00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:05.272
I'm so hungry, I could eat
a (bleep) Nissan Versa!

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.107
Me too!

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:09.209
No, do not text
Michael, Amy!

00:00:09.376 --> 00:00:13.313
No!
I love him and it's
none of your business.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.250
What are these
(bleep) baskets doing?

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.085
Who is that guy?

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:21.822
Two roommates, both drunk
and only one chance to win.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.725
The challenge, create an
unforgettable meal using

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:26.727
a basket of mystery
ingredients collected

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.930
from your kitchen
before time runs out.

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:32.900
And the losing chef
will be "Sauced."

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.168
(screaming)

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.073
Chef Amy, Chef Kelsie,
today you have...

00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:43.410
A half-eaten Chobani
yogurt from 2012.

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.379
Four baby carrots.

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:48.849
A shriveled lime
and a bottle of Lexapro.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:50.450
Your time starts now.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.753 line:0%
 
Go, go, go,
go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:54.354 line:0%
 
No, no, no!
Go, go, go, go, go!

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:55.889
Okay, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry...
Okay!

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.858
Okay, here we go, okay--
this is it!

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.927
Shots, shots,
shots, shots!
Shots, shots,
shots, shots!

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.795
Mmmm!

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.163
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, give me
one more!

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:04.331
One more, one more,
one more.
Okay, one more.

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:05.465
One more and then
we do this game.

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:06.300
Give me it.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.668
(Amy)
My name is Amy.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:11.271 line:0%
 
This is bonkers, like, you guys
realize that, right-- Okay.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.774
Wait, am I on
that screen?

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:17.711
Can you move it
so I can see?

00:01:17.845 --> 00:01:20.147
Before I
dropped out of UNLV...

00:01:20.314 --> 00:01:21.381
Wait.

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:25.118
... I worked at a burrito place
called The Dugout,

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:28.455
so as soon as I saw
the lime, I'm thinking, like...

00:01:28.522 --> 00:01:29.890
burrito?

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.927
This is (bleep) broken.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.363
(Kelsie)
I work in a bead kiosk.

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:37.798
It's a good gig.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.668 line:0%
 
But maybe my thing
is cooking!

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:44.838
Oh, my--

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.773
I'm going so fast right now.

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:48.408
And look!

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:50.277
Oh, this is
a tricky basket.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.346 line:0%
 
Especially when you're as
blasted as these two chefs are.

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:54.715
More ingredients!

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.750
(Mateo)
I like Amy's confidence,
though.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.356 line:0%
 
She has all four burners
on high and nothing cooking.

00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:09.196 line:0%
 
This would never
fly at FUD.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:10.631
Two minutes, chefs.

00:02:12.065 --> 00:02:13.834
Amy...

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.436
Look at me,
Amy, Amy.

00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:20.207
You were the prettiest girl
at Fiddlesticks tonight.

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:23.610
The bartender was
so into you.

00:02:31.385 --> 00:02:35.088
18, 17, 16, 15...

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.226
... 14, 13, 12, 11...

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:43.397
... ten, nine,
eight, seven...

00:02:43.497 --> 00:02:46.400
... six, five,
four...

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.303
... three, two, one...

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:52.005
Time's up,
please step away.

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.211
Judges...

00:02:57.344 --> 00:02:58.445
Chefs.

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.713
Judges...

Today, I have prepared for
you a bruleed Lexapro,

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:07.788 line:0%
 
parsnip coulis,
spring carrots,

00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:09.556
and roasted fennel.

00:03:09.723 --> 00:03:10.891
Oh, (bleep).

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:13.160
I like the acidity of the
lime with the starchiness

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:15.162
of the Lexapro.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.597
Chef Amy.

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:18.065
What?

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:20.133
Oh-- Chefs.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:23.103 line:0%
 
Today I prepared for
you mayonnaise

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.707 line:0%
 
from a Myrtle
Beach mug

00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:30.277
that Michael gave me.

00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:33.413
I think we've made
our decision.

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:34.882
I believe so, yeah.

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:40.087
Whose dish will
be Sauced?

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:45.158
Chef Kelsie.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.195
Congratulations, you are
the "Sauced" champion.

00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:50.831
I'm a for-real chef!

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:52.165
That's fair.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.400
That's fair,
you deserve it.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:54.801
Can you guys get out
of our apartment?

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:56.770
Yeah.
