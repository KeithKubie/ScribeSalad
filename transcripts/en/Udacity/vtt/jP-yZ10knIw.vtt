00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here I've drawn a problem which is a classic 2-dimensional motion problem.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Before we get into it, though, let's remind ourselves about the equations we learned in 1-dimensional motion.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
These equations relate a few variables--Δx, initial velocity,  time, acceleration, and velocity,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which we called some final velocity.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm going to write those over here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
To fully understand an object's motion in one dimension,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we like to somehow decide what the values were for all of these variables.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In 2-dimensional motion, I said we're just solving two of these 1-dimensional problems.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, we need to make some copies.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Δx is going to partner with Δy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
V₀--ah, wait. V₀ I'm going to call V₀ₓ, like I did over here.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
To distinguish between whether the velocity is horizontal or vertical,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
its partner will be V₀ᵧ.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
There's going to be two accelerations--one in the x direction and one in the y.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Likewise, two final velocities.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Interestingly enough, however, there's only going to be one time.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There's no x and y version of time, because unlike position, velocity, and acceleration,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
there's no easy way to assign a direction to time.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In physics, we call time a scalar, and these other quantities are vectors.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
You don't have to worry about the vocabulary for now.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If we want to know the trajectory of this ball as it travels through the air,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
our goal is to get numerical answers for each of these quantities.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Some we can already fill in. V₀ₓ I know will be 10 m/s.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This is the number that I just gave you at the start of the problem.

00:01:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What about Δy? Can you tell me what Δy will be in meters?
