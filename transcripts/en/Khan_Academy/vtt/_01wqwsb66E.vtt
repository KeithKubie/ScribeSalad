00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.320
Find the greatest common
factor of these monomials.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.970
Now, the greatest common
factor of anything

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.571
is the largest factor
that's divisible into both.

00:00:11.571 --> 00:00:14.070
If we're talking about just
pure numbers, into both numbers,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.390
or in this case,
into both monomials.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.070
Now, we have to be
a little bit careful

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.570
when we talk about
greatest in the context

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.897
of algebraic
expressions like this.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:24.730
Because it's greatest
from the point of view

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.190
that it includes the most
factors of each of these

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.850
monomials.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.560
It's not necessarily the
greatest possible number

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.150
because maybe some
of these variables

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.820
could take on
negative values, maybe

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.490
they're taking on
values less than 1.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.906
So if you square
it, it's actually

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:41.300
going to become
a smaller number.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.970
But I think without getting
too much into the weeds there,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.570
I think if we just kind of
run through the process of it,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.450
you'll understand it
a little bit better.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.107
So to find the
greatest common factor,

00:00:50.107 --> 00:00:51.690
let's just essentially
break down each

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.900
of these numbers
into what we could

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.536
call their prime factorization.

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:57.910
But it's kind of a combination
of the prime factorization

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.650
of the numeric
parts of the number,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.300
plus essentially
the factorization

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.720
of the variable parts.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.130
If we were to
write 10cd squared,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.850
we can rewrite
that as the product

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.910
of the prime factors of 10.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.440
The prime factorization
of 10 is just 2 times 5.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.470
Those are both prime numbers.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.930
So 10 can be broken
down as 2 times 5.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.740
c can only be broken down by c.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.730
We don't know anything else
that c can be broken into.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.650
So 2 times 5 times c.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.800
But then the d squared can
be rewritten as d times d.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.920
This is what I mean by writing
this monomial essentially

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.970
as the product of
its constituents.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.470
For the numeric part of
it, it's the constituents

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.950
of the prime factors.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.630
And for the rest
of it, we're just

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.770
kind of expanding
out the exponents.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.560
Now, let's do that for 25c
to the third d squared.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.250
So 25 right here,
that's 5 times 5.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.350
So this is equal to 5 times 5.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.470
And then c to the third,
that's times c times c times c.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.840
And then d squared,
times d squared.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.470
d squared is times d times d.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.770
So what's their greatest
common factor in this context?

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.330
Well, they both
have at least one 5.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.700
Then they both have at
least one c over here.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.400
So let's just take up one
of the c's right over there.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.030
And then they both have two d's.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.510
So the greatest common factor
in this context, the greatest

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.890
common factor of
these two monomials

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.620
is going to be the factors
that they have in common.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.190
So it's going to be equal to
this 5 times-- we only have one

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.240
c in common, times--
and we have two

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.020
d's in common, times d times d.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.060
So this is equal to 5cd squared.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.745
And so 5d squared, we can kind
of view it as the greatest.

00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:59.060
But I'll put that
in quotes depending

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.920
on whether c is
negative or positive

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.360
and d is greater
than or less than 0.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.920
But this is the greatest common
factor of these two monomials.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.950
It's divisible
into both of them,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.410
and it uses the most
factors possible.
