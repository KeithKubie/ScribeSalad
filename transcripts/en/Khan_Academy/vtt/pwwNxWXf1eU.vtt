00:00:00.492 --> 00:00:02.023
- [Instructor] This right here is a map

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:05.457
of the Persian empire in 490 BCE,

00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:07.046
before the Common Era.

00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:10.004
And you see that it is
an extensive empire.

00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:12.775
It was established by Cyrus the Great

00:00:12.775 --> 00:00:14.014
and then this successors.

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.566
We talked about it in previous videos

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:18.268
how they were able to conquer
the Neo-Babylonian Empire

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:21.268
in 539 BCE and then go on to conquer

00:00:22.138 --> 00:00:23.755
much of the middle east.

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:28.251
They were able to conquer the
long-lived Egyptian empire.

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:32.418
They seemed somewhat unstoppable
at this point in 490 BCE.

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:36.570
At this point, we have Darius is ruler

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.325
of the Persian Empire,

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:42.385
the Achaemenic Empire, as
it's often referred to.

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:44.517
And they're able to keep expanding

00:00:44.517 --> 00:00:47.767
until they come across some unexpected,

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.991
unexpectedly resistant people,

00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:53.599
and that's the Greeks.

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:56.034
This is probably one of the most famous

00:00:56.034 --> 00:00:59.978
and legendary stories
in history, the rivalry,

00:00:59.978 --> 00:01:04.007
the conflicts between the
Persians and the Greeks.

00:01:04.007 --> 00:01:06.509
You should maybe take it with
a little bit of grain of salt,

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:07.808
because what we know of it,

00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:09.651
the history that I'm about to give you,

00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:12.238
comes to us from Herodotus.

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:15.483
And Herodotus who's often
known as the father of history,

00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:17.275
he was Greek.

00:01:17.275 --> 00:01:21.020
And he also lived after a lot
of these conflicts happened

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.282
and he wrote about these conflicts,

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:24.515
his adult life was well
after these happened,

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:27.100
so he had to talk to people
who were around that time

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.775
and obviously, he is getting
the Greek side of the story.

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:32.748
There are no surviving
Persian accounts for it,

00:01:32.748 --> 00:01:34.245
so you might want to take
it with a grain of salt

00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:36.764
because the accounts of Herodotus do tend

00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:39.281
to make the Greeks look pretty good.

00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:40.826
But let's just talk about what happened,

00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:43.071
because taking it with a grain of salt,

00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:47.023
it is a fascinating series of stories.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:48.547
So you have Darius as king,

00:01:48.547 --> 00:01:53.004
you can see the extent of
the Persian Empire in 490 BC

00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:54.470
or really at the turn of the century

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.970
if we were to go back 10 years to 500 BCE,

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.250
but they are in control of some folks

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.002
who are are a little bit more rebellious

00:02:05.002 --> 00:02:08.469
than most of the people that
are within the Persian Empire.

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.243
And they are in this
region right over here,

00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:13.990
known as Ionia, where
you had Greek settlements

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.771
that are now under Persian control.

00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:17.771
From 500 BCE

00:02:19.517 --> 00:02:20.934
to about 494 BCE,

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:26.196
so kind of the first 10 years
of the fifth century BCE,

00:02:27.845 --> 00:02:31.012
you have a series of revolts in Ionia.

00:02:32.738 --> 00:02:34.610
Let me zoom in on that a little bit,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.743
so we can see that,

00:02:36.743 --> 00:02:38.973
you can see our timeline,

00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:40.306
right over here.

00:02:41.547 --> 00:02:44.266
So this area, we're now zoomed in,

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:47.308
this area is referred to as Ionia.

00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:49.002
This would be modern-day,

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.126
the coast of modern-day Turkey.

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:56.297
We're out here on the Anatolian Peninsula.

00:02:56.297 --> 00:02:59.730
And these rebellions in 498 BCE,

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.530
the rebels are able to take
over and burn down Sardis

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.770
which is under Persian control.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.778
The Persians under Darius
are not happy about this.

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:10.778
So they send a force to,

00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:14.520
to take back control

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.494
and also to get a little bit of revenge,

00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:19.628
because when the rebels were
able to take over Sardis,

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:22.317
they had help from some
of their Greek brethren.

00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:24.743
It's important to note
that the the Greeks weren't

00:03:24.743 --> 00:03:26.806
some type of a unified state.

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:30.194
They weren't a unified Empire
like the Persians were.

00:03:30.194 --> 00:03:33.363
They were a fragmented
group of city-states.

00:03:33.363 --> 00:03:36.758
You have the famous
Athens, Corinth, Sparta,

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:37.776
all of these city-states,

00:03:37.776 --> 00:03:39.527
they shared a common language.

00:03:39.527 --> 00:03:41.778
They shared similar religion,

00:03:41.778 --> 00:03:45.030
but they were not one unified Empire.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.802
But when their brethren, the Greek rebels,

00:03:48.802 --> 00:03:51.649
these Ionic rebels, I guess you could say,

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:55.033
rose up against the their Persian rulers,

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:57.866
they had assistance from Athenians

00:03:58.714 --> 00:04:00.881
and from folks in Eritrea.

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.519
So when Darius finds out about this,

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.024
not only does he want to take
back what the rebels had,

00:04:07.024 --> 00:04:08.257
he wants to suppress them,

00:04:08.257 --> 00:04:11.130
he wants to put down that rebellion.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.464
He also wants to have
revenge on the Athenians

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:17.371
and the Eritreans.

00:04:17.371 --> 00:04:18.988
So the first thing he does

00:04:18.988 --> 00:04:21.905
is he sends out a fleet in 492 BCE.

00:04:24.268 --> 00:04:27.761
You see his fleet here in green.

00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.446
This fleet that I am tracing.

00:04:30.446 --> 00:04:33.748
He sends it out in order to in order to,

00:04:33.748 --> 00:04:37.761
in order to seek revenge on the Athenians

00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:39.105
and the Eritreans.

00:04:39.105 --> 00:04:41.207
But he is unlucky and once again,

00:04:41.207 --> 00:04:42.863
these are the accounts of Herodotus.

00:04:42.863 --> 00:04:46.158
His fleet, his large
fleet, runs into a storm

00:04:46.158 --> 00:04:48.175
and is mostly destroyed,

00:04:48.175 --> 00:04:49.864
and is mostly destroyed.

00:04:49.864 --> 00:04:54.766
And so in 492 BCE, the
Persians are unsuccessful.

00:04:54.766 --> 00:04:56.245
But they are not satisfied.

00:04:56.245 --> 00:04:59.016
Darius is not happy with that idea

00:04:59.016 --> 00:05:02.099
that we are the largest empire known,

00:05:02.982 --> 00:05:06.510
we should be able to take
on these fragmented Greeks,

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.501
with a much smaller population,

00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:11.552
much less wealth than
the mighty Persians do.

00:05:11.552 --> 00:05:12.802
So in 490 BCE,

00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:17.777
he sends out another attempt to take over,

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:20.015
to seek revenge

00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:23.578
and to subjugate the
Eritreans and the Athenians.

00:05:23.578 --> 00:05:25.992
This time he is a little
bit more successful.

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:28.244
His fleet is not destroyed.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.727
So this is in this brown color,

00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:32.087
I'll try to color it in.

00:05:32.087 --> 00:05:33.490
This brown color right over here,

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.157
you can see the path
of the fleet this time.

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.207
And he is eventually,

00:05:40.207 --> 00:05:44.248
he is able to subjugate
and take over Eritrea,

00:05:44.248 --> 00:05:46.800
but as he's going to Athens,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.267
which you can see right here,

00:05:49.267 --> 00:05:51.934
they decide to stop at Marathon.

00:05:53.023 --> 00:05:55.052
That word might be familiar to you

00:05:55.052 --> 00:05:58.035
and we'll talk about
in a second why it is.

00:05:58.035 --> 00:06:01.760
That is where they're
engaged by the Athenians.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.593
The Athenians are able
to defeat the Persians.

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:09.322
This is a very big deal in history.

00:06:09.322 --> 00:06:11.258
Once again, this is Herodotus' account,

00:06:11.258 --> 00:06:14.261
but up to that point, the
Persians seemed invincible.

00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:15.834
But now the Athenians were able

00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:18.917
to actually destroy them in a battle.

00:06:19.945 --> 00:06:22.750
And the Persian fleet, they
go back to their boats,

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.060
they run back to their
boats according to Herodotus

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.850
and many of them are killed
as they as they retreat.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.758
They're going to go back
around the peninsula,

00:06:29.758 --> 00:06:32.243
potentially to go attack Athens.

00:06:32.243 --> 00:06:36.110
but they decide not to and they retreat.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.782
Now the word Marathon,

00:06:37.782 --> 00:06:39.802
this is a very big deal
in history first of all,

00:06:39.802 --> 00:06:44.495
is that this mighty empire
is put back in this battle.

00:06:44.495 --> 00:06:47.675
It oftentimes, historians will mark it

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:51.985
as the beginning of a
kind of Greek ascendancy,

00:06:51.985 --> 00:06:54.385
the ascendancy of Greek civilization,

00:06:54.385 --> 00:06:56.059
at the end of these Greco-Persian Wars.

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:58.769
We're really just in the
beginning periods of right now

00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:02.136
that's really the beginning
of the Greek golden age.

00:07:02.136 --> 00:07:05.996
But as we'll see, the Greco-Persian wars

00:07:05.996 --> 00:07:09.110
are not over with the battle at Marathon.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.004
That was just the first major interaction

00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:15.017
over the next few decades.

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:17.015
Now one thing that you might be saying is,

00:07:17.015 --> 00:07:20.265
hey, that word marathon,
that seems familiar.

00:07:20.265 --> 00:07:22.021
Maybe some of you have run a marathon

00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:25.799
or you want to run a
marathon going 26.2 miles.

00:07:25.799 --> 00:07:29.992
You might say, is there any
relation to this battle,

00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:34.484
to this location in
Greece called, Marathon.

00:07:34.484 --> 00:07:36.747
The simple answer is, yes.

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:38.508
So there's an apocryphal story,

00:07:38.508 --> 00:07:39.758
and when people say
apocryphal, they're like,

00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:41.035
"Well, we're not sure
if it really happened,

00:07:41.035 --> 00:07:42.526
"or maybe it didn't happen."

00:07:42.526 --> 00:07:44.739
And this one, people are
pretty sure it didn't happen.

00:07:44.739 --> 00:07:46.501
The story goes something like,

00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:48.039
when they had the battle,

00:07:48.039 --> 00:07:51.467
a messenger was sent
from Marathon to Athens

00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:54.009
and the distance from Marathon to Athens

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:56.286
is roughly the distance
of a modern marathon,

00:07:56.286 --> 00:07:58.119
around 25 or 26 miles.

00:07:59.693 --> 00:08:01.497
The apocryphal story goes,

00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:04.515
they went to deliver the
message of the Persian attack

00:08:04.515 --> 00:08:06.758
and the success of the Athenians,

00:08:06.758 --> 00:08:09.053
and then when the messenger
gave that message,

00:08:09.053 --> 00:08:11.493
he just passed out and died.

00:08:11.493 --> 00:08:15.503
So when the modern Olympics
that we've set up now,

00:08:15.503 --> 00:08:17.758
over the last hundred and something years,

00:08:17.758 --> 00:08:19.510
they said, "Hey, let's have an event

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.207
"that celebrates that run
from Marathon to Athens."

00:08:23.207 --> 00:08:26.507
That's where our modern
marathon actually comes from.

00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:29.026
Now the actual story as
best, as I can figure out,

00:08:29.026 --> 00:08:30.957
and I encourage you to
look up primary documents

00:08:30.957 --> 00:08:32.750
to figure this out for yourself,

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:35.500
is it's mixing up a few stories.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.786
After the victory at Marathon,

00:08:37.786 --> 00:08:40.953
the Athenian army did quickly mobilize

00:08:42.012 --> 00:08:44.605
and go back to Athens
and cover that distance

00:08:44.605 --> 00:08:46.536
in order to defend Athens.

00:08:46.536 --> 00:08:48.485
Because remember it looks
like the Persian fleet

00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:52.595
were coming around this
peninsula right over here

00:08:52.595 --> 00:08:54.012
to get to Athens.

00:08:55.008 --> 00:08:57.083
The story of that runner is

00:08:57.083 --> 00:08:58.992
there was runner named, Filipides,

00:08:58.992 --> 00:09:01.268
who was sent from Athens to Sparta

00:09:01.268 --> 00:09:02.365
to convey a message.

00:09:02.365 --> 00:09:03.744
That's actually a much further distance.

00:09:03.744 --> 00:09:06.143
In a lot ways it's much more impressive,

00:09:06.143 --> 00:09:08.791
but those two stories
were mixed up together

00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:10.481
into the story of Marathon,

00:09:10.481 --> 00:09:12.537
which is where we get our modern-day

00:09:12.537 --> 00:09:13.761
distance of the marathon.

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:15.360
Hey, let's all run roughly the distance

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.360
from Marathon to Athens.

00:09:18.251 --> 00:09:22.522
In the next video, we'll see
that the Persians are not done.

00:09:22.522 --> 00:09:25.249
Darius will not be able
to seek the revenge

00:09:25.249 --> 00:09:27.513
that he wants in his lifetime,

00:09:27.513 --> 00:09:31.513
but his son Xerxes is
going to keep going at it.
