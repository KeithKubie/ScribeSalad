00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.750
&gt;&gt; These extremely rare
but damaged motion pictures

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.090
of Mark Twain were taken at his
home in Connecticut in 1909,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.150
a year before his death.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.940
A copy of the film, along with
first editions and thousands

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.010
of the celebrated writer's
letters and manuscripts,

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.380
are part of the Mark
Twain Project.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.870
Its aim is to painstakingly
edit and publish the bulk

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.560
of Twain's huge output.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.010
Twain's daughter bequeathed
her father's papers

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.710
to the University of
California at Berkeley in 1962.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.540
The extensive collection is
hidden away in small offices

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.950
on the top floor of
Bancroft Library.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.150
For three decades, eight editors
have been pouring over more

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.100
than 10,000 letters,
plus notebooks,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.460
story and book manuscripts
and newspaper clippings,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.290
seeking to find the real
Mark Twain and to make all

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.490
of his work accurate
and accessible.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.070
&gt;&gt; This is your literary
heritage here in our files.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.230
It has to be edited, it has
to be preserved in some form

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.950
that is going to be
transmittable to the future.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.700
&gt;&gt; Robert Hirst,
the general editor,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.660
has devoted his entire
professional life since 1967

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.200
to Twain, whom he sees
as a towering talent

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.700
in language and humor.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.150
&gt;&gt; I still hear my editors
laughing out loud down the hall

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.450
because they're reading
something

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.670
which they've probably
read a dozen times before,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.460
but is still alive
and still funny,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.780
no matter how many
times you read it.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.420
&gt;&gt; Many academics would argue

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.130
that Twain is still
America's best loved,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.460
perhaps its best writer.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.860
Professor Frederick
Crews recently retired

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.750
from Berkeley's English
department.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.510
&gt;&gt; Mark Twain appeals to
academics and non-academics

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.960
to a degree that you can't find
matched in any other writer.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.730
He grew up with the country.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.900
He represents the
Midwest, the Far West,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.170
even the New England
establishment.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.980
He went from being a
rough frontier humorists

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.090
to being the darling
of genteel culture.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.500
Which of course he made fun of.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.930
&gt;&gt; Robert Pack Browning,
another of the project editors,

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.670
is convinced Twain is
worth special treatment

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.360
as an American writer
and personality.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.990
Using materials from
Berkeley's collection,

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.000
he has put together an exciting
display of Twain's life and work

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.580
at the University's
Blackhawk Museum.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.360
&gt;&gt; The language that
you and I speak

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.490
with its peculiar
American qualities,

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.020
was put down on paper
by this man.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.130
&gt;&gt; Notice his handwriting.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.590
&gt;&gt; At the museum,
visitors immerse themselves

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.130
in the issues Twain wrote about,
from racial equality to love.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.450
A passionate love letter
to his future wife is here

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.890
for everybody to read.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.410
&gt;&gt; I love love love love love
you, and multiplied by 150.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.810
And so loving you,
I note your faults,

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.230
ignite them with my love.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.010
&gt;&gt; What do you think
that Mark Twain feels

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.920
about this wonderful woman?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.310
&gt;&gt; He was really
in love with her.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.450
&gt;&gt; Twain spent a lot of
time on the lecture circuit

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.530
to gain fame and money.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.920
His lecture notes from 1896
help explain the crucial passage

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.890
in Huck Finn published
12 years earlier,

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.710
where Huck is debating
whether to turn

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.380
in Jim as a runaway slave.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.830
&gt;&gt; Huck is prepared to turn Jim
in, yet he finally concludes

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.410
that he cannot do that.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.050
His heart wins out and his
conscience suffers a defeat.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.630
This was the most popular
component of his lecture

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.000
on this grand tour of the world.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.370
[ Applause ]

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.170
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
So good morning.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.160
I'm so happy to see all of you.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.030
So glad to have -- be able
to welcome you to the Library

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.380
of Congress this morning

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.630
and to the Ninth Annual Jonah
S. Eskin Memorial Lecture.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.190
It's really a lecture though.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.820
Today's going to be more of a
presentation and a conversation.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.220
And we're delighted
to have all of you.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.560
We're also delighted to have our
author, Philip Stead, with us.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.760
And before we get started
with the rest of our program,

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.820
I've got a couple
of remarks for you.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.120
I'm Lee Ann Potter.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.300
I direct educational outreach
here at the Library of Congress.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.170
And along with my colleagues
in educational outreach

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.860
and our Young Reader Center,
we want to welcome you.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.390
And we also want to
shout out to you,

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.210
because we know who
all of you are.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.470
Before I do the roll call of
the various schools that are

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.070
in the room though,
I want to mention

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.270
that this week is
Children's Book Week.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.900
It is the longest-running
national literacy program,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.100
or initiative, in
the United States.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.460
It's sponsored by the
Children's Book Council,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.900
as well as Every Child a Reader.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.310
And along with schools and
libraries around the country,

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.360
this week is dedicated to
celebrating the joy of reading.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.370
So we're happy that
you're with us today

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.060
to help us celebrate
the joy of reading.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.050
All of you before you leave,
will be receiving a copy

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.490
of this year's book week poster.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.640
So make sure you get
those on your way out.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.770
They were illustrated by
Jillian Tamaki, and given to us

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.070
by the Children's Book Council.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.370
So a nice thank you to the
Children's Book Council.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.620
Also, I want to make another
shout out as a thank you

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.640
to my colleagues -- to
Karen Jaffe, to Sasha Dowdy,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.830
to Monica Valentine, the
rest of educational outreach,

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.580
as well as our multimedia team,

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.730
for making this morning
possible.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.070
Thanks, you guys.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.230
So we have sixth, seventh, and
eighth-graders here with us

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.870
from School Without
Walls at Francis Stevens.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.860
We have sixth-graders

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.470
from Washington Global Public
Charter School [applause].

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.130
We also have sixth
and seventh-graders

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.860
from Stuart-Hobson
Middle School [applause].

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:39.700
We have sixth-graders from
St. Patrick's Episcopal

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.040
School [applause].

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.390
We also have students
from Northern Virginia,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.960
including students in
grades three through six

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.150
from the River Farm Cooperative
School in Alexandria [applause].

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.710
And I guess I should say
this a little louder.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.410
We also have seventh
and eighth-graders

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:08.220
from the Mark Twain Middle
School [applause] in Alexandria.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.520
We're also live-streaming
this program.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.230
And we know that we've got
schools and individuals

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.760
in various parts of the
United States watching.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.330
So if you guys want to turn
around and wave to them,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:26.060
so they know we're glad
that they are tuning in.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.710
And I really I need to do a --

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.920
we have some interns in
our Young Reader Center

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.970
who did some homework last week
to find as many middle schools

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.530
in the United States
that are named

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:39.830
for Mark Twain as they could.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.150
And they sent out special notes

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.490
to those schools telling
them about this event.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.560
So hopefully we've got some
other Mark Twain schools

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.860
tuning in.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.160
I'm excited about that.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.700
So thank you all for coming.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.650
Oh, and by the way, because
we're live-streaming the

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.980
program, there will be
a recording available.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.240
So if you really get
into the program today,

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.540
you can watch it again later

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.660
and you can show your
friends and family, okay.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.960
You'll all do that, right?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.340
Yeah. Because the Library of
Congress has a YouTube channel,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.880
and I know you all follow it.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:15.160
And we're on Facebook.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.210
So today's program
is about Mark Twain,

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.150
but it's just sort
of about Mark Twain.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.420
How many of you --
raise your hands

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:28.000
if you think you know a thing
or two about Mark Twain.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.600
Okay, all right, some
good hands going up.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.150
So as you learned from the
video that we showed you,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.730
Mark Twain was a writer.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.490
He was a lecturer.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:39.910
He was a humorist.

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:41.830
He was also a publisher.

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.640
And we're going to learn a
little bit more about him today,

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.750
but we're also going to
focus not just on Mark Twain

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.960
but really we're going
to focus on the work

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.940
of this guy and his wife.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.130
So Philip Stead is
with us today,

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.030
and he's got an incredible
story to tell you

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:02.720
about Mark Twain that's very
closely connected to the papers

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.230
of Mark Twain that you got
a glimpse of in the video.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.960
And with all of our programs
here at the Library Congress,

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.060
we like to make sure that we
understand what the connection

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:15.300
to the Library and its
collections might be

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.300
with whatever topic
we're focused on.

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:19.270
So we did a little digging.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.940
And not only are there
Mark Twain papers

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.310
in the Bancroft Library
out in California,

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.800
but there are some terrific
Mark Twain materials here

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.270
in the Library of Congress.

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:29.860
One of them is up on the screen.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.380
In 1874, Mark Twain --

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.820
who of course his real
name was Samuel Clemens --

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.530
he wrote a letter to the
Librarian of Congress.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.730
And he did so because he had
written a series of sketches

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.470
and he wanted to ensure that
his work was being copyrighted.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.920
You can go ahead and
hit that next slide.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:55.860
So he's writing to -- this is
in May of 1874, and he's writing

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.590
to the then Librarian of
Congress, Ainsworth Spofford.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:03.830
He says, "Dear sir, I enclose a
design of a pamphlet cover upon

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:05.550
which I desire copyright.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.030
Also, the title page of the
pamphlet, upon the contents

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.900
of which I likewise
desire copyright.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.420
Fees, $1, enclosed.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.500
Very truly yours,
Samuel Clemens."

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.380
So we have to say, we love
it when we come across things

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:23.020
like this in the
Library's collection.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.630
So a handwritten letter
from Mark Twain related

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:28.100
to copywriting some of his work.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.420
But not only does the Library of
Congress hold original letters,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.780
but the Library also has
an enormous collection

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.760
of newspapers and magazines
and many, many, many --

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.060
literally millions of them --

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.860
are available through
the Library's Chronicling

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.220
America website.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:47.690
And the next slide,
which shows you one

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.600
of those political cartoons
in one of those magazines,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.660
Harper's Weekly, that
shows Mark Twain as well.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.690
And I know that in your
textbooks and other materials,

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.320
sometimes -- go ahead
and click it again --

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.540
you often see things like
the political cartoon,

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.240
but you miss the context.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.200
You sort of miss that
it originally appeared

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.730
in the newspaper, and that's
the fun part about looking

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.960
at original sources, is you see
where they originally came from.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.090
I want to say one more thing
about the video that we watched.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.500
We were so excited about this.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.220
A couple of years ago,
the Library entered

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.960
into a partnership
with WGBH TV Boston.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.880
It's a public TV station.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.110
And because of that partnership,
the American Archive

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:32.690
of Public Broadcasting
was established.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.990
And through the American Archive
of Public Broadcasting website,

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.850
you can access literally
thousands

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.740
of public television programs
like the one we watched.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.060
So when we started digging
around the website and came

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.480
across that entire film --

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.400
and it's a lot longer than what
we saw -- related to Mark Twain,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.700
we were pretty excited.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.410
So another shout out to the fact

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.700
that the Library's collections
come in a huge variety of media,

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.820
from motion picture
films to newspapers

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.960
and periodicals to manuscripts.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.820
Library collections are so much
fun, they're not just books.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:07.350
But if they were books
and you happen to go

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.910
on the Library's website,
and you happen to do a search

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.350
on Mark Twain in the
main card catalog,

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.860
guess how many times you'd
find Mark Twain's name?

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.370
Not in the millions,
but about 3000.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.920
There are about 3000 books
in the Library's collection

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.920
that are either written by
Mark Twain or about Mark Twain.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.220
That's a lot.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:28.520
3000, that's incredible.

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:29.820
And they're not just
in English either,

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.790
lots of those materials are in
languages other than English.

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.280
Okay, so enough about
the Library

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.780
of Congress and its collection.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.070
But what I love most about
all of those materials

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.130
and the reason we wanted
to highlight them is

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.410
to really emphasize to you
that the materials that are

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:48.800
in the Library often
speak to us.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.130
They inspire us.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:54.470
They are the ideas and the
thoughts and often the voices

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.750
of not only people who are
living today but people

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.050
who lived in the past.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.770
And our speaker today
certainly has a story

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.290
in that vein to tell us.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:09.110
So I'm going to do my official
introduction of Philip now.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.410
So here we go.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.470
It is my great pleasure to
introduce our very patient

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.140
and award-winning
author, Philip Stead,

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.350
who with his illustrator
wife, Erin Stead,

00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.800
wrote the exceptional and
unique book, "The Purloining

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.510
of Prince Leo Margarine."

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:35.040
[ Applause ]

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.080
Philip also wrote "A
Sick Day for Amos McGee,"

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.020
which was the 2011 Caldecott
award-winning illustrated book

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.450
by his wife and him.

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:48.180
"Bear Has a Story to Tell,"
"Lenny and Lucy," "Hello,

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.960
my Name is Ruby," "Jonathan
and the Big Blue Boat,"

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.850
and "A Home for Bird."

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.310
I suspect some of those
titles are familiar.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.660
Now here's the opportunity
you've been waiting for.

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.630
How did Philip Stead
find the unfinished draft

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:03.930
from Mark Twain?

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.130
And what did it take to complete
and become a published work?

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.910
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead:
All right, well,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.560
thanks for having me, everybody.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.860
This is kind of a treat for me.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.410
I very rarely get to speak

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.320
to middle schoolers
or high schoolers.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.420
I normally am talking
to very young children

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.880
or I'm talking to adults.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:25.640
And so I flew in last
night from Michigan,

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.530
and I had a few hours
that were free.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:30.490
And so I had dinner with
somebody I hadn't seen

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:32.270
since I was in high school.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.130
I went to middle school
with this person too.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.050
And I was talking to
her and she said --

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.450
she was the valedictorian
of our school, by the way.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:42.580
We were talking about what I
was going be presenting today,

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.420
and she was asking me a lot of
questions, and then she said,

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:46.720
you should tell them
about how you used

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.480
to skip school all the time.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.730
And I said, I absolutely
should not tell them that.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.620
And so I'm on record not
telling you that right now.

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.500
I absolutely never skipped
middle school or high school.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.060
So I'm an author.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.910
I'm also an illustrator.

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.320
I've either written
or illustrated

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.950
about 15 different books,
with about five or six more

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.450
to come in the near future.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:13.300
These three books
are the three books

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.470
that I made with my wife, Erin.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.370
Erin could not be here
today, but she was the artist

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:20.940
in all three of these books,
and she's also the artist

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.340
for this Mark Twain
collaboration that I'm going

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.640
to be talking about today.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.560
A little bit about
myself before I begin.

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.080
I'm from the state of Michigan.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.440
Has anybody here ever been
to the state of Michigan?

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.430
That's not too bad.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.730
I love Michigan.

00:15:36.730 --> 00:15:38.030
One of the reasons
I love Michigan is

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:39.330
because there's so much water.

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.370
I grew up down here
near Detroit.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.510
So people from Michigan
like to show their hand

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.300
when they're talking
about where they're from,

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.440
because Michigan is
shaped like a mitten.

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.190
So Detroit is down here.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:53.490
And now I live way up there.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.150
Do you guys see that
red dot up there?

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.450
So I live way up there.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.320
And then do you see an
island sort of right

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.550
above that, a big island?

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.850
Okay, so remember that island,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.390
we're going to come back
to that in a minute.

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:08.560
I think it's important
to know where a person --

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.030
where an author is from,
because I think something

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.140
about where you're from will
inevitably sort of creep

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.700
into the types of
things you make.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.370
I think that's absolutely true
of Mark Twain, who as you heard

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.930
in the video, was from all
over, but really I believe he's

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:25.460
from Hannibal, Missouri.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.760
That's where he was born.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.230
He was born along the
Mississippi River.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.260
And I think there's something
about being from that place

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.170
that has infected
everything he's written.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:35.970
When you live along the river,

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:39.050
I imagine that you're always
seeing people coming and going

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.930
in there's constant
motion and things coming

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.540
into town and out of town.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:43.960
And when I read Mark
Twain's work,

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.750
that's what sticks out to me.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.740
There's always a
coming and a going

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.190
in his books and in his stories.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.660
They're always are
traveling stories.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.710
I think the water is
important to me too.

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.850
Michigan is surrounded by water.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.430
And this is right -- this may be
five minutes from where I live.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.270
People think of Michigan and
maybe they imagine something

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.960
that looks more like
Ohio, like flat farmland.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.160
But when I think of Michigan,
I think of beaches and I think

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.730
of big open expanses of water.

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:17.280
And when I want to be -- when
I want to be quiet and I want

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.210
to think about my thoughts and
want to think about my writing,

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:24.520
I go to the water, and I sit
in quiet places near the water.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.550
I live in an old farmhouse,

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:29.870
and beside the old
farmhouse is a big red barn.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.420
My wife Erin and I have turned
the red barn into an art studio.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.770
So this is the inside
of the studio.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.660
And the upstairs, when
you walk upstairs,

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.090
it's just a library,
it's all books.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.090
So when we don't have any
ideas, we just go upstairs

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.900
and we sit near other
people's ideas.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.890
And then once we've got an idea,
we go back downstairs and we sit

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:52.400
at our desks and
we begin to draw.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.650
Does anybody here consider
themselves an artist?

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.820
Yeah. So I think I
was 10 years old --

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.540
I think I was 10 years old

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.700
when I was given my
first drafting table.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.940
A drafting table is one of
those tables it sort of lifts

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:12.110
up like this so you can
draw closer to your face.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.870
And I think it's really
important as an artist

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.660
or an author either one to
have a space that you work.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:21.410
And it doesn't have to be as
big and open as this barn.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.710
It can be a corner in a room.

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.010
It can be in your closet.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.310
I remember when I was
very little, I used to go

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.740
in my closet and lock
the door and that's

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.640
where I would work
on my projects.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.390
But it's important to be
alone with yourself sometimes.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:35.960
So that brings us to
Mark Twain and the story

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.680
of how the story came to be.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:47.150
So in the year 1879, Mark Twain
was in a hotel room in Paris,

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.880
and he was telling a
story to his own children.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.330
This is something that he
would do almost every night,

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.360
and we know that because he
would write about these moments

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.870
in his diaries and his journals.

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:58.360
And the way it would
normally work is one

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.270
of his daughters would bring
a magazine or a newspaper.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.630
They would open up to a page and
they would point at an image.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.690
And from that image,
Mark Twain --

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.780
it was Mark Twain's job to come

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.690
up with a story for
his daughters.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.790
And sometimes it was successful.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.670
Sometimes it was
not so successful.

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:21.150
But we never really had
any actual evidence,

00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:23.850
written evidence, of
any of these stories

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:26.350
that survived to
the present day.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.720
So fast-forward all the
way to the year 2011.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.410
There's a man named
Dr. John Bird.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:34.440
He was a professor
from North Carolina.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.520
And he was out at that archive
that we just saw on the video,

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.740
in Berkeley, California,
and he was doing research

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.590
for a Mark Twain cookbook.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:46.680
He wanted write a cookbook
based on food and recipes

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.800
that could be found in
Mark Twain's writings.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.970
So he had the researchers
pulling out any file folder

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.370
that had anything at
all to do with food.

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.100
So there was one folder and it
was just labeled oleomargarine,

00:19:58.100 --> 00:19:59.760
which today we would
call margarine,

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.970
which is something you'd
find at the grocery store.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.500
It's kind of like butter.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:07.640
We always had margarine in the
refrigerator when I was a kid.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.260
So when they open
up this folder,

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.140
instead of finding
anything about food,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.450
what they found were 16
pages of handwritten notes

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:15.810
for this children's story

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:20.580
that Mark Twain had told his
daughters in Paris that night.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:25.010
This was enormous news in
the Mark Twain universe.

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:29.170
Because it's not every day that
you find something brand-new

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.470
from the most famous

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:33.560
and important American
writer who has ever lived.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.750
Interestingly enough
though, so at some point

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:39.430
in the hundred plus years
between the original telling

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.440
and when it was discovered,
somebody had actually pulled it

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.350
out of the archive, thought

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.760
that maybe it was a
little bit illegible,

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:46.060
people wouldn't be
able to read it,

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.620
and decided to type the entire
thing up on a typewriter

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.580
and just stick it right back in
the folder and forget about it.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.510
So this thing had actually
been discovered before,

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.040
but the person who discovered
it the first time didn't realize

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.380
the importance.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.050
So this is actually
what was given to me.

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:04.050
It was not a completed story,
it was notes for a story.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.780
And I was asked to
please find a way

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.520
to complete Mark
Twain's original idea.

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:16.740
So this is a daunting task, but
right away I began making notes

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.510
on that original -- on
this original document.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:24.220
Sometimes I agreed
with what Mark Twain --

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.010
the ways in which Mark
Twain was telling the story.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:30.730
Sometimes almost immediately, in
fact, I found ways to take issue

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.430
with what Mark Twain was
doing with his story.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.590
For example, Mark
Twain had right

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.350
on this very first page a
main character in his story,

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.210
named Susie, which is also
the name of his daughter.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.590
And that character
was a kangaroo.

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.730
I felt that this was a
mistake that he had made.

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:49.440
Mark Twain loved kangaroos,
which you can actually --

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.560
you can learn a lot
about Mark Twain.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.320
And that's one thing that
comes up again and again,

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.320
Mark Twain loved kangaroos.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.450
But as a storyteller
that works specifically

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.750
in children's literature
like I do, I know something

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.260
about kangaroos that he doesn't.

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.170
Which is that if you put
a kangaroo in your story,

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.690
you just made your story
in a very specific place

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:12.990
in a very specific country.

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:15.190
What country is that?

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.490
&gt;&gt; Australia.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:17.790
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: Exactly.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.090
So every kid everywhere knows

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.390
that kangaroos are
from Australia.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:21.820
And I really didn't think
that Mark Twain wanted

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:24.250
to set this book in Australia.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.570
So I crossed off kangaroo
and I made that character

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:33.870
into a skunk, which is made some
Mark Twain professors very angry

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.170
with me.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.620
So what I got was 4
1/2 pages of notes.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:43.130
And at the end of this last
page, the story just ends.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.070
There's no official
ending to the story,

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.700
there's just the point at
which he stopped taking notes.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.950
And there was never
a clear answer

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:55.050
as to whether the final pages
of the manuscript were missing,

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.270
or if Mark Twain never got
around to writing them,

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.650
or maybe there never
was an ending.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.240
I'm of the opinion that there
actually never was an ending

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:04.540
to this story.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.360
Because this is a story that
Mark Twain was telling out loud,

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.580
probably over the
course of several nights.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.700
And so there didn't really
need to be an ending.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.670
It was the kind of story
that just continues

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:19.420
to have new material every
night when he would sit

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.070
down with his children.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.460
But that doesn't really work if
you're trying to make a book.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.270
A book needs to have an ending.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.150
So you can see my own
handwriting at the end.

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.610
That was the very first thing
I wrote for this project,

00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:34.360
where I get to the ending,
and I just write, then what?

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.140
And that was my task:
figuring out then what.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:44.480
So for me that meant
going very far away.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:47.890
And very far away for
me meant an island

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:49.190
in the middle of Lake Michigan.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.000
So you remember that island that
was just north of where I live?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.380
That's called Beaver Island.

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.060
And I had never been to Beaver
Island, which is not unusual,

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:00.840
because very few people have
ever been to Beaver Island.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.420
This is what it looks like from
the airplane that I had to take

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.960
as I was leaving the island.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.260
There's very few buildings.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.230
It doesn't look anything
like Washington, DC.

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.050
There is a tiny, tiny town

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:16.530
at the very far end,
and then that's it.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.330
There's about three
buildings and a light house.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:21.540
There's only one road that cuts
down the middle of the island.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:23.860
So I originally arrived
on that on a boat.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.470
I had my bicycle.

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:27.450
I rode all the way to a cabin

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.370
that was owned by
a friend of mine.

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:30.750
The cabin had no phone.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.050
It had no Internet.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.350
It had no television.

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:34.650
It had no radio.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.760
And I had decided that I was
going to stay at this cabin

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.900
until I had written something.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.460
It's -- the hardest part of any
project I think is beginning.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:48.580
And I can put off working
on something forever,

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.920
if I don't get to it right away.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.800
So that's why I ended
up on this island.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.440
As I'm riding my bike
around the island though,

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.540
I kept encountering these
signs along the side the road.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.940
And the signs were all talking

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.720
about this man named
James Jesse Strang,

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.020
who I had never heard of.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:08.390
And I knew nothing
about the history

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:11.930
of Beaver Island before I
arrived there with my bicycle.

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:15.000
This is where the story --

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.960
the story of Beaver Island
is strange, but it's also

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.240
where the story of the making of
this book becomes very strange.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.900
In the 1850s, the
Mormon Church was led

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.320
by a man named Joseph Smith.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.260
Joseph Smith died.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.760
And then there were several
people that were sort of vying

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.290
for control of who would be in
charge of the Mormon Church.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.570
So there was a man named
Brigham Young, who took a bunch

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.900
of his followers out
to the state of Utah.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.290
And that's why so many followers

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:49.710
of the Mormon Church
still live in Utah today.

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.900
But then there was also this
man named James Jesse Strang,

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:57.070
who took his followers
to Beaver Island.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:58.880
When he arrived at
Beaver Island,

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.020
he decided that he had
had a revelation from God.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.540
And that revelation was that
he should be named King,

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.140
King of Beaver Island.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.160
This was very funny to
me, that there was a King

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.340
of Beaver Island that
I had never heard of.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:16.390
I learned shortly thereafter
-- you know, I'm riding my bike

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.610
down the road, I end up at a
different sign and it says,

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:22.020
this is the spot where
James Jesse Strang issued a

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.330
particularly unpopular
proclamation

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.570
and then he got himself killed.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:29.630
So this again was
very funny to me.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.450
And it seemed like
exactly the kind of story

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:34.010
that Mark Twain himself
would've been really interested

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.310
in hearing.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.520
Because Mark Twain
was always interested

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.530
in how American history,
American politics,

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:45.820
American religion all kind of
mixed together to make one sort

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.560
of uncomfortable story.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.790
So I didn't know what to do
with all this information.

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.790
It seemed important to me.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.140
It seemed important
because it was something

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.780
that I thought Mark Twain
would be interested in.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:59.820
It also seemed important to
me because it was a story

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.450
about a king and a kingdom,
and here I was working

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.880
on a fairytale that was
about a king and a kingdom.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.670
And so I couldn't figure
out exactly how but I knew

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:11.920
that I wanted these two
things to go together.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.100
And I was worried that I was
already sort of going off

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:18.720
in a wrong direction and
Mark Twain maybe wouldn't be

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.030
so happy with me.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.590
But then my very last
day on the island,

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:25.360
I pull a book off of the shelf.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.660
So again, I'm at a library.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.000
It's a much smaller library,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.340
but it's a library just
inside this little cabin.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.890
Pull a book off the shelf
and a page falls out.

00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:37.530
The book was a little
paperback of stories

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.310
and essays by Mark Twain.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:42.570
And this quote was on
the page that fell out.

00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:46.050
It says, "narrative should
flow as flows the brook

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.520
down through the hills
and the leafy woodlands,

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.190
its course changed by every
boulder it comes across

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:53.900
and by every grass
clad gravelly spur

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.020
that projects into its path.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.550
Its surface unbroken but it's
course not stayed by rocks

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.680
and gravel in the bottom
in the shoal places.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.550
A brook that never goes
straight for a minute

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.560
but goes and goes briskly.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.230
Sometimes ungrammatically,

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:10.490
and sometimes fetching a
horseshoe three-quarters

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:11.850
of a mile around.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.970
And at the end of the
circuit, flowing within a yard

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.510
of the path it traversed
an hour before.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:20.540
But always going and always
following at least one law.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.190
Always loyal to that law,

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.380
the law of narrative,
which has no law."

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.990
And I love that last sentence,

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.410
the law of narrative
which has no law.

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:32.320
And I really felt like that was
Mark Twain giving me permission

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.870
to tell this story in any
way that was necessary.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.780
And I really felt
that that was the way

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:41.040
that Mark Twain would want
me to tell this story.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.430
But then began -- after I
come back from the island,

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.730
I get something down on paper.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.240
It's really not a
finished story yet,

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.940
but at least I've got something.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.850
I really felt like I
needed to do more research,

00:28:51.850 --> 00:28:55.070
to really understand
who Mark Twain was.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.640
So there were sort of two ways

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.640
to approach how to
write this story.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.910
One would be to try to
predict every single word

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.390
that Mark Twain would've said.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:07.000
And right away I felt like
that was a recipe for failure.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.590
There is no way to really know

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.240
over a hundred years later
what Mark Twain would've said.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.120
But what I could
do is get to know

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.040
who Mark Twain was
as best I could.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.390
And if I could know who Mark
Twain was, then I might be able

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:22.470
to tell a story that
he would be happy with,

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:25.080
that he would be proud of,
that would honor the spirit

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:30.150
of Mark Twain, instead of trying
to be literal about the way

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.170
that he would've told the story.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.880
One of our first
stops that my wife

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.810
and I took was to this house.

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.690
So this was Mark Twain's
house in Connecticut.

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.080
This is where he lived
when he wrote many

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.090
of his most famous works.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.840
It's the house that his
children grew up in.

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:48.930
It's a big, beautiful,
elaborate house.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.710
It's so big, I really couldn't
even fit it all into a picture.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.330
So I'm just showing you
one little piece of it.

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.020
This is Mark Twain's
personal writing room.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:00.590
This was my favorite
place in the house.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.610
It's got his billiard table.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:07.010
That desk in the back is where
he would sit and do his writing.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:09.980
What I really loved
about this house is that,

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.100
even though it's --
today it's a museum.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.430
And even though it's a big,
beautiful, elaborate house,

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:16.920
it really still felt
like a home.

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:21.090
So when you walk into it, you
really feel that this is a place

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.030
where a family that
loved each other lived.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.740
You can imagine the
stories being told.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.920
It didn't at all
feel like a museum.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.420
Another piece of research that
was really important to me --

00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.330
there are actually two more
pieces I want talk about.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:38.730
One is the autobiography of
Mark Twain, which was published

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.390
in three volumes, and
when you stack them

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.480
up together, it's
about this tall.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:46.610
What was so important about the
autobiography of Mark Twain is

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:49.930
that he had stipulated he
didn't want it published

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.400
until 100 years after his death.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.420
The reason being is that he
had put all of his grievances

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.280
into that autobiography,
all the things

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.930
that he was feeling irritable
about, all the things

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.380
that were bothering
him, maybe about --

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.410
there was a whole section
about copyright at the Library

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:07.890
of Congress that
he was upset about.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:12.140
And he was able to
put information

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:16.790
down in a very honest way that
he may have felt inhibited --

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.770
more inhibited if
it was something

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:22.430
for publication while
he was still alive.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:26.510
In addition to that, he didn't
actually write the biography.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.450
What he did is he spoke it.

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:32.100
He tried and failed
several times in his life

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.320
to work on his autobiography.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.280
And towards the end of his life,
he realized that the best way

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.140
for him to go about it was
not to start with the day

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:41.440
of his birth and just write

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.120
down every single
instance along the way

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.660
until his eventual death.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.580
What he wanted to do was
just wake up in the morning,

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.350
and before he even got out
of bed, just start speaking

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.070
about whatever it was
that was on his mind.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.550
And somebody else in the room
would be writing it down.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:57.050
This was hugely important
for me.

00:31:57.050 --> 00:32:01.120
Because the story
I was writing began

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:04.120
as what we would call a
piece of oral history.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:07.430
So it was a story that was
spoken out loud in real time

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.890
between Mark Twain
and his daughters.

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:13.270
And here I had pages
and pages and pages

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.690
of Mark Twain oral history.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.380
And I think we all know
that the way that you speak

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.010
out loud is different from the
way that you write on paper.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:24.730
And there might be some
overlap between the two,

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.030
but I really needed to get

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:27.850
to know the Mark Twain
that spoke aloud.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:30.680
And that's a much harder
Mark Twain to find.

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:32.700
The other piece of research
that was really important

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.870
for me was a biography
written by Mark Twain

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:38.420
by his 12-year-old
daughter, Susie.

00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:44.680
This was probably the
most important piece of --

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:48.100
the most important original
document that I came across.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:52.790
Here we have a quote
from that biography.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.860
So she's 12 years old, and
she writes about her father.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.100
"He couldn't bear to hear
anyone talk but himself.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.390
But he could listen to
himself talk for hours

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:03.730
without getting tired."

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:06.970
So I could find no
other instance

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:10.700
of anybody writing
critically about Mark Twain.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:12.400
Anybody that was willing
to acknowledge what kind

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.210
of flaws did this person have.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.800
Although Susie thought
her father was very funny,

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.560
she thought he was very brave,

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.540
she thought he was
very intelligent.

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.860
She also had critiques
of her father.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.730
And I wanted to know
those critiques.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:31.970
Mark Twain would also be writing
down notes in his own journals

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.360
and diaries about Susie.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.910
So here's one that says,
"apparently Susie was born

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.770
with humane feelings
for the animals

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.080
and compassion for
their troubles."

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.270
That was one of my favorite
quotes that I came across.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.590
Because that's when I recognized
that if this was a story

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:51.090
that Mark Twain was telling to
his own children and to Susie

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:53.720
in particular -- who I think
was his favorite daughter --

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:58.310
and Susie was a child who had
a lot of love and compassion

00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:00.200
for animals, then
love and compassion

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.170
for animals should be
a part of this story,

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.930
even if it's not a part
of the original notes.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.240
Here's another quote from Susie,
and this quote is actually

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.430
at the very beginning of the
book when you open up the book.

00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:14.720
It says, "I have wanted
Papa to write a book

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.420
that would reveal something of
his kind, sympathetic nature."

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:21.150
This, you know, as
I'm talking right now,

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:24.170
I think that this was actually
probably the most important

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:29.780
single piece of information
that Erin and I stumbled across.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.740
Because Mark Twain --
you have to imagine.

00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.960
He's not just a famous
author, he's the most famous

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.730
and important person on the
entire planet when he was alive.

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:43.500
He's less like a famous author,
more like say Kanye West.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.170
So he was the Kanye
West of his day.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:51.240
Because of that, I think it was
very difficult for Mark Twain

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.600
to be honest when
he was in public.

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.910
He felt a real burden
to always be funny.

00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:59.410
I think he felt a real burden
to always be very smart.

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.390
He wanted to be the smartest
and funniest man in the room.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.380
But he had a hard time
revealing that part of himself

00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.570
that was kind and that part of
himself that was vulnerable.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:10.110
And I really thought
that those parts

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:13.660
of himself would be the kinds of
-- would be the parts of himself

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.360
that would be revealed if
he was telling a story just

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.650
to his own family.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:22.010
So this is what my
writing looks like.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.800
And I kind of cringe at the
idea that my own notes will end

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:28.360
up someday, you know,
at the Berkeley Archive

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.660
or the Library of Congress.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:36.330
Because my notes look a lot like
my own middle school homework.

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:39.840
This is the very first
passage from the book.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:43.120
So it's a note written
by me that sort

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.410
of explains how I'm
going to tell the story.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.730
And the way I imagined
myself telling this story was

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.920
that I imagined Mark
Twain was there with me

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.970
and he was telling me the story,
and now Mark Twain is gone,

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.840
and it's my job now to
tell it back to you.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.300
And I'm going to tell it in my
own way, but I'm going to be

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.300
as faithful as possible
to the man that told

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.560
to me in the first place.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.250
So now I'd like to talk
to you a little bit

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.120
about how the artwork was made.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:12.880
So Erin would normally do
this part of the presentation.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.470
She's at home with our
10-month-old baby right now,

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:19.580
so I'm going to do my best
telling her half of the story.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:24.570
For Erin the most important
part of the process was coming

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:25.950
up with the main character.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.940
She really felt that there
was no way she could proceed

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.650
with this project until she
knew exactly what this character

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:35.470
looked like, exactly how
this character moved.

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:42.990
In this case she really wanted
the character to have two things

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:45.560
that are very difficult to
put into the same person.

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:51.350
She wanted the character to look
vulnerable and compassionate.

00:36:51.350 --> 00:36:55.760
She also wanted that
character to look brave.

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.010
And these two things, they're
not necessarily opposites

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.020
but they're difficult things
to put into the same face.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.170
And so Erin spent nearly
three months working

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.150
on just this single drawing.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.990
She would draw it, she
would draw it again.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.820
And eventually she
came across --

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.430
or she came to this image of
our main character, Johnny,

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:15.600
that she was happy with.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.900
One thing that Erin does
to find a character is

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:23.310
that she'll actually sculpt
the character with clay.

00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:26.720
For Erin that's easier
sometimes than just trying

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.940
to draw unto a empty white page.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:32.510
She can just get her thumbs
in there, start moving around.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.810
What does the nose look like?

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:35.440
What does the eye look like?

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:38.740
What does the character
look like when you turn it?

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.050
Does it look good
from all angles?

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.240
And when she's got
a clay head --

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.620
this is about three inches
tall maybe in real life.

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.310
And once she's got
that finished,

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:53.350
what she can do is move it
around and draw from it.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:54.650
That way you're not
always having

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:57.280
to use just your imagination.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.980
Erin uses all old-fashioned
and traditional materials,

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.270
which is one of the reasons
I think we were asked

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:06.570
to work on this project.

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:11.190
Mark Twain -- when Mark
Twain was alive and writing,

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.400
the most common form of book
illustration was probably wood

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.860
block printing.

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.180
In its day would've been
in almost every book

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.710
that you would see
that would have images.

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:22.220
These days it's much
less common.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.490
But it's the way that
Erin continues to work.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:29.030
So on the right side here
we have her carving knives

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.390
that she uses for
carving wood blocks.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:33.560
And on the left are
just her pencils

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:36.320
that she uses to
finish the images.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:41.460
So these are Erin's
paints and her brayers

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.020
and what's called a bear and the
little circular object is called

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.390
the baren.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:49.250
The way Erin works is
she'll carve a wood block.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:53.630
She'll add ink or paint to
that wood block using one

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:54.930
of those brayers.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:56.230
It's kind of like
a paint roller.

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:59.640
Then she'll press a piece of
paper onto that wood block

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.310
and then take that circular
baren, and with the pressure

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:05.240
of her own hand,
will press the ink

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.010
from the wood block
onto the paper.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:10.120
In the center there
is Erin's color chart.

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.940
So there are -- let's
see -- 15 colors there.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.960
That's every color that Erin
is going to use in the book.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.950
Before Erin makes
a single image,

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.060
what she does is
decides the color palette

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:23.140
for the entire book.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.800
So this is one of
Erin's wood blocks.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.140
This is the wood block -- one
of the wood blocks that was used

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:31.090
to make the cover image.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:36.150
So she carved that big shape
that's sort of all smeared

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:37.450
in red right now,
that's the dragon.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:40.510
And then underneath the
dragon's head is the lion.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:44.520
After she's added the ink
and then pressed the paper,

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:47.520
she pulls the paper up, it
looks something like this.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:53.500
And then the final step is
several hours with her just

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.250
with her pencil box
where she starts filling

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:56.550
in all the details.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:00.220
So this is the image, this
is the cover image for the

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.890
"The Purloining of
Prince Oleomargarine."

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:06.930
Erin also uses the wood blocks
in a nontraditional way.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:09.850
So typically you would always
be carving away things.

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:13.270
But one thing that Erin likes
to do is to add ink directly

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.730
onto the block and to sort

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:18.070
of wipe it softly away
just with a paper towel.

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.940
And by doing that, she can
get an image that looks kind

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:25.350
of like this with these
soft edges for the ground

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:27.550
and these soft edges
for the clouds,

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:31.290
which then became an image
that looks like this.

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:33.820
So one of the challenges
that Erin was facing was,

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.910
what is the setting
for this book?

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:39.150
It was told originally in 1879.

00:40:39.150 --> 00:40:45.270
We are illustrating it at
this time in 2014, 2015, 2016.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.980
But it's a fairytale
at the same time.

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.990
And fairytales aren't usually
set, well, in Australia for one.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:54.400
They're also not set in the
United States typically.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.680
We kind of felt that Mark
Twain would want to buck trend

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.420
and he would want this book
set in the United States.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:03.080
And so what we decided
to do was bridge the gap

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:08.300
between Mark Twain's era and
our own era and to set the book

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.290
in what's known as
the Dust Bowl.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.780
So the middle of the country
in the 1930s basically.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.830
It's a really desolate,
dusty place,

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:17.930
and we thought it was
perfect for the kind of story

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:20.310
that Mark Twain would tell.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:25.420
So you guys see the house up
there in the upper right corner?

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:29.320
Throughout the book, Erin
dropped in little things

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.890
that were -- she would
call them Easter eggs.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.450
Things for people that really
love Mark Twain to find

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.960
so that they could engage with
the book in a special way.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.960
So that house was
actually based on the house

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:45.330
that Mark Twain was born
in, which is seen here.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:51.780
The queen in this story, who
doesn't show up until later

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.910
on in the story, was actually
based on Mark Twain's wife.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:57.150
Which some people have noticed.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:42:01.330
There was one final piece of
the creation of the artwork

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:04.290
that really was giving us
trouble for a long time.

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:07.640
There were certain elements that
we really wanted to be carved

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.010
in wood and printed, but they
were just either they were too

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:16.020
intricate to carve by hand, or
it would just take us too long.

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:20.970
So what we ended up doing was
using a laser to carve the wood,

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:24.710
which involves a
lot of me standing

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:26.050
and watching this machine work.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:28.680
So this is what I'm
looking at there.

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.540
All of the chapter titles in the
book -- so it says chapter 2,

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:35.780
regarding parades, chapter
1, in which we are introduced

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:39.380
to our luckless hero -- all of
these chapter titles were carved

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:43.950
into wood using this
laser machine.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.630
There are also use these
long proclamations,

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.900
the proclamations -- the
unpopular proclamations --

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:53.320
of the king, that would've taken
us literally months to carve

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.430
by hand, that we
were able to carve

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.370
in maybe 45 minutes
using this machine.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:01.750
These are some of my favorite
pieces of artwork in the book.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.390
This is what that
king's proclamation looks

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:07.220
like in the final book.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:15.790
This is what one of the
chapter titles looks like.

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.240
Maybe my favorite
individual carving

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.970
in this book is actually
on the endpapers.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:21.270
Can I see the book here?

00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:25.620
So an endpaper is the
part of the book --

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:28.020
the very first thing
when you open the book

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:32.300
and the very last thing you
see when you close the book.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.720
And in most books this
will just be a solid color,

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:38.400
or maybe it'll just
be plain white.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.290
But Erin and I love to
do something special

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:42.400
for the endpapers
whenever we can.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:45.330
So we wanted to bring the whole
project back to where it began.

00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.110
We wanted people to be
able to see a little bit

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:49.960
of what Mark Twain's
actual writing looked like.

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.070
So we took some original
pages of Mark Twain's work.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:55.460
We had them digitized.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.780
Then we were able to feed
those into the laser carver.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:03.080
And Mark Twain's actual
writing started to get spit

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.240
out by this laser carver
directly into the wood.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.290
And this is an image
of Erin pulling a print

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:10.650
from Mark Twain's handwriting.

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:13.760
So these are some of my
favorite pieces of artwork.

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:17.270
So that brings us
to the conclusion.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:21.900
One of the questions that I get
more than an when I'm talking

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.220
about this book is: Which part
of the book was Mark Twain's

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.710
and which part of
the book is yours?

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:30.530
And the obvious answer,
the most obvious answer is

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:31.830
that the ending is mine.

00:44:31.830 --> 00:44:35.540
The last few pages of the
book are completely mine.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.490
But in truth, that doesn't
really tell you the story.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:41.180
Because all throughout the
text, he and I are sort

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.810
of interweaving and
sometimes it's him speaking

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:45.110
and sometimes it's me speaking.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.250
And I worked very hard and it
was very difficult for me to try

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.330
to find a way to
balance our two voices.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:55.540
My favorite example of something
that's neither Mark Twain nor

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:59.190
myself but is also
both is this chicken.

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.800
So the chicken is my favorite
character in the entire book.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:07.150
And the chicken's name
is pestilence and famine.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:11.320
So as I was doing my
research on Mark Twain,

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.620
one of the things
I discovered is

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:16.570
that Mark Twain always
had cats in his house.

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:18.980
Just cats and cats everywhere,
when he lived on the farm

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.220
in Elmira, New York, there were
cats in and out of the house

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:23.630
and in his writing studio.

00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:26.990
And the cats always
had strange names.

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:32.170
One of those cats was named
pestilence and famine.

00:45:32.170 --> 00:45:34.150
Or -- and we could
never really figure this

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:35.610
out -- there were two cats.

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:38.650
One that was named pestilence
and one that was famine.

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:39.960
The reason we couldn't
figure it out is

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.990
because nobody had
bothered to put a comma

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:43.930
where you would need
to put a comma.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:46.870
And we could never find a
satisfactory answer to whether

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:49.160
or not there were
two cats or one cat.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:50.800
But Erin and I thought
it was funnier

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.870
if there was only one cat
and the cat had two names.

00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:57.670
So that's why this chicken
was introduced into the story

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.770
as pestilence and famine,
one chicken has two names.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.220
And that's my favorite example

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.270
of something that's both
a little bit of Twain

00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:08.030
and a little bit of me and
a little bit of Erin too.

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:13.160
And an example of the kind of
thinking that we were using

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.460
as we were making this project.

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:15.920
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: It's great.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.250
I love this story.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.510
Isn't it a great story?

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:31.170
[ Applause ]

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:33.870
I'm really glad that
you made a point

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:36.150
of mentioning how
you start the book.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.690
I want to read you guys
something real quick.

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:41.400
And he says at the very
beginning, it's the note

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:44.140
from one of the authors.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:48.490
And he showed you his
handwriting version of this,

00:46:48.490 --> 00:46:51.090
but the part that I really
get a kick out of is,

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:54.420
"Most likely you don't know me
and you've never heard my name,

00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:56.080
said too fast or otherwise.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.770
Chances are though you've
heard of my friend, Mark Twain.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:02.410
He's the one who
told me this story."

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:03.710
I love that.

00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:07.790
I have a feeling you guys
have some questions for him.

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:12.110
I love this notion that
something that he's just shared

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:14.250
with you, either about his
work or the story itself,

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:16.710
probably has spoken to you
and you've got questions.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:20.860
So we've got four microphones
all around our room.

00:47:20.860 --> 00:47:24.380
And when you raise
your hand and one

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:31.420
of my colleagues identifies you,
if you would take the microphone

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.030
and say your name and
then ask your question,

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:36.330
that would be great.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:39.050
Why don't we start right here?

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:40.600
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Jaden.

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:45.670
And I wanted to ask what you --

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:50.160
what do you inspire to be
most like, like Mark Twain?

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:53.740
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: Well, if
I could grow a mustache

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:58.090
like Mark Twain, I think
that'd be pretty great.

00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:02.130
I think -- so I learned
a lot about Mark Twain

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:04.100
as I was working on this.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.510
And one thing that
I really admire is

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:08.270
that Mark Twain was really well
known for being able to stand

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:11.420
up in front of people, and
he would just sort of stand

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:14.080
and wait for everybody
to get really quiet,

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.400
and then he would
just start talking.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.900
And he could tell
a story like that.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.490
And that really is
impressive to me.

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:24.180
Because it took me three
years to write this story.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:27.880
And I think Mark Twain could
have done in about 15 minutes.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.180
So that's what I aspire to be.

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.620
I aspire to be somebody who
can just get up, tell a story,

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.840
and have it be perfect
on the first try.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.140
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Good answer.

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:39.070
Oh, I want to mention
as well for those of you

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:41.150
who are watching
our live-stream,

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:45.420
if you want to ask a question,
you can through Twitter,

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:49.560
if you use the #TwainLOC.

00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:53.770
So if you're on Twitter and
you want to ask a question,

00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:56.940
if you if you just
use the #TwainLOC,

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:01.750
my colleague Sasha has her
phone ready and she can be

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.770
on the lookout for any
of those questions.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:05.690
Okay. How about we go --

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:12.670
do we have a question
back there, or not?

00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:14.330
Great.

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:17.230
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Eleanor.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:21.780
And I was wondering
what the like connection

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:26.360
between all the characters was
and how they were all connected?

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.890
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: The
question was how are all the

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:30.190
characters connected.

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:32.940
So this is a difficult
one to answer.

00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.870
Because Mark Twain sort of
had his own way in his notes

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:39.320
of connecting the characters,
but then I had my own ideas

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.300
for how characters
ought to be connected.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:45.900
But there are certain characters
that were the same throughout.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:49.680
So the character of Johnny, we
were very faithful to the way

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.430
that Mark Twain wrote
about that character.

00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:56.610
Also the character of the
queen, who I think was --

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:59.830
we based it on Mark Twain's
wife, who he loved very much.

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.220
But I think that even if he
wasn't quite thinking that,

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:07.660
that was a character that he
was particularly in love with.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:09.630
But there were so many
different options.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:12.380
One of the things I love about
this story is that there were

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.920
so many pieces of
information that were missing.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.290
And that's what was really
exciting as a storyteller,

00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:19.070
is that because there were
so many pieces missing,

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.460
it allowed us to
make the connections

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:29.050
and to put things together in a
way that felt appropriate to us.

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:30.390
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Cooper.

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:35.150
And what made you like
Mark Twain so much?

00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:36.510
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: So that's
an interesting question,

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:39.370
because there were times when
I would say that I didn't

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:43.330
like Mark Twain very much.

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:45.740
We spent so much
time working with him

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:50.230
as if he were a real live
person, that we started to feel

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:52.360
that Mark Twain was almost
like a family member.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.410
So you love your family,

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:58.300
but sometimes you just really
can't stand your family either.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.350
And the more that we read about
Mark Twain and the more we had

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:03.780
to spend time with him, there
were times when we just felt

00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:07.060
like maybe it would be better,
Mark, if you would just leave

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:10.420
and we could work on this thing
by our self for a little while.

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:11.720
But he never left.

00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.250
And now I feel like Mark
Twain is permanently living

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:16.550
in my spare bedroom.

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.470
&gt;&gt; My name is Zoe Ridell.

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:23.490
I was wondering what's your
10-month-old baby's name?

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:27.720
&gt;&gt; My 10-month-old
baby's name is Adelaide,

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.770
which is actually a
city in Australia.

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:36.800
So Australia has come back
into the conversation.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.100
&gt;&gt; My name is Ty.

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.640
And I had a question about
when you went into the house,

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:46.450
did you feel like a flashback
or anything that you felt inside

00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.570
that could've put in your books?

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:52.640
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: Do you mean
like in Mark Twain's house?

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.940
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:55.770
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead:
So a little bit.

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:57.490
The funny thing is when
you walk into that house,

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:00.830
it really does feel like there
are ghosts in that house.

00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:02.790
And it's not a house that
I would want to be hanging

00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:06.820
around in after dark,
I'll say that.

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:11.010
&gt;&gt; Hello, my name is Avery.

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:15.820
And was the title of your
book Mark Twain's title,

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.810
or did you make that title?

00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:19.110
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: That's
a very good question.

00:52:19.110 --> 00:52:21.570
So Mark Twain didn't
leave a title.

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:25.150
All he wrote was the word
"oleomargarine" on the top.

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:29.510
And so it was our job also
to come up with the title.

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:32.900
Purloining was my
editor's favorite word.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:34.280
Well, she has two
favorite words.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.800
One is purloining,
which means --

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.800
if you don't know
what this word means,

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.550
it kind of means it's
something like stealing,

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:44.200
kind of like kidnapping
in this case.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.860
Her other favorite
word is defenestration,

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:49.830
which means to throw
yourself out a window.

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:53.200
But I worked tirelessly to
try to get the second word

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:58.950
into the book and never
was able to do it.

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:01.250
&gt;&gt; Sasha?

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:04.530
&gt;&gt; Hi, mane is Destinee.

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:10.780
And my question was is there
like a spiritual connection

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:15.160
with Mark Twain, or
is he still alive?

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.470
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead:
So Mark Twain died

00:53:17.470 --> 00:53:20.130
in I think it was the year 1910.

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:22.730
But for me he is very
much still alive.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:24.360
So I guess yeah, you
would call it kind

00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.560
of a spiritual connection.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.170
&gt;&gt; My name is Suleiman.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:33.220
And my question was if those
aren't all the characters,

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:36.510
then how did you pick which
characters to put on the cover?

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:41.760
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: So that was
up to my wife, Erin, to decide.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:45.410
And all of the important
characters

00:53:45.410 --> 00:53:46.900
in the book are there.

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.930
So the characters that
have either speaking roles

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:52.500
or play some other
sort of important role.

00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:56.080
And there are a lot of animals
in the book that are sort

00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:00.580
of I guess you'd call them
background in the story.

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:04.030
And so it was -- Erin was trying
very hard to put the most --

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:05.390
all the most important
characters --

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:08.810
which would include the
chicken, the skunk, the lion.

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.600
On top of the tiger
there is the weasel.

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.970
The weasel is very important
to the telling of the story.

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:14.270
And then of course the dragon.

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.010
Which was so big that
she couldn't even fit him

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.610
on the front cover,
so he goes all the way

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:20.270
on to the back cover too.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:21.860
&gt;&gt; My name is Austin.

00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:25.970
And I was wondering how many
drafts did you have to do?

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:27.790
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: Another very
good question, how many drafts?

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:32.530
So my very first draft was the
version of the book that I wrote

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:35.240
when I was at the
cabin on Beaver Island.

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.490
But I didn't stop writing the
entire time we were working

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:39.790
on the book.

00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:43.310
So I began writing
in September of 2014,

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:46.980
and we finished the
book in January of 2017.

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:53.050
So around 2 1/2 years of writing
and rewriting and rewriting.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:55.920
And the way that I work, I
don't start at the beginning

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.680
of a draft and work
all the way to the end.

00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.280
I just have the entire
thing in front of me

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:01.540
and I change a little bit here
and I change a little bit there

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:03.860
and then I go back to the middle
and I change a little bit here.

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:05.890
So I can't really tell you
exactly how many drafts,

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:09.570
but what I can tell you is
that I was constantly working

00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:11.450
and constantly changing.

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:13.030
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name's Wesley.

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:16.140
And I was wondering if
Mark Twain had an influence

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.720
on any of your other books?

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:20.540
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: I
love that question.

00:55:20.540 --> 00:55:22.680
So did Mark Twain
have an influence

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.980
on any of my other books?

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:28.640
I think he didn't necessarily
have a direct influence

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.530
on my books, but I do think he
had an influence on the type

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:33.830
of writer that I became.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:37.330
People have a lot of different
ways to describe Mark Twain,

00:55:37.330 --> 00:55:38.630
but one of the ways that people

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:41.090
like to describe him
is as a satirist.

00:55:41.090 --> 00:55:48.650
So a satirist is somebody
who finds a way to use comedy

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:50.220
to better inform people

00:55:50.220 --> 00:55:53.030
about some serious
issue that's going on.

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:56.460
And that's always been a
really interesting way for me

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:57.860
to communicate, something

00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:03.550
that has influenced me even
though maybe there's not a

00:56:03.550 --> 00:56:05.030
specific book of Mark Twain's

00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:07.450
that I would look
to for inspiration.

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:10.720
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Shakala.

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:16.360
And I was wondering where
did you find the notes

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.510
for to write the book?

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:19.810
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: So the notes --

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:21.580
do you remember the video
we watched at the beginning?

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:26.530
That was the Mark Twain Papers,
which is its own little archive

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:28.950
and library in Berkeley,
California.

00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:31.000
So at the time that
they made that video --

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.340
which I'm guessing was
about 20 years ago --

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:38.490
they said that there were I
think he said 10,000 letters

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:40.110
to and from Mark Twain.

00:56:40.110 --> 00:56:44.240
Today it's all the
way up to over 30,000,

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:48.900
and they're still finding
every single week as many

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:52.120
as three new letters
written to either Mark Twain

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.090
or from Mark Twain or from a
family member of Mark Twain's.

00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:57.280
And so this archive, it's
really a living thing,

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.400
where things are
constantly coming in

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.690
and new things are
being discovered.

00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:06.750
And there's got to be any number
of little pieces of gold stuck

00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:12.240
in this archive waiting to
be discovered by people.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:13.540
&gt;&gt; My name is Amani.

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.750
And I was wondering
why do you think

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:19.960
that you were chosen
to rewrite this book?

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:21.620
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: I've
asked myself that too,

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:25.360
and I don't have an answer

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.280
that I can say is
definitely the true answer.

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.110
But what I think is the reason

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:33.910
that we were chosen is actually
the abilities of my wife, Erin.

00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:37.510
So I really think that it's
her ability as an artist

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:39.430
and the methods I
was showing you.

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:40.920
How she works in wood block.

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:43.040
She works with all these
traditional materials.

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.080
I think that Erin
was really the bridge

00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.880
between Mark Twain's
era and my own.

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.680
And I just kind of came along
because I was attached to her,

00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:54.630
that's what I tell
people anyway.

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:55.930
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Awesome.

00:57:55.930 --> 00:57:57.360
We've got time for
one more question.

00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.280
And we'll take this one.

00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:01.230
&gt;&gt; Hello. So my name is Zozon.

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:03.340
And I got a question.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.690
So before you wrote the book,

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:09.070
did you know what was
in Mark Twain's mind?

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:11.950
Like you don't know what
-- how -- the way it was --

00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:14.190
like the book was ended?

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:16.420
Like what was in his mind?

00:58:16.420 --> 00:58:18.520
Did you like figure out this?

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:21.450
Or like you took your time?

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:23.710
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: So
the most difficult part

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:25.010
of this job was figuring

00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:27.960
out what was actually inside
the mind of this writer.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.900
And instead of trying to
figure out what was in his mind

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:35.150
on that very specific day,
what I tried to figure

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:38.070
out was what was on his mind
throughout his lifetime.

00:58:38.070 --> 00:58:39.370
And if I could figure
out what was

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:41.130
on his mind throughout
his lifetime,

00:58:41.130 --> 00:58:43.670
then I would have a better
chance of figuring out the ways

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:46.200
that he would've told the story.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.990
Also, before I leave,
I want to make sure

00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:50.020
that somebody gets me
one of these T-shirts

00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:53.330
that just says Twain on it.

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:55.840
Because I don't have
anything quite like that.

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:58.650
So if [inaudible]
yeah, that'd be great.

00:58:58.650 --> 00:58:59.950
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: Awesome.

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:02.030
Thank you all so much.

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:03.710
Your questions were terrific.

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:05.010
And Philip, thank you.

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:07.510
&gt;&gt; Philip Stead: Thank you.

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:15.900
[ Applause ]

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:21.030
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
I also want to --

00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:23.280
I also want to give a
very, very special --

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:31.570
I want to give a very special
thank you to Dr. and Mrs. Eskin

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:35.770
who are here with us, who
made this program possible.

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:38.070
Thank you.

00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:43.350
As I mentioned at the
beginning of this program,

00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:46.520
Dr. and Mrs. Eskin
are responsible

00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:52.980
for the Jonah S. Eskin Memorial
Program here at the Library.

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:55.330
And they've been supporting
this for nine years.

00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:58.820
And every one of these programs
I just think are marvelous.

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:02.390
I think your connection to this
story, your way of telling it,

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.020
and having it be
about inspiration

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.110
and discovery is very much
a part of why you are here.

01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:10.550
And so thank you, and thank you.

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:14.870
And thank you to those of you
watching on the life-stream.

01:00:14.870 --> 01:00:16.990
We love it when our
audience gets extended.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:20.000
So thanks to all of you.

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.510
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
