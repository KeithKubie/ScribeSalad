important factor today it really it's
back to the first factor is more

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039
back to the first factor is more
 

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:45.070
back to the first factor is more
important than this factor but it's it's

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080
important than this factor but it's it's
 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.320
important than this factor but it's it's
in the fact it's in the list the third

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:47.330
in the fact it's in the list the third
 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.080
in the fact it's in the list the third
factor is how much did you use was it

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.090
factor is how much did you use was it
 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.180
factor is how much did you use was it
the appropriate amount for the purpose

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.190
the appropriate amount for the purpose
 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.460
the appropriate amount for the purpose
that you were trying to make of the of

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:54.470
that you were trying to make of the of
 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.920
that you were trying to make of the of
the item did you take the most important

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:56.930
the item did you take the most important
 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.260
the item did you take the most important
bits if you did that's going to tend

00:07:59.260 --> 00:07:59.270
bits if you did that's going to tend
 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:00.940
bits if you did that's going to tend
against fair use but if you only use a

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:00.950
against fair use but if you only use a
 

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:03.159
against fair use but if you only use a
small portion of it that may tend toward

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:03.169
small portion of it that may tend toward
 

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:05.500
small portion of it that may tend toward
fair use and finally the fourth factor

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:05.510
fair use and finally the fourth factor
 

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.560
fair use and finally the fourth factor
is the market impact how did you impact

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:08.570
is the market impact how did you impact
 

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.700
is the market impact how did you impact
the market up for the

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:09.710
the market up for the
 

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:12.880
the market up for the
original work in your uses and if your

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:12.890
original work in your uses and if your
 

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.950
original work in your uses and if your
work if your use is transformative

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960
work if your use is transformative
 

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.930
work if your use is transformative
then there's likely no market for that

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:16.940
then there's likely no market for that
 

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.910
then there's likely no market for that
transformative use and and therefore you

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:18.920
transformative use and and therefore you
 

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.320
transformative use and and therefore you
may not be impacting the market at all

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:20.330
may not be impacting the market at all
 

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.650
may not be impacting the market at all
so those are the four factors in fair

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:23.660
so those are the four factors in fair
 

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.600
so those are the four factors in fair
use so now I'm gonna tell you a little

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:25.610
use so now I'm gonna tell you a little
 

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.730
use so now I'm gonna tell you a little

this risk and despite that huge and

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:58.310
this risk and despite that huge and
 

00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:59.710
this risk and despite that huge and
scary number we conducted a fair use

00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720
scary number we conducted a fair use
 

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.140
scary number we conducted a fair use
analysis of our uses of the uses we

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:02.150
analysis of our uses of the uses we
 

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:04.030
analysis of our uses of the uses we
wanted to make and we determined that

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.040
wanted to make and we determined that
 

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.760
wanted to make and we determined that
despite this huge number the risk was

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:06.770
despite this huge number the risk was
 

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.590
despite this huge number the risk was
small that someone would actually object

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600
small that someone would actually object
 

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.180
small that someone would actually object
and let alone someone bring a lawsuit

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.190
and let alone someone bring a lawsuit
 

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.550
and let alone someone bring a lawsuit
against us so we accepted that risk in

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560
against us so we accepted that risk in
 

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.620
against us so we accepted that risk in

light of our mission to expand access to
 

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:16.600
light of our mission to expand access to
our material and decided to digitize the

our material and decided to digitize the
 

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.340
our material and decided to digitize the
collection of photos and here are the

collection of photos and here are the
 

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.100
collection of photos and here are the
results so we made an interesting a
