00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.100
This is Jocko podcast number one 81 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.220
Jocko Willink. Good Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:10.743
Get him out.

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.000
We were in Cambodia alone with no fixed wing aircraft.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.310
Sal's eyes were as big as saucers.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.720
I told Bubba to give me a claymore mine with a five second fuse I gave Bubba and

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.970
Foxville move quick signal. As we moved back to the LZ,

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.060
I stayed at the rear of the formation with sal and hastily with sal hastily

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:31.200
covering our tracks.

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.710
We'd only gone a short distance when sal hist beaucoup VC beaucoup VC.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.160
I could see the pith helmets in the distance coming from the south.

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.650
I radioed the Green Horn at CNC helicopter and told them to return with their

13
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.140
gun ships and to pick us up at the primary LZ,

14
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.260
a s a p C and c said they'd have assets on site in 10 minutes or less.

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.460
Now, even 10 minutes seemed like a long time.

16
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.170
Twan and I fired our m 79 as to high bursts,

17
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.050
which slowed the NVA down for a few seconds.

18
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.520
Sao Open fire shooting shingles, single shots and moving backwards.

19
00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.040
No longer bothering to cover our tracks.

20
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.490
I yelled to Bubba to move out at double time.

21
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.710
The race for life was on sow and sow.

22
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.350
Here's to hip and pointed north dam.

23
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.340
There were pith helmets and NVA uniforms coming at us from the north two and at

24
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.710
a dead run.

25
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.350
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

26
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.650
<v 0>Sam and I placed a claim more behind a tree, pulled the fuse lighter and ran.</v>

27
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.680
The NVA were now running and shooting wildly.

28
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.280
We sprinted to catch up to the team. As the claymore exploded,

29
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.190
the NVA kept on charging.

30
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.810
Sao quickly placed its claim more in front of a tree and ran.

31
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.260
While Twan and I provided covering fire,

32
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.730
we sprinted toward our team as the second claim or detonated.

33
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.960
We felt the blast on our backs as we ran as fork and BUBBA pushed toward the l z

34
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.180
hip Twan sow and I fired back using the immediate action drills.

35
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:18.270
The entire team had practiced for hours on end.

36
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.500
Twangy m 79 rounds were deadly effective.

37
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.660
Those combined with my m 79 rounds and the car 15 fire from hip and sal

38
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.800
temporarily starred, stalled the hard charging NVA troops.

39
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.940
We reached the LZ quickly in comparison to how cautiously we had exited it.

40
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.520
As the team set up a hasty perimeter hip placed another claim or in the path of

41
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:48.521
the NVA that were charging us from the south to the north Bubba ric declaim more

42
00:02:49.221 --> 00:02:51.560
with a contact get nater on a trip wire.

43
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.490
As the tide of pith helmets flowed toward us,

44
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.030
Bubba and I opened fire with our m 70 nines and Sao and hip opened up on full

45
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:02.710
auto with their car.

46
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:07.711
Fifteens more NVA emerged from the smoke of the m 79 high explosive rounds and

47
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.990
tripped Bubba's claim more.

48
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.950
That's when the first Green Hornet gunship arrived.

49
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.870
I popped a smoke canister and directed a gun run to the west of our perimeter.

50
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.970
Within seconds, the gunship roar gunship roared in front of our perimeter,

51
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.140
shredding the NBA ranks, slowing them down for a few seconds.

52
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.430
The Green Hornets fired power was incredible. Finally,

53
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.010
the Green Hornet slick that inserted us into the target area arrived on the LZ

54
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.000
as close to our position as possible with his left door facing us.

55
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.410
The nose pointing north or northwest. Fortunately,

56
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.900
the air force had made it to us in less than 10 minutes.

57
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.480
The relentless NVA kept coming after us.

58
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.390
As Twan and I each on least one more.

59
00:03:55.391 --> 00:04:00.391
M 79 high explosive round at the NVA bubble led the team toward the Air Force

60
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.390
Huey.

61
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.110
We always had an American lead the teams approach to an American helicopter to

62
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:09.850
avoid any confusion in regard to south Vietnamese team members on s t Idaho.

63
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.100
I fired the last claim war as the wave of NVA troops got in front of it.

64
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.290
<v 2>Okay.</v>

65
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.290
<v 0>The last claim or blast gave me a few precious seconds to make it to the Huey</v>

66
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.273
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

67
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.220
<v 0>In that right there is a another glimpse</v>

68
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.810
into the insanity that John Stryker Meyer known as tilt lived through as a

69
00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:41.460
special forces soldier in Vietnam,

70
00:04:41.461 --> 00:04:46.461
a recon team leader for Mac v Sogs studies and Observation Group Command and

71
00:04:46.621 --> 00:04:51.510
control. And if you have not listened to podcast one 80 yet,

72
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.100
then go listen to it.

73
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.460
Tilt was on that podcast and as soon as he walked out of the studio,

74
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.520
I knew that I needed him to come back as quickly as possible.

75
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.200
And I asked him and he graciously agreed. And here he is.

76
00:05:07.201 --> 00:05:10.950
Once again, John Stryker Meyer tilt.

77
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.630
Good evening sir. Good evening. Yeah. You know,

78
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:19.170
you kind of mentioned that that one operation right there,

79
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.610
when you were out there facing three divisions,

80
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.720
after you got fat, dumb and happy on Thanksgiving Day with a big meal,

81
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.730
that then you guys rolled out into the field. Right? Indeed it did. And it has.

82
00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:35.520
So how did that, how did that operation go now? Have you guys got inserted?

83
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.880
How did you end up in that situation where you're running away,

84
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.900
putting in five second fused claymores face the enemy? What was,

85
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.800
what led up to that? Well, we had a briefing the night before and um,

86
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.220
they were hyper concerned because the three NBA divisions,

87
00:05:53.221 --> 00:05:58.010
30,000 men where Mia, Lily and the dia,

88
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.720
<v 3>whoever else is out there had lost contact. So, uh, that night, uh,</v>

89
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:07.370
myself and the CEO and S3 went over to maps, Liz reports,

90
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.220
audit Intel reports. We were up until after midnight.

91
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.600
<v 0>So, so they, they came to you and said, hey, we're missing 30,000 men,</v>

92
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.040
three divisions of NVA. At first. The third one we've gotten the CIA login,

93
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.830
we've got the dia, we've got spy planes and all that stuff. We can't find them.

94
00:06:22.831 --> 00:06:23.664
So then they come to you?

95
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.760
<v 3>Yeah. Okay. And you're like, cool, we got this. Oh yeah.</v>

96
00:06:28.761 --> 00:06:33.240
And at the time I was still a spec four and [inaudible] so, and I had,

97
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.860
I hadn't met the CEO yet. So the first thing was, he looks at me, he says,

98
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.080
you're an e four this is an e 89 bill at what WTF? I go, look sir.

99
00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.990
Long story short, I said, look, I've run a bunch of missions up north.

100
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.580
We're here TDY. How can I help you? And he settled down. We looked.

101
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.050
Then we were up all night looking at those Intel reports.

102
00:06:51.051 --> 00:06:54.620
And then they also had pictures that were from 70,000 feet.

103
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.130
We had never seen anything like that.

104
00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.860
And my mom was a piano teacher and one of her students,

105
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.010
dad worked on lenses for aircraft to shoot from 70,000 feet.

106
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.000
He talked to me about my, as a young kid, I go, oh, that's really cool.

107
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.020
Well now I knew what he was working on and why he couldn't really talk about it

108
00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:17.420
much. But they, that was the first time,

109
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:21.170
the SRS w ones we use overflights got it. And, and I say,

110
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:23.940
where'd the hell these come from? It cause I was like, this is mind boggling.

111
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.980
And used to seeing, you know, a little pictures close by people smile.

112
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:32.981
But for 70,000 feet we had a good estimate as to where they might be.

113
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.260
And they said, we can't tell you this stuff. Shut up. You don't haven't seen it.

114
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.870
And so we put it all together,

115
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.620
just try to Syria and we went in really on the ground a short while,

116
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:46.550
maybe an hour or so and then all hell broke loose.

117
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:47.890
<v 0>And did you, didn't you,</v>

118
00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:51.490
you stumbled upon their camp or like a camp that they had recently left?

119
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.910
<v 3>Yeah, well they have a, they would have waste stations along the way.</v>

120
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.030
And so we walked into them before we found some,

121
00:07:58.031 --> 00:08:01.810
but never would fire is burning. The one still had a Pato on it.

122
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.460
And so, um, and when we got back,

123
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:11.490
sound guy's estimated then one division had just left and they're point there

124
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.870
tell them it was what came back at us.

125
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.280
And the other from the north was just moving into the base camp. Ah,

126
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.790
little sandwich. Yeah. Little NVA Sandwich. There we go. And we were to,

127
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.030
we were to Bologna your basic balloon.

128
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.700
<v 0>Yeah. Did you go into that one real heavy in terms of, is that,</v>

129
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.190
cause I is, if I remember correctly from the book,

130
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.540
how common was it that you carried the five second fuses on the,

131
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:44.440
<v 3>uh, we started doing that a month earlier, um, early part of November. I mean,</v>

132
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.500
could, we had a couple targets where, um,

133
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.070
the numbers were just incredible when they came at us.

134
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.940
So I always wanted to have those just in case.

135
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.490
So here we took a few extra fuses. You know,

136
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:59.190
John had fuses and a sow and a fuck.

137
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.760
They all knew how to work those. And so, um,

138
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.690
here I said, because we saw how open area was,

139
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.290
we were used to triple canopy up north. And so now we're in Cambodia.

140
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.080
You could see three or 400 yards away,

141
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:16.640
maybe 500 yards WTF times to knees.

142
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.210
He the pith homeless run Natchez.

143
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.770
<v 0>Whoa. How does it feel when you see the NVA in an open run towards your position</v>

144
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.280
toward arms? Yeah. Good Lord. Deb was, it was an experience.

145
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.240
I'll take it to the grave with me. That's a nightmare is your worst one.

146
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:36.170
How did you, did you, did you in a situation like that, you're,

147
00:09:36.171 --> 00:09:37.370
you're, you've got,

148
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.510
I mean thousands of potentially thousands of enemy soldiers.

149
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.780
Some of them are booze blatantly running towards your position.

150
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.870
What are you thinking in the back of your mind? Are you thinking, Hey,

151
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.440
we're not going to get out of this, are you just,

152
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.160
I know for me in my experiences, which are nothing come close to that,

153
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.100
but I was always just thinking about getting my job done. Like, okay,

154
00:09:58.101 --> 00:09:59.690
this is what, this is the best thing I can do right now. Hey,

155
00:09:59.691 --> 00:10:00.760
we need to put some people over here.

156
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.060
Let's get some machine gutters up on the roof.

157
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.960
I would never get to a point where I was or maybe I didn't have enough time or I

158
00:10:05.961 --> 00:10:09.020
wasn't smart enough to think about what big consequences were coming.

159
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.430
But when you see,

160
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.780
when you see those helmets running towards you at port arms,

161
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:15.610
you've got to be thinking,

162
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.800
this isn't looking real good for this isn't looking real good. Full tilt.

163
00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:20.900
And the bullet I had my first Jocko moment,

164
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.660
which was the good news is we found these fuckers.

165
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.780
The bad news is they're coming to kill my ass.

166
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.660
Really. It's like,

167
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:34.050
<v 3>well, I'll play. We did our homework last night. This really worked out well.</v>

168
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:35.620
Maybe a little bit too well. Yeah.

169
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.820
And just thank God for the Greenhorns Smith Day. Then get back to her,

170
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.320
which is only a question of time.

171
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:42.300
<v 0>And they could, you would,</v>

172
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:46.290
you would keep them on station gen for generally like for like 10 or 15 minutes.

173
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.960
<v 3>Well, this is Cambodia. Everything was different there. First we had no, uh, uh,</v>

174
00:10:50.961 --> 00:10:54.530
no fixed wings. All we had was to helicopters,

175
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:59.360
but there were the greenhorns air force at that state at that point in time,

176
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.730
November 68 they were,

177
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.120
they had to stay to art Hueys they were the fastest.

178
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.660
They could carry more loads and or many guns. Uh,

179
00:11:08.661 --> 00:11:12.620
I think they had mounted mini guns that they could handle manually.

180
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:17.960
Some of the early ones we saw were mounted and so the helicopters would have

181
00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:20.180
limited maneuverability. But the one,

182
00:11:20.181 --> 00:11:24.770
the year air force was just really on top of the game. Well that's what came in.

183
00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.450
And when they came in with their mini gun runs,

184
00:11:26.451 --> 00:11:30.080
I really bought us a couple of valuable seconds. Seconds.

185
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.250
They were common and you could see him as just like,

186
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.060
<v 0>and I was looking at some pictures of you yesterday and you guys still had 20</v>

187
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:41.700
round mags. Oh yeah. Which you went,

188
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.580
which you'd load out to 18 rounds cause you didn't want to compress the spring

189
00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:45.720
too much and cause a jam.

190
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.580
<v 3>Right. And we would have run over your mother to get one of those</v>

191
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.650
<v 0>don jobs. Yeah, man. Oh yeah.</v>

192
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:55.180
<v 3>It was, it was different.</v>

193
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:59.280
So we always had at least 600 plus rounds all in the magazines that a couple of

194
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.760
strip bandoliers just in case.

195
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.370
<v 0>Yeah. And you guys did make it out that time obviously. Um,</v>

196
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.880
<v 3>well yeah. And then you know here too, when we left,</v>

197
00:12:10.881 --> 00:12:14.870
the chopper pulls out and as we're lifting off the NVA come out of the jungle,

198
00:12:14.871 --> 00:12:16.740
the thin jungle and it was muddy.

199
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.290
You had rained the day before and these guys are coming out there or at port

200
00:12:21.291 --> 00:12:25.640
arms and they're trying to stop and the mud comes up from their boots just to

201
00:12:25.641 --> 00:12:29.680
try to stop, come down to port arms. So mean a door gunner just,

202
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.970
and I forget it was sour. Fuck,

203
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:35.630
we're just getting these guys and they just stopped like a cartoon and they go

204
00:12:35.631 --> 00:12:37.730
back, this is what happened.

205
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.060
It just blew these guys back into mud from their boots as going up into the

206
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:45.230
props as they're trying to stop and they hit him and these go back into the

207
00:12:45.231 --> 00:12:46.790
jungle and we got the hell out of there.

208
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.430
<v 0>It strikes me as strange because as I keep reading about the NVA, well,</v>

209
00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:55.120
I mean we know that these, you know, this is an insurgency,

210
00:12:55.121 --> 00:12:58.540
these guys are looking to not fight when they don't have to. Right.

211
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.760
That's why it always surprises me in your, in,

212
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:04.420
in your stories how determined they were. Like those guys, hey look,

213
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.150
okay the Americans, they're getting on the helicopter, we'll let them go,

214
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:10.060
whatever, uh, we'll come back next time. You know,

215
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:12.340
we don't want to die right today cause we don't have to. We can wait,

216
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.710
we can wait 10 years or we can wait 20 years, you know, we go,

217
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:15.580
we're going to be here forever.

218
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.120
For them to have that kind of determination where they were just common in

219
00:13:19.121 --> 00:13:21.580
common and convenance and like you said on the last podcast,

220
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.310
literally stacking up bodies so they could get to you.

221
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.370
That would've been just a crown jewel to capture a little,

222
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:32.560
a little special forces team. Oh, here. I mean they had to kill American award.

223
00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:33.560
<v 3>So if they,</v>

224
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.310
if they confirmed that they killed one of us or got the body of a dead body,

225
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:41.540
they would get their killed an American award and they would get a bonus of some

226
00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:43.820
sort, maybe ruled heroes up north

227
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:49.180
<v 0>for the rest of their lives. Awesome.</v>

228
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.600
Okay. So that book and we talked about on the last part, last podcast,

229
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.310
and I said it last time, we touched less than 10% of the book.

230
00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:02.080
The stories are completely insane and you can get that book on Amazon.

231
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:05.050
Uh, you won't, but you've written, that's not the only book you've written.

232
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.190
You've written another one.

233
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.480
Another book is called on the ground and this book,

234
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:16.300
again, you're, it's, it's just the same level of, of insanity.

235
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.750
You feel strange for me to be sitting here talking to you because every time I

236
00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:21.160
read a story, one of your stories, I'm like,

237
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.250
how's this guy making it out of this? Uh, there's,

238
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.640
you kick this one off with an interesting story. These guys, one of the,

239
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.480
it's you're not with them, but it's a recon team on the ground.

240
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.300
A guy named Watkins is in charge. Pat Walk-ins,

241
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.660
and they're set up on a road and they're doing a recon and I think they set up

242
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:44.290
an ambush to like a j and ambush to take out some troops,

243
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:49.210
but they end up with this massive NVA convoy. And when I say massive,

244
00:14:49.211 --> 00:14:51.710
I mean massive. It takes hours to get by.

245
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.040
And there's people and there's trucks and there's bulldozers and there's tanks.

246
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.730
Yeah. And again, I've got to point this out. So we're probably talking,

247
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.570
you know,

248
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:06.350
a thousand enemy soldiers at least that are patrolling by you for an hour,

249
00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.780
for three hours. They're walking by you.

250
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.190
And meanwhile you got a team of six guys, eight guys, something like that.

251
00:15:13.191 --> 00:15:15.200
And it was seven or eight, I forget. But yeah,

252
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.360
and they're there and they're monitoring this.

253
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.930
And Pat was familiar with all the Russian tanks,

254
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.230
so he knew what the Russian tanks were and he had it all to you and tell

255
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:26.240
together. And the,

256
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:29.860
just one of those another night and SOG another night in socks.

257
00:15:29.861 --> 00:15:31.440
So they're sitting there waiting and they,

258
00:15:31.441 --> 00:15:34.880
they eventually they go by and uh,

259
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.340
and eventually now one of the,

260
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.280
one of the Indian soldiers that was working alongside walk-ins,

261
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:43.580
one of the members of the team was named wrong, r, O, n, g.

262
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.500
And he comes up after this convoy goes by, he comes up and this,

263
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.500
this is what happens. I'm going to the book here. Wrong city.

264
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.620
He'd been watching the road traffic just like Watkins and it had been taken,

265
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.450
taken, had been taken as taken with it as he was mean. He was like lost in like,

266
00:15:59.451 --> 00:16:01.010
oh my God, I can't believe the summer stuff.

267
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.770
While he was staring at all the vehicles passing by a handed,

268
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.680
reached out and given his arm, Mashiach, a mountain yard soldier, one of those,

269
00:16:09.681 --> 00:16:12.410
the NBA had pressed into unwilling service.

270
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:15.350
Said it's your time for guard duty.

271
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.300
Is that close to the enemy or why? That's nuts. Oh yeah,

272
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:28.550
completely nuts. The mountain yards, which you guys called yards,

273
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.070
the nuns, the south Vietnamese,

274
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:35.030
even sometimes former NVA soldiers.

275
00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:37.850
What was it like? Who did you mainly work with?

276
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:40.280
What were the differences between the different groups?

277
00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.890
There are different ethnic personalities and I know we didn't talk about last

278
00:16:42.891 --> 00:16:44.780
time you talked about in the book, but those,

279
00:16:44.781 --> 00:16:48.140
those different ethnicities didn't always get along. Oh No.

280
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:52.070
Especially when it came to playing poker apparently. Oh yeah. The cards games.

281
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.400
Cause I first, like the first few days at Fubu,

282
00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.420
they had a poker game that went awry and, and uh, the Cambodian lost,

283
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.360
he goes to his room, gets a fry grenade,

284
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:03.380
comes back and dumps it on the Monty yards.

285
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.130
So we had an instant fireflight into compound. And you know,

286
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:10.250
you always going through the training, you turn about the different groups.

287
00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:14.750
Well that case we had the Cambodians Monton yards nuns and in my team was south

288
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:15.584
Vietnamese,

289
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.390
which included at least four guys that came south in 54.

290
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.170
Uh,

291
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.880
when there was an 18 month truce where anybody that in north could go south with

292
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.030
thousands, did the navy had a special operation, would it,

293
00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:33.020
has ships going up to NOI and shipping thousands of people south?

294
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.290
Nobody went north. Nobody wants to be up with the comedies.

295
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.100
But we had those had four of them Almighty and they were just outstanding

296
00:17:40.101 --> 00:17:43.610
troops. And uh, so that was fooled by,

297
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.620
and his team was that brew, which was the lowest of the Monte Yard tribes.

298
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:49.770
Cute.

299
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.330
They couldn't throw a hand grenade where the shit but fearless and they hate,

300
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:55.860
they hate it. The North Vietnamese.

301
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.730
That's one of the key points in it and you talk about in the book is how much,

302
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.610
you know, what,

303
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:05.430
what the North Vietnamese had done to the mountain yards and how much they

304
00:18:05.431 --> 00:18:10.200
fiercely hated them and how fiercely loyal they were to you guys. Oh yeah.

305
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:12.890
Macy troops. And uh,

306
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.840
they would just fight to the end and it was more than,

307
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:19.770
there's more than one guy who like a one zero who had,

308
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.970
we called them affectionally our little people. The little people said,

309
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.180
I'll take a bullet for you. That's how dedicated they were.

310
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.690
And they proved that over and over again over and over again. Now,

311
00:18:30.691 --> 00:18:32.790
some teams had troubles, but we never had it.

312
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.050
Like on my team or with the freshmen, most majority of teams,

313
00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.410
the s the little people took care of vetting their own.

314
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.720
So like when Idaho was liked out,

315
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.790
sal and Hep went out and recruited and there were young kids, 15 years old.

316
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:52.140
We brought on the team but they vetted him and we never worried about him so we

317
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:55.890
didn't have to worry about the friendly fire or what they call today with a blue

318
00:18:55.891 --> 00:18:59.790
fire. Yeah. They call it uh, they call it

319
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.110
friendly fire. Yeah. There's just called, they have another,

320
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.350
they have another word for it too that I can think of what it is cause friendly

321
00:19:07.351 --> 00:19:08.860
fires like a mistake. Right, right.

322
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.550
What we're talking about is when you know some of your own yeah,

323
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.160
it was one of your Taliban forces or one of your,

324
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.080
your local forces is actually a Taliban person in turns on your,

325
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.380
is actually a uh, Mati militia guy and turns on use of those things.

326
00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.880
Those things are scary very because they build up trust and all of a sudden the

327
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:27.714
guy turns on you.

328
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.520
Cause early on sober eight camps had trouble with that with their, uh,

329
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.700
the Monte north had turned who had been a more loyal to the calmness for some

330
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:41.910
reason. But then there was, others had issues cause they,

331
00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.170
they like special forces,

332
00:19:43.171 --> 00:19:46.530
but they were pissed off working with the South Vietnamese and they didn't,

333
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.560
they were just, they don't kill. They would happy to kill South Vietnamese,

334
00:19:49.561 --> 00:19:53.520
our allies or to commies up north. And sometimes you had to like,

335
00:19:53.521 --> 00:19:57.180
guys don't, don't kill our allies. Not Today please.

336
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.640
But I'd never had that. My team was all south Vietnamese, all rock man.

337
00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.290
So one of the, one of the other crazy parts of,

338
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:12.410
of this book that you open with or you start one of the early chapters is this,

339
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.720
this attack on fob four,

340
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.860
which was just sound completely, completely horrible.

341
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.370
And here's a quote from the book, the entire compound.

342
00:20:23.371 --> 00:20:25.620
This is after this attack happens,

343
00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:30.450
the entire compound was now a swirling battleground with dozens of small but

344
00:20:30.451 --> 00:20:33.300
ready deadly Dyer firefights in progress.

345
00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:37.350
It was difficult to tell the scantily clad Americans and indigenous personnel

346
00:20:37.351 --> 00:20:40.770
from the enemy. And there was no command coordination,

347
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.000
just a lot of individuals struggling against uncertain and overwhelming odds.

348
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.480
The air was filled with enough chaos to the census. Screams, shouts, bullets,

349
00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:53.800
dust, smoke, and the smell of cordite, burning wood, rubber and fuel.

350
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:57.280
And lastly, the smell of seared flesh.

351
00:20:58.490 --> 00:20:59.690
<v 3>And this, this attack</v>

352
00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.580
<v 0>resulted in 17 special forces. Soldiers were killed.</v>

353
00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:09.680
And I don't know the number of, of indigenous forces that were killed,

354
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:13.090
but this sounded like just a complete, I mean,

355
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.560
obviously it was a big win for the enemy.

356
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.790
And what was your perspective on all that? Where were you when that happened?

357
00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:24.670
<v 3>I was safely ensconced and fob one because uh, uh,</v>

358
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:28.680
fob four had opened at the end of 67 and a very,

359
00:21:28.681 --> 00:21:29.850
at the base of a mountain.

360
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.200
And there's a whole lot of political reasons why they're at the base of a

361
00:21:34.201 --> 00:21:37.090
mountain. But anyways, they're there. They had it,

362
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:42.110
a test attacked body Vietcong grant around Christmas time of 67.

363
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.380
And on August 23rd, after the dust settled,

364
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:49.830
the men who were there like pat walk-ins estimated that,

365
00:21:49.831 --> 00:21:53.400
that that attack in December was a test to see what could,

366
00:21:53.401 --> 00:21:55.920
they had minimal defenses up, minimal wire.

367
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.850
The internal security force was riddled with via comm.

368
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.800
And they planned this attack for over a year to sapper attack with the NVA

369
00:22:04.801 --> 00:22:09.801
sappers as well as via Kong Holly train sappers and conventional troops that

370
00:22:10.831 --> 00:22:13.730
went in just pouring the Loin Kloss and uh,

371
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:18.660
carrying a weapon or a Satchel charge and hand grenades. And, um,

372
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:21.750
so I was at food by the hit after midnight.

373
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:25.380
There's always a discussion about what time they hit.

374
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.470
And since then we've had a, uh,

375
00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.210
military intelligence salsa came back and one of the people that we said was

376
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.590
70th as he's 16,

377
00:22:34.591 --> 00:22:39.270
but still the highest number of green berets killed in one battle in our special

378
00:22:39.271 --> 00:22:41.580
forces history. And, uh,

379
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.900
fortunately we had a recon team up on a hill on marble mountain at night that

380
00:22:45.901 --> 00:22:49.560
took out the, uh, the mortars could,

381
00:22:49.561 --> 00:22:51.370
the Amie were just dropping mortars off the mountain,

382
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.070
into the camp on top everything else

383
00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:56.240
<v 0>because they don't care about friendly fire. Speaking of friendly fire,</v>

384
00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:57.350
the enemy doesn't care. No,

385
00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.320
they don't care if they're dropping mortars on their own people as long as

386
00:23:00.321 --> 00:23:02.600
they're killing some of their enemies as well.

387
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.520
<v 3>And some of them had their bandanas and said, we came here to die. And they did.</v>

388
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:09.520
<v 0>What did that,</v>

389
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:14.470
what would the repercussions that went through your community after that

390
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:15.304
happened?

391
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.450
<v 3>Uh, everybody, you know, you,</v>

392
00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:23.490
it's one thing to talk about being a hit by an enemy force at night.

393
00:23:24.490 --> 00:23:27.400
They fight when they want to fight. That's a classic example of them doing it.

394
00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:28.840
They planned it for over a year.

395
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.490
They even came in and took over the indigenous mess hall for final briefing in

396
00:23:33.491 --> 00:23:37.300
the base that night before they launched the attack.

397
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:40.240
And so that's how well planned it was.

398
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:44.140
<v 0>So they went in to the indigenous camp,</v>

399
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.130
the friendly camp, and gave

400
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:49.910
<v 4>their final briefing for the attack inside of the friendly camp.</v>

401
00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.890
<v 3>Yup. And they had to have our loyal,</v>

402
00:23:52.891 --> 00:23:56.340
a indigenous truth that saw something suspicious. When he went up,

403
00:23:56.790 --> 00:23:59.250
the NVA killed him right away and left her body's liner.

404
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.930
And so it was really well planned. They knew to camp. Um,

405
00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:08.310
we had a promotion board. So, um, all of the,

406
00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.730
at that time there was six f o bs, one through six.

407
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.040
This was fob for Indian Ang.

408
00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.450
And so all of the people up for promotions came in that day.

409
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:22.980
Most of them stayed that night. On top of that, we had, uh,

410
00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:25.140
they had monthly command and control briefing.

411
00:24:25.141 --> 00:24:28.030
So every CEO as well as,

412
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:32.460
as as three or the XO from each of the fops was all at fob for,

413
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.290
and then the,

414
00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:39.291
we had a command and control element that was based at the Denang air base and

415
00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:40.980
they had just moved onto base,

416
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:46.140
so had increased population and they knew it and as the way they planned it and

417
00:24:46.141 --> 00:24:48.090
they planned it on a night when there's no moon.

418
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.793
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

419
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.390
<v 4>Got To uh,</v>

420
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.910
<v 3>always respect your enemy always. And then we always carried a weapon,</v>

421
00:24:57.911 --> 00:25:01.030
no matter where we went is wanting to be like fob one.

422
00:25:01.031 --> 00:25:02.410
We had a good security there,

423
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:07.210
but even then you don't know because they be a comm would come and we found um,

424
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.040
mortar markers on the roof of the clubhouse and they had come in and walked it

425
00:25:12.041 --> 00:25:16.660
out and there's part of their via condo come in and help do whatever was in

426
00:25:16.661 --> 00:25:21.370
base. But they were also there marking targets for future mortar attacks on our,

427
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:22.960
on our compound. Yeah.

428
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.150
<v 4>That would happen that my first deployment to Iraq,</v>

429
00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:27.610
I was in Baghdad and we would,

430
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.780
they would occasionally roll up guys that had their gps, you know,

431
00:25:31.781 --> 00:25:34.990
the little contractors guys that did everything from empty out the

432
00:25:34.991 --> 00:25:38.320
port-a-potties. There was guys that cut hair. These were just, you know,

433
00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:39.730
there's, there was civilians,

434
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.480
Iraqi civilians that worked on the base and occasionally they'd get rolled up,

435
00:25:43.481 --> 00:25:45.970
they'd look at their phone or look at their why, what are they carrying?

436
00:25:45.971 --> 00:25:47.470
They'd have a gps with them and sure enough,

437
00:25:47.471 --> 00:25:49.110
they're out there trying to figure out where you,

438
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.860
where's a good place to drop a mortar.

439
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:56.190
I actually like kicked all the contractors out of our compound completely.

440
00:25:57.821 --> 00:26:01.600
And that's something that I had heard from the Vietnam vets was like, nope,

441
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:04.480
you don't, you don't know who's who. You just don't let them in.

442
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:06.250
And so when I showed up,

443
00:26:06.251 --> 00:26:08.920
we actually move the port-a-potties outside of our compound.

444
00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:13.540
We had to go outside if we wanted to. They were still in Americans, uh, area,

445
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.530
but they were not inside of our compound. So they,

446
00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.700
so there was no locals inside our compound at all. Zero. That's what we,

447
00:26:21.701 --> 00:26:24.190
that's what we did when I showed up. And that's why I did it because I was,

448
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:25.570
I had heard, hey look,

449
00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.900
there's going to be people that will be gathering intelligence on you and if

450
00:26:28.901 --> 00:26:30.100
they're in the compound, you can't,

451
00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.440
you can't vet every single civilian that's going to come out there.

452
00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:36.940
The contractors scary. It is. Yeah, I was, that's,

453
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.480
that is uh, the,

454
00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:42.100
the g the chapter that you actually covered in two chapters cause it's such a

455
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:43.990
horrible, but

456
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.540
<v 3>that's an incredible read to see what those guys went through. Oh yeah.</v>

457
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.930
How many did you just go interview people? How did you get all that information?

458
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.580
Well, um, several of our guys, meth will be one where they're at at night.

459
00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:02.580
So on the 24th after, by noon time, everything has settled down.

460
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.490
They had, you know, they have failed in their attack.

461
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.580
We had controlled at camp of relief forest from fob.

462
00:27:08.581 --> 00:27:11.340
One went down led by Colonel Barr, Lieutenant Colonel Barr,

463
00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:16.620
and they went through and cleaned up any of the left palm last pockets of enemy

464
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:17.454
soldiers.

465
00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.810
And there was an appeal dubby camp right next to us and Nestle,

466
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.990
there was an effort to free that 500.

467
00:27:24.991 --> 00:27:29.790
So POW is that we're going to break loose to come in to further help over on our

468
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:34.280
base. But a couple of key people made a key uh,

469
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.550
effort along that line to the north. The Stop, the uh, the uh,

470
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.380
pending escape of the NVA there. Please don't,

471
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:48.360
I'm at a tipping point. Oh yeah. Erection. There's a bit as good as a one amiss.

472
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:50.460
So anyway, that an answer to your question,

473
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.590
we had a lot of things in my mind and then we closed fob one in January,

474
00:27:55.591 --> 00:28:00.370
went south. And so several the guys that had performed at night or survived,

475
00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:04.670
we're all there. So I talked to him, she had mental notes and then, uh,

476
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.550
when I worked on the book,

477
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:08.160
we came back and I did a piece for soldier of fortune.

478
00:28:08.161 --> 00:28:13.161
I usually wrote under a nom de Plume and we did a first story written about that

479
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.860
back in a day and a soldier fortune printer back in 80 sometime or early

480
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.410
nineties. So I use that. And then build on it.

481
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.280
And then John Peters to coauthor on that book, uh, on the ground.

482
00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:31.340
He was there at night and he was in a hooch. He and uh, Doug God,

483
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.620
Shawl SF are too drunk from that night.

484
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.270
And like many of the people that were there and uh, but the young, uh,

485
00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.700
Bill brick charged out of hooch,

486
00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.370
it was gunned down immediately cause they had machine gun, uh, positions,

487
00:28:45.371 --> 00:28:47.580
setups, anybody came out, they had gotten them down.

488
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:52.290
And that one element that was up on top of the mountain there. Yeah.

489
00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:56.430
And there was, there was one American with multiple, uh, is that right?

490
00:28:56.431 --> 00:28:59.190
There was one there. There's two, uh, ed ames was up there.

491
00:28:59.191 --> 00:29:02.940
He was the one zero and the Larry Trimble was actually the one doing a lot of

492
00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.560
the operational stuff cause uh,

493
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.430
aims was monitoring the radio and it was he,

494
00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.740
Larry and his people that took out the mortars that night or the cast

495
00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:16.020
[inaudible] would have been much higher. And then their indigenous said, hey,

496
00:29:16.021 --> 00:29:20.080
we're going back down the next day, the next day. Cause Ed Ames went out, the,

497
00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:23.490
the king became and lifted him out. They put it in replacement,

498
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.150
who sprained his ankle was something getting off the helicopters.

499
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.190
He could not move. But he, so he worked available.

500
00:29:29.530 --> 00:29:34.410
Ly was the guy taking care of everything on top. And uh, yeah.

501
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:36.690
So he did said they wanted to go down that Dan and I said, well,

502
00:29:36.691 --> 00:29:40.080
you may run into ambushes going down marble mountain,

503
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.620
because what we didn't know was underneath marble mountain, there is layers of,

504
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.140
of um, stories.

505
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:51.100
They had hospitals down there via conch training grounds, everything else,

506
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.840
which we learned about years later.

507
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.630
Right along with the Buddhist monks that rode down there, they,

508
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.110
they Kozik the peacefully. And so, uh, yeah,

509
00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:01.690
they went down and Larry for a while was by herself.

510
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.600
<v 0>Deer. Yeah. They got into a fire grave. Yeah. Those guys get a firefight.</v>

511
00:30:05.601 --> 00:30:09.380
They come back. Yeah. But when they left, he's up there by himself.

512
00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:12.500
He's just low. Hey, I got this. And he's the lone ranger.

513
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.600
Your own ranger going to defend this thing until he's dead.

514
00:30:14.601 --> 00:30:18.230
That was his attitude. That was, that's Larry freaking unbelievable. Oh yeah,

515
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:22.220
absolutely. You gotta get this book and read these, these parts. They're uh,

516
00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:29.310
they're epic, epic heroism, I mean, and crazy and,

517
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:31.940
and incredible lessons learned as well. And I know you're not,

518
00:30:31.941 --> 00:30:36.941
we're just talking about lessons learned and how easily lessons get forgotten in

519
00:30:37.011 --> 00:30:39.770
the Milton that it happens in any organization but in the military for sure.

520
00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:40.220
You know,

521
00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:43.250
cause guys are going there to command for two or three years or maybe four years

522
00:30:43.251 --> 00:30:45.980
and then they're somewhere else and then someone else comes in and different

523
00:30:45.981 --> 00:30:48.350
experiences and no one agrees on what's right and what's wrong.

524
00:30:48.351 --> 00:30:51.530
And next thing you know, you do, the lessons are gone. You forget them.

525
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:56.830
So these books right here capture some incredibly important lessons for anyone

526
00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.460
on the battlefield or even close to it. Um,

527
00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.840
I want to get down to kind of the end of your first tour here

528
00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.540
and I'm going to the book.

529
00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:13.370
When I win one April, 1969 arrived.

530
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.900
I was a conflicted man.

531
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:20.710
The end of my tour was slated for 27 April so far I'd avoided the short timers

532
00:31:20.781 --> 00:31:23.420
attitude because after all it was Vietnam.

533
00:31:23.421 --> 00:31:27.890
And we were engaged in guerrilla warfare across the fence. Nonetheless,

534
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.170
I couldn't believe I was still alive.

535
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:31.840
<v 2>Okay.</v>

536
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:36.700
<v 0>I looked forward to going back to the world and yet I felt incredibly guilty</v>

537
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:41.850
about leaving Sao hap and foc and the other men at CCN behind,

538
00:31:42.821 --> 00:31:47.821
which is CCN is what they renamed FMI 44 I believed in the SF mission,

539
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:54.610
but how long could r t Idaho go on without a casualty?

540
00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.170
We hadn't lost a man to hostel fire since May,

541
00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:03.340
1968 when the previous incarnation lost six men in Laos,

542
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:07.960
r t Idaho had run a lot of missions, been in a lot of firefights.

543
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.280
It wasn't a stay behind team that schemed to remain in camp.

544
00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.291
I was alive.

545
00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:19.291
Thanks in large part to the skills and courage of Sao hip Twan and the other

546
00:32:19.961 --> 00:32:24.700
Vietnamese team members as well as to the courage and flying skills of the

547
00:32:24.701 --> 00:32:29.590
Vietnamese king bee pilots and the American pilots, the Marines and Scarface,

548
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.510
the judge and the executioner as well as TAC air pilots who always responded to

549
00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:35.500
our calls for help.

550
00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:40.910
We were alive because the recon gods at smiled on the reassembled r t, Idaho.

551
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:46.610
Somehow the magical elixir of trust, training, instinct,

552
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:50.870
guts, timing, and God's good grace had fallen into place.

553
00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:55.010
There were other things that were collectively wearing on me.

554
00:32:55.011 --> 00:32:59.090
Toward the end of my first tour of duty by April,

555
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.750
1969 both Lynn black and I were frustrated with having enemy soldiers shooting

556
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:07.751
us out of so many targets as the helicopters approached LZs for landing and when

557
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:09.470
we weren't in the field,

558
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:13.610
we found rt Idaho getting frequently assigned to guard duty,

559
00:33:13.611 --> 00:33:18.110
a top marble mountain because black and I had continually butted heads with the

560
00:33:18.111 --> 00:33:21.230
ramps to add insult to injury.

561
00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:25.820
There conveniently were never any choppers available to air lift us to the top.

562
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.550
We had to hump all of our supplies ourselves,

563
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:32.540
which was still a dicey business in the light of all the VC activity in the

564
00:33:32.541 --> 00:33:36.980
village to the south of the mountain and the in the caves. Deep inside it.

565
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.740
We always moved up marble mountain on full alert.

566
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:45.350
One on one such trip sal was training hung to run point hung earned his pay that

567
00:33:46.431 --> 00:33:50.210
day as he found and deactivated more than a dozen booby traps,

568
00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:54.920
including a claymore mine that had a pressure released firing device on it.

569
00:33:56.090 --> 00:34:00.740
So you're sort of downtime like, hey,

570
00:34:00.741 --> 00:34:03.470
we're back in camp. We're just going to pull a little easy duty here.

571
00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:06.620
Just stand some guard duty. Oh, we got to go up to marble mountain. Oh,

572
00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.290
there's no one to take us up there, so we're going to have to patrol up there.

573
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.740
And you're going up there and you find on your way up there more than a dozen

574
00:34:12.741 --> 00:34:16.010
movie trece Oh yeah. That's trying to get to your guard duty.

575
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.540
Yeah. I guess that could wear on you a little bit

576
00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:24.480
<v 3>that that was significant day. We didn't sleep well that night.</v>

577
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:28.260
And so this marble mountain, how long was the patrol to get there from base?

578
00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.840
Well, it's close by and uh, we,

579
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:35.730
we would usually walk around to the south side of the mountain and there were

580
00:34:35.731 --> 00:34:38.970
stairs that you go up before you get to the, uh,

581
00:34:39.570 --> 00:34:43.920
trails cause it was so steep to get to the top that there's only certain number

582
00:34:43.921 --> 00:34:48.450
of ways you could walk up. And uh, we, you know,

583
00:34:48.451 --> 00:34:50.040
you always try to alter how you go,

584
00:34:50.041 --> 00:34:54.300
but there's only so many times you can alter it. And so that data way we went,

585
00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:58.850
so a sal and hung really earned their pay. I mean, he and they, they followed,

586
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.870
he stamps, but that had been me,

587
00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.380
now Lynn's Lin was a little bit more sharp and keen eyed to me,

588
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.350
but that had been me, I would've been hamburger meat on that first claymore.

589
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:13.690
<v 0>And so that stuff, like I said, it's wearing on you.</v>

590
00:35:13.691 --> 00:35:16.660
Obviously it would wear on anyone, but that's the end of your tour.

591
00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:20.500
You get done with that tour. And we touched on this a little bit on,

592
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.790
on the last time, but I wanted to go a little bit deeper on you.

593
00:35:24.791 --> 00:35:29.680
You're coming back to America after your first tour in Vietnam, how old are you?

594
00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.860
Uh, let's see. 69, 23, 23 years old. And when you get back,

595
00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:38.070
again touched on this a little bit,

596
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.510
<v 4>but they assign you, they assign you to, um, like, uh,</v>

597
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:44.430
a signal cut signal company.

598
00:35:44.431 --> 00:35:49.431
Meaning you're not an operational guy and you're in with some and you're just

599
00:35:50.011 --> 00:35:53.520
coming out of Vietnam and you're, you're, you're hearing people are saying like,

600
00:35:53.521 --> 00:35:55.500
Hey, what do you, you know, was it even,

601
00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.780
was it even there's guys that are of actively Avoiding v going to Vietnam?

602
00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:04.320
<v 3>Oh yeah. This is the 10th Special Forces Group. And, uh,</v>

603
00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.840
they had been in Germany since 52 and they had,

604
00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:11.530
they were actively involved in a Cold War and those guys earned their pay.

605
00:36:11.830 --> 00:36:15.520
Their, uh, in fact, one of the first books just came out on debt a,

606
00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.700
which was there in a cold war. Um,

607
00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.610
but this is a special forces unit.

608
00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:26.970
So companies a through d were active e because of my Mos Camo.

609
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:32.560
Oh, cause you're radium. Radiomen that's a great a man. They stuck me there.

610
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.970
And, uh,

611
00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:38.290
we had four or five platoons and there are new officers,

612
00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.540
their butter bars, like right out of ocs,

613
00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:45.880
they're young and they treated everybody like was basic training.

614
00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:50.230
And my first thing was, excuse me, this is an SF unit, even though it's signal.

615
00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:51.460
And so we had

616
00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:56.220
<v 4>signal the officers inside that platoon, they're not,</v>

617
00:36:56.221 --> 00:36:59.580
they're not SF guys, they're like communications officers.

618
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.230
<v 3>You know what? I'm not even sure.</v>

619
00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:04.320
I just know they're young and dumb and not respected.

620
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.630
And then we had the power to other platoon swords.

621
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:11.400
Each one was fat now to shape and had avoided going to Vietnam and was proud of

622
00:37:11.401 --> 00:37:16.401
it and made fun of me and a couple of guys from d company because we weren't

623
00:37:16.891 --> 00:37:20.280
smart enough to figure how to get out of going to numb. I'm going like,

624
00:37:20.281 --> 00:37:21.810
wait a minute, what are you wearing on your head?

625
00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:27.150
And so we had some difficult moments dealing with those guys and ma.

626
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.540
And so we had routine training as civil company,

627
00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:33.790
wood trucks and all this stuff to go and do these things. I said,

628
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:37.740
whenever we do one of these little practice runs for a weekend or a mission,

629
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:39.930
we will, when could,

630
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:42.930
we're going to get outta here and let everybody else do the KP and stuff.

631
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:45.270
And that just pissed everybody off auto more.

632
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:50.550
I pushed our young guys and pushed them hard in base. We did duties,

633
00:37:50.551 --> 00:37:52.380
training, missions, you're out there three or four days.

634
00:37:52.381 --> 00:37:56.730
All this is just Camo and uh, but the way we did it,

635
00:37:56.790 --> 00:38:01.080
I can't even tell you the details now cause I just hated it. But we won.

636
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.710
We were the first ones back to the base. We had the most single contact,

637
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.190
all the criteria and we met and we beat the fat rents.

638
00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:14.850
<v 4>Now a n. N so you're back. Where, where,</v>

639
00:38:14.851 --> 00:38:17.130
where were you stationed at that point? Devons Massachusetts.

640
00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:18.960
So then you've got gotta. I mean,

641
00:38:18.961 --> 00:38:21.360
if some people that weren't ever in the military don't realize this,

642
00:38:21.361 --> 00:38:23.460
but even when you're in the military, when you're back in America,

643
00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.730
you go and interact with normal civilian. You know, you go to restaurants,

644
00:38:26.731 --> 00:38:29.940
you go to bars, you, you live a normal life except for your job. You know,

645
00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:34.920
whenever the hours you've got to work your job, then your living, how was that

646
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:40.120
<v 0>like now you're just going out for a pizza on a Thursday night,</v>

647
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:43.630
now you're going out to have some beers on a Friday night or a Saturday night.

648
00:38:43.631 --> 00:38:44.740
How was that transition?

649
00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.900
<v 3>Um, it was difficult because actually we didn't transition,</v>

650
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.960
basically hung out mostly with the SF guys up there because there's

651
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:58.630
Massachusetts, didn't know much about the small towns and um, I bought a four,

652
00:38:58.850 --> 00:38:59.880
four, two w 30.

653
00:38:59.881 --> 00:39:04.750
I had to get a job just to pump gas on weekends just to get actually cas and

654
00:39:04.751 --> 00:39:08.200
hopefully be able to pay for the insurance. Did you buy it brand new? No.

655
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:12.340
Used even used. Oh yeah. That thing was expensive, Huh? Oh, it could go.

656
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:16.720
I blew it up on the turnpike at a 130 miles an hour. But uh,

657
00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:20.150
it was a great car in between. And uh,

658
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:24.940
so I'm working and you know, what was your, what was your side job? Oh,

659
00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:26.123
pumping gas.

660
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:30.010
They had local shell station at one of the little towns outside of Fort Devins

661
00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.180
and the guy was a, um,

662
00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:35.770
he was a World War II vet and he had put up a sign,

663
00:39:35.771 --> 00:39:39.590
I bought gas and there's a sign help Juan. I say, Hey, I need cas.

664
00:39:39.591 --> 00:39:43.180
Can I work for you on weekends or if I get a day off, he said, yeah, come on in.

665
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:47.620
So I was highly trained, I could do oil changes, I could grease him up.

666
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.620
And uh, it was fun. And uh,

667
00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.870
<v 0>you were Greenbrae special forces.</v>

668
00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.720
Vietnam just got done with your first tour

669
00:39:58.490 --> 00:40:02.780
and you're pumping gas on the weekends. That had to be a little bit of a,

670
00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.470
of like a tough thing to swallow.

671
00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:11.100
<v 3>It was, but you know, we swallowed it cause that's like I got to survive.</v>

672
00:40:11.101 --> 00:40:12.150
And at the time I was just,

673
00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:17.570
I still had a sweet thing down south and so she was dealing some issues,

674
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.960
um, up there, this whole thing's falling apart. And Boston,

675
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:27.210
Boston was so anti military. I mean it was just peace freaks Galore.

676
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.260
I went to town twice now, I never went back because it was,

677
00:40:31.261 --> 00:40:33.960
they could tell that we were in the military cause our hair was still shorter

678
00:40:33.961 --> 00:40:37.080
than the average hippie in Boston. Not a good time.

679
00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:40.050
So we just stayed with our guys. Um,

680
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:45.150
Durbars we had a few engagements in the bars, but uh, yeah,

681
00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:46.110
I was glad to get out of there.

682
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:48.680
<v 0>And you ended up getting in trouble for some of those engagements as far as we</v>

683
00:40:48.681 --> 00:40:48.980
did.

684
00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:53.450
I'm told that the NPS came by cleared based the day before they got there and

685
00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:57.500
uh, I can, that's all I know. Taking the fifth amendment on that one.

686
00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:00.920
This is the SOG operation that will remain secret. Indeed.

687
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:05.390
So you are a little bit on the lamb, you were a little bit on the run. Yes.

688
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:08.840
And so you run to, uh,

689
00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.620
to your, to this woman in d c is that where she is?

690
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.790
<v 3>Oh yeah. At the Pentagon there was a woman in charge,</v>

691
00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:18.240
SF orders for Southeast Asia. Her name is Billy Alexander.

692
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:21.000
She's one of our saints, patron saints.

693
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.750
<v 0>There was, there was a woman that,</v>

694
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:27.870
that ran the officers that detailed the officers in the seal teams for a long,

695
00:41:28.271 --> 00:41:32.260
long time. I want to say she did it for 40 something years and yeah,

696
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:34.460
I mean it's the exact thing like if you,

697
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.080
if you knew her and she was always great to me and I mean she was very nice to

698
00:41:39.081 --> 00:41:42.350
me and she took great care of me probably because I was just lucky enough to

699
00:41:42.351 --> 00:41:45.290
have some senior people that knew me and you know, put in a good word.

700
00:41:45.291 --> 00:41:46.700
But she was always very nice to me.

701
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:51.330
But I saw what happened to some guys that maybe she didn't like so much or it

702
00:41:51.331 --> 00:41:54.170
was rough. So it sounds like, you know,

703
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.970
you showed up with some flowers or bottle one she liked and you went,

704
00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:02.150
this is independent in the puzzle. Pallets at the Pentagon. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

705
00:42:02.151 --> 00:42:06.020
Same thing. Yeah. Same thing. Yeah. This, no this won't. And like I said,

706
00:42:06.021 --> 00:42:10.610
this woman was always super nice but she, she wielded a lot of power, you know,

707
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.000
in, inside, inside the seal officer community. Wow.

708
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.270
Cause if she didn't like you, well she was right in your orders.

709
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:19.460
And if she liked you, then you know, and was like, you know,

710
00:42:19.461 --> 00:42:22.310
let a few more neutral than what, you know, she gonna do what she's gonna do.

711
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:26.000
But yeah, it sounded like Mrs, uh, Billy Alexander was, uh,

712
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.400
the same type of thing. Oh, he drove down all night,

713
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:30.950
got dairy right in the morning at Pentagon open, walked in.

714
00:42:30.951 --> 00:42:35.000
This is before any metal detectors. Walked in and asked the guy where she was,

715
00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:37.760
went down, gave it a one to flowers, please give me orders.

716
00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.730
Came back at the end of the day, drove back all night.

717
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.490
How many people were just going all the way to the Pentagon to try and get

718
00:42:43.491 --> 00:42:48.320
orders back to Vietnam? Oh, not many. I'm told. Not many,

719
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:49.281
but there were some,

720
00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:52.520
there were all the SF guys that really felt more comfortable and they want it to

721
00:42:52.521 --> 00:42:55.550
be there. And there's, there's a, I wish I could line up the stories,

722
00:42:55.551 --> 00:42:59.270
but there's like Billy Wall and others that have gone to her over the years and

723
00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:03.470
um, gotten their assignments they wanted, she took care of SF. Yeah, that's, I,

724
00:43:03.471 --> 00:43:07.160
I've, I told this story the other day. I was kind of, there's an, there's,

725
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:11.690
so there's that woman who's the civilian that handles the detailing,

726
00:43:11.691 --> 00:43:12.980
but then there's a, there's a,

727
00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.840
a seal officer that would kind of work with her side by side.

728
00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.180
He would get rotated out every couple of years. Well, when nine 11 happened,

729
00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:24.110
I knew that guy and he was, he was a guy that I had worked for.

730
00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:26.840
He was an officer and he was a great guy and I had a lot of respect for him and

731
00:43:26.841 --> 00:43:30.110
we got along very well. And as soon as nine 11 happened, I called him and said,

732
00:43:30.111 --> 00:43:32.310
hey, you know, I was going to college at the time. I said, cert,

733
00:43:32.311 --> 00:43:34.940
please get me into college. Send me back to going back to a team right now.

734
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:38.810
I don't need to college, I'll finish it online or whatever. I said,

735
00:43:38.811 --> 00:43:42.140
just please get me back to a team. And you know, he said, listen,

736
00:43:42.141 --> 00:43:43.190
this war's going to last a long time.

737
00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.360
But I was having a conversation with him a few months ago with him and his wife

738
00:43:47.361 --> 00:43:48.960
actually. And I was saying, Oh yeah, no,

739
00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:52.010
remember when I called you and I asked you to please send me? And he said,

740
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:55.260
he said everyone called him. And,

741
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:58.610
and it made me feel like that's pretty awesome. Like it wasn't like, you know,

742
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.790
I guess in my mind I didn't think I was special, but in my mind I thought,

743
00:44:01.791 --> 00:44:05.720
you know, I really wanted to go. So did everybody else, every other seal that,

744
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:10.040
that Wa that wasn't in the Atta seal team. Everyone wanted to go when,

745
00:44:10.041 --> 00:44:13.490
when the war happened every wanting to go do their part Esprit de Corps. Yeah,

746
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.100
absolutely. And uh, he was right.

747
00:44:16.101 --> 00:44:18.170
The war lasted a lot longer than any of us thought it would.

748
00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:23.640
So you get your orders back to Vietnam, you're,

749
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:27.260
what'd you do with the car? Well, but, uh, I had to get rid of four, four,

750
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:31.980
two traded in and got a little fat, five three speed on the, this is

751
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.710
<v 3>survival vehicle, right? Yeah. And so, uh,</v>

752
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.950
so I just parked at and dad took care of it while I was gone and, um,

753
00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:44.810
um, so I went back to, went home and said, hey, I'm going back to nom.

754
00:44:44.811 --> 00:44:48.060
I had no leave time cause I burned it all up previously.

755
00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:53.410
And so went home and broke my mom's heart and told dad, gone gone back to my,

756
00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.040
my sister ran me to the airport the next day and then, uh,

757
00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:02.040
back to head and back to Vietnam. Yeah. Your mom must have been,

758
00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:06.000
where'd your dad think? Uh, well, you know, dad was a,

759
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.900
I'll support your son and he was, to his credit, he never,

760
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:14.160
he never had an opinion, never asked him for an opinion because he had a,

761
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.880
he had deferment during the war family deferment cause he had to run the family

762
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:18.714
business.

763
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:23.550
And then my uncle flew over the hump so we had family service and um,

764
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:27.510
but he says, good luck if you need anything. Let us know.

765
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.690
And a mom was just like, she's a little bit more emotional,

766
00:45:30.691 --> 00:45:34.680
but a tough old farm girl from Central Jersey, the Dutch farm girl, you know

767
00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.430
<v 0>Eddie. And even, even then,</v>

768
00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.950
did they know anything about what your last appointment was like?

769
00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.490
<v 3>No. No, we never talked about it. Just glad you're home. Yup.</v>

770
00:45:43.491 --> 00:45:46.580
Glad to be home. Where they had no idea what kind of,

771
00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:50.630
what kind of situations you had been in. No, we really couldn't talk about it.

772
00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:55.790
And I'm like, uh, I'll, if I missed it, you for not on air. But you know,

773
00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:59.300
many years later my dad came up to me and say, you know,

774
00:45:59.301 --> 00:46:01.220
I finally read across the fence and it says,

775
00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:05.570
now I know why this guy came by and took our trash.

776
00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:09.620
So he said, yeah. So they got the north guys, a tall black guy.

777
00:46:09.621 --> 00:46:11.600
He come by and pick up our trash.

778
00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:16.280
So he had to be from the FBI because they're checking my trash to see if I wrote

779
00:46:16.281 --> 00:46:19.340
anything that is a violation of the, uh,

780
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:23.450
the agreement to be signed in Denang the 20 year agreement.

781
00:46:23.451 --> 00:46:26.480
You won't talk about it, won't write about it. And they checked you on here.

782
00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.660
So Dad and they, this guy picked up the transport at once.

783
00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:32.250
Could Dad recognized her? He saw him down at the,

784
00:46:32.251 --> 00:46:35.780
a postal office was near the FBI office. So he figured, oh,

785
00:46:35.781 --> 00:46:37.370
the FBI guys check it on my Johnny.

786
00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:43.240
<v 0>Yeah, that's a sidebar. Yeah, no, that's,</v>

787
00:46:43.241 --> 00:46:47.830
that's, that's kinda crazy that they're putting all that effort to do that. And,

788
00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:53.140
and yet you there, you're out pumping gas.

789
00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:58.150
That's crazy to me. Yeah. Yeah. I gave a great Lou job though, buddy.

790
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:01.900
You came, you could even drop the grease. You need it. That's, yeah.

791
00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:05.230
That's awesome. Yeah, that's crazy. You know, like,

792
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:11.050
that's uh, I guess when I'm older now, like, you know, when I was a kid,

793
00:47:11.051 --> 00:47:14.020
I worked at fast food restaurants, you know what I mean? I can, and now I think,

794
00:47:14.021 --> 00:47:16.180
man, I would not want to do that right now.

795
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:19.520
<v 3>No. The funny thing was I had a little 25, like the Little Brownie,</v>

796
00:47:19.521 --> 00:47:21.980
25 boys carrying my pocket. This is Boston.

797
00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.760
There's still some people that were like less than friendly up there. I said,

798
00:47:25.761 --> 00:47:30.120
I hope I get robbed. I just want to kill them. You're a robber. But

799
00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:35.890
<v 0>Nah, it didn't happen. So what did happen? We got you back to Vietnam. Indeed.</v>

800
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:40.210
So you get back to Vietnam. Going back to the book here,

801
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:41.710
the casualty rates for SOG,

802
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:44.860
recon teams were the highest for any unit in Vietnam.

803
00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:50.700
We all had our close calls and thus each of us was given ample opportunity for

804
00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:54.240
the truth of this observation to be in sized on his soul

805
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.100
non perhaps.

806
00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:02.100
So more so than the young hard charging one zero of rt Michigan Sergeant Elden

807
00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.060
Bardwell.

808
00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:06.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

809
00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:10.310
<v 0>No one who ever met him doubted his professionalism or determination.</v>

810
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:14.750
He was not only meticulous when preparing his team for a mission and a fearless

811
00:48:14.751 --> 00:48:15.710
leader went on the ground.

812
00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:21.040
But he also possessed a biting wit and an absolute intolerance when it came to

813
00:48:21.801 --> 00:48:23.720
fools and ramps,

814
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:28.400
fools and ramps being a redundancy and his way of thinking.

815
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.930
So this was interesting cause you, you, you talk about bars.

816
00:48:34.931 --> 00:48:39.020
Well and in the story that you tell he they're,

817
00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:43.700
they're out in an op and he finds a Avastin AK 47 vest and he wants it and he

818
00:48:43.701 --> 00:48:46.580
wants the AK. These just found them laying around in a bunker or something.

819
00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.220
So he puts on the vast and he gives the AK to one of his,

820
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:54.110
one of his [inaudible] guys and, and then he ends up getting shot in the chest.

821
00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:56.040
And that, that uh,

822
00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:59.870
vest actually saved his life cause it hit one of the magazines that was in the

823
00:48:59.871 --> 00:49:03.500
vest. Correct. Crazy story. And what was interesting, so when I was in,

824
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:09.130
I was in Germany in 1998 I was stationed at naval special warfare unit two just

825
00:49:11.781 --> 00:49:15.230
outside of Stuttgart. And My boss,

826
00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:18.410
who is the commander of Naval Special Warfare Unit two,

827
00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:23.510
he obviously directed to the guy that was in charge of Special Operations

828
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:26.930
Command Europe. And My boss, who I had a ton of respect for,

829
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:30.590
he's an incredible guy, a great guy, and taught me a ton.

830
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:35.960
He would tell me, hey, the, this, the use of soc commander, this guy,

831
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:39.200
he's awesome. His name is bars. Well, you would tell me stories about him.

832
00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:44.300
He just absolutely loved the Bardwell and talked about him with the highest

833
00:49:44.301 --> 00:49:49.220
respect possible. And, and he was, it was awesome. And I mean,

834
00:49:49.221 --> 00:49:50.720
I knew about bars. Well,

835
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:54.020
I mean I basically learned about him initially from him. That's amazing.

836
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.060
Then it later on. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

837
00:49:56.061 --> 00:49:59.410
I would read about him small world and what, uh, what, uh, you know, a,

838
00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:03.320
a great guy. He was and what an epic soldier he was and what a great example.

839
00:50:03.321 --> 00:50:05.030
And you know, so many people say he's the,

840
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:08.420
like one of the foremost examples of how you'd want to be as a soldier.

841
00:50:08.421 --> 00:50:09.260
Just a great guy.

842
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:12.770
And I was lucky enough to have a little degree of connection too,

843
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.370
to have my boss work for him when, and he must've been,

844
00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:17.940
he must've been a two star at the time.

845
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:21.850
I think it was a two star ballot at the time. So there he was. And He,

846
00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:25.550
I think he did 40 something years, almost 40. Yeah. Couple of months shy.

847
00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:30.770
Yeah. So that's pretty awesome to, to, uh,

848
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.520
to read about bars. Well. Oh yeah. Um,

849
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:39.440
you get to this point here where you're, you're talking about how crazy.

850
00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:43.580
And I often try and explain how in combat unexpected things happen.

851
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.230
The things that you see, you can't make it up. Things happen are so crazy.

852
00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.110
And you've got a section in here where you're talking about Lynn Black,

853
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:55.190
who's your running mate for a while? For a long time. Yeah.

854
00:50:55.191 --> 00:50:59.120
Then when I left he took over the team and he ran it and when I came back I went

855
00:50:59.121 --> 00:51:00.500
on a team. Then he,

856
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:04.700
we brought it up to speed with what the EO had changed in five months. Yeah.

857
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:06.680
And then we took turns and then they said, hey,

858
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:08.100
you guys got too much experience.

859
00:51:08.101 --> 00:51:12.500
So Lynn went to did some more snoop and pooping and I took over Idaho again.

860
00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:16.430
And, and this is when he's solo on the ground or you're not there.

861
00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:21.410
He's not solo, but he's with his team. He's in Laos and they're on patrol.

862
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:23.960
They're deep in enemy territory, which is just like,

863
00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.190
just the way you guys rolled. And He, you know,

864
00:51:28.191 --> 00:51:29.930
the team starts to hear people following them.

865
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:33.260
And now they start stepping up their pace. They're trying to move,

866
00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:36.560
they're trying to do things to disguise their trail and all that,

867
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:39.920
and finally they really like, okay,

868
00:51:39.921 --> 00:51:42.230
we're definitely getting followed if the two days. Yeah,

869
00:51:42.231 --> 00:51:44.570
after two days of being followed. Yeah, and so here we go.

870
00:51:44.571 --> 00:51:45.770
Going back to the book, however,

871
00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:50.420
before black could give the word to change course, the noises suddenly returned.

872
00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.290
Only now it sounded as though a large number of enemy soldiers was headed

873
00:51:54.291 --> 00:51:57.350
straight for them and the troops were not in the least trying to hide their

874
00:51:57.351 --> 00:51:59.780
movement. This is it fought black.

875
00:51:59.781 --> 00:52:02.900
The trackers have linked with reinforcements and they're about to try and

876
00:52:02.930 --> 00:52:07.130
overrun us. He immediately told the team to head for the ridge form,

877
00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:09.440
align and get ready for a fight.

878
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:13.970
Claymore mines were putting a quickly into place and black dug out the radio

879
00:52:13.971 --> 00:52:18.971
handset in intact in anticipation of calling Covey black was totally convinced

880
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:22.370
he would soon be declaring a prairie fire emergency.

881
00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:27.590
Back when black was with rt, Alabama, he had faced a matte.

882
00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:31.070
He'd faced massive frontal assault waves by determined and VA,

883
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:34.670
so he knew what to expect and he knew what needed to be done.

884
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:37.400
Having moved the team up onto the ridge line,

885
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:42.080
he knew he had the tactical advantage. If the enemy wanted a bloody fight,

886
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:46.520
and it certainly sounded as though they did, the NBA could charge uphill and rt,

887
00:52:46.521 --> 00:52:47.840
Idaho would give it to them.

888
00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.940
Everyone had placed their weapons on full automatic and be gun and unbending the

889
00:52:52.941 --> 00:52:54.740
metal pins on their hand grenades.

890
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.430
The ends were bent in order to keep the pins from accidentally being pulled to

891
00:52:58.431 --> 00:53:01.940
the ring and hang up on a branch or something else.

892
00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:06.080
High explosive rounds in the m 79 were replaced with rounds containing large

893
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.460
buckshot capable of blasting a devastating hole in any in the enemies ranks.

894
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:12.980
With everything in place and ready.

895
00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:17.090
Our t Idaho faced the jungle and waited for whatever was coming.

896
00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.630
The Frenchman called sight of something approaching,

897
00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.260
but the vegetation was such that he couldn't get a clean shot at it.

898
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:27.870
He figured it was someone moving in a crouch because it only stood about four

899
00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:28.710
feet off the ground.

900
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:33.980
He could see other similarly poised figures behind it all moving noisily toward

901
00:53:34.201 --> 00:53:36.390
the team and a few more feet,

902
00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:40.230
they would reach a point where the jungle thinned out and he'd figured he'd have

903
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:41.064
a good shot at them.

904
00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:46.590
Like any recon man latour know had fought about such a moment.

905
00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:50.760
The moment when an outnumbered team was forced to make a stand.

906
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.200
Thus like all the other rt Idaho members,

907
00:53:55.380 --> 00:54:00.090
he was very tense but ready for anything, anything that is,

908
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:03.810
but what stepped into the clearing. He couldn't believe his eyes.

909
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:05.760
He found himself staring,

910
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:10.940
not an oriental gentleman in pith helmets armed with AK 47 but long armed hairy

911
00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:16.980
reddish orange creatures with the decidedly human features.

912
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:20.370
It was a small band of Orangutans, probably a family of them.

913
00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:23.250
They had been tracking the team out of natural curiosity,

914
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.300
trying to figure out what these hairless apes were up to in their territory.

915
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:35.100
Yeah, that's probably the happiest monkeys they ever saw.

916
00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:39.240
Oh yeah, for sure.

917
00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:45.760
I was in Sri Lanka and we got to see that, um, they, they uh,

918
00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:49.200
you would hear them coming and they would be moving through the trees and it was

919
00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:52.110
really cool. Uh, just, just how, but they, yeah,

920
00:54:52.111 --> 00:54:54.870
you'd hear all this noise and it'd be a bunch of monkeys coming through the

921
00:54:54.871 --> 00:54:59.010
trees and though we had that surround war. Yeah, we got online,

922
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:02.010
we were ready for the assault and just like we got overwhelmed by monkeys.

923
00:55:05.420 --> 00:55:07.680
All right. Now we're getting to the point where you, so that was,

924
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.290
that was a Lynn black working on his own and now we're getting,

925
00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:14.400
when you returned, when I returned to CCN at the end of October, 1969,

926
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:18.870
I immediately reported to sergeant major John Hobbes and asked if I could rejoin

927
00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:20.143
Archie, Idaho.

928
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:24.870
He said that Latino had just completed his tour and returned state side.

929
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.180
There was an opening for an American and I could fill it,

930
00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:33.170
but linen black jr is still the one zero and you two are both experienced one

931
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.100
zeroes.

932
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.950
I reminded him that I'd been away for five months and needed some time to get

933
00:55:37.951 --> 00:55:39.810
back into the flow of things I added.

934
00:55:39.811 --> 00:55:43.740
I'd be happy to serve as blacks one one for awhile because I respected his

935
00:55:43.741 --> 00:55:48.360
judgment as I have poured. Now you go and meet with the team. As I approached,

936
00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:51.390
I saw black and sal leading the team away from the range.

937
00:55:51.391 --> 00:55:52.650
Once they caught sight of me,

938
00:55:52.651 --> 00:55:56.070
their faces lit up and there was a rush of feelings of greetings.

939
00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.830
As I shook black's hands, hand,

940
00:55:58.831 --> 00:56:02.880
the team surrounded us dancing about almost like children and the good nature

941
00:56:02.881 --> 00:56:05.910
taunts instantly begin flowing hot and heavy.

942
00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:11.600
The gross insult being one of the most accepted ways a recon man can show

943
00:56:11.641 --> 00:56:16.560
affection. I was subjected to a whole litany of them aimed at everything from my

944
00:56:16.561 --> 00:56:20.970
intelligence to my sexual orientation in the midst of it all black.

945
00:56:20.971 --> 00:56:24.550
Totally cool. As usual, asked if I was back on the team. Yes, Sergeant.

946
00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:27.670
I replied. I am reporting for duty. I am a new one.

947
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:30.160
One I know more about the team,

948
00:56:30.161 --> 00:56:33.760
the AAO and the bullshit in camp. Oh sorry.

949
00:56:33.761 --> 00:56:38.440
You know more about the team, the AOE and the bullshit here in camp than I do.

950
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:41.410
I want, I want a black to understand.

951
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:45.160
I was willingly putting myself under his command and that my goal was not to

952
00:56:45.161 --> 00:56:46.900
challenge him, but to learn from him.

953
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:51.930
A recon man who thinks he knows it all is a recon man headed for trouble.

954
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:54.430
And if I could capture those,

955
00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:59.460
that attitude right there and distill it among every person that's moving into a

956
00:57:00.011 --> 00:57:03.670
leadership position like this, the humility that you show here,

957
00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:08.880
the willingness to subordinate your own ego is like the best sign of a great

958
00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:12.190
leader. When you check into a situation, you go, Oh, you know what?

959
00:57:12.191 --> 00:57:13.930
I don't know everything. And by the way,

960
00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:17.260
if I think I know everything I'm wrong and oh there's someone that's been here

961
00:57:17.261 --> 00:57:20.260
for a while, guess what? Cool. I got no problem working for you.

962
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:23.140
I'm here to support. I'm here to, I'm here to look out for the team.

963
00:57:23.141 --> 00:57:24.340
I'm here to help the team win,

964
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.210
not here to look out for my own little agenda.

965
00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:29.770
So that was awesome.

966
00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:33.440
<v 3>And that's been black. He's just an amazing man. And um,</v>

967
00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:36.750
so I totally respect him and was glad that it worked out.

968
00:57:36.751 --> 00:57:40.350
Thanks to Billy Alexander or as your cut get over there pretty quick.

969
00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:43.020
And I'm with Lynn, you know,

970
00:57:43.021 --> 00:57:46.830
he had done a tour duty with the one 73rd, and his,

971
00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:50.970
he lost a brother there and he still came back cause he wanted to get his fair

972
00:57:50.971 --> 00:57:55.410
share of an NBA dead just to take some personal revenge.

973
00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.720
And uh, you know,

974
00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:02.460
we had that mission where he came up against a 10,000 and survived Mason's

975
00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:07.710
mother one of our amazing heroes. And um, so yeah, I respected him and then uh,

976
00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:11.430
later on we began, there's no sop and the sergeant major Hobbes,

977
00:58:11.431 --> 00:58:12.630
he asked us to do an sop.

978
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:16.030
<v 0>Yeah, that sounded like a,</v>

979
00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:20.110
that's something that we needed to start doing the seal teams to you.

980
00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:23.050
There's another, here's another section in here where you start talking about,

981
00:58:23.051 --> 00:58:23.820
well,

982
00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.260
it appeared to me and we were actually talking about this before we started

983
00:58:26.261 --> 00:58:29.880
recording and that's when you go to meet the new commander and here we go back

984
00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:32.290
the book because I hadn't met the seat CN commander.

985
00:58:32.291 --> 00:58:35.770
I Polish my jump boots to spit shine hoping they might make a positive

986
00:58:35.771 --> 00:58:39.100
impression. When I met him later that afternoon, the call came down to meet him.

987
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:42.790
I put on the last pair of starched fatigues I had in my possession,

988
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:47.530
put on my new green baret and the spit shine to boots. So there you go.

989
00:58:47.531 --> 00:58:49.270
You're getting squared away and again,

990
00:58:49.271 --> 00:58:52.480
this is one of those things where you're in your second tour of Vietnam.

991
00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:56.710
You know you're an SF guy, you've been in all kinds of really tough situations,

992
00:58:56.711 --> 00:59:00.010
but you're going to meet the commander. Okay, cool. Be Humble, get squared away,

993
00:59:00.011 --> 00:59:01.570
uniform on, try and make a good impression.

994
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:07.660
The commander of CCN made it a point to say that he ordered recon teams to break

995
00:59:07.661 --> 00:59:09.850
contact with enemy forces and continue the mission.

996
00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:15.010
I knew that several other recon teams had been unsuccessful in getting the

997
00:59:15.011 --> 00:59:18.910
tanker. So this guy's a tanker. This guy was a tanker. He, I don't know.

998
00:59:18.911 --> 00:59:19.300
What do you want?

999
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:22.160
You want to give us a little briefing on what that new commander was like?

1000
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:23.730
<v 3>Um, yeah,</v>

1001
00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:28.230
he was assigned Nair and he was a friend of general crate neighbors who was the

1002
00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:33.060
overall commander. Abrams had seceded, Westmoreland [inaudible] as the, as the,

1003
00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:38.070
uh, top commanding officer for all of Vietnam as he was one of his buddies.

1004
00:59:38.490 --> 00:59:42.460
And so an order to build up his career, uh,

1005
00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:47.370
apron sent him to an NSF unit. So He'd get built up his metals, get to time.

1006
00:59:47.730 --> 00:59:49.380
And at that time in the army,

1007
00:59:49.860 --> 00:59:52.980
if you served as special forces for anything much longer than six months as an

1008
00:59:52.981 --> 00:59:54.300
officer, your career was done.

1009
00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:58.230
You would not get to promotion as the West pointers and the other guys that we

1010
00:59:58.231 --> 01:00:00.390
get your, your career was just finished.

1011
01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:04.080
But if you had a certain amount of time, and he came up there, uh,

1012
01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:07.950
which we learned later was to, uh, build his metal portfolio.

1013
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:10.260
And we have some other stories that go on later on.

1014
01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:15.590
So he never really adjusted nor did he apparently understand SF and the way we

1015
01:00:17.371 --> 01:00:21.720
worked, particularly on a recon teams and whole thing about uh,

1016
01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:26.780
break contact and team mission while Sir if you're with me on the ground and you

1017
01:00:26.911 --> 01:00:28.650
want to say that, that's cool.

1018
01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:32.130
But if you're up there 5,000 feet and telling me to break contact a team

1019
01:00:32.330 --> 01:00:33.630
mission, what a six man recon team,

1020
01:00:33.631 --> 01:00:38.631
we got 10,000 guys wanted a party now but I will can't quite say it that way

1021
01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.150
till you go into extreme PC mode. Yeah.

1022
01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:47.160
And you were just meeting each other too. It's like I heard he was uh, uh,

1023
01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.550
he was lacking compared to his previous commander we had there.

1024
01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:53.220
<v 0>Yeah. And the, the idea, you know,</v>

1025
01:00:53.221 --> 01:00:55.680
I think its patent said the commander in the field is always right,

1026
01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.830
which is a great thing to lean towards from your perspective.

1027
01:00:58.831 --> 01:01:02.220
When you're up at 5,000 feet or back in Attack Gull operation center,

1028
01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:05.100
you kind of assume that your guy in the field is making the right call and try

1029
01:01:05.101 --> 01:01:05.934
and support them.

1030
01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:10.440
And there's so many times where I read the stories that you writers,

1031
01:01:10.590 --> 01:01:14.180
the stories of the other guys that you're writing about, the, the,

1032
01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:19.280
the difference between the teen being overrun and killed is a minute.

1033
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:24.130
It's two minutes, sometimes it's seconds. You know, it's like these, uh,

1034
01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:25.160
of the time when you got,

1035
01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.870
when the fire as you're taking off the fire consumes the area we were just in.

1036
01:01:28.871 --> 01:01:33.060
That's followed by the NVA. So often these situations,

1037
01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.870
as soon as they started to go bad, even in the slightest way,

1038
01:01:36.871 --> 01:01:39.020
it's like okay we gotta we gotta start figuring out how we're gonna get outta

1039
01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.810
here. Cause if we try and fight by the time we make the decision.

1040
01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.030
So if you try to do this idea of his,

1041
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:49.170
which is break contact and then continue the mission, I mean,

1042
01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:53.280
is it really possible for you to break? So you lose a bunch of your Ammo,

1043
01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:54.750
what do you figure a third year Emo,

1044
01:01:54.751 --> 01:01:58.280
half of your ammo and a quick gunfight and now you think the enemy's just gonna

1045
01:01:58.300 --> 01:01:59.133
walk away.

1046
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.130
<v 3>And the fundamental flaw here is this is a secret mission.</v>

1047
01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.940
It's a clandestine operation. If you make contact with the enemy quote,

1048
01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:09.200
you've been compromised.

1049
01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.380
But somehow that didn't compute with the tanker [inaudible]

1050
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:16.880
<v 0>yeah. So you're in there, you're talking to them. And, and here we go.</v>

1051
01:02:16.881 --> 01:02:17.361
Back to the book,

1052
01:02:17.361 --> 01:02:21.540
I knew that several other recon team had been unsuccessful in getting the tanker

1053
01:02:21.541 --> 01:02:24.180
to change his mind on that topic. So I approached it from a different angle.

1054
01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:28.260
I asked him to place himself in the one zero position in the field because most

1055
01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:29.010
of the ones,

1056
01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:32.010
euros I knew would do anything within their power to successfully complete a

1057
01:02:32.011 --> 01:02:36.690
mission if the tactical situation was conducive to it. But once compromised,

1058
01:02:36.691 --> 01:02:38.970
it was often militarily difficult to do.

1059
01:02:38.971 --> 01:02:43.080
So with a six man recon team against large numbers of NVA soldiers,

1060
01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.120
he promised me think more on the topic and I saluted and returned to the team

1061
01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:52.080
room, leery of the new CEO. So you did you even at an,

1062
01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:53.400
even at a young age,

1063
01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:58.490
you had the had the kind of understanding maybe I'm not going to approach things

1064
01:02:58.771 --> 01:03:02.040
head on, hey, you know, you're, you're not trying to store your dome.

1065
01:03:02.041 --> 01:03:04.200
That's a bad idea. No, it's like, hey, you know sir,

1066
01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:07.890
from my perspective as a one zeros, what we see it's a little bit different.

1067
01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:11.790
I just was impressed with the fact that you were playing the game a little bit

1068
01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:14.740
to try and build a relationship with this guy. Try and get him on your side.

1069
01:03:14.741 --> 01:03:16.030
Spider Parks and Pat Walker

1070
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:17.110
<v 3>does it have to be [inaudible].</v>

1071
01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:21.460
We a couple offices here that are real dickheads in the beginning and when they

1072
01:03:21.461 --> 01:03:26.461
took over command of they would be making bad decisions and didn't understand a

1073
01:03:26.951 --> 01:03:31.951
situation but at least majority of the senior officers meaning a major or

1074
01:03:32.051 --> 01:03:34.960
lieutenant colonel, our case majority,

1075
01:03:34.961 --> 01:03:37.540
once they'd been there and saw what we were up against in the field.

1076
01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:41.200
It just took a while for that little time gap from when they land.

1077
01:03:41.201 --> 01:03:42.590
They want to prove their hard ass,

1078
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:46.840
they want to be a good CEO now you got to worry about their career too and

1079
01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:51.550
between that reality and what we're dealing with on the ground and usually most

1080
01:03:51.551 --> 01:03:54.900
of them came around. This guy was not one of those that was a,

1081
01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.320
didn't have that capability.

1082
01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:59.490
<v 0>You're just seeing it in his, his own perspective.</v>

1083
01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:04.130
<v 3>Yeah. I had learned from the pros, you know spider Pat Wok is John McGovern.</v>

1084
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:08.510
These were all senior SEOs and I watched them in situations dealing with

1085
01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:12.890
sergeant majors and S3 particularly on mission stuff before the mission and

1086
01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:17.780
afterwards how they would talk. And I picked up a lot of, I like the thick,

1087
01:04:17.781 --> 01:04:20.840
I absorbed some of their pcs skills cause I had none.

1088
01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:23.851
<v 0>And the, and the,</v>

1089
01:04:23.851 --> 01:04:26.700
what would you say the goal was from a leadership perspective as you're talking

1090
01:04:26.701 --> 01:04:29.610
to these guys? I mean I always say, look, if I've got a boss,

1091
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:33.570
my goal is to try and form a relationship with me so that he listens to what I'm

1092
01:04:33.571 --> 01:04:35.970
saying. Cause if I go down there and bud heads out of the gate,

1093
01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:39.660
they're not going to listen to me. If I tell this boss this tanker, Hey,

1094
01:04:39.661 --> 01:04:41.520
you don't know what you're talking about. Wealth,

1095
01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:45.120
he's not going to listen to another word I say. But if I say, Hey Sir Roger,

1096
01:04:45.121 --> 01:04:48.240
that I want to give you some perspective on this that I've seen, you know,

1097
01:04:48.241 --> 01:04:48.630
whatever.

1098
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:51.870
Just trying to talk to them with respectfully try to build a relationship.

1099
01:04:51.871 --> 01:04:52.704
That's what I try to do.

1100
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.540
<v 3>Yeah. And with the CEO.</v>

1101
01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:58.040
He just tried to stay hell away from deal to sergeant major because they'd been

1102
01:04:58.050 --> 01:04:59.250
all been on the ground.

1103
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:02.050
They had experience and they appreciate it what we were doing.

1104
01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:05.880
They knew what we're doing day by day. Our sergeant majors were squared away,

1105
01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.070
um, with exceptional one,

1106
01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.610
but most of the ones I dealt with and we're just really lucky.

1107
01:05:11.611 --> 01:05:15.840
So I tried to deal with them. Keep the COO site, stay away from is the best way.

1108
01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:22.630
<v 0>Officer avoidance, sir. Officer avoidance. That's a good one. Uh,</v>

1109
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:27.250
moving forward a little bit in the late afternoon is black and I went over the

1110
01:05:27.251 --> 01:05:30.940
final mission preparations. Jenkins came running into our hoots with bad news.

1111
01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:32.650
R T Maryland has been hit.

1112
01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:38.320
Walton Brown or down Jesus h Christ, I can't believe it. Walled told me they,

1113
01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:41.860
that they told him it was a dry hole. Give me your PRC.

1114
01:05:41.861 --> 01:05:45.010
25 someone said they heard Brown on the radio.

1115
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:47.650
As I screwed the long antenna into the PRC.

1116
01:05:47.651 --> 01:05:51.850
25 black ass Junkins any word on the bright light team?

1117
01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:56.350
He turned to me with a frown on his face. No word yet replied Jenkins,

1118
01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:58.150
but I want to go if there is one.

1119
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:03.040
We all moved outside to get better radio reception on our FM radios.

1120
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:08.110
The news got worse. Junkin said he could hear Covey talking to Brown.

1121
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:13.620
All the Americans were down and being overrun. Junkin said,

1122
01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:17.970
have you heard Covey's last conversation with Brown when a wounded Brown told

1123
01:06:17.971 --> 01:06:19.860
Covey they were being overrun?

1124
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:23.280
He said he heard the AK 47 firing.

1125
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1126
01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:26.100
<v 0>And then there was radio silence.</v>

1127
01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:30.450
All communications with r t Maryland were lost.

1128
01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:36.070
The weather over the target closed in precluding any bright light missions for

1129
01:06:36.071 --> 01:06:39.310
10 days when a bright light finally went in.

1130
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:44.510
Team members found only American web gear near the last loan location of our t,

1131
01:06:44.511 --> 01:06:49.150
Maryland. No further evidence of the team was ever located

1132
01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:54.450
walled Brown and Sergeant Donald Monroe shoe.

1133
01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:59.780
The newly appointed team member were listed as presumptive killed in action.

1134
01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:05.510
The loss of walled Brown and shoe was a reminder of just how deadly the AOT

1135
01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.320
continued to be in SOG. As always,

1136
01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.400
the recon men talk to each other afterward to see if there were any lessons to

1137
01:07:13.401 --> 01:07:17.460
be learned from their loss. Well, the weather was bad.

1138
01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:21.780
Sergeant Major John Hobbes suggested to black myself and a few others in recon

1139
01:07:21.781 --> 01:07:26.520
that perhaps a recon book should be written containing and documenting the

1140
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.460
team's standard operating procedures.

1141
01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:30.580
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1142
01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.160
<v 3>so there you go. That's when you got started on that Damn Tacos. Yeah.</v>

1143
01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:35.210
Lynn was a phenomenal,

1144
01:07:35.211 --> 01:07:39.740
he is a phenomenal artist and so he would do a lot of sketches and then we

1145
01:07:39.741 --> 01:07:44.240
worked on every sop from everything from just getting pre mission.

1146
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:47.150
What would you, what you would carry a,

1147
01:07:47.151 --> 01:07:49.820
break it down between America's IA ditch batteries,

1148
01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:54.470
claymores five-second fuses and then adapting to the AOE you're going in.

1149
01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:58.340
Um, of years and layoffs. They had a lot of water,

1150
01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:02.060
so you only carry one t cantina water and purification pills.

1151
01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:06.470
Other times it was dry. You had to carry more water, which is more weight.

1152
01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:08.900
So always tried to stay low as possible.

1153
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:13.550
And that as one of the fluctuation weight factors that we have some control

1154
01:08:13.551 --> 01:08:16.730
over. How much were you use the carrier?

1155
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:22.160
At least 80 to 90 pounds back then. And we uh,

1156
01:08:22.161 --> 01:08:24.410
we [inaudible] was your body weight? Ah,

1157
01:08:24.411 --> 01:08:26.780
I think it was about one 70 soak and wet.

1158
01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:31.400
Maybe one 75 but the most after rnr

1159
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:37.580
and you're carrying 80 pounds. 90 pounds. Yeah.

1160
01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:42.940
Cause I carried the radio plus the a 600 plus rounds for the car am sitting in

1161
01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:48.410
the iron rails in a frag grenades and you guys know it wore no body armor.

1162
01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:52.800
Oh No, no helmet. The body armor back then was this clunky stuff. Yeah.

1163
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:54.050
And it was just, you know,

1164
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:58.310
and the helmet was just made too much noise and his weight and in the jungle

1165
01:08:58.311 --> 01:09:01.550
would just get caught up and stuff. Whereas I just wear to cravat all the time.

1166
01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:04.580
And then the try to cover my blonde hair

1167
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:11.780
again, this is a, you know,

1168
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:15.050
every time I read one of your one at one of the stories that you write about,

1169
01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.810
you know, you made it out, you know, you, you,

1170
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:21.800
you had that extra claymore that gave you enough time to get on the bird.

1171
01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:24.200
You laid down that extra fire, the, the, the,

1172
01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:28.880
the air ships showed up in time to put down cover fire and here with these guys,

1173
01:09:28.881 --> 01:09:31.760
with our t, Maryland, like those seconds didn't happen.

1174
01:09:31.761 --> 01:09:34.610
Those aircraft didn't show whatever the case may be.

1175
01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:38.510
And that's what was at stake every single time you guys went out there. Right?

1176
01:09:38.511 --> 01:09:41.640
And just like we said, and across the fence, all the Americans were killed.

1177
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:44.510
Dee and digital left alive. So they were hit by,

1178
01:09:44.511 --> 01:09:47.840
we assume sappers and with the indigenous,

1179
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:51.140
it's a psychological thing on all the troops in camp.

1180
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.260
You had to deal with that again. But like with my team,

1181
01:09:54.261 --> 01:09:57.020
we just pulled the team together and said, hey, tell us what you heard.

1182
01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:00.560
We don't, we don't have a problem with you guys, but when this happens,

1183
01:10:00.561 --> 01:10:01.550
just be advised.

1184
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:06.320
Keep Lynn and I appraised of anything you hear that could be negative or

1185
01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:10.580
troublesome, then we'll squelch it right away or deal with it.

1186
01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:15.680
In this case, did the indigent, the [inaudible] make it out for,

1187
01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.600
they never heard from again or no. Two out of three made it out. Uh,

1188
01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:22.370
one was killed as they came out of the forest,

1189
01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:24.770
there are near a marine compound of some sort.

1190
01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:27.980
And because they were in ditch when he came out arm,

1191
01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:33.430
the marine took him out and the other two were able to surround surrender and

1192
01:10:33.891 --> 01:10:36.980
make a gestures of some sort that they were able to get picked up,

1193
01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:40.430
came back and he took him down to Saigon for the full debrief and everything.

1194
01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:45.940
And did you guys ever get word on that debrief way late where they only thing we

1195
01:10:46.341 --> 01:10:49.130
heard was from Covey and cubby said that they had,

1196
01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.840
the team is set up for his rest over night spot too early and he thought it was

1197
01:10:53.841 --> 01:10:58.260
a dangerous spot but the one zero didn't listen to him. And uh,

1198
01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.390
so everybody was,

1199
01:10:59.770 --> 01:11:04.640
I'm surprised that we did it cause Walt had been one zero for a few months.

1200
01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:07.160
He had been in Marine Corps First, Cain,

1201
01:11:07.161 --> 01:11:12.161
SF and then he ran a few missions out of f will be one and half would be one

1202
01:11:12.171 --> 01:11:13.980
shutdown. Uh,

1203
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.300
he came down to a fob for CCN.

1204
01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:20.800
<v 4>What'd you guys always know who the Covey was?</v>

1205
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:22.690
Who the Covey rider was going to be?

1206
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:28.440
<v 3>No, no. Uh, sometimes it fluctuated, uh, particularly at the,</v>

1207
01:11:28.441 --> 01:11:33.441
we went down to fob four cause the air force changed their pilots and all the

1208
01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.690
copywriters we had fob one got reassigned somewheres else.

1209
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:42.100
So none of them carried on as copywriters. Now pat walkers came home,

1210
01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:45.620
he d roast out, spider parse came to CCM,

1211
01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:50.230
began another assignment and I saw a spider very little, uh, because I,

1212
01:11:50.231 --> 01:11:52.480
I couldn't even tell you what his assignment was. We just saw each other.

1213
01:11:52.481 --> 01:11:55.030
So little there. Cause Lynn and I are busy running

1214
01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:57.940
<v 4>with the Covey rider. Do all the mission planning with you?</v>

1215
01:11:58.370 --> 01:12:00.240
<v 3>No. A Deli.</v>

1216
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:05.240
The cubby rotter and a pilot would be in for the final briefing at base or at

1217
01:12:05.241 --> 01:12:10.010
the launch site and it was just talk about LZs uh,

1218
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:15.200
any anti aircraft because they continue to bring down more anti aircraft.

1219
01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:18.260
Everything from the uh, uh, 37,

1220
01:12:19.070 --> 01:12:23.060
Mike Mike's to the heavier anti-aircraft artillery that came in later.

1221
01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:29.150
<v 4>Did that, did they ever get, did the coveys ever get shot at and shot down?</v>

1222
01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.840
<v 3>Always. We have several that went down and um,</v>

1223
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:38.370
there is a, what altitude would they fly at? Well,

1224
01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:42.510
um, they would do everything from way up high when they're just doing a general

1225
01:12:42.511 --> 01:12:45.450
recon to when a team would be on the ground,

1226
01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:50.520
they would have to spot the team either through smoke or mirror or from a

1227
01:12:50.521 --> 01:12:53.700
location you'd have, you'd be on a proud of point that they could pick us out.

1228
01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:57.690
Well, most of the times would be signal mirror that we'd flashy up to them.

1229
01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:02.580
They'd lock in on us that way. But once they got to doing actual coverage,

1230
01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:07.650
they would come down really low and [inaudible] stuff and there would be oh two

1231
01:13:07.651 --> 01:13:11.460
to slow movers. The little push pool. Yeah. Um, yeah,

1232
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:13.530
we lost several coveys

1233
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:15.190
<v 4>it seems like those, I mean,</v>

1234
01:13:15.191 --> 01:13:19.210
I can't imagine being the Covey rider in this one for our team, Maryland.

1235
01:13:19.211 --> 01:13:20.890
And you're, you're there and you're,

1236
01:13:21.190 --> 01:13:25.780
you're basically watching your guys get overrun. And I mean,

1237
01:13:25.781 --> 01:13:29.590
it isn't even after you maybe made suggestions that they moved somewhere else,

1238
01:13:29.591 --> 01:13:32.080
but you know, they don't see, but you're still supporting them. I mean,

1239
01:13:32.081 --> 01:13:32.950
what a helpless feeling.

1240
01:13:32.951 --> 01:13:37.951
That's gotta be rough at most of the Covey riders were guys that couldn't

1241
01:13:39.971 --> 01:13:41.200
operate for whatever reason.

1242
01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:45.800
<v 3>No, they were, well they were former SF, so sometimes would be, um,</v>

1243
01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.730
SF men had been in country for eight or nine months and then they would be

1244
01:13:49.731 --> 01:13:52.190
signed to Cubbyrise. So they had experienced on the ground,

1245
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:55.910
there are short timers. So it was viewed as, as a,

1246
01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.020
a job that was not quite as dangerous as being on the ground,

1247
01:14:00.021 --> 01:14:04.460
but it had its own hidden dangers. Yeah, yeah. And, and

1248
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:07.530
<v 4>it seems like you would,</v>

1249
01:14:07.531 --> 01:14:11.080
you would just want like someone that you really knew and trusted as your

1250
01:14:11.081 --> 01:14:12.100
copywriter. Right.

1251
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:14.770
<v 3>And so like in my case, we had a bunch of new ones,</v>

1252
01:14:14.771 --> 01:14:17.320
so this cubby rider was great. Uh,

1253
01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.110
he just picked everybody up brand as well.

1254
01:14:20.111 --> 01:14:23.680
We had a couple others that we dealt with and some of these guys like Spider

1255
01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:28.570
Pars. Here's a couple of times when there's no error available. So you say,

1256
01:14:28.571 --> 01:14:31.420
well, how low did they get? They would make a gun run with a car.

1257
01:14:31.421 --> 01:14:35.530
15 spider would hang out the window. Foreigners car 15 at the NBA.

1258
01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:40.110
I don't even know what to say to that. Yeah. Yeah.

1259
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.780
And he wasn't the only copywriter did that.

1260
01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:45.900
I mean other guys who dropped her mouth for an MCT nine,

1261
01:14:47.810 --> 01:14:48.770
that's what they tried to do to,

1262
01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:52.400
to give us support while we're waiting for the year air force in the other

1263
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:56.000
aerostats to get there. You know, I was thought so when I went to see school,

1264
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:58.970
you know, they, they taught us how to use signal with the mirror.

1265
01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:01.700
Then in my mind, cause I'm dumb,

1266
01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.640
I would think like I'm thinking like how well does it really gonna work?

1267
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:09.130
I can't believe every, that's like your primary signal device? Absolutely.

1268
01:15:09.150 --> 01:15:10.520
Was the signal mirror? Yeah.

1269
01:15:10.521 --> 01:15:15.290
Every time that we had been on the ground for a period of time had to reconnect.

1270
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:19.640
Everything was all signal through the mirror and we had to get the flash.

1271
01:15:19.641 --> 01:15:23.180
You get the copy on the right side so he could see us getting it, you know,

1272
01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.390
everything y'all. Yeah. How big is that mirror?

1273
01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:31.820
That was just a regular signal mirror. Like a, maybe a five by three.

1274
01:15:31.821 --> 01:15:35.870
Three by five? Yeah. Like a cell phone. Did you have?

1275
01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:39.530
I had this even though I didn't really believe in signal mirrors.

1276
01:15:39.531 --> 01:15:44.090
I guess I had this like special signal mirror that when you pointed it at the

1277
01:15:44.091 --> 01:15:46.010
thing it got like a little shade.

1278
01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:49.070
There's a little circle in the middle that got a little shade on it when you'd

1279
01:15:49.071 --> 01:15:52.580
be in the right spot. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. Uh, I don't know.

1280
01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.630
I never figured out how that quite worked. Okay.

1281
01:15:54.631 --> 01:15:56.480
I just want to get the flashy up so they could see it.

1282
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:59.720
Did you do like the technique where you're aiming at your hand and pointing at

1283
01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.670
the thing at the aircraft? No,

1284
01:16:01.671 --> 01:16:04.520
I would just make sure we had the flashy and just point it in general.

1285
01:16:04.521 --> 01:16:07.310
I didn't get that high level of training. And you had sir,

1286
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:13.100
well thank God I didn't never have to do it cause I probably would have been

1287
01:16:13.101 --> 01:16:16.220
able to pull it off. Well triple camp is a little different than the desert.

1288
01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.310
Yeah. Yeah. And so in the triple canopy,

1289
01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:23.360
that had to be a challenge to find a hole in the jungle to get through with the

1290
01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.351
flash. In the first place.

1291
01:16:24.351 --> 01:16:27.890
Then you had to get the cubby lined up with your hole and then with the mirror

1292
01:16:27.891 --> 01:16:32.210
flash, you would, you would look at us nowadays and think we were,

1293
01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.200
we were weak with all the crap that we've got. We got laser pointers,

1294
01:16:36.201 --> 01:16:39.650
we got little signaling devices, transponders.

1295
01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.590
I know we can be your equipment. There's no question about that.

1296
01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:43.580
Not to mention you're not,

1297
01:16:43.581 --> 01:16:47.360
we would have run over both of our mothers for photos. No. Yeah, yeah, for sure.

1298
01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:48.253
Oh yeah.

1299
01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.370
And you guys had some starlight scoped and you guys have some starlight thing.

1300
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:54.920
There were big and heavy. We never carried it in field. No,

1301
01:16:54.921 --> 01:16:57.240
we only used them for a couple teams. Did A,

1302
01:16:57.280 --> 01:17:00.620
I couldn't even tell you which ones a, I'd never heard about it much,

1303
01:17:00.710 --> 01:17:02.500
at least with fob one or our time.

1304
01:17:02.501 --> 01:17:07.400
CCN But we use the frame bushes and there were so bright than you.

1305
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:10.040
They ruined your night visits. So one be blown out for

1306
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:14.690
<v 0>them from the green sensors that they use to amplify the light.</v>

1307
01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:16.790
And then your other eye was for night vision.

1308
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.903
<v 2>Hmm.</v>

1309
01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:25.910
<v 0>Okay. Awesome stuff. Uh, you after this,</v>

1310
01:17:25.911 --> 01:17:30.470
after our t Maryland disappears, uh,

1311
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:32.210
going back to the book next morning,

1312
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:36.610
Hobbs asked me if I would courier a packet of sensitive information to Mack

1313
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:39.710
resach headquarters in Saigon. You end up going to Saigon.

1314
01:17:39.711 --> 01:17:42.920
You ended up doing a little bit of Thailand is a time in Thailand as well cause

1315
01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:43.910
you got a little pass.

1316
01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:48.680
It sounds like you had a good time there of which you don't remember a lot.

1317
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:51.830
True. Uh,

1318
01:17:51.831 --> 01:17:56.420
you get back to Saigon and you're waiting for a return flight to Denang.

1319
01:17:56.421 --> 01:18:00.320
You'd spent all your poker money, which remind me never to play poker with you.

1320
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:03.200
And here we go back to look.

1321
01:18:03.201 --> 01:18:05.390
For some reason I couldn't fall asleep that night in Saigon.

1322
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:08.840
I lay there on my bed looking at the ceiling, watching the ceiling turning,

1323
01:18:09.050 --> 01:18:13.820
still not believing that I had returned to Vietnam and to ASOG at some point.

1324
01:18:13.821 --> 01:18:17.270
I remember thinking when I was in nom, during my first tour of duty,

1325
01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:21.020
I dreamed of returning to the states. When I finally got home,

1326
01:18:21.650 --> 01:18:23.780
I found myself drawn back to nom.

1327
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:29.830
Of course there were pressing legal matters at Fort Devons that can contributed

1328
01:18:31.670 --> 01:18:34.910
to my leaving the u s of a. As I lay there,

1329
01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:39.350
I found myself asking myself, what the hell are you doing here?

1330
01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:44.380
You could die. It's like realization.

1331
01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:48.930
Yes. Dentical scene from the apocalypse. Yeah, it is. It is. And Martin Sheen.

1332
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.800
Yeah.

1333
01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.390
That mental tape replayed many times in my mind that night in many different

1334
01:18:54.391 --> 01:18:58.740
forms, but the essence of the issue was when I was in nom,

1335
01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.080
I wanted to go home. When I was home, I wanted to go to nom.

1336
01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:08.760
Once again, I thought of home where other than my family,

1337
01:19:08.761 --> 01:19:12.750
there was no compelling reason to return. I had no job waiting. I had no job,

1338
01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:13.950
no career to speak of.

1339
01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:18.600
I imagined going to one of those county employment centers and saying, hi,

1340
01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.130
I was a one zero and a secret war that I can't talk about. I can fire my car,

1341
01:19:23.131 --> 01:19:27.930
15 from the hip real good and I can hit a target at 400 meters with my f sawed

1342
01:19:27.931 --> 01:19:28.980
off m 79.

1343
01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.780
And I could bring napalm so close that it'll suck the air out of your lungs.

1344
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:40.580
Thus, at the age of 23, I had my midlife crisis.

1345
01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.130
There was a, uh,

1346
01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:48.910
a picture that one of my platoon chiefs told me about.

1347
01:19:49.090 --> 01:19:52.720
He had this mentor Vietnam seal,

1348
01:19:52.810 --> 01:19:54.790
who was a mailman in imperial beach,

1349
01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:58.060
California [inaudible] and you know,

1350
01:19:58.061 --> 01:20:00.940
he had come home from Vietnam and become, you know, what am I going to do?

1351
01:20:00.941 --> 01:20:03.010
And he became a mailman. And he had, and Ma,

1352
01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:08.100
my platoon chief said that that guy had a on his wall and it was,

1353
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:10.170
uh, it was, uh,

1354
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:15.170
taken from the behind of a guy in fatigues with his web gear on and his weapon

1355
01:20:16.091 --> 01:20:18.300
slung and, and you're, and he's looking at a,

1356
01:20:18.450 --> 01:20:23.100
like a corporate guy in a desk and the corporate guys looking up at him and the

1357
01:20:23.101 --> 01:20:24.930
caption underneath it says, I'm sorry sir,

1358
01:20:24.931 --> 01:20:28.350
we don't have a job here for appointment. Exactly.

1359
01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:32.640
Which is sounds like how you were feeling. It's perfect on point. Yeah. Yeah.

1360
01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:37.930
And you're,

1361
01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:39.750
you got this and this is, you know, it's interesting,

1362
01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:41.660
I was just talking to one of my buddies, um,

1363
01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:46.890
and he was saying, look, you know, sometimes I hear people say, oh,

1364
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:52.410
I loved being in combat and when they say that I kind of get pissed at them and

1365
01:20:52.411 --> 01:20:55.770
I think, you know, if you loved it so much or he's like, he says, I don't,

1366
01:20:55.771 --> 01:20:58.890
I didn't love it so much or you know, I had a hard time with, you know,

1367
01:20:58.891 --> 01:21:02.370
it was hard and I'll do, I would do it again if I had to,

1368
01:21:02.371 --> 01:21:05.310
but I'm not dreaming about it until we had this little conversation.

1369
01:21:05.311 --> 01:21:07.800
What I ended up saying to him was I said, well,

1370
01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.750
W when I was on my last deployment to Iraq and you know, there's,

1371
01:21:13.290 --> 01:21:14.880
you know, we had some guys wounded, we had some,

1372
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:19.910
we had had had one guy killed at this point and there starts to be like,

1373
01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:25.920
you start seeing those negative feelings start to start to grow a little bit.

1374
01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:29.910
You know, guys start questioning stuff, guys start, hey, you know,

1375
01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:32.780
what are we doing this off? Hey, who, who's who, what?

1376
01:21:32.781 --> 01:21:35.700
Why are we doing this mission? And then you start to feel that,

1377
01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:39.360
and then guys start can be start to become negative.

1378
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:43.470
And one of my platoon commanders came to me and said, you know, hey man,

1379
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:47.140
you know, this is going to be rough when we get home. These guys are gonna be,

1380
01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:50.340
you know, W we, we might not, they're going to be mad about this.

1381
01:21:50.341 --> 01:21:52.590
They're gonna be mad about that. They're gonna be mad about something else.

1382
01:21:52.591 --> 01:21:56.820
And I said, let me tell you what's gonna happen. I said, when we get home,

1383
01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:00.750
when you talk to them three days after we get home,

1384
01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:04.350
they will have forgotten 10% of the bad stuff.

1385
01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:08.370
And in a week they'll forget 30% in, in a month,

1386
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:11.130
they'll forget 50% I said, in a year,

1387
01:22:11.131 --> 01:22:13.650
the only thing they'll remember about this deployment is the fun,

1388
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.330
cool stuff that's,

1389
01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:20.460
and that's kind of what I think makes guys like me say, man, I,

1390
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:23.400
I had a, it was awesome. I would love to go back of course,

1391
01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:28.080
because we block out, you know, some of the hard memories. And for me,

1392
01:22:28.170 --> 01:22:32.040
I also always say the absolute best time of my life was being a tasking to

1393
01:22:32.041 --> 01:22:33.360
commander and the battle Ramadi.

1394
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:37.770
And the worst time of my life was being a task unit commander and a battler

1395
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.750
model. Cause there's nothing worse than losing your guys.

1396
01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:45.180
Oh and so it sounds like that was hitting you sort of mid deployment of hey

1397
01:22:47.401 --> 01:22:51.660
look, or when you were home, when you were back in America, you got,

1398
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:56.220
you got money problems, you got girl problems, you got law problems,

1399
01:22:56.221 --> 01:23:00.270
you got what all those problems and they can all go away. Yes,

1400
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:04.440
they can all become insignificant as soon as you get home that see one 30 and

1401
01:23:04.441 --> 01:23:06.150
fly back. And

1402
01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:10.320
<v 3>I thought about Hep Sal [inaudible] a two one in the team.</v>

1403
01:23:10.321 --> 01:23:15.321
I genuinely had that guilt feeling of them there and me not being there with

1404
01:23:16.110 --> 01:23:20.970
him. I felt as a, as a Greenbrae, I should've been there with him all along,

1405
01:23:21.270 --> 01:23:24.210
but we had a tour duty as you know. And, um,

1406
01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.890
so I was in a way, I was really glad to be back on the team. But yes,

1407
01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:32.100
a little bit more mature now and thinking a little bit, maybe two months,

1408
01:23:32.101 --> 01:23:36.120
but that night in that hotel and then 20 years later when apocalypse now comes

1409
01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.730
down, I go like, how the hell they get in my head for that scene.

1410
01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:43.780
<v 4>You obviously, you, you, you get through that,</v>

1411
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:47.290
that apocalypse now scene

1412
01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:51.250
of staring at the ceiling and thinking, you know,

1413
01:23:51.251 --> 01:23:54.280
every minute that I'm in the Bush, every minute I'm in this hotel,

1414
01:23:54.281 --> 01:23:58.990
Charlie gets stronger cause he's out in the bush. You get back,

1415
01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:03.460
um, and you're on another mission. And I'm jumping into it right now.

1416
01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:05.830
As I snapped out of my snooze, you're asleep and helicopter.

1417
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:07.150
I snapped out of my snooze.

1418
01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:11.710
I looked at out the starboard door just as we flew over the to start a layout,

1419
01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:15.460
Laotian farmers, a woman and two water buffalo,

1420
01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:20.560
the big chopper then hopped over the hedge row and landed in an adjacent field

1421
01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:24.970
as ingles. And I frantically awakened to the rest of our t, Idaho.

1422
01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:27.490
I was mad as hell. It wasn't bad enough.

1423
01:24:27.491 --> 01:24:30.430
They hadn't bothered to alert us as we approached the target area,

1424
01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.770
but now they were compounding that FOA. Paul,

1425
01:24:32.771 --> 01:24:37.771
by flying too close to indigenous farmers and then depositing us in the middle

1426
01:24:37.901 --> 01:24:39.040
of an open field,

1427
01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:43.420
far from our primary LZ and farther yet from the bridge.

1428
01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:48.400
That was the primary objective of our mission that this particular mission was a

1429
01:24:48.401 --> 01:24:50.200
pretty simple one, at least on paper,

1430
01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:53.380
which I take it with a serious grain of salt.

1431
01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:55.780
When you say admissions is a pretty simple one. Yeah.

1432
01:24:57.220 --> 01:25:02.220
By early 1970 the brass had become aware of something new and rather creative on

1433
01:25:02.531 --> 01:25:05.230
the part of the NVA underwater bridges.

1434
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:10.030
These were being put in in place at strategic spots along the Hotel Minh trail

1435
01:25:10.210 --> 01:25:13.420
where it ran through Laos from the air.

1436
01:25:13.421 --> 01:25:17.200
It would appear as though the trails were interrupted by water in some places

1437
01:25:17.201 --> 01:25:18.370
several feet deep.

1438
01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:21.880
Yet it was apparent that the trucks heading south were crossing these streams

1439
01:25:21.881 --> 01:25:25.900
with ease. A closer review of aerial photographs, however,

1440
01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:30.610
had revealed that the ever inventive NVA had come up with an underwater

1441
01:25:30.611 --> 01:25:32.980
structure that could support heavy trucking.

1442
01:25:33.130 --> 01:25:35.980
While remaining virtually unobservable from the air.

1443
01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:41.950
It was a devilishly clever idea and well executed to boot. So that's a pretty,

1444
01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:45.240
they just built these like, they're like maybe like six inches underwater.

1445
01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:46.083
The bridge.

1446
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:49.570
<v 3>Yeah. And we looked at the pictures. You couldn't tell, uh,</v>

1447
01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:53.600
they really done it well. And um, so that was the mission is simple.

1448
01:25:53.601 --> 01:25:57.560
Go in and find out what they are, take pictures and blown the hell up.

1449
01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:01.790
Simple mission. Yeah. If it'd be more fun to blow them up with the truck.

1450
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:04.240
<v 4>Okay. And</v>

1451
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:07.070
<v 3>you were, you guys were sleeping, the helicopters hadn't there.</v>

1452
01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.100
No one woke you up. And the reason why we lost from Thailand,

1453
01:26:10.610 --> 01:26:15.110
the weather had been socked in in Vietnam, so it was a bad weather spelled,

1454
01:26:15.111 --> 01:26:19.770
which was February of 1970 and they flew us by, um, blackbirds,

1455
01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:23.480
which were the, uh, uh, clandestine service.

1456
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:27.440
Air Lift for us flew to Thailand. We land in Thailand,

1457
01:26:27.441 --> 01:26:32.210
which is neutral at the air force base. And the black truck comes up, we get in,

1458
01:26:32.211 --> 01:26:35.060
has curtains, they can't see us. We go back to the base.

1459
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:39.380
And my old commander from fob one was the CEO at that launch site,

1460
01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:42.530
which was the 46 special forces group.

1461
01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:47.270
And they were there just to be in country, but they had decided to seek a war.

1462
01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.120
Spazz came out of there to have cubbies out of there.

1463
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:54.470
And so we launched and the air force had the HH threes,

1464
01:26:54.471 --> 01:26:57.560
the bigger helicopters, like the jolly green giant,

1465
01:26:57.561 --> 01:26:59.990
but a scaled down version without the armor plating.

1466
01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:04.520
So we launched from there and we flew for two or three hours cause the long

1467
01:27:04.521 --> 01:27:08.090
flight from Thailand across a western layoffs.

1468
01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.650
And we launched the,

1469
01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:13.760
as we landed at a fuel dump in the middle of last,

1470
01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:19.850
yeah, it was run body agency. Oh, okay. So we land Ewald yes, we refill.

1471
01:27:19.851 --> 01:27:24.320
But you get off, you go like, hey man, who are you? He goes, I'm not here. I go,

1472
01:27:24.321 --> 01:27:28.040
welcome my here. Either he says have a good day while you're not here.

1473
01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:31.730
And we continue to go in. And then the air force put us down in that,

1474
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:32.720
that canyon.

1475
01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:36.230
And that's one thing that's always interesting when you're using helicopters.

1476
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:41.030
The helicopter, when you're supposed to insert at one spot for them,

1477
01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:44.660
they, they, they miss that spot by a minute or whatever.

1478
01:27:45.020 --> 01:27:46.310
For them it's no big deal. Like, Hey,

1479
01:27:46.311 --> 01:27:48.860
they just flew them in a little bit long for you on the ground,

1480
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:53.050
that minute is a long time. I mean that can be a kilometer.

1481
01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.960
It could be like a really massive amount of space that you just missed. Oh yeah.

1482
01:27:56.961 --> 01:28:00.620
And this is like the dip between the valley and the Pete.

1483
01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:03.920
We want to go in on so we could run at night a little bit cause there's some

1484
01:28:03.921 --> 01:28:07.550
open areas that we could cover and didn't get down maybe at the middle of the

1485
01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:09.590
night to check this thing out in the morning at first light.

1486
01:28:09.591 --> 01:28:14.360
That's where our plan was. Just didn't happen. We're in a valley and it's like,

1487
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:18.290
uh, okay. We flown out here. I certainly don't want to just fly back.

1488
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:21.140
Pissed everybody off. Let's give it a shot. We're here,

1489
01:28:21.141 --> 01:28:24.080
we're on the ground scope. So we had to get up, put our gear on first.

1490
01:28:24.081 --> 01:28:28.040
We didn't even have a routine insert where everybody goes out on full alert and

1491
01:28:28.110 --> 01:28:32.540
we can get out and put the damn equipment on. And then we're like, okay,

1492
01:28:32.541 --> 01:28:34.100
we're in a valley in the mountain,

1493
01:28:34.101 --> 01:28:38.780
we want to be on several thousand feet above us and we're in this valley.

1494
01:28:39.020 --> 01:28:42.050
Are you carrying a regular topographic map?

1495
01:28:42.051 --> 01:28:45.110
Is that your primary means of navigation? Yes,

1496
01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:49.850
and they would have the big map and then our target where we plan to go,

1497
01:28:49.851 --> 01:28:54.320
they would cut a 10 by 10 cut it out. And that's also all we carried.

1498
01:28:54.710 --> 01:28:57.450
So if we got caught there be nothing else besides just that,

1499
01:28:57.540 --> 01:29:01.830
that grid that we were in. And did you ever use any imagery as well to,

1500
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:04.860
to no compliment that. Nope.

1501
01:29:04.861 --> 01:29:09.861
Strictly map the Covey pile if they did a VR visual reconnaissance prior to the

1502
01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:12.890
mission. But here it wasn't. We, uh,

1503
01:29:13.290 --> 01:29:17.970
the cubby had told them here's the target area and for some reason the air force

1504
01:29:17.971 --> 01:29:19.980
has went down through the valley and dropped us there.

1505
01:29:24.170 --> 01:29:25.050
<v 4>All right. Continuing on,</v>

1506
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:29.110
given the rather undistinguished nature of our arrival or sorry,

1507
01:29:29.111 --> 01:29:30.940
undisguised nature of our arrival.

1508
01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.490
We knew it was only a matter of time before hundreds of NVA troops,

1509
01:29:33.491 --> 01:29:37.480
trackers and dogs would be pouring down on us on that road looking for us.

1510
01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:43.460
So you want s w cause we get to work with dogs.

1511
01:29:44.420 --> 01:29:48.770
So like I can't imagine knowing going in that I'm going to be facing dogs that

1512
01:29:48.771 --> 01:29:49.700
are going, coming after us.

1513
01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:52.490
And obviously you guys work cause you guys carried mason pepper and all this

1514
01:29:52.491 --> 01:29:55.340
other stuff to throw them off. But what a nightmare that is.

1515
01:29:55.890 --> 01:30:00.600
<v 3>I still hate dogs. My wife loves him but, and the kids love them.</v>

1516
01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:03.840
Do you have any dogs? Yeah, we got a fleabag running around the house.

1517
01:30:08.130 --> 01:30:11.580
His name is gunny buddy ways. It's like we got him from other, from a gunny.

1518
01:30:11.581 --> 01:30:13.340
So okay. Um,

1519
01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.700
<v 4>ours was no tourists, John. Furthermore,</v>

1520
01:30:16.820 --> 01:30:19.460
it's very unsettling to be moving through this beautiful valley in broad

1521
01:30:19.461 --> 01:30:23.660
daylight at what? For a recon team passed at breakneck speed.

1522
01:30:23.780 --> 01:30:26.290
It was not a comfortable way to proceed. We took no breaks,

1523
01:30:26.310 --> 01:30:30.410
not wanting to spend a moment longer than necessary in such an exposed position.

1524
01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:32.000
So you're just hauling ass. Oh yeah.

1525
01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:35.300
Trying to get out of this valley as fast as you can

1526
01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:39.890
<v 3>and you end up going up a hill, a big hill.</v>

1527
01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:42.290
And we split the team too for awhile.

1528
01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:45.230
I put the angles on one side of the valley and me on the other,

1529
01:30:45.231 --> 01:30:49.850
it wasn't that big in terms of width. Been wide enough to, I could see him,

1530
01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:52.130
he could see me. Okay. Just a warmth divide.

1531
01:30:52.131 --> 01:30:55.460
And then the detailed gunners took care of our foot footprints.

1532
01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:58.520
And what was your reason for that call? Um,

1533
01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:02.600
I just wanted to split the team up to see what was on the other side of the

1534
01:31:02.601 --> 01:31:05.840
valley. We couldn't tell either side what was there. So I figured we could,

1535
01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:06.920
if there's any enemy,

1536
01:31:07.220 --> 01:31:11.240
we wanted to find out on both sides at once and try to get to a point where we

1537
01:31:11.241 --> 01:31:14.920
could begin to find a spot to get up. The mountain could be,

1538
01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:19.630
are gonna run out of daylight. Got It. So it was a little bit of a, of a, of a

1539
01:31:19.690 --> 01:31:22.570
<v 4>panic, not panic move. It was a, it was, hey, we're no Tufts situation.</v>

1540
01:31:22.571 --> 01:31:25.360
One of the best ways we can get out of this is we put teams on both sides of

1541
01:31:25.361 --> 01:31:27.430
valley. We're looking for a way to get into the top of this thing.

1542
01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:29.590
I knew you talk about this earlier now.

1543
01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.990
I used to warn guys all the time about splitting forces.

1544
01:31:32.090 --> 01:31:35.030
<v 3>Oh yeah. And it's like really risky. Really,</v>

1545
01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:39.560
really risk is one rule you never do. And I've, I did it twice. Okay.

1546
01:31:39.561 --> 01:31:43.190
So I just wanted to confirm that. Oh yeah, no, absolutely. And the,

1547
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:46.490
the situation was such that we couldn't tell what was on either side.

1548
01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:48.560
So I figured we're going to have a firefight.

1549
01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:51.740
At least now there'll be minimal forces.

1550
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:55.820
Our four w we went in an eight man team at times had four and four,

1551
01:31:55.850 --> 01:32:00.170
four and four and John had been on the ground with me previously, so I

1552
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:02.910
<v 4>wasn't worried about John and a soap.</v>

1553
01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:05.050
We're going to have a firefighters do with minimal forces.

1554
01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:07.740
We could survive and then get the prairie fire and worry about getting Outta

1555
01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.720
here. Otherwise proceed.

1556
01:32:09.721 --> 01:32:13.990
B And d covers much ground because of that mission where we set up the ambush.

1557
01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:14.800
We had,

1558
01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:19.720
we had great success by not stopping because the NVA knew that we would go 10

1559
01:32:19.721 --> 01:32:22.900
stop 10 so they would anticipate how far we traveled here.

1560
01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:26.950
It's like we covered maximum ground hauling ass. Yeah.

1561
01:32:28.090 --> 01:32:33.040
All right. Now you end up finding a place to go up this hill and here we go.

1562
01:32:33.041 --> 01:32:35.050
Back to the book. By now we were out of breath.

1563
01:32:35.051 --> 01:32:38.080
The grueling climb with all our combat gear was starting to wear on us,

1564
01:32:38.230 --> 01:32:42.490
and each additional steps seem to bring an increased in the steepness of the

1565
01:32:42.491 --> 01:32:43.240
incline.

1566
01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:47.980
It was growing painfully clear that those periodic volleyball games we had

1567
01:32:47.981 --> 01:32:50.500
played back at camp weren't sufficient physical training.

1568
01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:56.020
Did you? What'd you guys, what'd you guys do for PT back then? Not enough

1569
01:32:59.710 --> 01:33:03.820
volleyball gets off. That was it. Yeah, because we were so busy, you know,

1570
01:33:04.030 --> 01:33:07.660
between the mission, mission prep, and then he started sticking us in isolation.

1571
01:33:07.661 --> 01:33:08.710
I was going to ask you that. Would you,

1572
01:33:08.711 --> 01:33:12.280
would you be tired when you're going into the field or would you be well rested?

1573
01:33:12.730 --> 01:33:15.430
Cause like on this one, he fell asleep. You guys were all asleep. Oh yeah.

1574
01:33:15.490 --> 01:33:17.260
I'm gonna tell you right now, like when we would go in the field,

1575
01:33:17.261 --> 01:33:19.450
most of the time when I would go in the field, especially in Ramadi,

1576
01:33:19.451 --> 01:33:21.760
I would be exhausted by the time I went in the field because we'd spent all this

1577
01:33:21.761 --> 01:33:24.430
time planning and de conflicting and briefing and doing all this stuff.

1578
01:33:24.431 --> 01:33:26.800
By the time I went in the field, it was like the time for me to go, okay,

1579
01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:28.630
hey someone, someone's saying watch,

1580
01:33:28.631 --> 01:33:31.420
I'm going to sleep for an hour or two hours. You know, that happened a lot.

1581
01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:36.250
Yeah. We usually had a nights rest prior. Yeah. It's nice. Yeah, it's a luxury.

1582
01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:41.080
Very nice. Um, going back to the book, however,

1583
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:46.110
any thoughts of letting personal pain slow us down or not so subtly overwritten

1584
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:48.940
by noise noises we could hear from the north of us.

1585
01:33:49.210 --> 01:33:52.480
The menacing sounds made us forget our dry throats keeping lungs,

1586
01:33:52.481 --> 01:33:57.130
pain needs and knees and aching backs. The enemy was out there and the game,

1587
01:33:57.131 --> 01:34:00.790
as they say, was on the forces. Might not yet be joined,

1588
01:34:00.791 --> 01:34:04.420
but the fight was in the offing, so he knew it was coming.

1589
01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:06.880
And then you guys go into like a series.

1590
01:34:06.881 --> 01:34:11.881
The Sao leads you guys into like a serious fight of vines,

1591
01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.680
thorns undergrowth.

1592
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:18.880
We went in and then we went in deeper and then he pushed us the third time and I

1593
01:34:18.881 --> 01:34:22.800
was pissed because I tore my fatigues. I'm going, sal, you know,

1594
01:34:24.330 --> 01:34:28.030
de Dinky Dow like you're crazy. You're pushing it. He was right. I was wrong.

1595
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:34.030
We went into third level. Yeah, and then you get in so deep.

1596
01:34:34.031 --> 01:34:37.300
Eventually settled down and tried to get as comfortable as possible on a 40

1597
01:34:37.301 --> 01:34:38.170
degree slope,

1598
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:44.170
around 2100 we heard numerous trucks on the main road in just a few minutes.

1599
01:34:44.171 --> 01:34:47.980
Several had driven slowly past our remain overnight position.

1600
01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:49.750
Unfortunately,

1601
01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:54.750
the happy times were spoiled when we soon heard the barking of tracking dogs

1602
01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:00.230
around zero 100 we heard the enemy troops move north on the road.

1603
01:35:00.500 --> 01:35:04.220
While on the east side, someone opened fire with a few AK 47 bursts.

1604
01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:08.690
The distinctive bark of the Russian made weapon jarred us into full alert.

1605
01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:12.710
How long could they keep it up in which direction would they move?

1606
01:35:12.950 --> 01:35:16.400
We sat in the inky darkness, a darkness so complete.

1607
01:35:16.401 --> 01:35:18.590
I couldn't see my hand in front of my face.

1608
01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:22.580
It sounded as though they were making their way north.

1609
01:35:22.610 --> 01:35:25.880
That's how dark it is and you have no night vision.

1610
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:29.000
It's just pitch black. Again,

1611
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:37.880
it didn't take long before we had enemy troops on both sides of us.

1612
01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:39.800
As dense as our cover was,

1613
01:35:39.801 --> 01:35:44.801
we could see the flickering light from the lamps the NVA carried as the enemy.

1614
01:35:44.871 --> 01:35:47.420
Soldiers began probing the bottom tip of the finger.

1615
01:35:47.421 --> 01:35:50.990
We were on vehicle activity on the road picked up noticeably.

1616
01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:55.850
This gave us a very uneasy feeling, had sound not driven us on the NVA,

1617
01:35:55.851 --> 01:35:59.560
might well have spotted us, but as it was, we were a sconce too,

1618
01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:04.570
so deep in that godawful thicket that w that the one enemy soldier who

1619
01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.410
approached our position hesitated and then gave up defeated by the phony

1620
01:36:09.411 --> 01:36:10.244
vegetation.

1621
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:14.870
We could almost feel him thinking better of it and deciding to return to his

1622
01:36:14.871 --> 01:36:15.704
comrades.

1623
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:20.770
Little did he appreciate how close to death he'd come with five car fifteens and

1624
01:36:21.351 --> 01:36:23.930
an m 79 aimed in his direction.

1625
01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:29.210
Slowly the NVA troops tired of their frustrating and uncomfortable search and

1626
01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:33.380
called it off our t, Idaho could finally release the collective breath.

1627
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:34.250
It had been holding.

1628
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:39.350
The danger was not gone not by a long shot but just briefly retired from the

1629
01:36:39.351 --> 01:36:40.520
field of play,

1630
01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:45.610
so thank God you were deep in that Bush. Oh yeah.

1631
01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:48.700
And you know like I forgave sale

1632
01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:51.400
cause it's like this is,

1633
01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.000
we don't need to go that far as I could look on my fatigues. I'm bleeding here.

1634
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:59.290
He's right. The Sal was always right. I always listened to him.

1635
01:37:00.670 --> 01:37:05.670
So the night goes by at firstlight our options were severely limited.

1636
01:37:06.281 --> 01:37:10.150
We couldn't move north, south or east, which left us one choice,

1637
01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:13.930
not wanting to spend another day and night tied to trees on the side of a hill.

1638
01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:17.980
We opted for the obvious and moved out in a Western lead direction for the rest

1639
01:37:17.981 --> 01:37:20.530
of the day. We climbed the side of the steep mountain.

1640
01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:25.680
Did you guys ever move at night or do you guys try pretty much to remain in one

1641
01:37:27.461 --> 01:37:29.760
position at night? Try to stay in one position,

1642
01:37:30.130 --> 01:37:34.900
particularly in a triple canopy because just too much noise in Cambodia.

1643
01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:38.320
When we're on flat territory, we could've moved and we'd thought about it.

1644
01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:42.010
[inaudible] but uh, uh, no, not in Laos.

1645
01:37:43.930 --> 01:37:46.060
Several times the rock face was so steep.

1646
01:37:46.061 --> 01:37:49.630
We had to tie together six foot strands of rope we used for Swiss seats to make

1647
01:37:49.631 --> 01:37:52.660
rope long enough to advance up to the next level of rocks.

1648
01:37:52.690 --> 01:37:55.120
So we're talking serious terrain. Oh, horrible.

1649
01:37:56.970 --> 01:37:58.740
Just as last light was feeding in a darkness,

1650
01:37:58.741 --> 01:38:01.470
we reached the top of the mountain. I was physically beat.

1651
01:38:01.471 --> 01:38:04.500
My pants were torn in my hands, knees and legs were covered with cuts,

1652
01:38:04.501 --> 01:38:06.300
scrapes and bruises. We were a mess.

1653
01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.130
We set up our ROI plan quickly and took turns eating rations before settling

1654
01:38:11.131 --> 01:38:15.480
into the nightwatch rotations. After the previous night nights, Ron,

1655
01:38:15.510 --> 01:38:18.240
this mountain tight mountain top site was paradise.

1656
01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:21.990
We could see enemy trucks moving south, but did nothing about it.

1657
01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.180
We were almost too tired to think extremely dangerous condition to be in wet on

1658
01:38:27.181 --> 01:38:30.960
the ground. Rast was what we needed, not confrontation.

1659
01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:34.600
You guys are exhausted, beat

1660
01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.200
<v 3>and we, when we climbed, we did take our web gear off rucksacks Oh really?</v>

1661
01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:45.940
We tied all the squishies together because we're going straight up.

1662
01:38:46.030 --> 01:38:50.980
So one guy would go up and then you shipped up the backpack,

1663
01:38:51.220 --> 01:38:54.130
then the web gear, put it back on, go to the next level.

1664
01:38:54.460 --> 01:38:58.480
We had to take that spread the shock it several times and just to get up cause

1665
01:38:58.481 --> 01:39:02.140
it was so steep but it was covered with enough vegetation.

1666
01:39:02.290 --> 01:39:05.740
They couldn't see us in the valley so they weren't quite sure where we were.

1667
01:39:05.741 --> 01:39:06.670
And we had put out the,

1668
01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:11.080
the mason stuff and other locations was fouled some of the dogs noses.

1669
01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:13.560
So it an all day climb and uh,

1670
01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.860
with only a couple when we broke for lunch and whatever. But yeah,

1671
01:39:17.861 --> 01:39:19.450
that was a nasty, nasty climb.

1672
01:39:21.020 --> 01:39:21.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1673
01:39:21.490 --> 01:39:25.620
<v 4>When morning came we are woke to a beautiful sunrise and found that we are top</v>

1674
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:29.290
an unbelievably gorgeous Laotian mountain range.

1675
01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:33.160
The next few hours were the most spectacular ones I ever had spent on the ground

1676
01:39:33.161 --> 01:39:35.710
in any AAO. Moving north are wrong. The Ridge line.

1677
01:39:35.711 --> 01:39:38.980
We began gradually descending off and encouraging.

1678
01:39:38.981 --> 01:39:43.330
One beautiful new encountering one beautiful new vista after another.

1679
01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:44.500
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1680
01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:49.500
<v 4>Around 12 or a hundred we found an area overrun with thousands of wild orchids</v>

1681
01:39:50.590 --> 01:39:53.470
in full spectacular bloom back home.

1682
01:39:53.471 --> 01:39:56.500
Each plant would be worth five to $50.

1683
01:39:57.190 --> 01:40:00.640
We decided to take a break in the field and soon everyone with the exception of

1684
01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:04.750
sal was in the middle of them and acting like a delighted child,

1685
01:40:04.990 --> 01:40:08.980
picking the flowers and sticking them in their hair teeth and behind their ears

1686
01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:10.930
or in the buttonholes of their fatigues.

1687
01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:15.130
It was like a spontaneous outburst of happiness and while it was somewhat

1688
01:40:15.131 --> 01:40:18.970
foolish, it was also refreshing. I think we all felt better for it.

1689
01:40:20.410 --> 01:40:24.800
You just take any pictures and know, Oh man, I'm just going to see those. Yeah.

1690
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:26.920
Oh yeah. You had the camera for the underwater bridge.

1691
01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:31.660
He didn't get the orchids, but sal was all business. Oh,

1692
01:40:31.661 --> 01:40:35.970
always. He's [inaudible] come on. What'd they go?

1693
01:40:35.971 --> 01:40:38.500
What was your nickname? Did they call you tilt as well?

1694
01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:43.010
<v 3>No, these, he called me my, because the Vietnamese couldn't handle ours.</v>

1695
01:40:43.310 --> 01:40:44.870
So instead admire was my,

1696
01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.800
<v 4>got it. I could see him looking at you thinking my,</v>

1697
01:40:49.801 --> 01:40:51.720
what are you doing with that damn flower of your hair?

1698
01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:59.590
<v 0>Their phrase was Buku dinky doubt. Very, very stupid. Very stupid. Very crazy.</v>

1699
01:40:59.620 --> 01:41:02.810
Yeah. How good. How good did your, did your Vietnamese get it sucked.

1700
01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.350
<v 3>I had had [inaudible] and that was why we didn't have language training because</v>

1701
01:41:07.410 --> 01:41:10.950
they knew that with SF, uh, put four years,

1702
01:41:10.951 --> 01:41:15.870
like for 64 to 68 were interpreters in place [inaudible] and then we just locked

1703
01:41:15.871 --> 01:41:17.640
out what happened. It was his best one.

1704
01:41:17.641 --> 01:41:22.470
He spoke good English and he cracked in my English and he spoke French.

1705
01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:23.500
Um,

1706
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:26.300
<v 0>was his background that he had all that good language skill. His Dad,</v>

1707
01:41:26.301 --> 01:41:29.820
his son in school in Paris, so he has some education in France.

1708
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:32.960
They spoke four languages and now he's an interpreter. Nom.

1709
01:41:33.190 --> 01:41:34.510
<v 3>Yeah, Bro.</v>

1710
01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:38.740
<v 0>Going back to the book, we,</v>

1711
01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:42.140
we came to a narrow strip of land that headed down from the hill.

1712
01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:46.070
I singled ingles and chow to set out to scout ahead while the rest of us

1713
01:41:46.071 --> 01:41:48.470
remained in place. Chow was 16 years old.

1714
01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:49.570
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1715
01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:51.100
<v 0>he'd been on the team nearly two years.</v>

1716
01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:53.290
So these kids had been on the team since he was 14 years old.

1717
01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.050
<v 3>Yeah. When the team got wiped out,</v>

1718
01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:59.370
chow cow and sewn were the three that we'd hired and brought on and we let a

1719
01:41:59.371 --> 01:42:00.300
couple others go.

1720
01:42:02.010 --> 01:42:03.660
<v 0>He'd been on the team nearly two years ever since.</v>

1721
01:42:03.661 --> 01:42:08.190
Spider parks would help rebuild the team in 68 Charles sensitive ears heard the

1722
01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:09.600
NVA moving up the mountain.

1723
01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:13.710
He warned ingles with hand signals and the two of them abruptly stop moving with

1724
01:42:13.711 --> 01:42:15.810
the enemy less than 10 meters away.

1725
01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:16.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1726
01:42:16.670 --> 01:42:21.350
<v 0>Ingles quietly broke sky squelch on his URC 10 emergency radio several times.</v>

1727
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:23.090
Alerting me to the danger.

1728
01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:24.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1729
01:42:24.540 --> 01:42:26.550
<v 0>The rest of us were about 50 meters away.</v>

1730
01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:31.840
The shit was about to hit the fan because we were so far removed from all their

1731
01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:35.550
support. There was no time to waste. None at all. We needed to jump on.

1732
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:38.550
We need all the jump we could get on things.

1733
01:42:38.551 --> 01:42:43.551
So I quickly contacted a nearby O v 10 Bronco and declared a prairie fire

1734
01:42:43.741 --> 01:42:48.180
emergency setting in motion the string of responses that could save our lives

1735
01:42:48.181 --> 01:42:49.014
and get us out.

1736
01:42:53.070 --> 01:42:55.890
Does everybody, did everyone know, is that like a pro word?

1737
01:42:55.950 --> 01:42:59.040
Prairie fire emergency? Did everyone know exactly what that meant?

1738
01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:00.423
Tack Air at noon.

1739
01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:04.620
<v 3>Right. And uh, then we also had the airborne command control,</v>

1740
01:43:05.130 --> 01:43:09.190
but they weren't always over our a m they couldn't pick up the Fox Mike FMP.

1741
01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:14.310
[inaudible] so in this case we lucked out, um, that uh, ob 10 was,

1742
01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:18.090
I think there were one of the ravens who had,

1743
01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:23.270
they were surprise supporting another CIA operation that was further west until

1744
01:43:23.371 --> 01:43:26.610
they asked. And he had been up her to call and came over.

1745
01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:31.080
That was the first time he worked with ob tens man,

1746
01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:33.803
Lucky Barry.

1747
01:43:35.130 --> 01:43:38.400
<v 0>While I was talking to the pilot, Charles Sao and ingles spring,</v>

1748
01:43:38.401 --> 01:43:43.020
a hastily arranged ambush that [inaudible] on the startled enemy troops when

1749
01:43:43.021 --> 01:43:45.330
their appointment was less than a meter away.

1750
01:43:46.230 --> 01:43:49.680
Chao hit him with a full automatic burst from his car, 15 blowing and backward

1751
01:43:50.710 --> 01:43:54.020
<v 4>Charles sound angles. Then hit the remaining enemy,</v>

1752
01:43:54.021 --> 01:43:58.640
soldiers so hard and fast that they didn't have time to fire a single return

1753
01:43:58.641 --> 01:43:59.474
shot.

1754
01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:04.370
Ingles threw down a hand grenade down the hill to discourage anyone who might be

1755
01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:08.840
around. So this is all something that's happening. God,

1756
01:44:09.330 --> 01:44:14.130
a meter away there. He's really close, man. He came up the hill,

1757
01:44:14.131 --> 01:44:18.720
he was white because that was the first really real firefight the child had been

1758
01:44:18.721 --> 01:44:20.700
in and uh,

1759
01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:25.060
cause he be trained up and like he had the earnest [inaudible] team.

1760
01:44:25.061 --> 01:44:27.060
So this was his mission and that was,

1761
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:30.210
he was down in with John and he was the head of John.

1762
01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:35.670
As the fight began to unfold, I took stock of the situation.

1763
01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:37.770
There weren't too many places for us to go.

1764
01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:40.470
Within minutes of the Bronco's arrival, the piloted spotted us.

1765
01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:45.500
He said he could see more enemy activity north of us along the hill angles and

1766
01:44:46.140 --> 01:44:46.973
sal were on.

1767
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:51.570
He made a run on the enemy concentrations firing his rockets into their

1768
01:44:51.571 --> 01:44:54.450
position. Then he said somewhat laconically,

1769
01:44:54.750 --> 01:44:58.800
I've got two bits of bad news for you. First nom is socked in.

1770
01:44:59.190 --> 01:45:03.570
No assets can launch from there to extract you, which means Thailand assets,

1771
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:07.620
which means at least three hours before the birds arrive on station.

1772
01:45:08.670 --> 01:45:10.270
Second to yourself,

1773
01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:14.610
there are approximately a dozen troops about 800 meters out and moving towards

1774
01:45:14.611 --> 01:45:17.820
you. I think you better sit tight until we get some help.

1775
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:19.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1776
01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:23.880
<v 4>By 1430 a Covey aircraft replaced the Bronco and repeated this sit tight</v>

1777
01:45:23.881 --> 01:45:24.714
suggestion.

1778
01:45:25.050 --> 01:45:28.860
He agreed the eastern Western face of the mountain were too steep to descend.

1779
01:45:28.861 --> 01:45:33.840
He also confirmed the NVA were coming at us from the south and north.

1780
01:45:34.410 --> 01:45:37.970
They were clearly visible as they moved cautiously through the sparse veggie

1781
01:45:37.971 --> 01:45:41.460
vegetation. For the next half hour,

1782
01:45:41.461 --> 01:45:45.780
the enemy troops tried to locate us to discourage them. I directed several

1783
01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:50.070
[inaudible] [inaudible] Skyraider gun runs south of our position,

1784
01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:55.650
so this is another one of these things where I gotta like when you get,

1785
01:45:55.651 --> 01:45:59.040
you got the NVA move into your position and you get told, hey,

1786
01:45:59.041 --> 01:46:00.300
the closest extractor,

1787
01:46:00.330 --> 01:46:03.900
earliest we're going to be able to get you out of here is three hours from now.

1788
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:05.060
Yeah.

1789
01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:09.570
We were up on an area where there is minimal escape routes or the jungle because

1790
01:46:09.571 --> 01:46:13.410
everything was so steep on several different size of that little,

1791
01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:17.160
we're like a little bit of a plateaued or had been like a trail that came down

1792
01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:21.360
and then John and Chao had gone down further,

1793
01:46:21.361 --> 01:46:25.140
another little finger and that's what it had to firefight. He came back up,

1794
01:46:25.141 --> 01:46:29.100
we put a perimeter out and luckily we may radio contact right away. So,

1795
01:46:30.210 --> 01:46:30.600
um,

1796
01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:35.600
Dov 10 went in with his rockets just to say it was 2.75 and then that's when he

1797
01:46:36.901 --> 01:46:38.060
gave us the good news. Yeah.

1798
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:41.100
Good news that it's gonna be three hours at a minimum before they can get you

1799
01:46:41.101 --> 01:46:45.030
help. Yeah. That's why we carried a lot of bullets. Yeah.

1800
01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:47.100
That's a lot of that. It could be a long day.

1801
01:46:47.101 --> 01:46:49.440
I don't know if you can carry enough bullets for three hour firefight.

1802
01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:53.060
That's a nightmare. Uh,

1803
01:46:56.130 --> 01:47:00.600
back to the book of 12.7 millimeter enemy gun in the valley opened up on the

1804
01:47:00.601 --> 01:47:02.240
eight one. Ease.

1805
01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:06.600
I was sitting on the east side looking down at the valley floor after making

1806
01:47:06.601 --> 01:47:10.980
another gun run that a [inaudible] pilot told me he was pissed because the enemy

1807
01:47:10.981 --> 01:47:15.630
gunner was coming too close to him and his wing man. He wanted to nail him asap.

1808
01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:19.050
I gave the pilot where I fought was clear what I thought were clear verbal

1809
01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.440
directions to where the enemy Gunnar was located, but he couldn't find them,

1810
01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:27.960
so I told him simply to watch the ground for my and follow my tracers. At that.

1811
01:47:27.961 --> 01:47:31.800
I fired a short burst toward a clump of trees in the valley that were maybe 500

1812
01:47:31.801 --> 01:47:36.030
meters away. The pilot had no trouble seeing where my tracers hit.

1813
01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:37.230
Thanks partner.

1814
01:47:37.230 --> 01:47:40.440
He said in the low southern draw and then rolled in for the kill.

1815
01:47:40.590 --> 01:47:43.350
It was the most beautiful napalm dive I've ever seen.

1816
01:47:43.530 --> 01:47:47.070
The pilot came out of the sky pointing straight down his engine screaming.

1817
01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:51.360
It reminded me of dive bombers I'd seen on the television series of victory at

1818
01:47:51.361 --> 01:47:52.194
sea.

1819
01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:56.070
I really thought I was watching a World War II movie because I was so high up in

1820
01:47:56.071 --> 01:47:56.790
the mountain.

1821
01:47:56.790 --> 01:48:00.540
I was looking down on the Skyraider when at the absolute last second,

1822
01:48:00.750 --> 01:48:05.010
he released a napalm canister and pulled out of his gutsy dive.

1823
01:48:05.710 --> 01:48:09.640
It was a perfect strike. The impact generated a secondary explosion,

1824
01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:13.450
which was probably the gunner spare amo going off around him.

1825
01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:16.000
Black oily smoke billowed up.

1826
01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:20.680
There was not a whisper of sound from the former gun in placement for the next

1827
01:48:20.681 --> 01:48:21.191
three hours,

1828
01:48:21.191 --> 01:48:25.570
I directed air strike after air strike around our position and in the valley

1829
01:48:27.930 --> 01:48:29.190
at 1730 hours.

1830
01:48:29.191 --> 01:48:34.080
We heard the very welcome sound of the hh threes coming our way.

1831
01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:36.030
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

1832
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:37.350
<v 4>as they approached in the distance,</v>

1833
01:48:37.351 --> 01:48:42.351
the NVA pushed up from the north and hit Sal's claymore further south of us.

1834
01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:44.520
Another machine gun opened up from the valley.

1835
01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:47.400
As I gave Covey the compass heading to its position,

1836
01:48:47.401 --> 01:48:50.670
I caught sight of an enemy soldier climbing a tree about a hundred meters away.

1837
01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:51.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1838
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:55.380
<v 4>He had handed his RPG launcher to a nearby comrade while he'd gotten to that</v>

1839
01:48:55.381 --> 01:48:57.810
position, it was clear he was looking for Archie,

1840
01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:00.570
Idaho or hoping to nail an air force chopper.

1841
01:49:01.170 --> 01:49:03.840
I was too far away to shout and alert to the other team members.

1842
01:49:04.050 --> 01:49:06.600
For the first time. In my 16 months of running missions,

1843
01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:09.630
I extended the collapsible stock of my car.

1844
01:49:09.631 --> 01:49:13.890
15 normally it remained compressed to minimize the length of the weapon,

1845
01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:18.270
but now I wanted it extended to help stabilize my aim.

1846
01:49:19.050 --> 01:49:23.310
Once I was ready, I carefully put the NVA soldier in my gun site.

1847
01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:24.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:27.720
<v 4>In that fleeting moment, I felt like God,</v>

1849
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:32.370
I had the power of life and death concentrated in my fingertip.

1850
01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:35.820
As I grounded my elbow to steady my arm,

1851
01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:41.360
I found myself silently hoping the NVA troop would be unable to find the team

1852
01:49:41.371 --> 01:49:43.650
and simply climb back down the tree.

1853
01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:49.000
He didn't see either me or my car. 15 in a troubling way,

1854
01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:51.580
it seemed unfair or unsportsmanlike,

1855
01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:55.390
but war is not designed to be a sporting contest.

1856
01:49:56.230 --> 01:50:00.340
If the situation were reversed, I had little doubt what he would opt to do.

1857
01:50:01.210 --> 01:50:04.210
Although these reflections took less than a moment to form,

1858
01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:07.270
they caused deep soul searching on my part.

1859
01:50:08.370 --> 01:50:08.550
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1860
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:12.960
<v 4>I found myself recalling my third grade Sunday school teacher,</v>

1861
01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:18.500
Mrs Myrtle right shirt and her treatment of the 10 commandments,

1862
01:50:18.781 --> 01:50:23.340
especially the one that proclaims thou shalt not kill Hell.

1863
01:50:23.341 --> 01:50:27.960
If I had met this treed soldier on the streets of Hanoi without guns and beyond

1864
01:50:27.961 --> 01:50:29.370
the rhetoric of politicians,

1865
01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:34.020
we'd probably be able to find lots of common ground between us and dozens of

1866
01:50:34.021 --> 01:50:35.910
purely human things to talk about.

1867
01:50:37.110 --> 01:50:37.320
<v 5>Okay,</v>

1868
01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.620
<v 4>but that could not be. Not now, not at this given moment.</v>

1869
01:50:41.730 --> 01:50:46.110
Also in my mind was the knowledge he would receive a metal if he ever managed to

1870
01:50:46.111 --> 01:50:48.150
kill me or one of my team members.

1871
01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:51.720
As I watched and reflected his comrade,

1872
01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.750
reached up and handed him a little rocket launcher,

1873
01:50:55.680 --> 01:50:58.440
I could tell it was unloaded what I had,

1874
01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:02.220
what I had come to think of my personnel,

1875
01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:07.250
my personal NVA moved a little farther up the tree craning his neck to find us

1876
01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:11.970
from the corner of my eye. I could see sun moved towards sal,

1877
01:51:12.960 --> 01:51:16.050
and at that very moment someone passed up around for the RPG.

1878
01:51:16.230 --> 01:51:18.930
I still refused to yield to the inevitable.

1879
01:51:19.230 --> 01:51:23.150
I continued to hold onto the stubborn hope that he would abandon his cause,

1880
01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:26.850
climbed down the damn tree and walk away. Instead,

1881
01:51:26.851 --> 01:51:31.770
he fitted the round into the end of the w, the launcher. I still watched still,

1882
01:51:31.771 --> 01:51:36.630
I waited even after he'd put the weapon to his shoulder as he nestled his neck

1883
01:51:36.631 --> 01:51:39.510
against it and began to take careful aim toward us.

1884
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:41.280
I leveled my sight on his head.

1885
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:45.900
I pulled the trigger a single yet timeless shot.

1886
01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:50.110
He dropped from the tree out of sight,

1887
01:51:51.310 --> 01:51:52.570
but not out of my mind.

1888
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:58.140
<v 5>One of those moments.</v>

1889
01:52:03.650 --> 01:52:04.730
<v 4>How far was he away?</v>

1890
01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:10.100
<v 3>When was the range? Well over maybe a foot football field and a half,</v>

1891
01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:14.090
two fields. Cause like on the cusp of this,

1892
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:17.520
of the hill and he was around on the side. Nick is here,

1893
01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:21.680
there was like a tree he climbed up that was above the regular vegetation.

1894
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:23.600
So I'm not sure how high he went,

1895
01:52:23.601 --> 01:52:26.810
but I could see him the beginning and then just waited.

1896
01:52:28.110 --> 01:52:28.460
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1897
01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:33.140
<v 3>Cause uh, and then when he got that damn RPG [inaudible] yeah.</v>

1898
01:52:33.170 --> 01:52:34.970
Then it's time to do what you gotta do. Oh yeah.

1899
01:52:35.230 --> 01:52:36.063
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1900
01:52:39.210 --> 01:52:44.160
<v 4>And once again, I'm going to make this claim. I'm not reading this whole book.</v>

1901
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:48.920
I'm just jumping around and you should read this whole book if you're listening

1902
01:52:48.921 --> 01:52:52.520
to this because I'm getting 10% of what's going on in here.

1903
01:52:54.650 --> 01:52:57.050
Uh, this part continues on. Seconds later,

1904
01:52:57.051 --> 01:52:59.690
one of the approaching hh three pilots broke.

1905
01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:00.813
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1906
01:53:02.210 --> 01:53:06.900
<v 4>Broke into my reverie by commenting somewhat frantically on the heavy ground</v>

1907
01:53:06.901 --> 01:53:09.210
fire. He was taken from the mountains south of our position.

1908
01:53:09.810 --> 01:53:12.540
There was a moment's hesitation before he sadly announced,

1909
01:53:12.541 --> 01:53:16.110
I think we have some mechanical problems. We are going home.

1910
01:53:17.010 --> 01:53:19.230
We could see the helicopters, and they looked fine to us.

1911
01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:21.120
They were less than two kilometers out.

1912
01:53:21.180 --> 01:53:23.370
When they turned and disappeared into the fading Sun.

1913
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:27.580
Our morale sank as they vanished after cursing our lack of, uh,

1914
01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:32.340
after cursing our lack of look and the pilot, I told the team to take a nap.

1915
01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:37.400
It going to be a long night. So there goes your ride out.

1916
01:53:38.080 --> 01:53:43.030
You've already been there for freaking ever. And you see those guys, Hey,

1917
01:53:43.150 --> 01:53:45.280
we got some mechanical problems. We're out of here. Yeah,

1918
01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:46.630
it was a very unhappy moment.

1919
01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:56.890
Uh, so you guys, uh, you tell the guys to take a nap. You take a little nap.

1920
01:53:56.950 --> 01:54:00.970
Yeah. And back to the book around 1930 ingles roused me. Wake up.

1921
01:54:00.971 --> 01:54:03.580
You're not going to believe this shit. As I came around,

1922
01:54:03.730 --> 01:54:08.730
he was pointing south up the mountain side from about 30 meters from our

1923
01:54:09.041 --> 01:54:11.860
perimeter. And as far as we could see,

1924
01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:16.630
there were dozens and dozens of lanterns bouncing and swinging along.

1925
01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:19.780
Each lantern was carried by an enemy soldier.

1926
01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:22.960
In between each lantern were many more soldiers.

1927
01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:26.290
The same scene was on folding to the north of us.

1928
01:54:26.470 --> 01:54:29.470
The NVA were coming up the hill on mass.

1929
01:54:30.190 --> 01:54:33.940
We could see at least a dozen trucks unloading hundreds of NVA troops in the

1930
01:54:33.941 --> 01:54:37.720
valley. Also across the valley and up on the plateau to the east.

1931
01:54:37.930 --> 01:54:42.460
There were hundreds of lights moving everywhere, like swarming, fireflies,

1932
01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:47.580
flitting around in the night in a smaller valley west of us still more lights,

1933
01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:51.940
more and VA, more trouble, just more,

1934
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:55.270
more and more of everything we did not want to see.

1935
01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:00.820
I felt the tremendous weight of just how small Arty Idaho was.

1936
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:03.460
How terribly isolated and alone we were,

1937
01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:06.160
how incredibly vulnerable.

1938
01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:12.060
All of a sudden I found myself praying for reasons only.

1939
01:55:12.061 --> 01:55:13.290
He understands.

1940
01:55:13.890 --> 01:55:17.370
My prayer was answered as a few minutes later.

1941
01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:19.080
The first specter,

1942
01:55:19.081 --> 01:55:24.081
c one 30 gunship arrived on target with its two 20 millimeter cannons and four

1943
01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:28.830
7.62 millimeter mini guns ready for action.

1944
01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:37.600
That had to be the most horrifying thing that you could ever think of.

1945
01:55:39.050 --> 01:55:44.050
You wake up and you see these enemy lights surrounding you,

1946
01:55:44.490 --> 01:55:48.390
hundreds of them, and you know that they're looking. Those hundreds,

1947
01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:53.070
maybe thousands of enemy personnel are looking for you and your six man team.

1948
01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:57.330
<v 3>Oh yeah, they're coming for us. And it was just like, yeah, I'll be,</v>

1949
01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:00.490
I'll never forget when John woke me up. I mean,

1950
01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:04.070
it was just one of those moments he just like, oh my God, fuck

1951
01:56:04.100 --> 01:56:08.870
<v 4>me to tears and help me, Lord.</v>

1952
01:56:09.230 --> 01:56:11.490
Yeah, please wake up. You're not the mom.

1953
01:56:11.491 --> 01:56:14.720
Keep it right about now if you're not praying, I'm back in New Jersey.

1954
01:56:14.721 --> 01:56:19.160
Please start praying now and then what? What? Do you have any idea?

1955
01:56:19.161 --> 01:56:20.750
Did you ever find out what were the,

1956
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:22.760
see one 30 came from where the spectrum came from,

1957
01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:26.590
<v 3>had that'd be all Thailand. And so it just randomly showed up.</v>

1958
01:56:26.650 --> 01:56:30.940
I'll know that somebody was the Covey that we had talked to earlier who brought

1959
01:56:30.941 --> 01:56:33.400
the helicopters out, uh,

1960
01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:36.660
because the cub was still trying to work with us for other era assets.

1961
01:56:36.670 --> 01:56:41.290
And when it got dark we lost everything conventional. So all the a ones, fans,

1962
01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:43.330
phantom jets, um,

1963
01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:47.800
gone and they didn't have helicopter gunships out of Thailand,

1964
01:56:48.070 --> 01:56:50.260
just transport vehicle aircraft.

1965
01:56:51.160 --> 01:56:54.340
So we had that quiet spell and um,

1966
01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:58.960
so they had notified Spector and they had told me that they're going to try and

1967
01:56:58.961 --> 01:57:03.850
get a specter out. And uh, had you worked with the spectrum before? Uh, yes,

1968
01:57:03.851 --> 01:57:07.870
we used before. Um, but nothing like this night.

1969
01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:14.190
<v 4>So for anyone that does know to a c one 30 specter gunship is, it's a,</v>

1970
01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:17.430
it's a c one 30, which is like a big transport aircraft,

1971
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:21.240
but they put some big weapon tree, in this case, two 20 millimeter cannons.

1972
01:57:21.241 --> 01:57:24.240
And for 7.62 mini guns,

1973
01:57:24.241 --> 01:57:29.010
which fire 6,000 rounds a minute. Correct. Something crazy. Yeah. Yeah.

1974
01:57:29.011 --> 01:57:29.490
It's like a,

1975
01:57:29.490 --> 01:57:32.460
it looks like a laser beam when the tracers come out of these things,

1976
01:57:32.461 --> 01:57:34.440
dog piss it from the sky or that

1977
01:57:37.410 --> 01:57:42.390
and uh, so these guys show up and here we go. Back to the book.

1978
01:57:42.391 --> 01:57:43.620
This was this awesome.

1979
01:57:43.621 --> 01:57:48.390
A wave array of weaponry could be made to form a magic link with my emergency

1980
01:57:48.391 --> 01:57:50.310
strobe light. Once that link was established,

1981
01:57:50.311 --> 01:57:53.940
the gunner could dance the incredible fire power of his four mini guns,

1982
01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:58.740
which is 24,000 rounds per minute total within five feet of us.

1983
01:57:59.370 --> 01:58:01.350
It was wondrous. It was miraculous.

1984
01:58:01.650 --> 01:58:05.130
It could save us on this particular night. However,

1985
01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:09.480
we were faced with a highly unusual, if not unique problem.

1986
01:58:09.690 --> 01:58:14.690
The pilot circling over US reported he couldn't pick out the teens strobe light

1987
01:58:14.701 --> 01:58:17.280
because there were so many other lights surrounding us.

1988
01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:22.110
The myriad of lanterns must have made the dark earth look like a pin cushion

1989
01:58:22.111 --> 01:58:26.430
illuminated from within. No problem. I said, I'll turn off mine.

1990
01:58:26.850 --> 01:58:30.540
You get the rest. Hit the ridge line west of the valley.

1991
01:58:30.780 --> 01:58:33.960
Give me a minute to put my team on the safe side of the mountain.

1992
01:58:35.490 --> 01:58:38.580
The Specter commenced to putting on an amazing display of fire power.

1993
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:41.530
Once again, we gave thanks for being on the right side of the fight,

1994
01:58:41.531 --> 01:58:45.400
the one that had uncle Sam's air force and Spector on its team.

1995
01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:49.690
After ripping up scores of body and carving out large patches of empty darkness

1996
01:58:49.691 --> 01:58:52.960
on the Ridge Line, the specter directed his deadly fire into the valley.

1997
01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:57.910
More lanterns were snuffed out and the darkness spread like a stain as lights

1998
01:58:57.911 --> 01:58:59.770
and lives were extinguished.

1999
01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:05.290
The Specter crew finally expended all of its ordinance and the pilot apologized

2000
01:59:05.291 --> 01:59:09.190
for running out of ammo. The next specter arrived seconds later,

2001
01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:13.070
so they, they were just, they knew you were in a bad way and they were coming.

2002
01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:13.721
Oh yeah.

2003
01:59:13.721 --> 01:59:18.721
We were so happy that the second one showed up because now the lights are out so

2004
01:59:19.061 --> 01:59:21.610
we can turn the strobe light on and had direct Camo.

2005
01:59:21.670 --> 01:59:25.060
Did they have night vision back then in the specters? Oh yeah. Okay.

2006
01:59:25.061 --> 01:59:30.010
At everything. See your force. Yeah. Yes, it is.

2007
01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:31.120
Yeah. I mean,

2008
01:59:31.121 --> 01:59:35.650
there's the specter gunship is just the most awesome asset to have overhead for

2009
01:59:35.651 --> 01:59:39.160
ground support cause the capability, the visual capability that it has,

2010
01:59:39.161 --> 01:59:43.630
and then the accuracy of fire. And this is 1970. Think how accurate that was.

2011
01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:48.430
Oh, what they can do now. Oh yeah, yeah. Um,

2012
01:59:49.930 --> 01:59:51.280
the next specter arrived seconds later,

2013
01:59:51.281 --> 01:59:54.460
he quickly locked onto our strobe and worked the southern slope with a

2014
01:59:54.461 --> 01:59:56.650
vengeance. Marching his guns right up to the trail,

2015
01:59:57.730 --> 02:00:01.960
right up the trail to the top of the ridge beyond our line of sight. He worked.

2016
02:00:01.990 --> 02:00:04.720
Then he worked at Valley and the Southeastern Mountain Ridge.

2017
02:00:04.721 --> 02:00:07.930
A third specter arrived and worked our southern perimeter again,

2018
02:00:07.931 --> 02:00:11.740
systematically walking. It's fiery, led up the mountain around us.

2019
02:00:11.741 --> 02:00:15.340
There was no longer any light above us. No Moon, no stars.

2020
02:00:15.341 --> 02:00:16.780
The only sound was the roar of the sea.

2021
02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:20.110
One 30 overhead in the absolute darkness.

2022
02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:22.600
He could not be seen until his guns opened up.

2023
02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:26.500
Then tongues of fire seem to erupt out of nowhere,

2024
02:00:26.501 --> 02:00:31.210
like spontaneously generated bolts of lightning and the outlines of specters

2025
02:00:31.211 --> 02:00:36.160
fuselage would appear in brief flashes as a pale and ghostly silhouette and

2026
02:00:36.161 --> 02:00:37.960
airborne grim reaper.

2027
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:41.500
When spectrum moved to other targets,

2028
02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:44.140
we could hear the enemy dragging away his dead.

2029
02:00:45.520 --> 02:00:50.520
At zero zero 45 Sao said some NVA were in the grass about 20 meters south of us.

2030
02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:57.310
A few minutes later he blew the claymores. We all instinctively flinched.

2031
02:00:57.311 --> 02:00:57.851
For some reason,

2032
02:00:57.851 --> 02:01:01.390
claymores always sounded more thunderous at night and caught you by surprise.

2033
02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:06.010
After the dust settled, we again heard NVA troops dragging away their bodies.

2034
02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:10.510
They never spoke. We heard no cries of pain.

2035
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.921
They're silent.

2036
02:01:11.921 --> 02:01:16.921
Execution of grim duty was at once Erie and admirable Jesus.

2037
02:01:17.921 --> 02:01:22.690
They were tough. They fought hard and died hard.

2038
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:27.610
So you wouldn't even, you'd hear these guys getting wounded,

2039
02:01:27.611 --> 02:01:31.180
getting blown up and they wouldn't even scream. They wouldn't cry.

2040
02:01:31.230 --> 02:01:34.640
It was just silence. It was amazing. Tuesday,

2041
02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:36.640
it's mind boggling.

2042
02:01:37.620 --> 02:01:41.600
Think that all those guys who were or just dead Kinda dead. We know,

2043
02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:44.900
but there had to be some wounded and of course not a sound,

2044
02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:47.930
but you hear them dragging the bodies.

2045
02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:49.653
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2046
02:01:49.790 --> 02:01:51.290
<v 4>I don't know how many we killed that night.</v>

2047
02:01:55.570 --> 02:01:58.330
Go back to the book. Shortly before the next specter arrived,

2048
02:01:58.390 --> 02:02:02.050
I moved my team away from the edge of the slope and into the high grasses Sao

2049
02:02:02.051 --> 02:02:05.500
placed one more claim, more down on the northern slope. In short order,

2050
02:02:06.130 --> 02:02:07.750
specter locked onto our strobe light.

2051
02:02:08.590 --> 02:02:11.410
He reported that cloud cover was beginning to roll in the EO.

2052
02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:13.360
When spectre dropped,

2053
02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:17.740
when spectra then dropped illumination flares over a sow's eyes turned as big as

2054
02:02:17.741 --> 02:02:22.090
pizza tins, NVA troops within five meters of us,

2055
02:02:22.450 --> 02:02:27.040
all of about 15 feet blinded by intense white light.

2056
02:02:27.370 --> 02:02:31.060
They could not immediately make us out as we nestled into the high grass,

2057
02:02:32.230 --> 02:02:37.000
but this was a little real constellation. They would spot us soon enough,

2058
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:42.120
I whispered into the radio asking Spector just how close he could bring the

2059
02:02:42.121 --> 02:02:45.990
ordinance to my strobe light as close as you want it.

2060
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.863
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2061
02:02:48.110 --> 02:02:52.610
<v 4>He first replied, I want it five feet in front of my southern perimeter.</v>

2062
02:02:52.670 --> 02:02:55.040
I responded, well, he hesitated.

2063
02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.980
I can't bring it in any closer than 25 meters from your perimeter.

2064
02:02:57.981 --> 02:03:00.860
Unless you're willing to accept responsibility for any casualties,

2065
02:03:01.100 --> 02:03:06.010
we may accidentally inflict. We have to record you saying it.

2066
02:03:06.780 --> 02:03:06.990
<v 2>Okay,</v>

2067
02:03:06.990 --> 02:03:09.870
<v 4>I wanted to scream. You dumb fucking idiot.</v>

2068
02:03:10.050 --> 02:03:13.770
They're five meters away and you're going to quote in your quoting regulations

2069
02:03:13.771 --> 02:03:17.700
to me. Just kill the fuckers before they kill us instead.

2070
02:03:17.701 --> 02:03:18.960
And feeling like a complete fool.

2071
02:03:18.961 --> 02:03:22.590
I whispered that I was fully willing to accept responsibility for any and all

2072
02:03:22.591 --> 02:03:25.980
casualties that may or may not result from his efforts to save our lives.

2073
02:03:27.330 --> 02:03:32.160
I followed up by saying now bringing it in as tight as you can to the light.

2074
02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:36.630
I'm holding it up now move south from my light. I'll take my chances with you.

2075
02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:40.960
The gun crew finally opened. Fire in there in the fuselage,

2076
02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:43.000
cracked over our heads.

2077
02:03:43.810 --> 02:03:47.680
The ground in front of us are corrupted as thousands of rounds ripped into it.

2078
02:03:47.681 --> 02:03:52.681
Kicking up stones and dirt and tossing NVA soldiers around Mike Rag Dolls again.

2079
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:57.220
Spector solely marched his stuff southward from our strobe light moving up the

2080
02:03:57.760 --> 02:03:58.593
ridge.

2081
02:04:00.550 --> 02:04:00.730
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

2082
02:04:00.730 --> 02:04:02.920
<v 4>danger close. Oh yeah,</v>

2083
02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:09.480
so the flare goes off and south sees that the enemy are five meters from where

2084
02:04:10.601 --> 02:04:14.000
you're at. Yeah. I didn't realize they were that close.

2085
02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:18.110
They would are quiet. I mean they kept coming all night

2086
02:04:20.210 --> 02:04:25.070
and because it was pitch black and they were just so quiet and they just

2087
02:04:25.071 --> 02:04:27.680
probably moved during the wind or move during when rounds were hitting or

2088
02:04:27.681 --> 02:04:30.290
whatever, and they made it tough within five meters.

2089
02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:36.290
I mean that's when you're making this radio call. It's a miracle.

2090
02:04:36.291 --> 02:04:38.130
They couldn't hear you. They just didn't start shooting

2091
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:40.050
<v 6>towards your direction when you make the radio call.</v>

2092
02:04:40.170 --> 02:04:41.090
That's why I was waiting for,

2093
02:04:41.110 --> 02:04:44.970
I was waiting for that next AK to open up on my voice.

2094
02:04:46.530 --> 02:04:51.420
Especially when they're asking you for the, Oh yeah. Oh,

2095
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:54.750
you talk about moments.

2096
02:05:00.030 --> 02:05:04.560
That's insane. Totally. I wonder what the, I mean that's,

2097
02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:09.190
I'm actually surprised that they could pull off five meters. It was just for a,

2098
02:05:09.210 --> 02:05:11.730
anyone that's listening that doesn't understand this, this aircraft,

2099
02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:14.910
I don't know what, what altitude where they at? Do you have any idea?

2100
02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:18.960
They had to be at least two to 3000 feet above us. So,

2101
02:05:19.080 --> 02:05:23.130
and I don't know what the height of the mountain range or that, um,

2102
02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:28.170
a little plateau that we were on there, but several thousand feet above us,

2103
02:05:28.171 --> 02:05:32.490
they locked in that and, and put rounds within five meters of you. Oh yeah.

2104
02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:33.511
Yeah. I mean,

2105
02:05:33.511 --> 02:05:36.810
I could see they'd do it now because now they've got computers and they've got

2106
02:05:36.811 --> 02:05:41.190
all these, I mean, just incredible systems up there. I mean,

2107
02:05:41.191 --> 02:05:45.570
I've been in the modern AC one 30. They're ridiculous. Oh, is that right?

2108
02:05:45.571 --> 02:05:48.960
You've been at a, yeah. Yeah. They're crazy. Like they're, they're the, the,

2109
02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:54.670
the capability that they have is just completely ridiculous, but I can't, no, I,

2110
02:05:54.710 --> 02:05:59.160
I mean, I know there's no way they had that same technology back in 1970.

2111
02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:02.320
It just impossible. You know, there's more technology in,

2112
02:06:02.430 --> 02:06:06.150
in my phone than is in 1970 bird.

2113
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:10.200
Those air force guys were good. And, uh, you know, we just kept a strobe light,

2114
02:06:10.260 --> 02:06:14.160
right pointed at the aircraft. So when it circled the, uh,

2115
02:06:14.730 --> 02:06:18.030
whoever had the m city, not, I did it for a while, then we'd take turns with it.

2116
02:06:18.031 --> 02:06:22.170
But we always followed the aircraft so it would be directly linked into that

2117
02:06:22.410 --> 02:06:25.800
stove line. That's right. Cause you had your, you put the strobe into the m 79,

2118
02:06:25.801 --> 02:06:30.150
right? Yeah. So it was only directional. Right. So we go straight up. Yeah.

2119
02:06:30.180 --> 02:06:31.890
So anybody on the ground wouldn't see it.

2120
02:06:32.280 --> 02:06:33.113
<v 5>Hmm.</v>

2121
02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:38.360
<v 6>So that's what's happening as these guys are five meters from you. Oh yeah.</v>

2122
02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:50.520
This is ridiculous. That's why I thought that night also

2123
02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:54.660
send me a King Bee, please. Yeah.

2124
02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:57.033
<v 5>Um,</v>

2125
02:06:58.070 --> 02:07:01.100
<v 4>back to the book between Bursa fire, he dropped more flares this time.</v>

2126
02:07:01.101 --> 02:07:03.200
The illumination revealed no movement south of us.

2127
02:07:03.201 --> 02:07:08.201
Instead Chow gleefully reported that there were Boku dead VC,

2128
02:07:09.250 --> 02:07:12.520
but the south quiet specter started on the northern flank and marched,

2129
02:07:12.580 --> 02:07:15.070
fired down the finger of land.

2130
02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:16.930
When I reported hearing more trucks in the valley,

2131
02:07:17.040 --> 02:07:20.770
that gun crews pounded them into silence and another specter circled us and laid

2132
02:07:20.771 --> 02:07:22.420
down its deadly ring of fire again,

2133
02:07:22.690 --> 02:07:24.730
bring it to within five feet of our strobe light.

2134
02:07:25.630 --> 02:07:27.370
Somewhere around zero 400 summer,

2135
02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:31.870
early morning fog and haze moved in as the last specter moved out.

2136
02:07:32.800 --> 02:07:33.020
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2137
02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:35.980
<v 4>Once the spectrum was gone, the NVA started moving toward us once</v>

2138
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:39.100
<v 0>more from the south. Only this time with real vengeance.</v>

2139
02:07:40.110 --> 02:07:40.943
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2140
02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:45.220
<v 0>Spectra spectrum killed a lot of their comrades and they were in no mood to back</v>

2141
02:07:45.221 --> 02:07:50.200
off. But we managed to hold them off by employing what we called our guests,

2142
02:07:50.201 --> 02:07:53.170
whether I'm throwing a grey NAIT or not tactic,

2143
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:57.610
which had a way of making almost an enemy almost any enemy. Think twice.

2144
02:07:57.611 --> 02:08:00.820
What was that all about? I didn't cover it in the book, but you wrote about it,

2145
02:08:00.821 --> 02:08:01.654
but what?

2146
02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:05.520
<v 3>Well, it's another version of hide and go seek with a, uh, could,</v>

2147
02:08:05.521 --> 02:08:08.730
we only had a limited amount of grenades. We used some already.

2148
02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:12.180
And so we knew that when we threw the grenade,

2149
02:08:12.181 --> 02:08:15.420
when the land that you would hear them run, that you would hear.

2150
02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:18.660
So we knew we were getting low.

2151
02:08:18.661 --> 02:08:23.661
So sal went out and got stones and Chow and that had the team went out and got

2152
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:26.190
stone. Somehow they came back.

2153
02:08:26.700 --> 02:08:30.610
So we'd wait until he would tell us,

2154
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:34.760
cause somehow he shall could just tell where they were. I could,

2155
02:08:34.770 --> 02:08:39.150
I didn't have that kind of definitive skill set. So he, uh, his signal,

2156
02:08:39.151 --> 02:08:42.580
he would let us know or he would just throw the rock. He told a rock,

2157
02:08:42.660 --> 02:08:44.850
you hear him scurry away like rats could.

2158
02:08:44.851 --> 02:08:47.850
They thought the [inaudible] was coming, so we throw another rock,

2159
02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:52.680
so it'd be less scurrying. So then we wait and throw another rock.

2160
02:08:52.681 --> 02:08:55.080
It'd be less scurrying than we throw it, another hand grenade.

2161
02:08:57.150 --> 02:08:59.490
So in that, this went on for quite a while, you know,

2162
02:08:59.590 --> 02:09:03.750
we always carried at least 10 hand-grenades I always carry these 10 or ditch

2163
02:09:03.751 --> 02:09:07.260
hatchery 10 yourself. Oh yeah, sure.

2164
02:09:07.261 --> 02:09:09.720
I had a cup on a strap and always in the rucksack.

2165
02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:16.740
<v 0>And here's why. Just for that mission. Yeah. Apparently.</v>

2166
02:09:16.810 --> 02:09:19.260
Little did I realize you needed 30 yeah.

2167
02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:25.650
We've stained from firing our weapons because the muzzle flashes would've marked

2168
02:09:25.651 --> 02:09:29.250
our position too clearly for the RPG gunners who had fired several inaccurate

2169
02:09:29.251 --> 02:09:32.790
rounds at us during the night. Fortunately, they hadn't come very close.

2170
02:09:32.970 --> 02:09:35.550
We played these deadly games with the enemy until sunrise.

2171
02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:39.420
At one point we broke a major thrust by tossing a white phosphorus grade

2172
02:09:39.450 --> 02:09:43.950
grenade. One of the most fearsome things I know of. We couldn't see them,

2173
02:09:43.951 --> 02:09:46.140
but we could smell burning flesh.

2174
02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:52.800
At around zero six 30 we heard an NVA officer or senior NCO calling role in the

2175
02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:55.444
distance.

2176
02:09:56.040 --> 02:09:56.210
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

2177
02:09:56.210 --> 02:09:58.460
<v 0>it appeared. Few people answered him.</v>

2178
02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:00.033
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2179
02:10:00.090 --> 02:10:02.190
<v 0>As the sun finally burned off the fog,</v>

2180
02:10:02.460 --> 02:10:05.850
we worked tactical airstrike with fandoms and sky Raiders.

2181
02:10:06.150 --> 02:10:07.650
A couple of machine gun positions,

2182
02:10:07.651 --> 02:10:11.160
open fire and hit one of the a one he is a fan of blue,

2183
02:10:11.161 --> 02:10:13.500
one of the gun crews to hell with a 500 pound bomb.

2184
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:18.990
The a one he knocked out the second one minutes after it opened fire because

2185
02:10:19.051 --> 02:10:21.390
there were no more specter aircraft to call on.

2186
02:10:21.630 --> 02:10:24.800
I continued to working with a peer of [inaudible],

2187
02:10:24.990 --> 02:10:27.210
having them make run after run,

2188
02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:32.780
I could talk directly to the lead pilot and he and his wing man executed my

2189
02:10:33.771 --> 02:10:34.160
every

2190
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:37.250
<v 4>request or direction flawlessly. Damn.</v>

2191
02:10:37.251 --> 02:10:40.850
You had to love those [inaudible] pilots. Finally,

2192
02:10:40.851 --> 02:10:45.410
we could hear in the distance the sweet, sweet sound of approaching helicopters,

2193
02:10:45.440 --> 02:10:49.190
big hh threes churning their way our way.

2194
02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:51.260
It was time to pull out all the stops.

2195
02:10:51.261 --> 02:10:55.970
I used every available support aircraft f fours and a one [inaudible] to raise

2196
02:10:55.971 --> 02:10:59.630
hell and suppress enemy fire as they roared in with guns blazing.

2197
02:10:59.840 --> 02:11:02.810
We could see the hh three's tagging along and they're awake.

2198
02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:07.130
I told Covey to have the hh three gun crews focus their fire on our southern

2199
02:11:07.131 --> 02:11:09.860
perimeter and we'd handled the northern side.

2200
02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:13.940
I also requested they land as close as possible to the north slope and not pay

2201
02:11:13.941 --> 02:11:16.880
any attention to the claymores explosions we'd be setting off.

2202
02:11:17.240 --> 02:11:18.860
I didn't want to spook these guys off,

2203
02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:23.390
so the the Hilos land,

2204
02:11:24.620 --> 02:11:29.090
every one of the team wants a board immediately went to the starboard window or

2205
02:11:29.091 --> 02:11:33.420
faced out the tailgate and began firing on full automatic as the HH threes

2206
02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:37.430
revved up to full power. I was the last to leave and before heading for the LZ,

2207
02:11:37.431 --> 02:11:40.190
I set off the last claim where we had put on the northern perimeter.

2208
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:44.270
Then I ran like hell bent over like a cripple and cursing the prop wash that was

2209
02:11:44.271 --> 02:11:47.630
trying hard to push me backward as I made my dash.

2210
02:11:47.631 --> 02:11:51.200
I remember being surprised and not seeing a single dead body,

2211
02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:55.670
although I passed a slew of blood trails and saw a lot of dark wet stains on the

2212
02:11:55.671 --> 02:12:00.140
ground. The second I was through the door, the hh three lifted off the ground.

2213
02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:01.670
There was nothing but sporadic,

2214
02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:06.760
small arms fire coming at us and in the end the extraction was relatively calm.

2215
02:12:07.161 --> 02:12:07.994
One,

2216
02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:13.590
it seemed as if the enemy was dispirited and just going through the motions.

2217
02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:15.320
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

2218
02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:18.950
<v 4>I had a feeling they wanted us out of the AAO as badly as we wanted to leave.</v>

2219
02:12:19.310 --> 02:12:22.040
Nonetheless, we all continued firing on full automatic.

2220
02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:27.020
We also launched at least one m 79 round. As we gained altitude,

2221
02:12:27.230 --> 02:12:29.630
I dropped my last hand grenade into the under Bush,

2222
02:12:30.530 --> 02:12:32.270
a little something for someone I hoped.

2223
02:12:33.110 --> 02:12:37.010
Then just as suddenly and miraculously all gunfire ceased.

2224
02:12:37.640 --> 02:12:42.500
The only sound was that of the churning Sikorsky h h three engines and the

2225
02:12:42.501 --> 02:12:45.320
increasingly cold air rushing through the aircraft.

2226
02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:51.270
I looked over my shoulder towards Tsao who is retrieving warm air force blankets

2227
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:54.870
for the long ride. When I made contact with him,

2228
02:12:55.080 --> 02:12:58.980
he gave me that quick nod of his and a slight smile.

2229
02:13:00.220 --> 02:13:00.770
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

2230
02:13:00.770 --> 02:13:01.730
<v 4>we made it again.</v>

2231
02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:10.700
That's just, just this just an insane mission.

2232
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:12.670
Oh yeah. And I'm sure you, you know,

2233
02:13:12.740 --> 02:13:14.810
why don't you just break contact and continue mission?

2234
02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:24.680
So, um, yeah. Crazy. They need to. Yeah.

2235
02:13:25.190 --> 02:13:26.080
I know that you're, uh,

2236
02:13:26.120 --> 02:13:29.690
putting some of these books on audio book we're working on in the process of

2237
02:13:29.691 --> 02:13:32.940
doing that. And these are going to be great when you, when you release those,

2238
02:13:34.110 --> 02:13:38.750
uh, I know you talk about in a little bit in the book you were put in for you,

2239
02:13:38.751 --> 02:13:41.340
you requested one of your guys be put into it for a silver star for this

2240
02:13:41.341 --> 02:13:43.260
operation Ed John Angle.

2241
02:13:43.440 --> 02:13:47.790
And then you got put in for a silver star as well.

2242
02:13:47.791 --> 02:13:52.791
And actually you're the CEO said he was gonna upgrade that upgrade,

2243
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:57.960
which I didn't agree with, but I'm not going to argue either. Yeah.

2244
02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:01.380
It to a distinguished service cross, which if you don't know that what that is,

2245
02:14:01.381 --> 02:14:02.214
that's the,

2246
02:14:03.240 --> 02:14:08.130
the second highest and military award for, for valor.

2247
02:14:09.090 --> 02:14:13.590
And so, but, but at the same time, and again this is,

2248
02:14:13.620 --> 02:14:15.750
I kind of have to just tie this back into the book a little bit,

2249
02:14:15.751 --> 02:14:20.010
but you had been going through this kind of hassle with the commanding officer

2250
02:14:20.011 --> 02:14:21.440
about carrying the, uh,

2251
02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:24.570
carrying a new encryption device out until you have it for that mission.

2252
02:14:24.630 --> 02:14:26.970
And you didn't have it for this one. Correct. But you ha,

2253
02:14:27.060 --> 02:14:30.330
but then he started turning up the heat like, hey, you got to carry this thing.

2254
02:14:30.331 --> 02:14:33.960
And this thing is no joke. I mean, I was looking at, I used,

2255
02:14:34.140 --> 02:14:38.040
even when I got to the seal teams, we used a PRC 77 were those around for you?

2256
02:14:38.530 --> 02:14:43.120
Yes. What we started with. Okay. For the, for that, uh, encrypted transmission.

2257
02:14:43.121 --> 02:14:47.820
So there you go. So yeah, the PRC 77 is an old radio. It's an FM radio and it's,

2258
02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:49.950
how big would I say it is? Well, it's,

2259
02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:52.620
what's something similar to trick 25 yeah.

2260
02:14:52.621 --> 02:14:56.490
But I'm trying to think of something that of a civilian would know. Can I,

2261
02:14:56.670 --> 02:14:59.700
so I can describe it. It's like a big, it's like two lunchboxes maybe. Like,

2262
02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:02.250
yeah, maybe like a briefcase that's a little bit more square,

2263
02:15:02.251 --> 02:15:05.190
a little bit thicker. So it's like that maybe two shoe boxes.

2264
02:15:05.420 --> 02:15:07.320
So you like this better? Something like that. That's what,

2265
02:15:07.321 --> 02:15:10.830
that's how big a PRC 77 is. The K Y 38,

2266
02:15:10.831 --> 02:15:14.250
which is the encryption device is basically the same size as that. Right?

2267
02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:17.070
It's like again, and it doubles the weight.

2268
02:15:17.410 --> 02:15:18.870
You got to carry double the batteries.

2269
02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:24.210
It cuts down your range because it takes away from the penetration of the,

2270
02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:28.800
of the, uh, radio waves coming out and you had to carry the encryption,

2271
02:15:29.730 --> 02:15:31.020
uh, punch. Ugh.

2272
02:15:32.070 --> 02:15:36.060
So that's what you're getting told to carry and you keep coming back and saying,

2273
02:15:36.061 --> 02:15:40.020
hey, this isn't that great. Hey, we been trying and it's not working.

2274
02:15:41.490 --> 02:15:46.350
Um, you, you, you keep getting told, nope.

2275
02:15:46.351 --> 02:15:48.870
Carry it. Carry, carry. Finally, you, you, you say to your boss,

2276
02:15:49.320 --> 02:15:51.300
you say the commanding officer, hey look, I'll carry it.

2277
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:55.980
But if we get in one of these bad situations, I'm going to destroy this thing.

2278
02:15:56.130 --> 02:15:58.860
If it doesn't work, if it doesn't work, I'm going to destroy this thing. Yeah.

2279
02:15:59.040 --> 02:16:03.390
And he kind of says, okay, whatever. You know, but you carry it. Yeah.

2280
02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:07.980
So you go on an operation, you, you and you actually,

2281
02:16:08.100 --> 02:16:10.260
we're going to leave it in the Hilos.

2282
02:16:10.261 --> 02:16:13.620
You asked the Halos to take it you and you asked them to come back and get it

2283
02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:14.573
cause it didn't work.

2284
02:16:14.580 --> 02:16:17.520
He said he loves come back and take this thing cause it's 50 pounds.

2285
02:16:17.550 --> 02:16:20.880
He has the weight and we had, I wanted to try, we were,

2286
02:16:20.910 --> 02:16:23.090
the target was the asphalt and there was,

2287
02:16:23.250 --> 02:16:26.310
there was something specifically in the asphalt they wanted us to confirm.

2288
02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:29.980
So I went in with a four team. The

2289
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.050
<v 3>theory being we'll go in light,</v>

2290
02:16:32.290 --> 02:16:35.920
we can move quicker because the Asheville valley didn't have triple canopy,

2291
02:16:35.921 --> 02:16:37.360
at least the part that we were looking at.

2292
02:16:37.810 --> 02:16:41.800
So it's like single or double canopy and a lot of open areas because it'd been

2293
02:16:41.801 --> 02:16:45.730
so many bombs to had been eight camps that had been overrun, deserted,

2294
02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:48.680
and I'd been in the ash all we put the sensors in and it costs,

2295
02:16:48.681 --> 02:16:53.170
we fly over it every time. So [inaudible] generally familiar where we were gone.

2296
02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:57.680
So I said I want to do a four man team, please don't force me to carry it.

2297
02:16:57.700 --> 02:17:01.630
Well we've had to carry it. And that's when I said if it doesn't work.

2298
02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:05.650
So we went in and tried it. It didn't work charted a few times. Yeah.

2299
02:17:05.651 --> 02:17:06.401
And they wouldn't come back.

2300
02:17:06.401 --> 02:17:10.720
And you been trying it on other operations as well where we try to one as just a

2301
02:17:10.721 --> 02:17:15.280
complete failure by brought it back. And so this time you start getting tracked.

2302
02:17:15.670 --> 02:17:18.550
Yeah. And and you say, okay, now I'm not carrying this thing anymore.

2303
02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:20.850
So you put a third of my grenades. You put a thermite grenade on. Yeah.

2304
02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:25.630
So you put a front of my grade on it, you destroy it and

2305
02:17:26.280 --> 02:17:28.830
<v 0>then you again by the skin of your teeth, you got,</v>

2306
02:17:28.831 --> 02:17:30.390
you get you and your guys out of there.

2307
02:17:31.650 --> 02:17:35.340
And when you are coming back to you, you're flying back to [inaudible].

2308
02:17:35.760 --> 02:17:37.420
<v 3>And just so you know how close they were.</v>

2309
02:17:37.570 --> 02:17:42.570
At one point I'm looking to the north and I see a young face come through the

2310
02:17:44.261 --> 02:17:46.930
jungle at me within two or three feet or so.

2311
02:17:47.500 --> 02:17:51.190
So I can see his outline and I can see his AK is down.

2312
02:17:51.700 --> 02:17:56.700
He sees me and we just stop and look at each other and it's all through the

2313
02:17:56.711 --> 02:18:01.570
jungle. The grass. He backed out. I just kept my car at him,

2314
02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:05.980
but he didn't open fire and he was young. I mean a young kid would a gun,

2315
02:18:06.940 --> 02:18:10.960
he backed up, he went away. So I knew that this, okay,

2316
02:18:10.961 --> 02:18:13.390
this mrs now compromise and we hit the thermite.

2317
02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:15.170
<v 0>Yeah. Like I said,</v>

2318
02:18:15.390 --> 02:18:19.290
this is another mission where you are getting out of there by the skin of your

2319
02:18:19.291 --> 02:18:21.920
teeth. It's a damn miracle that you,

2320
02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:23.880
you bring all your troops back that you don't get overrun,

2321
02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.680
that no one gets killed. It's crazy. Yeah.

2322
02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:29.400
<v 3>And they, the CEO was flying in the helicopter close by.</v>

2323
02:18:29.430 --> 02:18:33.920
We asked for a tactical withdrawals, right? Yeah. He goes, break contact,

2324
02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:38.440
your team issue our favorite words. So we destroyed the, the uh,

2325
02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:43.780
the encryption device, Roger that sir. And we have more contact. Well his,

2326
02:18:43.781 --> 02:18:45.520
he finally ran out of fuel, went back,

2327
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:48.580
we were on the ground for a few more hours. We continued to move,

2328
02:18:48.850 --> 02:18:50.950
but we hear more activity,

2329
02:18:51.010 --> 02:18:54.010
particularly at the B thermite at the damn radio.

2330
02:18:54.011 --> 02:18:57.700
I thought we'd be getting distracted. He didn't. So now they know where we are.

2331
02:18:57.880 --> 02:19:02.250
Cause anybody within 10 miles can tell. There's the third micro nade any ours.

2332
02:19:02.410 --> 02:19:05.440
It's those guys. And they were coming for us but there weren't a lot.

2333
02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:08.050
But we had um, a new cover,

2334
02:19:08.051 --> 02:19:13.051
erotic came out Dallas Long Street and we started running a ones across me

2335
02:19:13.181 --> 02:19:17.170
could, we could hear the uh, enemy to the west. And so the,

2336
02:19:17.171 --> 02:19:22.171
a made a couple of gun runs and the last gun run the pilot came in and then he

2337
02:19:23.531 --> 02:19:24.610
flipped his aircraft.

2338
02:19:24.611 --> 02:19:29.611
So like I'm looking at the awan making a gun run and early you could hear them

2339
02:19:30.231 --> 02:19:32.900
when they go by and how the aircraft makes these noises,

2340
02:19:32.901 --> 02:19:36.890
these cracked noises when the wings change and the whatever the structures in

2341
02:19:36.891 --> 02:19:40.790
the plane are. So I had heard him go Bob before this one. He came by,

2342
02:19:40.791 --> 02:19:44.390
he wants to make sure where we were. He came by so close,

2343
02:19:44.391 --> 02:19:48.770
I could tell you he was smoking a Philly shirt. He looked over,

2344
02:19:48.771 --> 02:19:49.430
he nodded,

2345
02:19:49.430 --> 02:19:53.740
I saluted and he did a couple more gun runs and they brought in into s and they,

2346
02:19:54.150 --> 02:19:55.430
they [inaudible] couldn't land.

2347
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:57.590
They dropped the ropes and pulled us out on ropes.

2348
02:19:58.010 --> 02:20:00.500
And of course whenever you go out in ropes to shooting matches like target

2349
02:20:00.501 --> 02:20:04.480
practice for them. How did no one ever get shot on the ropes? Maybe? Oh No,

2350
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:08.160
we had a lot of gossip. Never got shot in the ropes. Not Go would just,

2351
02:20:08.180 --> 02:20:09.800
just luck. I'll share luck.

2352
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:12.110
I mean I always felt like they're just coming through your legs,

2353
02:20:12.111 --> 02:20:15.140
get your balls or Mr. Happy.

2354
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:17.930
Worse brain damage. I'm worried about brains.

2355
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:19.423
<v 0>Sure.</v>

2356
02:20:24.570 --> 02:20:26.760
So you go through all that and again,

2357
02:20:27.120 --> 02:20:30.000
people need to buy this book so they can read that full story.

2358
02:20:30.270 --> 02:20:35.250
Cause even what you just said is a portion of it. Um, you get back,

2359
02:20:35.251 --> 02:20:36.900
you get taken out on strings,

2360
02:20:36.990 --> 02:20:38.910
which again is something we didn't talk about a lot,

2361
02:20:38.911 --> 02:20:40.590
but a lot of times when helicopters couldn't land,

2362
02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:42.960
they dropped down the ropes with the sandbags on the end and you guys were

2363
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:45.840
clipping and they drag you out through the jungle and gets you up to out dude

2364
02:20:45.841 --> 02:20:48.060
and gets you out of there. And that's what happens here.

2365
02:20:48.330 --> 02:20:52.350
Finally you get back in here. We're going back to the book.

2366
02:20:52.380 --> 02:20:56.970
When we landed on the helicopter pad at CC and the CEO's biggest Renfe, a rude,

2367
02:20:57.030 --> 02:20:58.600
arrogant, or rude,

2368
02:20:58.650 --> 02:21:03.650
ignorant sergeant major told me to report to the CEO Asap with the k y 38 and

2369
02:21:03.871 --> 02:21:07.980
all attachments for it. When I walked into the CEO's office,

2370
02:21:07.981 --> 02:21:11.070
the ramp sergeant major ordered me to stand at attention, which I did.

2371
02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:14.670
Then the CEO asked the $64,000 question,

2372
02:21:14.850 --> 02:21:19.850
where is the k y 38 I explained to him that per our earlier conversation when we

2373
02:21:21.031 --> 02:21:24.480
had made contact with the NVA, since it didn't work, I destroyed it.

2374
02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:30.450
He flew into a rage telling me that I had violated a direct order from him not

2375
02:21:30.451 --> 02:21:32.850
to destroy it under any circumstances.

2376
02:21:33.150 --> 02:21:37.410
I stated once again what I had said prior to the mission because this was a four

2377
02:21:37.411 --> 02:21:41.310
man team. He simply said he didn't remember it that way.

2378
02:21:41.490 --> 02:21:44.490
It was just me, him and the ramp sergeant major.

2379
02:21:44.760 --> 02:21:47.940
Who knew that the CEO was of course telling the truth,

2380
02:21:49.650 --> 02:21:52.740
so the the, the sergeant major support and skipper, of course,

2381
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:57.390
he's telling the truth. I didn't like the way this was going,

2382
02:21:58.350 --> 02:22:00.420
so as I had in the past with the CEO,

2383
02:22:00.421 --> 02:22:03.930
I tried to explain my actions from the position of the man on the ground,

2384
02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:07.950
which was different from a man singing a command and control helicopter as he

2385
02:22:07.951 --> 02:22:11.910
had earlier in the day while ordering me to break contact and continue mission.

2386
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:16.350
Then he got really pissed and told me that he was going to write me up for an

2387
02:22:16.351 --> 02:22:21.351
article 32 crim criminal allegation onto them military military code of conduct

2388
02:22:22.650 --> 02:22:26.550
for willfully destroying US government property in direct opposition

2389
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:30.780
<v 4>to his order not to destroy the k. Why 38 under any circumstances,</v>

2390
02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:35.850
the ramp sergeant major then whispered something to the CEO as they whispered

2391
02:22:35.851 --> 02:22:40.290
back and forth to each other. I found myself growing extremely calm,

2392
02:22:41.220 --> 02:22:45.600
unbelievably calm. Finally, the CEO step from behind his desk,

2393
02:22:45.810 --> 02:22:47.880
leaving the ramp sergeant major behind it.

2394
02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:51.270
I'm going to ruin your special forces career.

2395
02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:54.210
I want you out of CCN at firstlight tomorrow.

2396
02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:55.730
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

2397
02:22:55.730 --> 02:23:00.500
<v 4>he went on to tell me to report to Fifth Special Forces Group headquarters and</v>

2398
02:23:00.501 --> 02:23:04.520
not train where he'd have me drummed out of SF within the next month.

2399
02:23:05.660 --> 02:23:06.493
Privately,

2400
02:23:07.160 --> 02:23:11.060
I smiled because the CEO hadn't done his homework.

2401
02:23:11.420 --> 02:23:16.420
He failed to realize that my service in the army ended in two weeks due to the

2402
02:23:16.521 --> 02:23:21.521
fact that I had extended my time and service to return to CCN.

2403
02:23:22.310 --> 02:23:27.310
The CEO only knew the date when I had arrived at CCN and had assumed I had a

2404
02:23:27.321 --> 02:23:30.860
traditional one year tour of duty that would end in October,

2405
02:23:30.980 --> 02:23:32.840
not April, 1970

2406
02:23:34.980 --> 02:23:37.350
my SOG days ended right there.

2407
02:23:38.430 --> 02:23:38.960
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2408
02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:40.970
<v 4>I knew that when I went to not training,</v>

2409
02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:45.950
I could get any assignment in Vietnam where there was an opening for an

2410
02:23:45.951 --> 02:23:49.160
experienced SF soldier, but as I stood there,

2411
02:23:49.940 --> 02:23:54.230
I believe that God had sent this asshole into my life for a reason. Granted,

2412
02:23:54.231 --> 02:23:56.930
it wasn't a reason I didn't completely understand.

2413
02:23:57.560 --> 02:24:01.490
Granted it was a reason I didn't completely understand at this precise moment in

2414
02:24:01.491 --> 02:24:02.150
time,

2415
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:06.350
but maybe it was time for me to get out of Uncle Sam's army altogether while my

2416
02:24:06.351 --> 02:24:09.770
body, if not my mind, was relatively intact.

2417
02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:14.600
Who knew what the future held for SF in Vietnam. Finally,

2418
02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:17.540
he finished and asked me if I had anything to say.

2419
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:22.880
You're a disgrace to west point. Fuck you, sir.

2420
02:24:23.780 --> 02:24:26.390
I turned and exited without saluting the ramp.

2421
02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:30.140
Sergeant major caught up to me as I exited the door and told me to return and

2422
02:24:30.141 --> 02:24:34.130
salute the CEO. I bent toward his year and quietly said,

2423
02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:36.380
fuck you to sergeant major

2424
02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:40.590
before leaving the CCN headquarters area.

2425
02:24:40.830 --> 02:24:44.610
I stopped by the awards and decoration desk to see if the CEO had begun

2426
02:24:44.611 --> 02:24:47.430
paperwork for flying that day. East of our team,

2427
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:51.540
embarrassed the clerk simply nodded his head in the affirmative,

2428
02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:57.020
meaning that the CEO was in the process of getting himself written up for an

2429
02:24:57.391 --> 02:25:02.391
award for telling us to break contact and continue the mission while he was

2430
02:25:02.611 --> 02:25:06.450
flying out of harm's away safely in south Vietnam.

2431
02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:14.730
That was him. Yeah. Wow. Oh yeah.

2432
02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:19.530
Just unbelievable. But you know, it's just like you knew it.

2433
02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:23.860
I just felt it. And plus he had had a reputation already by that time

2434
02:25:24.430 --> 02:25:28.090
<v 3>and we had talked to the A and d people previously bought some other things.</v>

2435
02:25:28.091 --> 02:25:29.230
He put himself in four.

2436
02:25:29.231 --> 02:25:33.130
Had somebody put them in four and a yes,

2437
02:25:33.220 --> 02:25:38.020
it's just a total disgrace and it's just the luck of the timing was the fact

2438
02:25:38.021 --> 02:25:41.680
that you knew that you could get out of the army at that point.

2439
02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:45.550
I was juggling the thought of re-enlisting. Um,

2440
02:25:45.700 --> 02:25:49.750
a friend of mine who was a captain who we have run one mission together. Um,

2441
02:25:51.090 --> 02:25:51.730
uh, he was gone.

2442
02:25:51.730 --> 02:25:56.470
He was in the process of putting me in for a direct commission to lieutenant and

2443
02:25:56.471 --> 02:25:59.530
a sort of paperwork had been placed. Um,

2444
02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:02.230
and I don't know if it ever got to Saigon or not,

2445
02:26:02.380 --> 02:26:06.070
but I know that he had a separate office. The paperwork was done.

2446
02:26:06.071 --> 02:26:09.160
We had completed everything, we had letters of recommendation, all that stuff.

2447
02:26:10.060 --> 02:26:12.700
And I'm so fat.

2448
02:26:12.700 --> 02:26:15.580
He and I talked about where we're going to do is I was going to stand for a few

2449
02:26:15.580 --> 02:26:16.960
months to see if the direct commission,

2450
02:26:16.961 --> 02:26:20.370
even though the reductions in forest were [inaudible], you know,

2451
02:26:20.380 --> 02:26:23.080
because they're already start the Vietnamization process.

2452
02:26:23.620 --> 02:26:28.620
The maximum manpower we had at Vietnam was at the end of 69,

2453
02:26:28.751 --> 02:26:32.830
I believe it was. We had 543,000 Americans in Vietnam.

2454
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:36.310
So by April 70, when this all happen,

2455
02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:39.390
we had reduced the numbers. You could do more,

2456
02:26:39.430 --> 02:26:43.970
more what was coming even within SF. And so the,

2457
02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:47.590
all those things were being juggled. So if I got the direct commission,

2458
02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:49.360
I'd thought about that two years of college.

2459
02:26:49.361 --> 02:26:54.010
I knew I had to get two more years if I was gonna try for a career. And, um,

2460
02:26:54.910 --> 02:26:58.640
and I didn't want to go back to fort Devins. So, uh,

2461
02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:01.330
those were the things that I was juggling at the time.

2462
02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:04.900
And when this all happened, I just, like I said, I was really calm.

2463
02:27:04.901 --> 02:27:07.750
I just thought God gave me an answer here. Yup.

2464
02:27:14.310 --> 02:27:15.150
<v 4>Going back to the book.</v>

2465
02:27:15.151 --> 02:27:19.290
I continued down to the team room where it gave Sao $500 to buy food and drink

2466
02:27:19.291 --> 02:27:23.040
for the biggest party our t Idaho had. During my tenure on the team,

2467
02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:25.980
we partied late into the night one by one.

2468
02:27:25.981 --> 02:27:30.670
Each team member passed out until it was just hip and me standing outside our

2469
02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:32.640
Ti, Idaho's Vietnamese team room.

2470
02:27:33.810 --> 02:27:38.310
Hep asked me if I needed him for any more interpreting when I said no,

2471
02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:41.850
he passed out in the sand. I picked him up,

2472
02:27:41.880 --> 02:27:44.280
dust them off as best I could,

2473
02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:49.340
and carried him into the team room where I gently placed him in bed before I

2474
02:27:49.801 --> 02:27:50.670
turned the lights out.

2475
02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:55.380
I stood in the doorway for a moment longer reflecting on my 18 months with these

2476
02:27:55.381 --> 02:27:58.500
men with a special affection and admiration for

2477
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:01.890
Sao Hep Foulk clang and hung.

2478
02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:05.430
Then the guilt pangs washed over me.

2479
02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:08.850
What did the future hold for them?

2480
02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:14.650
That had to be the hardest part of this departure. Ah,

2481
02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:18.660
brutal really was, and these guys

2482
02:28:20.580 --> 02:28:24.320
were just this continually for years, but they didn't rotate out.

2483
02:28:24.490 --> 02:28:28.070
<v 3>No, that was their job. Well, hap had rotated up to headquarters, uh,</v>

2484
02:28:28.270 --> 02:28:32.710
he asked for permission to go there for a better paying job and if the three and

2485
02:28:32.711 --> 02:28:34.660
a half years run a recon, so sure.

2486
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:40.030
And we had the guy who was interpreter Virginia came over, not as good as Hap,

2487
02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:42.840
but he was a good interpreter. And by that time, uh,

2488
02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:47.740
we had worked on two other south Vietnamese [inaudible] and, um, uh,

2489
02:28:48.310 --> 02:28:51.190
chow were speaking good enough English where if I got shot,

2490
02:28:51.430 --> 02:28:55.900
they could pick up the radio takeover cause we cross train them on radio

2491
02:28:55.901 --> 02:29:00.850
procedures, slps, how to run, uh, everything. So, uh,

2492
02:29:01.540 --> 02:29:03.910
Hep knew how to do it then home and then chapel later.

2493
02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:07.700
<v 4>And they must, from their perspective, this must've seemed completely insane.</v>

2494
02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:12.340
<v 3>Oh, absolutely. And they were like, really? But they knew the way,</v>

2495
02:29:12.341 --> 02:29:13.270
but this is 70.

2496
02:29:13.271 --> 02:29:18.271
So SF had been near in force for six years by then and they knew enough and

2497
02:29:18.281 --> 02:29:20.890
talking to each other plus being in a secret war,

2498
02:29:21.730 --> 02:29:24.670
how things were operated and that, you know,

2499
02:29:24.671 --> 02:29:29.120
we all report it to a commander somewhere. And, um,

2500
02:29:29.530 --> 02:29:33.940
it was still one of the, uh, points as a sticking point was like, Oh God,

2501
02:29:34.810 --> 02:29:39.070
I'm alive, thanks to you. And now leaving you guys here. And uh,

2502
02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:44.090
so this is April 70 without a thing about what? April 30th, 1975.

2503
02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:47.410
It'd be like the date of Saigon Felon.

2504
02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:49.413
Just horrible.

2505
02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:56.150
<v 4>So you, you finished with that, you know, you, you pack up,</v>

2506
02:29:56.360 --> 02:30:00.770
you reported to not train during, during the next two weeks.

2507
02:30:00.771 --> 02:30:04.820
The most traumatic event was having the ice cream stand severely damaged by

2508
02:30:05.090 --> 02:30:06.980
enemy mortar fire. That was serious.

2509
02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:10.400
That's really messing with your head to destroy the ice cream stand.

2510
02:30:13.340 --> 02:30:17.120
The reps who had to go, God, they got PTSD from that one. Oh yeah.

2511
02:30:17.150 --> 02:30:18.830
They had to go downtown for their ice cream

2512
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:27.410
on April 25th. So that was April for us. Now it's April 25th. Yeah,

2513
02:30:28.100 --> 02:30:32.360
I mustered out of the army at Fort Lewis, Washington again with mixed emotions.

2514
02:30:32.600 --> 02:30:35.600
I flew to Denver, Colorado to spend a few days with my sister Linda,

2515
02:30:36.020 --> 02:30:39.710
and to enjoy some spring skiing in the Rockies at the end of April.

2516
02:30:39.711 --> 02:30:41.930
She got a rental car from me to return to New York City.

2517
02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:44.300
I drove from Denver to Sutherland,

2518
02:30:44.301 --> 02:30:48.470
Ohio to visit my cousin Dunk Conrad and his wife Sandra before heading home to

2519
02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:52.040
Trenton. The drive was about 1300 miles,

2520
02:30:52.430 --> 02:30:55.970
including pitstops and a long wait in Ohio for food and few phone calls.

2521
02:30:56.450 --> 02:30:58.250
I made it home in less than 15 hours,

2522
02:31:01.970 --> 02:31:04.160
so you're averaging over a hundred miles an hour. Basically.

2523
02:31:04.220 --> 02:31:05.780
It's all it could do though. Let's just a rental.

2524
02:31:09.530 --> 02:31:11.900
When I arrived at 20 West Paul AV,

2525
02:31:12.080 --> 02:31:14.900
that's your house where you grew up?

2526
02:31:15.020 --> 02:31:18.260
It was around 3:00 AM times had changed in my absence.

2527
02:31:18.261 --> 02:31:20.820
My parents now walked the front and back doors of the house,

2528
02:31:20.821 --> 02:31:23.880
so wearing my jump boots and classy uniform,

2529
02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:27.480
I went around to the back of the house where I climbed up to the window,

2530
02:31:30.390 --> 02:31:35.010
grabbed the metal roof of the shed and stepped on the metal clothesline Hook to

2531
02:31:35.011 --> 02:31:38.580
push myself up to the red metal roof,

2532
02:31:39.210 --> 02:31:43.440
dampened by them morning moisture. After I climbed through the back window,

2533
02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:48.390
I went over to my little brother David and gave him a big hug. Hell,

2534
02:31:48.480 --> 02:31:49.470
he was taller than me.

2535
02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:54.930
Then I went down to my parents' bedroom moving first to my mother's side of the

2536
02:31:54.931 --> 02:31:59.340
bed. I touched her face but didn't say a word groggy.

2537
02:31:59.670 --> 02:32:02.370
She merged. She murmured. David, is that you?

2538
02:32:03.870 --> 02:32:08.670
Then she reached up to my face and felt my beard. John, she said,

2539
02:32:09.180 --> 02:32:13.380
has she stirred from her sleep? John, is that you, John Your home?

2540
02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:15.900
Henry. It's John. He's home.

2541
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:21.950
She reached around my neck with the urgency and pain only mothers know and said

2542
02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:25.410
Johnny's home.

2543
02:32:27.200 --> 02:32:28.040
<v 5>Johnny's home.</v>

2544
02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:33.793
Oh yeah.

2545
02:32:44.470 --> 02:32:48.430
<v 4>So you made it home</v>

2546
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:54.690
<v 3>only by the grace God. And what came next? What do, I mean,</v>

2547
02:32:54.691 --> 02:32:59.400
what did you do after that? Well, um, went to,

2548
02:32:59.730 --> 02:33:04.530
uh, went back to school cause it took me two years to flunk out. So that summer,

2549
02:33:05.200 --> 02:33:06.930
uh, I uh,

2550
02:33:07.260 --> 02:33:10.710
took classes and then my dad got me a job right away driving school buses.

2551
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:15.300
And so like within the first two, three days of me getting a drivers license,

2552
02:33:15.301 --> 02:33:19.470
this is Trenton, New Jersey. There are still some race riots that were gone on.

2553
02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:23.820
So things were, they had a curfews, which is like,

2554
02:33:23.850 --> 02:33:28.500
this is like mind boggling in Trenton of all places. And so they said,

2555
02:33:28.890 --> 02:33:31.560
um, we got to run for you. You're going to go to Chambersburg,

2556
02:33:31.561 --> 02:33:34.710
which was the Italian section of Trenton.

2557
02:33:35.280 --> 02:33:37.830
And they were just starting new integration program.

2558
02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:43.580
So I picked up a bus load of young black kids that were mostly elementary

2559
02:33:44.071 --> 02:33:48.870
school, pick them up, take them into Chambersburg on the way in.

2560
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:53.870
There's protests and I'm getting rocked in stone and I don't have my car 15,

2561
02:33:54.840 --> 02:33:56.780
because those Italians or whoever they were,

2562
02:33:56.790 --> 02:34:01.110
they were hitting us with those rocks. It was really make me very unhappy.

2563
02:34:01.380 --> 02:34:03.610
But here it was like, this is trend.

2564
02:34:03.710 --> 02:34:06.690
I'll go from one more zone to this and they're doing this integration style.

2565
02:34:08.420 --> 02:34:09.600
So the curfew.

2566
02:34:09.601 --> 02:34:12.990
So we had all of that going on and within a couple of weeks the church softball

2567
02:34:12.991 --> 02:34:15.850
team was reactivated a softball season was there as a,

2568
02:34:15.851 --> 02:34:19.960
did that school does some driving and uh,

2569
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:24.670
eventually got involved in the school newspaper, became editor. Uh,

2570
02:34:24.671 --> 02:34:28.900
we had a period of time where the student government voted itself out of office.

2571
02:34:28.901 --> 02:34:30.550
We had the SDS on campus.

2572
02:34:30.670 --> 02:34:33.340
The calmness were in there doing her thing behind the scenes.

2573
02:34:33.850 --> 02:34:36.340
They burnt down a couple buildings just for good luck,

2574
02:34:36.730 --> 02:34:41.440
played dominoes in the library, knocked over all the books, their stupid stuff.

2575
02:34:41.890 --> 02:34:46.150
[inaudible] and then was you w you had to just be thinking to yourself, oh,

2576
02:34:46.170 --> 02:34:50.170
are you serious? Yeah, absolutely. What I just, you know,

2577
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:53.620
saw my friends get killed, took risk my own life.

2578
02:34:53.621 --> 02:34:57.820
Saw what the Vietnamese people were actually fighting for what they wanted.

2579
02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:01.870
Yeah. And you had these people back here in America do it acting like this.

2580
02:35:01.930 --> 02:35:04.270
And the student, you know, we knew the SDS was,

2581
02:35:04.490 --> 02:35:07.720
we're back with the calmness and they had their order propaganda,

2582
02:35:07.721 --> 02:35:10.240
but it was never reported. They were just like, well,

2583
02:35:10.241 --> 02:35:14.680
here's like another group protesting in the streets without any kind of active

2584
02:35:15.700 --> 02:35:15.970
deaf,

2585
02:35:15.970 --> 02:35:19.480
deaf definition as to who these people really wore and what they really hated

2586
02:35:19.481 --> 02:35:23.260
America. And so, you know,

2587
02:35:23.410 --> 02:35:28.120
we're evolved with school trying to get gone and um, you know, during this time,

2588
02:35:28.900 --> 02:35:32.780
um, we got very active with the paper and it was editor for two years.

2589
02:35:32.860 --> 02:35:37.840
So I've worked on a paper for every day for two straight years. And uh,

2590
02:35:38.140 --> 02:35:42.370
we had our moments, you know, they had the first faculty strike in the state.

2591
02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:47.640
So before that I was really excited could me and two other SF buddies were going

2592
02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:49.980
to shut the campus down cause the,

2593
02:35:49.981 --> 02:35:54.981
the faculty there and the teacher unions told us we will support you students

2594
02:35:55.691 --> 02:35:58.450
and we're going to get things for you. And they made other promises, which,

2595
02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:00.520
okay, I'm all for it.

2596
02:36:00.910 --> 02:36:04.360
And it'd be the first strike in history in New Jersey.

2597
02:36:05.230 --> 02:36:08.260
And so me and the guy has put together a plan because there's basically three

2598
02:36:08.261 --> 02:36:12.090
major entrances in one couple of clandestine routes.

2599
02:36:12.130 --> 02:36:14.410
So we had everything planned.

2600
02:36:14.450 --> 02:36:17.380
We were going to overturn an empty fuel tank or at one gate,

2601
02:36:17.381 --> 02:36:20.530
the other gate we were going to just close it down with cars and things.

2602
02:36:20.530 --> 02:36:25.030
So would take them at least a day or two to clean it up and clear it out.

2603
02:36:25.570 --> 02:36:30.160
We shut that school down so we're putting our plans together. Right.

2604
02:36:30.161 --> 02:36:31.720
So now here comes Mr editor.

2605
02:36:32.110 --> 02:36:35.260
I get a copy of the state.

2606
02:36:35.261 --> 02:36:39.730
I go to the State Department of the higher education and a chance to give me

2607
02:36:39.850 --> 02:36:43.300
what the state is proposing says, look at this, read this.

2608
02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:46.570
It says have the union give you their proposal,

2609
02:36:46.571 --> 02:36:49.180
but they wouldn't give it to me nor would the chancellor.

2610
02:36:49.181 --> 02:36:51.850
He felt it was a violation of their fiduciary.

2611
02:36:52.330 --> 02:36:55.450
Whatever the hell was that they are dealing with these union people.

2612
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:59.620
So the union guy had his Volkswagen in a parking lot.

2613
02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:03.100
Long story short, I borrowed his contract,

2614
02:37:03.340 --> 02:37:07.120
I got it photocopied it while I'm photocopying it downstairs at the

2615
02:37:07.121 --> 02:37:10.840
administration building. He walked by, I salute say hi,

2616
02:37:11.140 --> 02:37:16.140
continue to photocopy his is a negotiating paper which has many pages long

2617
02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:19.730
[inaudible]. I went back and print them side by side.

2618
02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:24.560
There's two mentions of what the union was going to do and over 20 or 30 pages

2619
02:37:24.561 --> 02:37:25.394
of documents.

2620
02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:30.700
One was to give them more time off and the other was for class size as all they

2621
02:37:31.671 --> 02:37:34.100
had in those pages. We printed it,

2622
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:39.170
did an editorial and said screw the Union and opposed it.

2623
02:37:39.290 --> 02:37:44.290
And then we went to war with the union editorially and the Finnair and they went

2624
02:37:44.661 --> 02:37:47.420
on strike but they didn't close the campus down. I pulled up,

2625
02:37:47.421 --> 02:37:50.510
pulled our true brokenhearted man cause I really wanted to get some,

2626
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:54.140
some goodwill of warfare here at Trenton State College. You know,

2627
02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:00.250
they lied to us. What were you studying at the time? Um, well you know, uh,

2628
02:38:00.770 --> 02:38:02.040
I was a member, I was a freshman,

2629
02:38:02.130 --> 02:38:06.500
is 64 and I finally graduated in 74 with a political science degree with a minor

2630
02:38:06.501 --> 02:38:09.530
in English because English was still my foreign language at the time.

2631
02:38:10.530 --> 02:38:13.240
And did you, did you, I know you were working at the paper again,

2632
02:38:13.241 --> 02:38:16.090
that's what you ended up doing for your career yourself?

2633
02:38:16.190 --> 02:38:20.660
Career must have my amazement. Um, you know, cause a w at the signal,

2634
02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:24.410
that was our school paper. I did everything, photography, editorials,

2635
02:38:24.630 --> 02:38:28.550
new stories, and uh, went down to the Trenton Times a local paper.

2636
02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:30.290
They were owned by the Washington Post.

2637
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:34.370
Dick Harwood was the editor and during the war to gates stuff,

2638
02:38:34.580 --> 02:38:38.030
he was the voice that was skeptical of Woodward and Bernstein.

2639
02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:42.800
But he was my editors. I go down and I went in for an interview.

2640
02:38:42.801 --> 02:38:44.900
I said, I had my hairs on my shoulders.

2641
02:38:44.901 --> 02:38:49.850
Now I hadn't had a haircut for a couple of years. Blue Jean Jacket, t-shirt,

2642
02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:53.930
jungle boots, old blue jeans going for the first interview. He's interested.

2643
02:38:54.340 --> 02:38:57.020
Just come back for a second. I went back for a second interview,

2644
02:38:57.170 --> 02:39:00.620
had a clean tee shirt this time. Stepped it up. Yes.

2645
02:39:02.660 --> 02:39:06.080
I'm thought I'll pause in the jungle boots. I said, Nah. So I got hired,

2646
02:39:06.140 --> 02:39:07.640
went to work the trend times.

2647
02:39:07.850 --> 02:39:12.800
I was there for 10 years and then went to San Diego for 10,

2648
02:39:12.830 --> 02:39:16.130
10 years with the San Diego Union, which is about eight years.

2649
02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:20.960
Moved to California in 1985. What made you decide to move out to California? Um,

2650
02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:25.990
the Washington Post sold to Trenton times and the quality of the newspaper just

2651
02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:27.950
diminished incredibly.

2652
02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:33.220
I was fighting more with the editors to get stories into the paper because I

2653
02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:35.990
covered the courts and I was doing an investigative stuff.

2654
02:39:36.020 --> 02:39:39.740
We did a story about the, we broke the story about, um,

2655
02:39:40.010 --> 02:39:45.010
the FBI investigating Philadelphia Police Department corruption that went to the

2656
02:39:45.021 --> 02:39:49.580
top why I had interviewed a marine who was a Vietnam vet,

2657
02:39:50.180 --> 02:39:54.980
who was the undercover guy working with the fan belt inspectors for 18 months.

2658
02:39:55.460 --> 02:39:58.370
I see. As Guyanese we did this today, we did this,

2659
02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:02.480
he made fun of the FBI and so he told me when they're getting ready to,

2660
02:40:02.570 --> 02:40:05.390
to go out, get the search warrants and do to rates,

2661
02:40:05.391 --> 02:40:07.660
I called up the fan belt inspectors and said, hey,

2662
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:09.560
heard you got a little case going on.

2663
02:40:10.250 --> 02:40:12.740
I don't want to jeopardize your investigation,

2664
02:40:12.741 --> 02:40:16.260
but I'm going to write about it before you guys do it. Let's talk.

2665
02:40:16.770 --> 02:40:19.910
Turns out the chief FBI guy was a, uh,

2666
02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:24.570
as a spectrum pilot. Oh Geez. He had flown in Lagos.

2667
02:40:25.350 --> 02:40:28.080
Now we couldn't determine if he was my savior that night.

2668
02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:32.670
On February in 1970 or not. But we had an interesting exchange.

2669
02:40:32.671 --> 02:40:37.671
So I gave him two days and they put all the paper together and they put up

2670
02:40:38.011 --> 02:40:42.060
wiretaps on a key suspects and the Philadelphia Police Department.

2671
02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:46.620
Monday morning, our broke the story scooped the Philadelphia Inquirer.

2672
02:40:46.620 --> 02:40:50.850
Every major paper in the world is before TECOM just news network and Fox News

2673
02:40:50.851 --> 02:40:55.440
and all this stuff did the story. And uh, it was amazing.

2674
02:40:56.100 --> 02:40:59.430
And they, and they did the whole thing to follow. So that was my,

2675
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.110
one of my major coups.

2676
02:41:01.120 --> 02:41:03.870
We had the other story about the Philadelphia Phillies that were under

2677
02:41:03.871 --> 02:41:06.780
investigation. So had, uh,

2678
02:41:06.810 --> 02:41:10.350
law enforcement with my f was my main source that I did the courts.

2679
02:41:10.351 --> 02:41:14.160
And in between we duties investigated pieces for fun. Came to San Diego,

2680
02:41:14.161 --> 02:41:16.140
was there for eight years doing law enforcement,

2681
02:41:16.680 --> 02:41:21.000
covering our beloved border patrol. And then from there went to North County.

2682
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:22.130
Uh,

2683
02:41:22.130 --> 02:41:26.780
and I always lived in North San Diego County and they had a paper called the,

2684
02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:30.720
uh, the Osis side bleed citizen. So I went to work there.

2685
02:41:31.230 --> 02:41:35.400
The editor's job paid $10 a week more than a reporter's job. So I was like,

2686
02:41:35.640 --> 02:41:39.280
became an editor's assistant city editor up in Oceanside,

2687
02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:41.190
which eventually became the North County Times.

2688
02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:45.720
And so I went to work there in October and met my, uh, future bride in December.

2689
02:41:46.350 --> 02:41:49.200
She had, uh, two boys. I had two girls.

2690
02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:51.630
10 months later we're married.

2691
02:41:52.140 --> 02:41:56.850
And so we'll be celebrating our 25th anniversary of this, uh, this October. And,

2692
02:41:57.300 --> 02:41:59.200
uh, we moved at a tie breaker. So the tiebreakers,

2693
02:41:59.340 --> 02:42:02.790
he's 22 now and I've worked at the paper until, uh,

2694
02:42:02.820 --> 02:42:07.270
2008 that I've worked at a couple of nonprofits helping veterans over the last

2695
02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:10.200
11 years in between that, a couple of books for good luck.

2696
02:42:10.350 --> 02:42:13.140
<v 0>Yeah, yeah. Well, no awesome books. It seems like,</v>

2697
02:42:13.290 --> 02:42:17.470
and this is something that I was like, I obviously, you know, you,

2698
02:42:17.610 --> 02:42:21.810
you went through some just completely insane, intense stuff. You come back,

2699
02:42:22.170 --> 02:42:27.170
it seems like you got back into society fairly well fairly quickly.

2700
02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:32.190
You and, and what I always say to guys is like, you need a new mission. Like,

2701
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:35.370
cause what happens when I think guys fall apart is when they come back from

2702
02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:38.820
wherever they're deployed to and they don't, when they come back,

2703
02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:40.830
they don't know what to do. They don't, they don't,

2704
02:42:40.860 --> 02:42:43.340
they don't go on to the next mission. Whereas you're like, okay,

2705
02:42:43.341 --> 02:42:43.990
I'm gonna go to college.

2706
02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:46.830
I'm going to work at the newspaper or I'm going to organize these, you know,

2707
02:42:46.831 --> 02:42:47.730
we're going to fight this fight.

2708
02:42:47.731 --> 02:42:51.480
And it seems like you got focused on what your next mission was. Where,

2709
02:42:51.481 --> 02:42:55.020
I think that's when a lot of guys don't do well.

2710
02:42:55.350 --> 02:42:57.690
And I was wondering if you saw anything with your friends,

2711
02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:02.720
other Vietnam guys that you served with the guys that seem to get back on track

2712
02:43:04.261 --> 02:43:07.200
and carry on with their life as opposed to guys that don't.

2713
02:43:07.300 --> 02:43:07.700
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

2714
02:43:07.700 --> 02:43:12.220
Ma majority of our guys I like to think came back and the adjusted one way or

2715
02:43:12.221 --> 02:43:15.700
the other. Oh, we had a couple of tragic cases that did. And I mean, uh,

2716
02:43:16.120 --> 02:43:17.440
when I went back from my second tour,

2717
02:43:17.441 --> 02:43:21.130
I went back with Jeffrey Jenkins who was going back for his fifth tour duty,

2718
02:43:21.580 --> 02:43:26.380
second or third with SF. And so we held on the plane going across,

2719
02:43:26.610 --> 02:43:27.443
went back,

2720
02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:32.050
we land in a Cameron Bay and steady going through the process.

2721
02:43:32.051 --> 02:43:34.180
We got our duffle bag, went out, stole jeep,

2722
02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:37.570
drove to a the Trang but didn't go to headquarters,

2723
02:43:37.571 --> 02:43:40.030
went downtown and partied for a little bit.

2724
02:43:40.031 --> 02:43:44.410
Then we poured it in the Trang and then went up to CCN there cause we were both

2725
02:43:44.411 --> 02:43:48.310
returning, so was no in country training on Esta and uh,

2726
02:43:48.670 --> 02:43:50.290
and my order specifically said

2727
02:43:52.030 --> 02:43:55.930
Cs CCN and I got back to the team right away, which you covered earlier.

2728
02:43:56.290 --> 02:44:00.100
And the other sidebar, which really helped was um,

2729
02:44:00.460 --> 02:44:01.690
at trench state college,

2730
02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:06.220
I point it was a point man for the POW Mia Concern Center.

2731
02:44:06.550 --> 02:44:09.700
They came out with a bracelets and a, the whole thing would,

2732
02:44:09.800 --> 02:44:12.850
there was that effort, they had American citizens that were,

2733
02:44:13.030 --> 02:44:14.260
and the family members,

2734
02:44:14.570 --> 02:44:19.120
the first time American family members petitioned an enemy to treat our

2735
02:44:19.121 --> 02:44:23.530
prisoners better. And so our prisons weren't related,

2736
02:44:23.650 --> 02:44:26.410
released until February of 1973.

2737
02:44:26.411 --> 02:44:30.850
We had two years that I worked at the POW MIA concern center.

2738
02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:35.170
We had appealed w and air force POW from Trenton. We supported him,

2739
02:44:35.171 --> 02:44:37.570
his all his family wrote letters,

2740
02:44:37.571 --> 02:44:41.830
everything we could do a for now in our spare time between classes,

2741
02:44:41.831 --> 02:44:43.600
putting out newspapers and things like that.

2742
02:44:44.020 --> 02:44:48.040
So it was like a really a sub Rosa mission. And, uh,

2743
02:44:48.370 --> 02:44:52.210
when the prisoners came home, that was just a great moment. And so,

2744
02:44:52.211 --> 02:44:53.560
but it really was helpful.

2745
02:44:53.561 --> 02:44:58.561
Like they set another mission that we went into the newspaper going into it.

2746
02:44:59.290 --> 02:45:02.260
And, uh, there's a period of time to student government voter,

2747
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:07.120
Sada self out of office. So the paper was the only student voice.

2748
02:45:07.630 --> 02:45:08.463
So we took a,

2749
02:45:08.610 --> 02:45:10.440
<v 6>what's the deal? What do you, what does that mean?</v>

2750
02:45:10.441 --> 02:45:13.770
The student government voted themselves out of office. What does that even mean?

2751
02:45:15.390 --> 02:45:19.980
<v 3>Hey, this is 1971. We had, uh, people that were just,</v>

2752
02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:24.570
uh, too busy. They didn't think the student government was, was, uh,

2753
02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:26.400
could address issues.

2754
02:45:26.580 --> 02:45:29.750
They're apropos to true needs of students or whatever the hell that meant.

2755
02:45:30.020 --> 02:45:33.450
And I forget the real reasons, but they just disband themselves.

2756
02:45:33.451 --> 02:45:35.760
So the signal was the only voice on campus.

2757
02:45:36.300 --> 02:45:40.790
And so we became much more active. And of course we had a fern of action.

2758
02:45:40.860 --> 02:45:44.070
It was starting then and uh, the teacher strike,

2759
02:45:44.130 --> 02:45:47.640
we had a outbreak and meningitis were killed.

2760
02:45:47.641 --> 02:45:51.150
Three students had to cover that. And of course,

2761
02:45:51.710 --> 02:45:54.480
deep in my mind I wanted them to strike.

2762
02:45:54.990 --> 02:45:58.350
I wanted to go out and shut the campus down,

2763
02:45:59.610 --> 02:46:00.600
but it didn't work out.

2764
02:46:01.530 --> 02:46:06.360
<v 6>How about the, uh, you know, how was it the treatment, you know, um, you know,</v>

2765
02:46:06.390 --> 02:46:09.920
as a modern day veteran myself,

2766
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:13.640
<v 3>like we get treated just unbelievably, ridiculously good.</v>

2767
02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:16.580
Whereas the benefit from Vietnam, we weren't treated well,

2768
02:46:16.640 --> 02:46:20.240
but today our citizen tree treats our soldiers,

2769
02:46:20.241 --> 02:46:23.800
sailors appropriately regardless of the politics. Yeah.

2770
02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:27.950
They thank you for the service mostly. Yeah, we had, we had cases, I mean,

2771
02:46:27.951 --> 02:46:31.850
I w I wore my fatigue jacket for years just to say, fuck you. I'm wearing,

2772
02:46:31.851 --> 02:46:33.470
if you don't like it, talk to me about it.

2773
02:46:34.190 --> 02:46:37.640
And we had a few parties with the newspaper.

2774
02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:39.590
And so everybody,

2775
02:46:39.620 --> 02:46:42.890
almost everybody except for one or two people were very liberal courses.

2776
02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:46.730
This is the college, 1971 too. And uh,

2777
02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:49.880
we had this one freak is like six, three,

2778
02:46:49.910 --> 02:46:53.210
he had his long hair and he came up to me, he said, you know, you guys,

2779
02:46:53.570 --> 02:46:57.050
I know about you, green brace, your fucking baby killers, you know,

2780
02:46:57.051 --> 02:47:01.010
you've gone on to whole Party, comes to a stop. So it's mean is creep.

2781
02:47:02.090 --> 02:47:04.430
And so he said a few more things and in fact he says,

2782
02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:07.130
aren't you really a baby killer? And I said, look,

2783
02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:10.340
the only time we killed babies and when we ran out of rations,

2784
02:47:12.050 --> 02:47:15.650
well he just, it was never hit. That kid was never the same.

2785
02:47:16.550 --> 02:47:20.120
And every bosses kind of like laugh and realize how ridiculous this asshole was.

2786
02:47:20.750 --> 02:47:24.920
So it's like, why get your hands dirty? Yeah. Yeah. So yeah,

2787
02:47:24.921 --> 02:47:27.770
we had someone at like Lynn Black, when he came back,

2788
02:47:28.250 --> 02:47:31.930
he was trying to get out of the airport quick and took a, took the door,

2789
02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:35.810
got outside and wound up in a long corridor. Well,

2790
02:47:35.811 --> 02:47:39.670
three or four guys came up to him and said, hey man, you're back. You got cast,

2791
02:47:39.671 --> 02:47:41.420
we're going to believe you. That burden.

2792
02:47:41.780 --> 02:47:45.500
So Lynn pulled out his 25 caliber browning, the little ones, you know,

2793
02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:49.970
you put it in your palm and lingos no you're not.

2794
02:47:49.970 --> 02:47:52.130
I'm not giving it to you. And the guy goes,

2795
02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:55.790
I recognize a cigarette lighter when I see when Lynn put her mouth between his

2796
02:47:55.791 --> 02:48:00.650
legs right there at the airport day they left. But again,

2797
02:48:00.760 --> 02:48:04.040
it's no respect. You know, Linda's didn't want to get his uniform.

2798
02:48:04.041 --> 02:48:07.490
Where was that? Where it was Lynn [inaudible] up in Seattle. Yeah.

2799
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:09.800
Yeah. And then

2800
02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:15.410
how did you start getting reinvolved with like, uh, the,

2801
02:48:15.470 --> 02:48:19.190
the special operations group that you're with now? I got a phone call from us,

2802
02:48:19.191 --> 02:48:23.300
but, well, there's two. I got a phone call for spider parks in 1983.

2803
02:48:23.301 --> 02:48:27.470
I lived in Trenton. Um, my first wife, first daughter,

2804
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:31.820
and uh, he said we got this group Special Operations Association.

2805
02:48:32.090 --> 02:48:35.960
It's our guys who was formed by Green Berets that ran recon.

2806
02:48:36.290 --> 02:48:37.790
And we have some hatchet force guys.

2807
02:48:37.880 --> 02:48:42.500
They were the platoon company size operations, like mad dog, Cherry Shriver.

2808
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:47.510
And uh, they had formed up, um, a few years earlier.

2809
02:48:47.870 --> 02:48:51.710
So I signed up Bob and Linda to Trenton and there were unions were at different

2810
02:48:51.711 --> 02:48:54.800
places, so I'd never, I didn't bother to go for several years,

2811
02:48:54.801 --> 02:48:58.670
but spire and I talked, pay my dues and finally went to,

2812
02:48:58.730 --> 02:49:03.020
and he started having him in Vegas. Me and Jeff junkers would drive,

2813
02:49:03.530 --> 02:49:07.070
go to Vegas, get into the hotel, wait to security guard,

2814
02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:10.950
left and sneak into the reunion, hang out with the guys for a day,

2815
02:49:11.340 --> 02:49:12.520
pick one of our guys,

2816
02:49:12.830 --> 02:49:15.660
crashed in their room for night and then drive home next day.

2817
02:49:15.661 --> 02:49:18.900
But we get to see the guys and no money. We get to free food,

2818
02:49:18.901 --> 02:49:22.590
free drinks and a little gas. Right? So we did that for a couple of years.

2819
02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:26.010
It was a lot of fun. And then, uh, when I finally met Anna,

2820
02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:29.190
my s my current wife and my sweetheart forever, uh,

2821
02:49:29.730 --> 02:49:31.110
that kind of came to a close.

2822
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:34.860
I took Annan one time and the first time was not a really completely good

2823
02:49:34.861 --> 02:49:39.270
experience. Some regards is still pretty wild. And the hotel wasn't that cool.

2824
02:49:39.271 --> 02:49:42.840
But now it's more of a, our guys a Sloan now a little bit.

2825
02:49:43.170 --> 02:49:45.940
We've lost some along the way, so we haven't to be union.

2826
02:49:46.470 --> 02:49:49.380
This will be our 43rd reunion that I'm also involved.

2827
02:49:51.210 --> 02:49:53.160
The Special Forces Association, Chapter 38 up in orange.

2828
02:49:53.630 --> 02:49:57.300
And I went to the restroom two years ago. At Christmas time I came back,

2829
02:49:57.301 --> 02:49:59.650
I was president, so I'm wrapping up my,

2830
02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.010
my second year duty with those gentlemen.

2831
02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:07.380
<v 4>And, uh, what's the, what's the, uh, the nonprofit group that you have?</v>

2832
02:50:07.550 --> 02:50:10.250
<v 3>Oh, we have the veterans, um, uh,</v>

2833
02:50:10.340 --> 02:50:13.370
veterans affordable housing program that's out of orange.

2834
02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:16.130
And then we have a separate, uh, uh,

2835
02:50:16.850 --> 02:50:20.270
nonprofits called the American Veterans Assistance Group where we work with

2836
02:50:20.271 --> 02:50:21.800
programs within our communities.

2837
02:50:21.801 --> 02:50:26.090
We have 45 communities in the five western states that are, uh,

2838
02:50:26.170 --> 02:50:30.740
are owned by our company and by our nonprofit. And so, uh,

2839
02:50:30.741 --> 02:50:34.940
we encourage to help veterans that have fixed income to get them into affordable

2840
02:50:34.941 --> 02:50:39.590
housing. You know, the manufactured homes are less expensive, the stick houses.

2841
02:50:40.100 --> 02:50:43.460
And then we have programs with, through our, uh, the vag program.

2842
02:50:43.461 --> 02:50:45.710
We have programs for meals,

2843
02:50:45.711 --> 02:50:48.530
meetings have been a guest speakers and things like that.

2844
02:50:48.980 --> 02:50:51.290
And we're doing antebellum non of our communities now.

2845
02:50:51.620 --> 02:50:56.150
So that's where my other jobs than do the newsletter. Busy.

2846
02:50:56.540 --> 02:51:00.770
Always, always busy. Can't like twenties was a kid. Let the old man in.

2847
02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:06.210
<v 4>Well, I'll tell you what, um, we're,</v>

2848
02:51:06.211 --> 02:51:09.120
we just had three hours or something close to that. So, uh,

2849
02:51:09.350 --> 02:51:12.370
I know I need to let you get Outta here obviously. Um,

2850
02:51:14.500 --> 02:51:17.410
<v 3>anything else? Any other closing thoughts? Uh, no, just the,</v>

2851
02:51:17.411 --> 02:51:21.010
as I said to first time as I could have done any of the books without my

2852
02:51:21.011 --> 02:51:25.230
sweetheart, my dear bride, you know, we had a, uh,

2853
02:51:25.360 --> 02:51:29.860
14 pages in and the, and relatively newborn in the house, she said, go right.

2854
02:51:30.670 --> 02:51:33.190
And God bless her. Without her, I couldn't have done it. So,

2855
02:51:33.880 --> 02:51:37.060
and it found me today, we just learned we got to, to grow.

2856
02:51:37.061 --> 02:51:40.130
Two or three girls are pregnant. So we're getting excited about being a,

2857
02:51:40.131 --> 02:51:44.540
grandparents are practicing and we're still work with, are nonprofits.

2858
02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:45.940
So moving forward,

2859
02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:49.490
<v 4>anything can people donate to that nonprofit? Do you have that kind of thing?</v>

2860
02:51:49.491 --> 02:51:52.340
Is there a website or anything like that or is it you guys just run it locally?

2861
02:51:52.530 --> 02:51:56.460
<v 3>No, they uh, I'll have to check the website, but they could, uh,</v>

2862

02:52:38.260 --> 02:52:40.210

Appreciate it airborne all the way until next time.

2886
02:53:18.720 --> 02:53:19.960
And uh, once again,

2887
02:53:22.810 --> 02:53:25.870
John Stryker Meyer tilt tilt has left the building.

2888
02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:31.620
What an incredible human being and it's a complete honor and just lucky to be

2889
02:53:37.211 --> 02:53:41.230
able to sit here and talk to him and hear his stories and hear him reflect on

2890
02:53:41.231 --> 02:53:45.940
stuff. And it's been awhile. It's been three hours.

2891
02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:49.810
So anyways, if you liked this conversation,

2892
02:53:49.840 --> 02:53:54.220
this podcast that we just did, if you got something out of it,

2893
02:53:55.270 --> 02:53:59.440
which I know I did, if you want to support the podcast, sure.

2894
02:53:59.830 --> 02:54:02.830
While you actually support your own self,

2895
02:54:04.750 --> 02:54:08.840
I think echo can give you some help in making that happen. Yup.

2896
02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:14.450
Yes. So let's go into it. Obviously you do too. If you're not doing Jujitsu, I,

2897
02:54:15.310 --> 02:54:19.390
I would say Jocko and I strongly recommend,

2898
02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:24.070
I thought you were gonna say we were disappointed. No, see yeah,

2899
02:54:24.460 --> 02:54:26.920
maybe, maybe part, but not really.

2900
02:54:26.980 --> 02:54:30.910
At the end of the day there was some understanding to be exercised here cause

2901
02:54:30.911 --> 02:54:34.060
not every, okay, you were rolled, you're different.

2902
02:54:34.061 --> 02:54:37.720
But sometimes people roll into Jujitsu gym or see it on TV or even think about

2903
02:54:37.721 --> 02:54:40.710
it. Two people wrestling all hard or whatever pit.

2904
02:54:40.711 --> 02:54:43.540
Some people just don't automatically want to go do that and you know,

2905
02:54:43.570 --> 02:54:47.230
just automatically on its surface you might think,

2906
02:54:47.260 --> 02:54:49.420
oh well that's not really for me.

2907
02:54:49.540 --> 02:54:53.140
I don't really want to grapple grapple with some other dude.

2908
02:54:54.690 --> 02:54:58.090
What you don't see is what's beneath the surface cause what's beneath the

2909
02:54:58.100 --> 02:55:02.410
surfaces. Fitness, flexibility, mobility.

2910
02:55:03.410 --> 02:55:04.243
Mentor.

2911
02:55:04.310 --> 02:55:08.130
<v 7>Stamina. Yeah. Physical Stamina. Yeah.</v>

2912
02:55:08.210 --> 02:55:12.920
Cardiovascular improvement. Strength Improvement on top of all that.

2913
02:55:12.980 --> 02:55:13.491
You guess what?

2914
02:55:13.491 --> 02:55:18.440
You get legitimate skill that you can actually choke another person that's

2915
02:55:18.441 --> 02:55:22.970
bigger than you, that's stronger than you. Yeah. You can take them. Yes.

2916
02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:26.120
So, and you know, if I speak for myself,

2917
02:55:26.121 --> 02:55:31.010
the reason I started in continued with Jujitsu because it's the skill that

2918
02:55:31.011 --> 02:55:36.011
you're talking about that you learn that skill is this.

2919
02:55:37.070 --> 02:55:41.420
If someone, if someone insists on fighting you, you can win the fight.

2920
02:55:41.800 --> 02:55:44.690
You won the fight. And before you learn how to fight,

2921
02:55:44.810 --> 02:55:49.220
and I'm speaking generally speaking, um, before you learn to fight,

2922
02:55:49.460 --> 02:55:53.440
you think, ah, you know, I'm all just do this. [inaudible] you know,

2923
02:55:53.450 --> 02:55:57.620
I'm stronger than that guy or I'm bigger than that guy. Whatever. Yeah.

2924
02:55:57.621 --> 02:56:00.500
You know, and you don't realize how, how untrue, how,

2925
02:56:01.130 --> 02:56:04.580
you know how I've said we lie to ourselves. Yes. Like we lie to ourselves.

2926
02:56:04.610 --> 02:56:06.730
This is a whole nother category of lying to yourself.

2927
02:56:07.180 --> 02:56:09.260
Cause the one category is like, we lie to ourselves like, oh,

2928
02:56:09.261 --> 02:56:12.050
it's just one donut. It's not that big of a deal. That's just a lie.

2929
02:56:12.170 --> 02:56:14.090
You aligned yourself or, well, I don't,

2930
02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:16.770
I can't make it to the gym today cause you know, my, you know,

2931
02:56:17.220 --> 02:56:19.520
it's getting a little late. That's a lie. You know, it's a lie,

2932
02:56:20.030 --> 02:56:23.870
but an even bigger lie is I'm more capable.

2933
02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:28.700
I'm capable in certain situations and you're not and you think,

2934
02:56:28.730 --> 02:56:31.250
and you still talk to people like this boy, like, oh, you know,

2935
02:56:31.380 --> 02:56:34.550
well if it really came down to it, you know,

2936
02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:39.410
and I lift too. Yeah. And I got strong cardio.

2937
02:56:40.310 --> 02:56:41.780
Who's going to be able to take me? I'll tell you,

2938
02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:47.240
most 14 year old girl that knows how to, you know,

2939
02:56:47.900 --> 02:56:52.550
choke you. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Just like in Pool, right?

2940
02:56:52.870 --> 02:56:57.770
You play pool billiards, billiards, snooker. Sure.

2941
02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:01.480
And it's like, yeah, I know. I see what's going on.

2942
02:57:02.050 --> 02:57:05.700
Hit this ball to get that ball and go on the thing that's no problem on some

2943
02:57:05.750 --> 02:57:09.680
money on me. I'm pretty smart. I'm pretty coordinated, you know? I'm just like,

2944
02:57:09.681 --> 02:57:13.130
that's just how my mind, how hard can it be? Exactly. Right.

2945
02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:16.190
And you go play against the guy who really, who knows how to play pool.

2946
02:57:16.191 --> 02:57:17.900
You'd be like, Bro, how do you even do that?

2947
02:57:18.140 --> 02:57:20.870
Like how did you even like figure it out? But they know. They just know.

2948
02:57:20.871 --> 02:57:22.160
It's not like it's this magic thing.

2949
02:57:22.161 --> 02:57:25.790
They just sort of know the same thing what you did too. It's like, man, in fact,

2950
02:57:25.791 --> 02:57:30.080
it's such a mystery when you actually do it, how easily they beat you.

2951
02:57:30.081 --> 02:57:33.930
It's such a weird magic mystery that you don't even comprehend it. Yeah.

2952
02:57:33.990 --> 02:57:37.010
At first you're like, oh, oh, oh I just slipped. Nobody.

2953
02:57:37.011 --> 02:57:40.580
You didn't slip people either butchers. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you think,

2954
02:57:40.581 --> 02:57:43.070
oh well next time I'll just stop them from putting his arm there.

2955
02:57:44.350 --> 02:57:47.660
He's got 1 billion other things and he's going to do, yeah, exactly. Sure.

2956
02:57:47.870 --> 02:57:49.790
Know nothing about. Same thing with basketball,

2957
02:57:49.970 --> 02:57:53.570
the way that's the same thing with all sport basketball, right?

2958
02:57:53.630 --> 02:57:58.220
Well yeah, it goes deep anyway. When you do Jujitsu, when you dude,

2959
02:57:58.380 --> 02:58:00.980
you get to, cause you're doing it, we're doing it and you're gonna do it.

2960
02:58:00.990 --> 02:58:04.570
You should get a g cause you don't, you want to do g n No-gi.

2961
02:58:04.580 --> 02:58:08.400
So the kind of game that you get is an origin g Beski in the world factually and

2962
02:58:08.430 --> 02:58:10.620
made in America, which was a huge deal by the way.

2963
02:58:11.430 --> 02:58:15.450
Also origin the brand that makes these gies they make jeans.

2964
02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:20.340
American denim. You didn't get yours yet, did you? No, I didn't. I totally,

2965
02:58:20.580 --> 02:58:25.010
him and I talked to be little all the time. We just got his, yeah, we showed up.

2966
02:58:25.220 --> 02:58:27.120
We know why we take care of the customer first.

2967
02:58:27.960 --> 02:58:31.050
Well you're not really the customer mind or t,

2968
02:58:32.970 --> 02:58:36.840
you know what that is a research and development test and evaluation.

2969
02:58:37.610 --> 02:58:39.960
Testing quality assurance. Yeah.

2970
02:58:40.220 --> 02:58:43.800
And I just got another test evaluation for the next phase. Yeah,

2971
02:58:43.830 --> 02:58:45.600
cause I'm making another phase.

2972
02:58:46.410 --> 02:58:51.000
We lie to ourselves as a wise man. Once that anyway, no,

2973
02:58:51.001 --> 02:58:54.870
I don't have jeans, but I, from what I imagined and from what I see in gather,

2974
02:58:55.370 --> 02:58:57.770
you know from the field, they're good jeans.

2975
02:58:57.980 --> 02:59:02.880
See now what psychological good flanking maneuver you just did right now.

2976
02:59:03.090 --> 02:59:05.250
Then I'm just saying Brian will hear this and they'll be like, oh,

2977
02:59:05.580 --> 02:59:08.490
echo doesn't even have jeans. No, no. I'll get a hundred percent better.

2978
02:59:08.491 --> 02:59:11.190
Get them to them? Nope. Did you, did you text them and say, Hey,

2979
02:59:11.220 --> 02:59:12.840
can I get a pair of jeans size or whatever?

2980
02:59:12.930 --> 02:59:17.600
Me and Brian share text and paint by the way, how like, oh,

2981
02:59:17.850 --> 02:59:18.571
we're the last one.

2982
02:59:18.571 --> 02:59:23.571
We're the only ones that we literally know that don't have the genes and then so

2983
02:59:23.610 --> 02:59:26.070
he texted me the other day or show or even worse,

2984
02:59:26.340 --> 02:59:30.660
takes me in the Instagram story about his jeans and you know me, I'm over here.

2985
02:59:30.960 --> 02:59:34.170
Well then again I wear the shark fin short, you know,

2986
02:59:34.171 --> 02:59:36.060
what do you call the shorts that they make? That's all I wear.

2987
02:59:36.540 --> 02:59:39.360
Whatever hep presenting. Representing big time.

2988
02:59:39.540 --> 02:59:43.230
But they happen to be the best shorts. You wear jeans very often. Me? No, not,

2989
02:59:43.460 --> 02:59:46.380
maybe that's not why you're too vocal about it. Yeah, maybe.

2990
02:59:46.390 --> 02:59:48.570
But you would be if you had them on.

2991
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:53.400
If I knew like maybe I'm just sour grapes, like I don't even want any. Cool.

2992
02:59:53.730 --> 02:59:57.390
All right, well I do have them. All right. How are they? Are they good?

2993
02:59:57.570 --> 03:00:02.460
They are totally good to go there. The next level squared away. Awesome. Yup.

2994
03:00:02.490 --> 03:00:05.940
You can get jeans, you can get t-shirts, you can get supplements.

2995
03:00:05.941 --> 03:00:09.420
We have supplements, we got, we've got joint warfare, which you should take.

2996
03:00:09.570 --> 03:00:11.640
We've got killed Krill oil. We got discipline and discipline.

2997
03:00:11.641 --> 03:00:15.420
Go discipline goes like get your

2998
03:00:17.340 --> 03:00:22.260
cognitive wheels spinning, turning, moving quickly.

2999
03:00:22.470 --> 03:00:26.730
Sharp. So can we have discipline going to can come out?

3000
03:00:26.790 --> 03:00:29.760
I think he's actually out right now. Yeah, the little, yeah.

3001
03:00:30.030 --> 03:00:34.890
So those are the same formula. The one, the test one that they they, yes. Okay,

3002
03:00:34.891 --> 03:00:38.190
good. Yeah, that's, that one's good. Yeah. Here's the thing. All of these,

3003
03:00:38.310 --> 03:00:40.890
right? So you have joint work for Krill oil, right? The Combo.

3004
03:00:40.891 --> 03:00:43.860
That's the best way to go. Fleet and joints and stuff. And then, you know, uh,

3005
03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:48.870
discipline and the Malkan and everything. Can't consider this. Right?

3006
03:00:48.900 --> 03:00:51.840
As you get older and you still want to fight, cause man,

3007
03:00:51.870 --> 03:00:54.390
I gotta I gotta be honest with you. Um, you know, you feet,

3008
03:00:54.420 --> 03:00:56.880
you know how you catch the wave of just consistency.

3009
03:00:56.881 --> 03:01:00.550
I know you're a consistent person and discipline. I've been on that wave. Okay.

3010
03:01:00.760 --> 03:01:04.650
That's a tsunami, right? So you're the, you're the poster child of [inaudible].

3011
03:01:04.750 --> 03:01:09.640
I do have the Ding knee right now. Yes. Which is we're almost there.

3012
03:01:09.700 --> 03:01:11.500
Yes. But you know how, okay.

3013
03:01:11.501 --> 03:01:16.090
You know how some people can catch a various levels of,

3014
03:01:16.750 --> 03:01:21.200
how should I say, flourishing flourishes of activity, you know, um,

3015
03:01:21.430 --> 03:01:25.600
where they'll catch the wave of consistency meaning like everything they're

3016
03:01:25.601 --> 03:01:30.130
doing in their life is like I'm being disciplined and I'm in the zone where it's

3017
03:01:30.131 --> 03:01:32.860
like just second nature now pom pom, everything. Right.

3018
03:01:33.430 --> 03:01:37.180
So if you take all of these supplements that's gonna keep you on there,

3019
03:01:37.900 --> 03:01:40.360
especially as you get older. Oh,

3020
03:01:40.361 --> 03:01:43.120
I don't know about the older part cause I'm just kind of the same as I was

3021
03:01:43.570 --> 03:01:47.590
always just is how for you, but take it from someone who's getting older,

3022
03:01:48.250 --> 03:01:52.900
actually getting older. Uh, these, I think I, as far as my workouts,

3023
03:01:52.901 --> 03:01:53.680
like they're hard.

3024
03:01:53.680 --> 03:01:56.590
They're harder than most of the workouts I did when I was young and I'm just

3025
03:01:56.591 --> 03:01:59.920
maintaining big time as far as like staying in the game.

3026
03:02:00.240 --> 03:02:03.070
I'm saying check anyway. You get the consistent Combo. That's,

3027
03:02:03.071 --> 03:02:06.730
that's in my opinion how you do it. Also, I mentioned milk,

3028
03:02:07.360 --> 03:02:10.430
additional protein in the form of a dessert. Straight up.

3029
03:02:10.700 --> 03:02:14.010
There's a delicious drink that's says so tasty.

3030
03:02:14.900 --> 03:02:19.870
It was telling me like they were saying, oh, it was Dave. Good deal,

3031
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:22.120
good deal. Dave was saying,

3032
03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:27.040
he's at a point now where he's drinking strawberry milk.

3033
03:02:27.160 --> 03:02:30.280
He goes, listen, it's one thing to be okay,

3034
03:02:30.760 --> 03:02:33.910
it's time for dessert or hey, I'm a little bit hungry.

3035
03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:37.330
It's another thing to just be sitting around or walking into your house and bds.

3036
03:02:37.690 --> 03:02:42.690
Just think for no reason other than I want to taste the goodness.

3037
03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:46.310
I'm just going to go have this strawberry milk,

3038
03:02:46.720 --> 03:02:48.850
strawberry slayer right now and you know,

3039
03:02:48.920 --> 03:02:51.550
I understand because I've done that before and this is what I thought.

3040
03:02:53.050 --> 03:02:55.600
The thing is you, there is no guilt in that, but here's the thing.

3041
03:02:55.601 --> 03:02:59.260
The concept kind of made me feel a little bit guilty when I was doing that

3042
03:02:59.620 --> 03:03:03.100
because you know how the kind where you're just like at home bored and you see

3043
03:03:03.101 --> 03:03:06.060
the cookies and you're like, it was an easy path and you took it. It was a,

3044
03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:11.080
it was a desire that you should come to that my hand be a bad pattern to go

3045
03:03:11.141 --> 03:03:13.930
down. Yes. So you gotta be careful. Don't get,

3046
03:03:14.170 --> 03:03:19.170
don't allow the goodness of milk to start to train your brain to accept things

3047
03:03:19.421 --> 03:03:23.560
that you just want. Yes, you can make an exception with milk. You can be like,

3048
03:03:23.561 --> 03:03:27.850
Hey, I really want this right now just for just for the sake of wanting it. Yes,

3049
03:03:28.180 --> 03:03:31.840
you can let your mind, but don't think, hey donut. Yeah,

3050
03:03:31.990 --> 03:03:36.520
there's a slippery slope bro. It is that good. That's kind of shit.

3051
03:03:36.750 --> 03:03:40.330
That's true. So just be where the mindset essentially there's other flavors too.

3052
03:03:40.331 --> 03:03:43.810
If you don't like strawberry, which some people don't. Who is it? Jason Gardner.

3053
03:03:44.770 --> 03:03:49.510
Jason Guard. Jason Psycho. Like shrubbery. Good job. Jason. He's over there,

3054
03:03:49.511 --> 03:03:54.010
but he, he takes that little, hit her with his coffee in the morning.

3055
03:03:54.010 --> 03:03:57.770
He's got his little, he's got his little ritual scenario. Yeah,

3056
03:03:57.860 --> 03:03:59.990
he's got going on. That makes sense.

3057
03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:03.530
So strawberry and coffee I can ask from Red Cross is known right now. Like the,

3058
03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:08.510
the the one Yulia there. Yeah, sure. Then you got mint peanut butter.

3059
03:04:08.570 --> 03:04:10.370
The peanut butter is also off folks, so it was the mint.

3060
03:04:10.371 --> 03:04:14.540
That's the re that's the old baby. Did we just say, Oh gee, yes we did.

3061
03:04:14.541 --> 03:04:18.110
We did big time. It is. And then don't forget about the warrior kid milk.

3062
03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:20.270
Which the word getting milk for your kid.

3063
03:04:20.510 --> 03:04:25.100
Either that or you can give him poison. Yeah, you can give him poison, which Oh,

3064
03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:26.750
you got a bunch of corn syrup in this drink.

3065
03:04:26.751 --> 03:04:27.990
I'm going to give it to my child so that,

3066
03:04:28.180 --> 03:04:31.010
so that I give him type two diabetes or you can get them something that makes

3067
03:04:31.011 --> 03:04:35.150
them stronger, smarter, faster, better, yes. Or your kid or your kid milk.

3068
03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:39.320
Strawberry and chocolate gets on also Jocko White Tea, certified organic.

3069
03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:44.150
Very good. Micro, how would I even call it? Micro doses of caffeine.

3070
03:04:44.240 --> 03:04:49.110
There's like mini mini doses. Yeah, it is. Yeah. There's 60 milligrams per cam.

3071
03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:50.690
It's Sorta like a cup of coffee.

3072
03:04:51.050 --> 03:04:55.850
It also has the antioxidants in there and also days refresh. Very.

3073
03:04:56.230 --> 03:05:01.020
So there you go. And well obviously obviously.

3074
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:05.810
Yeah. If you want to dead lift 8,000 pounds, obviously. Yes. The TACO. Yep.

3075
03:05:05.840 --> 03:05:10.090
That's the one also certified you also,

3076
03:05:10.100 --> 03:05:14.000
we have a store. Jocko has a store. I say we have, so we all have a store.

3077
03:05:14.190 --> 03:05:18.590
If you want to get your merchandise. I haven't said that word Merck.

3078
03:05:19.040 --> 03:05:21.350
I don't really say that word that much. Just said it.

3079
03:05:21.560 --> 03:05:25.970
And you said it in a real kind of explicit kind of way.

3080
03:05:26.660 --> 03:05:30.340
Cause my daughter watches youtube videos, which I had to block her. Hello?

3081
03:05:31.240 --> 03:05:31.700
Not Blocker, but you know,

3082
03:05:31.700 --> 03:05:35.120
you know how you got to put the block on youtube so only they can only see

3083
03:05:35.121 --> 03:05:38.240
certain things. Anyway, I had to do that. She's like, you're like, okay good.

3084
03:05:38.241 --> 03:05:40.550
The only thing she's allowed to watch is two Jitsu videos,

3085
03:05:40.730 --> 03:05:43.880
Jocko podcast for your kid podcast. I don't know man.

3086
03:05:43.881 --> 03:05:45.210
She didn't take it to anyway,

3087
03:05:45.230 --> 03:05:48.710
the reason I did that was because she was falling some girl on there who was

3088
03:05:48.711 --> 03:05:50.540
really, she was just real sassy. She wasn't,

3089
03:05:50.541 --> 03:05:53.690
it wasn't like derogatories and she just had a Sassy way of talking.

3090
03:05:54.050 --> 03:05:56.990
Maybe 15 maybe 16 years old young man. That's my estimate.

3091
03:05:57.500 --> 03:05:59.030
And my daughter's six.

3092
03:05:59.090 --> 03:06:04.090
So this girl is talking about this and then my daughter is starting to say this

3093
03:06:04.611 --> 03:06:08.990
stuff, which is cute at first in my opinion, but after a while you're like, hey,

3094
03:06:09.020 --> 03:06:12.320
you can't talk like this is not yes is not what we're doing over here doing

3095
03:06:12.321 --> 03:06:15.530
exactly right. So she, anyway,

3096
03:06:15.560 --> 03:06:19.400
so recently within the last past two days, we had to block her anyway.

3097
03:06:19.430 --> 03:06:23.030
One of the things she kept saying was like marriage and she'd say it all Sassy,

3098
03:06:23.031 --> 03:06:25.460
like I'm not going to do it again. I'm not going to say it again.

3099
03:06:25.490 --> 03:06:28.970
But that's how she was saying it and it just slipped into your head slip.

3100
03:06:28.971 --> 03:06:32.580
Right and slip right out of your mouth right now talking about the murder.

3101
03:06:33.410 --> 03:06:35.990
That's why that's so what can you get at

3102
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:39.320
[inaudible] dot com store Jocko,

3103
03:06:39.321 --> 03:06:42.710
store.com this is where you can get discipline equals freedom shirts,

3104
03:06:43.340 --> 03:06:45.950
lightweight hoodies, which are really nice, man.

3105
03:06:46.010 --> 03:06:49.040
I had it on the other day and every once in a while I'll flash into it and be

3106
03:06:49.041 --> 03:06:50.230
like, Hey, this is, yeah.

3107
03:06:51.350 --> 03:06:54.950
You know what's interesting about Jocko store.com what's that?

3108
03:06:55.110 --> 03:06:57.870
Is we sell tee shirts. Sure. For one thing,

3109
03:06:57.871 --> 03:07:02.160
we sell discipline equals freedom t-shirt. We sell good teach, we sell t-shirts.

3110
03:07:03.150 --> 03:07:06.390
There's also people that come up to me and say, oh,

3111
03:07:06.480 --> 03:07:10.170
I just got an awesome tee shirt. I got one of your tee shirts. And I'm like,

3112
03:07:10.200 --> 03:07:14.040
I sweet man. And I just had a guy say to me, hey,

3113
03:07:14.041 --> 03:07:17.310
I just got one of your tee shirts. I wish I was wearing it right now.

3114
03:07:17.370 --> 03:07:21.440
And I was like, cool. And he goes, it's the, uh,

3115
03:07:21.780 --> 03:07:26.130
don't talk, just get after it shirt. And I go,

3116
03:07:27.330 --> 03:07:31.290
cool man. We don't have that. I don't even have that shirt.

3117
03:07:32.040 --> 03:07:36.720
So there are, what do we call them? A knockoffs, knockoffs,

3118
03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:41.160
shirts, what do you call like, yeah, there's like a word for it.

3119
03:07:41.390 --> 03:07:45.160
So yeah, they're disapproved, but they're kind of worth calling and approved.

3120
03:07:45.470 --> 03:07:48.930
They're like, worth this is why, because people will,

3121
03:07:48.931 --> 03:07:49.980
they don't know the layers.

3122
03:07:49.981 --> 03:07:54.981
You know how like remember the layers on his shirt and you have paid $90 for it

3123
03:07:57.060 --> 03:08:00.480
and has no layers came with no layers. There's no layers, man. And that's bad.

3124
03:08:00.540 --> 03:08:03.600
That's really loose and it's a piece of crap shirt. Yes.

3125
03:08:03.660 --> 03:08:07.740
So it's kind of like when you buy something for the kid,

3126
03:08:07.980 --> 03:08:11.310
you have a reason to buy something. Right. And this is generally speaking,

3127
03:08:11.311 --> 03:08:13.800
I know different reasons vary from person to person,

3128
03:08:14.130 --> 03:08:15.900
but you have a reason you buy something, right?

3129
03:08:16.080 --> 03:08:19.050
Let's say there's two reasons to buy a shirt. One of these shirts,

3130
03:08:19.590 --> 03:08:21.600
let's say there's one reason straight up, one reason.

3131
03:08:21.870 --> 03:08:25.770
The main reason is the layers. You get. Anyone literally you can spray paint,

3132
03:08:25.800 --> 03:08:27.840
discipline equals freedom on your shirt. If you're on display,

3133
03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:30.810
you can have that on. Yeah, you can do that. Totally can.

3134
03:08:31.540 --> 03:08:35.550
You can have one printed, you can go to a website and whatever font you want,

3135
03:08:35.551 --> 03:08:39.720
you can make it look however you want, literally. So why won't you do that?

3136
03:08:39.870 --> 03:08:42.000
Right? Cause you want more than just that.

3137
03:08:42.030 --> 03:08:45.150
There's something else for whatever that reason is. You're in the game.

3138
03:08:45.180 --> 03:08:49.260
Whatever that reason is. We'll call it x reason x. If you go by,

3139
03:08:49.290 --> 03:08:53.220
stop talking, get after it shirt. You literally bought something else.

3140
03:08:53.340 --> 03:08:58.340
You didn't buy an x check you out thinking about this one,

3141
03:08:58.680 --> 03:09:03.510
you know, because there's a whole reason I was thinking about it but,

3142
03:09:03.511 --> 03:09:05.640
but nonetheless, here's the thing. No Sir. No,

3143
03:09:05.641 --> 03:09:07.950
because I saw some kind of creator.

3144
03:09:07.951 --> 03:09:10.800
You feel like people are kind of

3145
03:09:12.510 --> 03:09:16.170
no maybe, but in defending you in this way though, because there is a,

3146
03:09:16.171 --> 03:09:20.820
there's a shirt thing called like t red spring or I don't know,

3147
03:09:20.821 --> 03:09:23.250
something where basically you can go online,

3148
03:09:23.850 --> 03:09:26.520
take a jpeg of a picture.

3149
03:09:26.620 --> 03:09:31.290
I can get any one picture of you online, submit it to this website.

3150
03:09:31.320 --> 03:09:34.650
It will make a mock up of the shirt. Like the, you know, the cheap shirts,

3151
03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:36.510
you know the buy buy in bulk,

3152
03:09:36.511 --> 03:09:41.280
maybe secondhand whatever shirts make a mock up and be like,

3153
03:09:41.281 --> 03:09:43.440
hey goes by my shirt. Right.

3154
03:09:43.470 --> 03:09:47.670
And I saw your face on it and it was like kind of a literally the wrong design,

3155
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:51.030
right? They were trying to copy. Exactly. But there's like already seen this.

3156
03:09:51.150 --> 03:09:55.780
Yes. I saw, this is a while ago and I saw it and I was like, man, you know,

3157
03:09:55.900 --> 03:09:59.650
down in TJ, like they'll knock off like Louis Vuitton purses and stuff.

3158
03:09:59.710 --> 03:10:02.650
At least it looks like the Louis Vuitton logo, you know,

3159
03:10:02.740 --> 03:10:05.890
and you got to look close to see the, you know, the, the, the quality,

3160
03:10:05.891 --> 03:10:10.060
the lapse and quality. But this one was like flagrantly wrong design, you know,

3161
03:10:10.120 --> 03:10:13.330
whoever. Meanwhile they're like selling it like their thing. Yeah,

3162
03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:15.010
it was offensive for sure.

3163
03:10:15.340 --> 03:10:18.190
And it's offensive on two levels because offensive tenet to us it's like, hey,

3164
03:10:18.191 --> 03:10:23.050
that's not our stuff. Don't misrepresent a B. The person who doesn't quite,

3165
03:10:23.080 --> 03:10:25.900
you know, they're just new and fired up. They can be like, hey, there's one,

3166
03:10:25.901 --> 03:10:27.400
here's the first one that popped up on Google.

3167
03:10:27.530 --> 03:10:28.480
They're going to get the junk one.

3168
03:10:28.690 --> 03:10:31.660
They're going to go out and try to represent in the wild and that's just not

3169
03:10:31.740 --> 03:10:34.840
going to work. Man. That's a bummer. That isn't, there is no support,

3170
03:10:35.110 --> 03:10:36.940
no support. And you know, I get it.

3171
03:10:37.480 --> 03:10:39.780
Support isn't the primary reason when you think about it,

3172
03:10:40.260 --> 03:10:43.260
like you've got to go out there and someone buys a shirt they want around their

3173
03:10:43.570 --> 03:10:44.440
no, but that being said,

3174
03:10:44.441 --> 03:10:48.310
there are some people that they don't really need another shirt there literally

3175
03:10:48.311 --> 03:10:51.820
just to support. Yes sir. Plenty of people just chatter. Just hey,

3176
03:10:52.030 --> 03:10:56.860
we appreciate the time, the effort, the whatever. Appreciate it.

3177
03:10:56.890 --> 03:10:58.740
Here's a little thank you. A little supports. Yeah.

3178
03:10:58.940 --> 03:11:03.340
There's nothing wrong with that. It's appreciated. That's w that allows us to,

3179
03:11:03.880 --> 03:11:08.530
that allows us to have echo, make all these videos

3180
03:11:12.610 --> 03:11:16.330
nonetheless. The Jocko store know who's listening to this right now.

3181
03:11:16.390 --> 03:11:19.450
No one with three hours, three, three plus hours.

3182
03:11:21.230 --> 03:11:24.660
All right. Whenever you're going to say you might as well say it. No one cares.

3183
03:11:25.130 --> 03:11:28.500
It's all still true about that and yes, the Mitt,

3184
03:11:28.510 --> 03:11:33.180
the stuff that you really want to represent the authentic certified,

3185
03:11:33.190 --> 03:11:35.990
there's no certification process but approved. Approved, yeah.

3186
03:11:36.250 --> 03:11:41.250
Is All on Jocko store.com I w a active dot C O.

3187
03:11:42.731 --> 03:11:46.900

3188
03:11:46.990 --> 03:11:49.870

3189
03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:54.480
well it's dot code that you, you can still yeah, that's,

3190
03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:56.950
you gotta be like that. Okay. Anyway, cause you know,

3191
03:11:56.951 --> 03:11:59.110
cause shipping certain parts in like the pay,

3192
03:11:59.240 --> 03:12:02.230
the shipping is crazy from here is what I'm saying. So boom.

3193
03:12:02.231 --> 03:12:04.630
You wanna you want to sidestep the shipping a little bit. You can do that.

3194
03:12:04.631 --> 03:12:07.270
Might take a little bit longer. I think. Maybe, I'm not sure.

3195
03:12:07.271 --> 03:12:10.180
I don't live in the UK, but nonetheless, some people were asking me about that.

3196
03:12:10.780 --> 03:12:15.310
Oh yeah. Anyway, hoodies and stuff. All the legitimate approved stuff.

3200
03:12:24.390 --> 03:12:27.610
I tuned or whatever you listen to podcasts. That's what I meant to say.

3201
03:12:28.300 --> 03:12:31.870
And the warrior kid podcast, which is not, it is not dead, you know,

3202
03:12:32.210 --> 03:12:36.160
which is more episodes are brewing. They're brewing in my mind.

3203
03:12:36.910 --> 03:12:40.720
Should I, you know what I make for the warrior kid podcasts I do last,

3204
03:12:41.170 --> 03:12:45.880
I don't know, six episodes perhaps. I've done the story from Uncle Jake. Yeah.

3205
03:12:46.240 --> 03:12:51.130
That takes not just time cause it takes a little bit of time to prep,

3206
03:12:51.650 --> 03:12:52.100
but it also

3207
03:12:52.100 --> 03:12:55.610
<v 6>takes the spark of inspiration. Right. Okay. Here's the deal. Right?</v>

3208
03:12:55.611 --> 03:12:59.750
And you can't manufacture Inspirado knows. We know. So sometimes I'm like,

3209
03:12:59.780 --> 03:13:02.630
well I could just do a QA for the kids, which is what it started out as,

3210
03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:06.470
which is fine. Which I get it. So,

3211
03:13:06.890 --> 03:13:11.270
but sometimes I feel like I'm letting everyone down if I don't do this story

3212
03:13:11.271 --> 03:13:12.530
from Uncle Jake's childhood.

3213
03:13:13.000 --> 03:13:16.640
Cause I really liked doing the stories from uncle Jacob Childhood. So do I. Now

3214
03:13:18.830 --> 03:13:20.750
I will, like I said, we're back on it.

3215
03:13:20.751 --> 03:13:23.990
Maybe I'll release some with no story from Uncle Jake's childhood just to,

3216
03:13:24.380 --> 03:13:28.730
cause I get so many good questions from young warrior kids around the world and

3217
03:13:28.731 --> 03:13:33.080
I mean that, think about that. The world little warrior kids all over the place,

3218
03:13:33.470 --> 03:13:36.440
getting ready to get up and get after it. Do some pull-ups. So yeah,

3250
03:15:36.440 --> 03:15:41.440
Phyllis Aka illustrator of where a kid book series and like in the dragons like

03:15:44.811 --> 03:15:47.660
I got some good stuff that you know I'm going back and forth with Dakota Meyer

3253
03:15:47.850 --> 03:15:49.870

wall hanging stuff from Mikey and the dragons,

3256
03:15:57.320 --> 03:16:00.690
which might be the dragon's artwork. Let's face it. This stuff is legit.

3257
03:16:01.470 --> 03:16:04.750
You consider yourself kind of an artist, right? Yes, I do. Yes you do.

3258

Pete Roberts just over there creating color palettes. Yes you are.

I'll see you over there with your color palettes. Your point, sir.

3260
03:16:13.770 --> 03:16:18.480
My point is that we have to admit that Mike and the dragons art work is awesome.

3261
03:16:18.690 --> 03:16:19.740
I will. We're taking it,

3262
03:16:19.800 --> 03:16:24.800
we're putting it on to some legit size canvases and you can hang it up in your

3263
03:16:25.590 --> 03:16:30.390
kid's room so your kid learns to overcome his or her fear

3264
03:16:32.170 --> 03:16:34.480
<v 7>check. Agree also on it.</v>

3265
03:16:34.630 --> 03:16:39.130
So on [inaudible] dot com slash Jocko so this is where you can get any kind of

3266
03:16:39.131 --> 03:16:43.640
fit, like additional fitness gear, awesome fitness gear, including kettlebells,

3267
03:16:43.690 --> 03:16:47.800
which I recommend. Battle ropes, maces clubs.

3268
03:16:48.460 --> 03:16:51.280
So I've been talking to some of the guys there.

3269
03:16:51.281 --> 03:16:54.320
He was telling me about the ecosystem.

3270
03:16:55.030 --> 03:16:59.290
Mace or a club in both. Right. Which one is the one with the longer? Is Mace.

3271
03:16:59.830 --> 03:17:04.180
Okay. Yes. Club is short. Yes. The Mace. So I was like, yeah, no, I, I don't,

3272
03:17:04.210 --> 03:17:05.770
I don't really do that workout.

3273
03:17:05.800 --> 03:17:10.480
But I looked into it and how it might be beneficial. The Macy's,

3274
03:17:10.690 --> 03:17:12.220
even when I official, yeah.

3275
03:17:12.940 --> 03:17:16.030
Well the Mace and they're both beneficial.

3276
03:17:16.480 --> 03:17:19.030
The thing that's beneficial about them, they're awkward. Yes.

3277
03:17:19.290 --> 03:17:21.070
They're hard to him handle. Yeah. You know,

3278
03:17:21.340 --> 03:17:24.100
I've been doing like a lot of kettlebells,

3279
03:17:24.130 --> 03:17:26.900
like heavier for as many reps that you know, it's like that guy.

3280
03:17:26.930 --> 03:17:28.030
You know how there's different, you know,

3281
03:17:28.031 --> 03:17:30.490
you can do like Kettlebell for a long asked anyway.

3282
03:17:31.150 --> 03:17:34.450
The more awkward kind of the thing. And you've been doing those sandbags too.

3283
03:17:34.660 --> 03:17:38.960
Huh? You're soon, man. Those awkward.

3284
03:17:39.210 --> 03:17:41.670
<v 6>Here's a good exercise with the sandbag. You just take your sandbag,</v>

3285
03:17:41.730 --> 03:17:43.260
just heave it over your head, turn around,

3286
03:17:43.470 --> 03:17:45.060
heave it over your head and turned around. He weighed over your head.

3287
03:17:45.390 --> 03:17:46.350
That's actually tiring.

3288
03:17:46.950 --> 03:17:49.380
You're going to find that to be more tiring than you expect.

3289
03:17:49.590 --> 03:17:50.940
Especially cause the first one you're like,

3290
03:17:51.000 --> 03:17:53.640
Oh jack was said this was going to be tiring. It's not.

3291
03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:57.870
Then you do the number three and you're like, jock was not the number five.

3292
03:17:57.871 --> 03:17:59.070
And you're like, why am I breathing hard?

3293
03:18:00.450 --> 03:18:01.890
<v 7>And then you do it like seven times. You're like,</v>

3294
03:18:01.891 --> 03:18:03.900
why am I even doing this because it's too painful.

3295
03:18:04.320 --> 03:18:05.970
That's my experience nonetheless.

3296
03:18:06.170 --> 03:18:09.890
I been doing it and consistently kind of for the first time in life or it'd be

3297
03:18:09.891 --> 03:18:10.020
like,

3298
03:18:10.020 --> 03:18:12.420
Oh yeah I tried to work cause it's cool for a week or two and saying it's cool

3299
03:18:12.421 --> 03:18:13.980
workouts, good workout, I get it.

3300
03:18:14.310 --> 03:18:16.830
But I've been doing them for like long time now.

3301
03:18:16.920 --> 03:18:21.810
Kettlebells like these awkward thing and in Jujitsu I feel this,

3302
03:18:22.080 --> 03:18:23.550
it's not weird. It's weird cause it's new.

3303
03:18:23.551 --> 03:18:26.670
So it's this new like lack of tiredness.

3304
03:18:26.700 --> 03:18:29.400
You know how there's like different tiredness in Jujitsu where you're like,

3305
03:18:29.401 --> 03:18:33.510
okay I'm winning. You know various people, you know. Yeah. Not You,

3306
03:18:33.660 --> 03:18:34.710
your knees out. I get it.

3307
03:18:34.770 --> 03:18:36.930
And you know when you come back we can roll or whatever.

3308
03:18:36.931 --> 03:18:40.680
And maybe I can really put my non tiredness to the test. But like I'm saying,

3309
03:18:40.890 --> 03:18:42.810
you get few different types of tiredness.

3310
03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:48.850
<v 6>You're like, oh, that has nine like 150 different names for snow.</v>

3311
03:18:49.060 --> 03:18:53.200
You have different, different styles and tired. Negative. No, because there's,

3312
03:18:53.630 --> 03:18:56.770
oh, think about it. There's the contentedness where you're breathing real hard,

3313
03:18:56.771 --> 03:18:59.980
but you can still generate kind of force with your muscles. You know,

3314
03:18:59.981 --> 03:19:02.850
your muscles aren't like Noodley, but you're like, oh,

3315
03:19:02.920 --> 03:19:06.340
you're not a muscle failure. Yes. Which is different. It's different.

3316
03:19:06.400 --> 03:19:10.450
And they would call that type of tired muscle faring, muscle fatigue,

3317
03:19:10.940 --> 03:19:12.940
Eskimo words for all these different things.

3318
03:19:13.120 --> 03:19:16.990
All your different forms of fatigue anyway. Or you can be like, Dang,

3319
03:19:16.991 --> 03:19:19.330
I'm not breathing hard, but I just, I'm just so weak. My body,

3320
03:19:19.331 --> 03:19:22.870
I can't lift my train with me. How much have you trained with me? I don't know.

3321
03:19:23.500 --> 03:19:27.700
Infinity Times. What? What? How do you describe my tired.

3322
03:19:30.100 --> 03:19:33.940
All right. Here's the, I'm trying to think. Have you ever seen me get tired?

3323
03:19:34.480 --> 03:19:38.300
I have with me. No. No. I've been tired. I'll tell you there's,

3324
03:19:38.530 --> 03:19:41.980
there's a couple times I totally remember getting tired. I was,

3325
03:19:42.040 --> 03:19:45.520
we did Nogi holiday training here.

3326
03:19:45.521 --> 03:19:50.260
One time we started with No-gi, we went to g, we had six,

3327
03:19:50.680 --> 03:19:55.510
I think it was six 10 minute rounds. No, it was six,

3328
03:19:55.570 --> 03:19:58.780
six minute rounds. No-Gi six six minute rounds,

3329
03:19:58.890 --> 03:20:01.540
G and I was tired at the end of that. Everyone's, you know,

3330
03:20:01.930 --> 03:20:02.741
everyone does the leg.

3331
03:20:02.741 --> 03:20:05.450
I'll take a rest round and then I'm going to go get Jocko. Yeah.

3332
03:20:05.780 --> 03:20:09.550
I'm just tired fully. Nonetheless. I didn't,

3333
03:20:09.580 --> 03:20:13.960
after doing all these workouts, I don't feel the like body tired,

3334
03:20:14.380 --> 03:20:17.990
you know, like a dog. Don't feel it. It was like not even nearly as well,

3335
03:20:17.991 --> 03:20:21.790
like I really got to get pushed to fill it, but so anyway. Anyway, the point is,

3336
03:20:21.960 --> 03:20:22.000
yeah,

3337
03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:25.210
go to [inaudible] dot com slash chocolate look at all the cool stuff on there.

3338
03:20:25.480 --> 03:20:27.400
Grabbed something from there that I don't really help you.

3339
03:20:27.401 --> 03:20:32.140
I'll keep you in the game. Big Tour books. Jocko. What do we got?

3340
03:20:32.790 --> 03:20:36.100
Got a bunch of books. Goodwill, where there's a will.

3341
03:20:37.690 --> 03:20:42.010
That's the latest way of the warrior kid book where there's a will getting some

3342
03:20:42.011 --> 03:20:45.910
really good reviews from people. I'm one of them. Have you finished it yet? No.

3343
03:20:46.250 --> 03:20:48.130
Oh, you're still working through it, Huh? Anyways,

3344
03:20:48.340 --> 03:20:51.430
if you want to help your kids or any kids that you know get on the path,

3345
03:20:51.460 --> 03:20:55.210
these are, these are books that everyone tells me and I will tell you,

3346
03:20:55.211 --> 03:20:58.060
I wish I had these books when I was seven years old, eight years old,

3347
03:20:58.061 --> 03:20:58.871
nine years old, 10 years old,

3348
03:20:58.871 --> 03:21:03.730
100% where the warrior kid Mark's mission and where there's a will check them

3349
03:21:03.731 --> 03:21:07.060
out. They're in multiple different languages to check that out.

3350
03:21:07.420 --> 03:21:09.700
If you speak a different language where your children speak a different

3351
03:21:09.701 --> 03:21:13.220
language, you can get that. Also got Mikey and the dragons miking.

3352
03:21:13.250 --> 03:21:18.250
The dragons is the book that should be read to every kid at least once a day

3353
03:21:20.170 --> 03:21:24.750
from the ages of one until six. I agree.

3354
03:21:25.390 --> 03:21:28.990
I just read it in a first grade class.

3355
03:21:29.710 --> 03:21:33.460
You went in the first one to a first grade class and read it.

3356
03:21:33.760 --> 03:21:37.300
How'd that bad happened? I went in there. I got nuts.

3357
03:21:38.230 --> 03:21:40.180
I told all the kids, cause you know it's like they're trying to,

3358
03:21:40.260 --> 03:21:43.600
their goal of a is to keep the kids calm. Right? I come in there, no,

3359
03:21:43.660 --> 03:21:44.321
that's not happening.

3360
03:21:44.321 --> 03:21:47.330
So I'm like good morning children and like there are good morning and I'm like,

3361
03:21:47.331 --> 03:21:50.660
what? Good morning. What? I can't hear you. What?

3362
03:21:51.040 --> 03:21:54.770
I'm not sure what you're saying. Can you please be loud? Are [inaudible].

3363
03:21:54.950 --> 03:21:57.590
So they're amped. And as I was getting them all amped up,

3364
03:21:57.591 --> 03:21:59.600
I started getting nervous cause I said, wait a second,

3365
03:22:00.050 --> 03:22:04.460
I'm getting these kids completely just jacked up and getting crazy and hyper.

3366
03:22:05.390 --> 03:22:08.120
And then I'm going to expect them to sit and listen to me read this book,

3367
03:22:08.121 --> 03:22:12.320
which is a 15 maybe an 18 minute read. It's not, it's not short.

3368
03:22:13.100 --> 03:22:16.220
It's not short. And so I was, I was like, Ooh,

3369
03:22:16.310 --> 03:22:17.780
I might have overstepped my balance. I might've done,

3370
03:22:17.781 --> 03:22:19.640
I might have made a broad tactical call.

3371
03:22:21.440 --> 03:22:24.310
So then I crack open the book. And this is after, you know,

3372
03:22:24.860 --> 03:22:27.070
answering a couple questions. I crack open the book, I read it, boom,

3373
03:22:27.071 --> 03:22:31.490
silence and total attention for 18 minutes. While I read the book.

3374
03:22:32.180 --> 03:22:37.040
So that book, and I was to explain to the kids that I put,

3375
03:22:37.160 --> 03:22:40.160
I put words in her, I said, listen, there's words in this books that you,

3376
03:22:40.340 --> 03:22:41.173
when you read them,

3377
03:22:41.720 --> 03:22:46.580
people were saying that words too big of a word for a little kid. I said,

3378
03:22:46.581 --> 03:22:49.790
these people want to make you stupid. I want to make you smart.

3379
03:22:49.940 --> 03:22:52.520
When you see this word, and I opened up poised, there's a thing, right?

3380
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:57.440
We use the word poise. I rhyme it with noise. And I said,

3381
03:22:57.620 --> 03:23:00.710
these people don't want you to know what the word places.

3382
03:23:01.040 --> 03:23:03.260
And I read it to them again, that little section. I said,

3383
03:23:03.261 --> 03:23:06.200
what do you think that means? And you know, some little kid, little,

3384
03:23:06.290 --> 03:23:11.270
little Billy up front. Is it mean like he said something really smart. He says,

3385
03:23:11.630 --> 03:23:16.490
does it mean you keep your feelings inside? And I said, yes, Billy.

3386
03:23:17.390 --> 03:23:22.120
That's what it means. Don't let the man keep you down. They want to see,

3387
03:23:22.130 --> 03:23:24.860
they want to give you the dumbest book. You can read this books,

3388
03:23:24.861 --> 03:23:26.480
got a couple of words. You're gonna, you're gonna have to,

3389
03:23:26.740 --> 03:23:29.240
you don't have to try and figure out what they mean, but you will poise.

3390
03:23:29.241 --> 03:23:32.090
You just figured it out. Billy, you set an example for everyone in this room.

3391
03:23:32.600 --> 03:23:35.090
Salute. Salute William.

3392
03:23:36.020 --> 03:23:39.530
I know that's advanced man. So that's Mike in the dragons.

3393
03:23:39.920 --> 03:23:43.730
Get that for the library. This is what you did there.

3394
03:23:44.750 --> 03:23:48.700
That was my theory. Hypothesis, you know? Okay. So you're, you're,

3395
03:23:48.860 --> 03:23:52.800
I made you train to the next belt level up. Yeah. Okay.

3396
03:23:53.360 --> 03:23:57.410
<v 7>No, with, with, with the kids, when you're getting them all fired up,</v>

3397
03:23:57.860 --> 03:24:00.200
here's what you did. You didn't necessarily get them,

3398
03:24:01.640 --> 03:24:06.050
you said there's a difference between being loud and fired up and being at

3399
03:24:06.051 --> 03:24:09.110
attention. So you got like the,

3400
03:24:09.130 --> 03:24:12.950
the trouble from what I understand that teachers and babysitters are way,

3401
03:24:12.951 --> 03:24:15.410
if you're looking after the big grand coaches and stuff like this,

3402
03:24:15.411 --> 03:24:18.290
looking after a big group of kids is, they don't, they're, they don't,

3403
03:24:18.291 --> 03:24:20.930
you don't have their attention. Yeah. You're fired up.

3404
03:24:21.110 --> 03:24:22.400
And a lot of the time with kids,

3405
03:24:22.401 --> 03:24:24.440
they're so fired up that they can't give you their attention.

3406
03:24:25.770 --> 03:24:27.350
It's going everywhere. Yes, exactly right.

3407
03:24:27.710 --> 03:24:31.490
So what you did is you just basically wrangled like a big horse wrangler

3408
03:24:31.760 --> 03:24:33.740
wrangled, all of that fired up in this,

3409
03:24:33.741 --> 03:24:35.510
that these kids in there actually have anyway,

3410
03:24:35.720 --> 03:24:37.770
but you got their attention so they'd,

3411
03:24:37.820 --> 03:24:40.880
you didn't have to like go against the grain with them at all.

3412
03:24:40.910 --> 03:24:43.290
All you did was sort of funnel it, funnel it you,

3413
03:24:43.291 --> 03:24:45.090
so all that fire does towards you.

3414
03:24:45.090 --> 03:24:46.980
So when it was time they'll do anything you say.

3415
03:24:46.981 --> 03:24:48.540
Now you're telling me you actually,

3416
03:24:48.541 --> 03:24:53.250
you've actually seen firsthand and the effects lasted like weeks after the

3417
03:24:53.251 --> 03:24:57.210
wreck, which is weird. I'm going to show you both videos side-by-side. Yeah,

3418
03:24:57.211 --> 03:25:00.420
that's right. Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to tell the people if I haven't already,

3419
03:25:00.480 --> 03:25:03.780
I dunno. I might have said [inaudible]. Okay. So we're at, uh,

3420
03:25:04.980 --> 03:25:08.460
Dave Burke's house. Good deal. Good deal. Do FERC. Shouse exactly right.

3421
03:25:08.520 --> 03:25:13.350
And we're leaving. It's time to leave. So it's like my kids, my two kids. Um,

3422
03:25:13.380 --> 03:25:17.070
your kids were not there. One of my kids, my youngest. Yes.

3423
03:25:17.071 --> 03:25:20.550
Your younger youngest was there. Um, Dave Burke skids,

3424
03:25:21.600 --> 03:25:26.340
Jamie and Flynn Cochrane's kids. And who else was there anywhere?

3425
03:25:26.670 --> 03:25:31.110
It was a lot. This is a lot of kids and jock was there.

3426
03:25:31.260 --> 03:25:32.370
You did the exact same thing.

3427
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:35.370
They did the exact same thing with them as you did with the kids in the class.

3428
03:25:35.490 --> 03:25:37.590
See, I see what you're doing there now, which is good by the way.

3429
03:25:37.830 --> 03:25:39.930
So you're going to detached. I like it. Detached.

3430
03:25:40.120 --> 03:25:42.720
You're giving your assessment and I have the video to revisit two.

3431
03:25:42.721 --> 03:25:47.330
I have one and my wife has one. So my wife's one, she's videoing you and your,

3432
03:25:47.360 --> 03:25:48.990
it cuts in where you're going like this.

3433
03:25:48.991 --> 03:25:51.890
You're going go go hookah with your hands site to site.

3434
03:25:52.060 --> 03:25:55.800
You're going to hook a hook, go hoop. The Ha and the kids are trying to keep up.

3435
03:25:55.801 --> 03:25:56.970
They're like, oh, what are we doing? Okay.

3436
03:25:57.090 --> 03:25:58.650
And slowly they started doing it and you're like,

3437
03:25:58.651 --> 03:26:02.030
and then you start yelling at them. You're not doing it loud enough. Yeah.

3438
03:26:02.190 --> 03:26:05.450
And then the same thing who go and they all start doing, they fall in light,

3439
03:26:05.460 --> 03:26:07.640
they're doing it louder or whatever and you're like louder.

3440
03:26:07.670 --> 03:26:11.640
Of course they want to be louder so they get so they can and they fall in late

3441
03:26:11.670 --> 03:26:14.930
and they do it. You're like, good. And then you give them high fives, right?

3442
03:26:15.180 --> 03:26:19.680
Good job. You'd want high five, you're like harder. Give one,

3443
03:26:19.790 --> 03:26:23.310
high five just whichever random kid please say harder and then they hit you with

3444
03:26:23.311 --> 03:26:25.200
a harder high-five. Then you go ah,

3445
03:26:25.230 --> 03:26:29.490
real loud and you go mean of course that gets everyone else fired up like they

3446
03:26:29.491 --> 03:26:30.510
want to do the same thing.

3447
03:26:30.511 --> 03:26:34.040
So you're like going from kid to kid high five saying aw mean and everyone's

3448
03:26:34.050 --> 03:26:37.320
trying to do it harder than the last kid or whatever. Meanwhile when other kids,

3449
03:26:37.321 --> 03:26:40.710
if you notice when other kids are giving you high five,

3450
03:26:40.711 --> 03:26:44.610
the ones that are not giving you high fives are just watching full attention.

3451
03:26:44.640 --> 03:26:46.830
Just waiting, waiting for the next thing.

3452
03:26:47.370 --> 03:26:52.370
Now the point of this story that made a significant to me was because two,

3453
03:26:52.830 --> 03:26:56.220
not even two weeks later, let me be like a week later, right? My son who's two,

3454
03:26:56.230 --> 03:26:58.770
my daughter who's six, my daughter accidentally,

3455
03:26:58.771 --> 03:27:00.210
and my wife has this on video too,

3456
03:27:00.390 --> 03:27:03.120
cause they're playing and doing little dances, whatever on accident.

3457
03:27:03.780 --> 03:27:08.280
My daughter steps on my son's wrist just on accident when they're Kinda,

3458
03:27:08.420 --> 03:27:13.110
you know, in the scramble. So my son gets up, he's like, he goes, ah,

3459
03:27:13.170 --> 03:27:15.000
and hits my daughter. Right.

3460
03:27:15.870 --> 03:27:20.290
And goes mean like, what the heck? That was kind of weird, you know,

3461
03:27:20.470 --> 03:27:23.880
that was a weird outbursts right there. So I'm like, cool. And then,

3462
03:27:23.881 --> 03:27:27.780
but my wife clever, she kinda remembered something about it. Right.

3463
03:27:27.781 --> 03:27:32.070
So she revisits the video that she took of you going, ah, I mean,

3464
03:27:32.071 --> 03:27:35.580
so it was like a hit and then I'll point on, right. That's what you did.

3465
03:27:35.581 --> 03:27:38.280
They hit in your version with a high five. Sure enough,

3466
03:27:38.281 --> 03:27:41.380
I see my son's little head watching the whole time, just in the corner.

3467
03:27:41.381 --> 03:27:42.350
He didn't do any highlights.

3468
03:27:42.430 --> 03:27:46.060
<v 6>He was watching the whole thing. Go revisit my son daughter's virgin,</v>

3469
03:27:46.240 --> 03:27:50.170
same exact thing. Boom. Incident, right steps on the wrist.

3470
03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:55.810
Instead of high five he does a hit to her shoulder or whatever in a high five

3471
03:27:56.050 --> 03:27:59.050
fashion and goes mean the exact same tone is you.

3472
03:27:59.500 --> 03:28:01.300
Your children are always learning. Yes.

3473
03:28:01.540 --> 03:28:06.320
So if you want your children to learn properly, the right stuff. Yeah,

3474
03:28:06.370 --> 03:28:07.930
read them Mikey and the dragons. Yeah,

3475
03:28:08.080 --> 03:28:12.220
but see what you did there with the attention. Rightfully it's,

3476
03:28:12.290 --> 03:28:14.770
it's totally effective. That's a good note, man.

3477
03:28:14.771 --> 03:28:18.010
I'm going to tell you that's a good little anecdote technique.

3478
03:28:18.040 --> 03:28:21.790
I'm going to use it. I'm gonna use it. Check. Don't do it before bedtime.

3479
03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:24.730
By the way, don't forget about the discipline equals freedom field manual.

3480
03:28:25.390 --> 03:28:29.560
This is the graduation gift, right? Get it for your kids.

3481
03:28:30.010 --> 03:28:30.520
What are they?

3482
03:28:30.520 --> 03:28:35.520
1517 1922 the 24 getting done with their master's.

3483
03:28:36.820 --> 03:28:39.340
Get them to discipline me cause freedom field Mandel, they got work to do.

3484
03:28:39.580 --> 03:28:44.500
We all do. If you want it on audio, it's on iTunes, it's on Amazon music,

3485
03:28:44.501 --> 03:28:45.370
Google play and all that.

3486
03:28:45.700 --> 03:28:49.690
Then you've got extreme ownership and the dichotomy of leadership written both

3487
03:28:49.720 --> 03:28:51.610
by me and my brother Leif Babin.

3488
03:28:51.820 --> 03:28:56.820
They are books about leadership and they will give you some principles that you

3489
03:28:57.611 --> 03:29:02.020
can apply to every single situation you are in,

3490
03:29:02.080 --> 03:29:06.520
in business, in life, the economy, leadership and extreme ownership.

3491
03:29:07.600 --> 03:29:08.590
Speaking of life,

3492
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:13.710
we have a leadership consultancy and what we do is solve problems inside

3493
03:29:14.021 --> 03:29:17.380
organizations and we solve them through leadership cause that's where the

3494
03:29:17.381 --> 03:29:21.340
problem is. So it's me, it's Lafe, Bab and JP Denelle,

3498

I am at Jocko Willink and once again, thanks to all the veterans out there,

3525
03:31:37.570 --> 03:31:42.570
men like John Stryker Meyer who fought for the American ideal and who himself

3526
03:31:44.381 --> 03:31:49.180
represents that ideal, true American hero,

3527
03:31:49.590 --> 03:31:54.400
humbled to sit here and talk to him and to those of you that are out there on

3528
03:31:54.401 --> 03:31:55.660
the front lines right now,

3529
03:31:56.560 --> 03:32:01.390
thank you for fighting for our ideals as well.

3530
03:32:02.500 --> 03:32:07.120
And also thanks to police law enforcement, firefighters, paramedics,

Thanks to you for living a life of service and sacrifice so that we can live our

3534
03:32:18.731 --> 03:32:21.610
lives in safety and security.

3535
03:32:23.850 --> 03:32:27.010
And to everyone else out there, remember

3536
03:32:31.870 --> 03:32:36.250
John Stryker Meyer has written about and told us stories that he lived through

3537
03:32:36.251 --> 03:32:39.460
and some of them are just hard to believe.

3538

3540
03:32:50.470 --> 03:32:52.330
there are an infinite number

3541
03:32:54.010 --> 03:32:55.660
of stories that never got told

3542
03:32:57.560 --> 03:33:02.240
stories from the men who did not come home,

3543

soldiers, sailors,

3544

airmen and Marines who gave away all their stories,

3545
03:33:12.260 --> 03:33:14.570
past, present, and future.

3546
03:33:16.860 --> 03:33:21.150
They sacrificed all those stories, the stories of their lives

3547
03:33:23.150 --> 03:33:23.983
for us.

3548
