this feature graphic contains a really

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250
this feature graphic contains a really
 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.800
this feature graphic contains a really
good set of elements it makes it clear

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810
good set of elements it makes it clear
 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.120

what sort of game we're talking about

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
what sort of game we're talking about
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.910
what sort of game we're talking about
you know the space out graphic it's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920
you know the space out graphic it's
 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.070
you know the space out graphic it's
always a good size right very legible if

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080
always a good size right very legible if
 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.590
always a good size right very legible if
the game is featuring it could be a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600
the game is featuring it could be a
 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.240
the game is featuring it could be a
little bit more polished looking and I

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250
little bit more polished looking and I
 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.790
little bit more polished looking and I
think that perhaps that the effect

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800
think that perhaps that the effect
 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.590
think that perhaps that the effect
behind spaced out might be a little bit

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600
behind spaced out might be a little bit
 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.420
behind spaced out might be a little bit
much right if it's all of our guidelines

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430
much right if it's all of our guidelines
 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.190
much right if it's all of our guidelines
ya know for sure I mean if you think

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
ya know for sure I mean if you think
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.380
ya know for sure I mean if you think
about like this is the first graphic if

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390
about like this is the first graphic if
 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.880
about like this is the first graphic if
your game ever does get featured that

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890
your game ever does get featured that
 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.890
your game ever does get featured that
gets seen on your mobile phone so you

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900
gets seen on your mobile phone so you
 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.210
gets seen on your mobile phone so you
have to think about the screen size as

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220
have to think about the screen size as
 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.380
have to think about the screen size as
well and so it's always important to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390
well and so it's always important to
 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.000
well and so it's always important to
focus on the most important elements

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010
focus on the most important elements
 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.520
focus on the most important elements
which is the title and also what your

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530
which is the title and also what your
 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.040
which is the title and also what your
game is about so it actually do hope it

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050
game is about so it actually do hope it
 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.960
game is about so it actually do hope it
would actually include a little bit more

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970
would actually include a little bit more
 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.520
would actually include a little bit more
of the 3d depth because the actual game

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530
of the 3d depth because the actual game
 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.550
of the 3d depth because the actual game
is in 3d and you know it's kind of

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560
is in 3d and you know it's kind of
 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.590
is in 3d and you know it's kind of
strange that I seeing like a 2d 8-bit

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600
strange that I seeing like a 2d 8-bit
 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.850
strange that I seeing like a 2d 8-bit
version game so I actually was not

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860
version game so I actually was not
 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.890
version game so I actually was not
expecting the game that i was playing

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900
expecting the game that i was playing
 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.210
expecting the game that i was playing

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:06.920
that we have the beautiful advantage
that we're actually looking at the

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:06.930
that we're actually looking at the
 

00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.780
that we're actually looking at the
screen right now at a very small screen

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:08.790
screen right now at a very small screen
 

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:11.240
screen right now at a very small screen
like I couldn't possibly read the text

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:11.250
like I couldn't possibly read the text
 

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:12.770
like I couldn't possibly read the text
in the review itself from where we're

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:12.780
in the review itself from where we're
 

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.500
in the review itself from where we're
looking but the size of the review of

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:15.510
looking but the size of the review of
 

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:17.210
looking but the size of the review of
the two of the graphic they were looking

00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220
the two of the graphic they were looking
 

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:18.740
the two of the graphic they were looking
at right now is not that far off from

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:18.750
at right now is not that far off from
 

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.630
at right now is not that far off from
this size on a phone or tablet and I

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640
this size on a phone or tablet and I
 

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.820
this size on a phone or tablet and I
just it looks like can't see anything

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:22.830
just it looks like can't see anything
 

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.770
just it looks like can't see anything
like I can't read it yeah it looks like

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:24.780
like I can't read it yeah it looks like
 

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.950
like I can't read it yeah it looks like
p drag to I can read the two so a little

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960
p drag to I can read the two so a little
 

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.750
p drag to I can read the two so a little
bit more contrast would actually help

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760
bit more contrast would actually help
 

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.920
bit more contrast would actually help
quite a bit and this is one of those

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:30.930
quite a bit and this is one of those
 

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:32.660
quite a bit and this is one of those
times where a really a subtle drop

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:32.670
times where a really a subtle drop
 

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:33.830
times where a really a subtle drop
shadow would help a little bit more

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840
shadow would help a little bit more
 

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.330
shadow would help a little bit more
there might be one if there is one it's

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:35.340
there might be one if there is one it's
 

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.330
there might be one if there is one it's
really subtle right here no no a little

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340
really subtle right here no no a little
 

00:29:38.340 --> 00:29:40.850
really subtle right here no no a little
one yeah I mean we can read it we can

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:40.860
one yeah I mean we can read it we can
 

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.050
one yeah I mean we can read it we can
read it when we're looking at a closer

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:42.060
read it when we're looking at a closer
 

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.120
read it when we're looking at a closer
screen so I'm like so that I mean really

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.130
screen so I'm like so that I mean really
 

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.320
screen so I'm like so that I mean really
the biggest thing is just think about

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:45.330
the biggest thing is just think about
 

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:46.460

like you know when you think about

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:46.470
like you know when you think about
 

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.930
like you know when you think about
designing your feature graphic always

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:47.940
designing your feature graphic always
 

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.280

if they just switch that all to read
 

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.550
if they just switch that all to read
letters it probably would have been fine

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:01.560
letters it probably would have been fine
 

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.380

wasn't until I started touching a screen

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:52.110
wasn't until I started touching a screen
 

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:53.800
wasn't until I started touching a screen
that I realized oh I was

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:53.810

an interstitial where it's really clear
that it's interstitial this is cool but

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:01.760
that it's interstitial this is cool but
 

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.880
that it's interstitial this is cool but

was very interesting because it was one
 

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.790
was very interesting because it was one
of those things where it's a beautifully

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:00.800
of those things where it's a beautifully
 

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.550
of those things where it's a beautifully
beautifully drawn game so we're gonna

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:03.560
beautifully drawn game so we're gonna
 

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.560
beautifully drawn game so we're gonna
try a harder level because just more fun

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:05.570
try a harder level because just more fun
 

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:07.570

building 44 arcade or at least were in
front of the building forward before me

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:22.040
front of the building forward before me
 

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.750
front of the building forward before me
for arcade but we also have you noticed

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760
for arcade but we also have you noticed
 

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.610

this is setting setting a new new trend

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:27.620
this is setting setting a new new trend
 

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.100

uh you know this game this game really

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:32.419
uh you know this game this game really
 

00:34:32.419 --> 00:34:34.270
uh you know this game this game really
has a lot going for it I just kind of

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:34.280
has a lot going for it I just kind of
 

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.530
has a lot going for it I just kind of
want to see the developer take it to the

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:35.540
want to see the developer take it to the
 

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:38.830
want to see the developer take it to the
next level because I think it could be

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:38.840
next level because I think it could be
 

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.720
next level because I think it could be
better I am I just kind of wish like you

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:40.730
better I am I just kind of wish like you
 

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.070
better I am I just kind of wish like you
know when you blow up the buildings like

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:42.080
know when you blow up the buildings like
 

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.690
know when you blow up the buildings like
all those bricks and all that for fall

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:43.700
all those bricks and all that for fall
 

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.370
all those bricks and all that for fall
apart and all that stuff but i guess

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:45.380
apart and all that stuff but i guess
 

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.600
apart and all that stuff but i guess
like that kind of would affect the level

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:46.610
like that kind of would affect the level
 

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:48.460
