obviously I agree and we were with the

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250
obviously I agree and we were with the
 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.070
obviously I agree and we were with the
Bloomberg foundation the major funder of

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080
Bloomberg foundation the major funder of
 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.990
Bloomberg foundation the major funder of
all of this so clearly I think that this

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000
all of this so clearly I think that this
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.440
all of this so clearly I think that this
is a very critical thing to do and we

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450
is a very critical thing to do and we
 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.470
is a very critical thing to do and we
really want to spread this to cities all

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
really want to spread this to cities all
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.570
really want to spread this to cities all
across the United States but let me talk

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
across the United States but let me talk
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.849
across the United States but let me talk
about other kinds of structures than

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
about other kinds of structures than
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.460
about other kinds of structures than
volunteerism which is is extraordinarily

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
volunteerism which is is extraordinarily
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.450
volunteerism which is is extraordinarily
important and and return to the role of

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460
important and and return to the role of
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.130
important and and return to the role of
a university because I I think

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140
a university because I I think
 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.979
a university because I I think
universities in order to train it

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
universities in order to train it
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.250
universities in order to train it
students to be good citizens need to be

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
students to be good citizens need to be
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.740
students to be good citizens need to be
good citizens themselves so the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
good citizens themselves so the
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.470
good citizens themselves so the
university needs to be a role model for

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
university needs to be a role model for
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.720
university needs to be a role model for
civic engagement it needs to create

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
civic engagement it needs to create
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.830
civic engagement it needs to create
opportunities for civic engagement and

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840
opportunities for civic engagement and
 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.709
opportunities for civic engagement and
one structural way to do that is through

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
one structural way to do that is through
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.910
one structural way to do that is through
service learning courses courses that

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
service learning courses courses that
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.420
service learning courses courses that
really do take the theoretical knowledge

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
really do take the theoretical knowledge
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.630
really do take the theoretical knowledge
in the classroom and also create a

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
in the classroom and also create a
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.789
in the classroom and also create a
mechanism for students to be able to see

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799
mechanism for students to be able to see
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.710
mechanism for students to be able to see
how they can translate that on the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
how they can translate that on the
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.390
how they can translate that on the
ground and not every course is amenable

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
ground and not every course is amenable
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.240
ground and not every course is amenable
to that not every professor finds that a

to that not every professor finds that a
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.179
to that not every professor finds that a
particularly valuable application but

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
particularly valuable application but
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.660
particularly valuable application but
really probing where and how that can

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
really probing where and how that can
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.210
really probing where and how that can
happen I'll give you one example and

neighborhood and then they give the
 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.340
neighborhood and then they give the
families the information they teach them

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350
families the information they teach them

developed a really great map of the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550
developed a really great map of the

Philadelphia which has fed back and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620
Philadelphia which has fed back and
 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.380
Philadelphia which has fed back and
helped a lot of the Public Health

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390
helped a lot of the Public Health

investigators and so they really are

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150
investigators and so they really are
 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.300
investigators and so they really are
learning okay I now know about geology

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
learning okay I now know about geology
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.360
learning okay I now know about geology
so I've learned about lead and now I'm

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370
so I've learned about lead and now I'm
 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.060
so I've learned about lead and now I'm
figuring out how I can apply that in a

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070
figuring out how I can apply that in a
 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.100
figuring out how I can apply that in a
way that provides service for others

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110
way that provides service for others
 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.090
way that provides service for others
that's a really important structural

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100
that's a really important structural
 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.340
that's a really important structural
tangible thing again not everything is

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350
tangible thing again not everything is
 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.050
tangible thing again not everything is
applied I to believe in theoretical

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060
applied I to believe in theoretical
 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.390
applied I to believe in theoretical
knowledge but where it can be it's

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400
knowledge but where it can be it's
 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.490
knowledge but where it can be it's
really valuable and it sets your mind in

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500
really valuable and it sets your mind in
 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.500
really valuable and it sets your mind in
a different course because then you're

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510
a different course because then you're
 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.320
a different course because then you're
always inquiring analytically you know

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330
always inquiring analytically you know
 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.170
always inquiring analytically you know
how could I apply what I learned maybe

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180
how could I apply what I learned maybe
 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.430
how could I apply what I learned maybe
there is a different way of thinking

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440
there is a different way of thinking
 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.800
there is a different way of thinking
about this maybe there's a new way and

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810
about this maybe there's a new way and
 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.950
about this maybe there's a new way and
you if you do that you can shift

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960
you if you do that you can shift
 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.950
you if you do that you can shift
paradigms as well because some of the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960
paradigms as well because some of the
 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.390
paradigms as well because some of the
traditional ways that we've thought

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400
traditional ways that we've thought
 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.790
traditional ways that we've thought
about delivering service haven't always

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800
about delivering service haven't always
 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.640
about delivering service haven't always
been as effective and we're also in a

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650
been as effective and we're also in a
 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.920
been as effective and we're also in a
21st century model so even if they were

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930
21st century model so even if they were
 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.590
21st century model so even if they were
effective in the last century we may

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600
effective in the last century we may
 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.540
effective in the last century we may
need different ways of thinking about it

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550
need different ways of thinking about it
 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.640
need different ways of thinking about it
now I think these courses are one

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650
now I think these courses are one
 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.790
now I think these courses are one
mechanism we're doing that yeah I yes um
