00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:03.604
Now, it’s possible you haven’t
noticed all the wicked ways

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:07.074
these snowflakes and soy boys
are sabotaging Halloween.

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:09.543
So I’ve invited some
of our citizen journalists

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:11.345
to share some scary stories,

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:12.746
submitted for the approval

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:15.282
of the 30 Minutes
to Midnight Society.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:17.217
♪ ♪

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.359
Our first tale tonight
comes from Aaron and Josh,

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.029
who are dressed as Don Jr.
and Eric Trump.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.964
Um...
(clears throat) No.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.367
-Jordan, uh...
-(cheering and applause)

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:36.570
Sorry, no.
A-Actually, Jordan, we’re, uh...

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.238
we’re sexy Don Jr.

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.308
-A-And slutty Eric Trump.
-Yeah.

00:00:41.308 --> 00:00:44.645
You’re gonna be terrified
of how aroused you are!

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:46.246
You’re gonna be so aroused,

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:49.583
Mike Pence is gonna send you
to conversion therapy.

00:00:49.583 --> 00:00:51.852
Our story is called...

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:55.989
BOTH: "The Tale
of the Brainwashed School."

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.192
Halloween
is now considered too--

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:02.729
and I’m quoting--
non-inclusive to be celebrated

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.265
in at least two elementary
schools in Massachusetts.

00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:07.734
Boyden Elementary School

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:12.139
will be replacing Halloween with
Black and Orange spirit day!

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.274
Anthony, this is insane!

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.877
-It’s... -They say they’re doing
it because it’s not inclusive

00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:19.813
-of all students. There is no
more inclusive holiday -Right.

00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:22.883
than Halloween. Everyone gets
to participate in Halloween.

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:25.819
Yes, Jordan! Everyone is allowed
to trick-or-treat!

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:28.422
Except for some religious kids
and diabetic kids

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:31.091
and childless drunk adults,
apparently.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.094
Thanks for the ankle bracelet,
State of New York!

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.763
-Honestly, you wear it well.
(clears throat) -Thank you.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:39.700
But, Jordan, that’s the problem
with inclusivity--

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.703
the PC police are so scared
of leaving one person out,

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:45.906
now no one gets Halloween...
during school hours.

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:47.841
Once they go home,
then everyone gets Halloween.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:53.180
-But, still, it’s spooky...!
-Ooh... -Ooh.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.083
-(applause and cheering)
-Terrifying stuff.

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:58.752
Terrifying. The last time
I was that frightened,

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:01.254
I trusted Nate Silver
as a legitimate polling source.

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.589
(laughter)

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:04.458
(Hillary laughing)

00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.093
(thunder rumbling)

00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:09.029
Niccole, you look positively
horrifying.

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.497
Exactly, Jordan.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.767
I’m a holiday Starbucks cup
that doesn’t say "Christmas."

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:15.836
-Oh.
-(laughter)

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:20.240
As you can see, I put the "hot"
in "boyc-hot Starbucks.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.376
(laughter)

00:02:22.376 --> 00:02:25.145
-(applause)
-But listen...

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:29.449
Not everyone thinks Halloween is
about looking fabulous.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:34.121
Just listen to the tale
of the P.C. Costume Killer!

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:38.125
WOMAN: Halloween now becoming
 more politically correct

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:40.227
 as college campuses
 try and dictate

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:44.131
 what students can
 and cannot dress up as.

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.733
 Wesleyan University
 putting up these posters,

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:49.870
 asking if your costume
 is offensive.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.371
MAN: 
 Is it okay for people

00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:53.440
 to dress up
 like an American Indian?

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.876
And I thought multiculturalism
was a good thing.

00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:58.712
Can a liberal dress up as
Barack Obama if you’re white?

00:02:58.712 --> 00:03:01.314
I don’t even want to go there.

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:03.316
Okay, I’ll go there.

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.951
(laughter)

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.220
And I’m gonna wear what I want.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.957
Halloween is about embracing
fantastical personas,

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:14.194
like Jedi, or ninja, or Latina.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.996
(laughter)

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:18.965
Now, I know all these colleges
might be putting up posters

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:21.468
that say, "Niccole,
you don’t understand the history

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.236
"behind what you are wearing.

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:25.238
You are treating
someone’s heritage as a joke!"

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:27.808
And to that I say,
this is not a joke!

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:30.177
I am seriously
killing this kimono.

00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:32.012
-(laughter)
-But...

00:03:32.012 --> 00:03:34.948
What better way to respect a
culture than by walking a mile

00:03:34.948 --> 00:03:36.650
in someone else’s shoes,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.885
and getting blackout drunk
in their skin tone?

00:03:38.885 --> 00:03:40.554
(laughter)

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:42.456
It is an homage.

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:44.658
That’s French
for "showing respect."

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:46.293
-KLEPPER: Wow. Yes.
 -Oui. Oui.

00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:48.995
The sensitivity from the left
is more frightening

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:52.232
than when I found my ex’s NPR
tote bag lurking under my bed.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:55.168
But I want to really get chills,

00:03:55.168 --> 00:03:57.637
so let’s see
what Kobi has for us.

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:00.006
-(Hillary laughing)
-(thunder rumbling)

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:01.641
She’s spooky.

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:03.076
Hello, Jordan.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:07.080
I’m obviously the DNC receipt
for the Clinton Russia dossier.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.349
(laughter,
applause and cheering)

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.186
And the scariest thing
about my costume is

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:16.323
how little the mainstream media
is covering it.

00:04:16.323 --> 00:04:18.558
Kobi, I don’t know
if I can take another story

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:20.360
about whiny liberals
getting all triggered

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.896
at a fun, made-up holiday
about goofs and pranks.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.965
-They’re so sensitive! -Yeah,
they’re way too sensitive!

00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:27.267
-They need to relax!
-It’s just a holiday!

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.835
And here
you’ve got another story

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:31.538
of some super-sensitive liberals
who are freaking out

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.140
over some itty-bitty
Halloween thing.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.376
Actually, this one is about
anti-Trump lawn decorations.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:38.078
How dare they!
On Halloween?

00:04:38.078 --> 00:04:39.446
(laughter)

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:40.947
Let me set the scene.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:44.818
A Halloween display
in New York sparking outrage.

00:04:44.818 --> 00:04:46.419
It says,
"D. Trump, burn in hell"

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.156
is what is written
on a tombstone.

00:04:49.156 --> 00:04:51.258
(cheers and applause)

00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:53.260
We’ll never know.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.395
We’ll never know
which "D. Trump"

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.231
this tombstone refers to, but,

00:04:58.231 --> 00:05:00.500
Jordan,
I think it might be Donald.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.135
Kobi, I don’t like this one.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.770
I don’t like this one at all.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.372
First of all, it’s wrong.

00:05:05.372 --> 00:05:07.174
D. Trump is not going to hell.

00:05:07.174 --> 00:05:08.942
He’s going to heaven, minimum.

00:05:08.942 --> 00:05:10.977
That’s not even the worst part,
Jordan.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:13.180
That tombstone is pitting
neighbors against neighbor,

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.781
tweeter against tweeter.

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:16.683
Fighting about politics
on Halloween

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:19.386
as if it were thanksgiving,
or any day on Facebook.

00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:23.490
Okay... Kobi...
what are you saying?

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.294
This is one, big liberal ploy
to ruin yet another holiday.

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:30.964
Pretty soon, we’ll be saying,
"Happy October 31st"

00:05:30.964 --> 00:05:33.200
instead of "Merry Halloween!"

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.334
(Klepper screams
in high-pitched tone)
