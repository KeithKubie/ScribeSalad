00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:18.724
Lawn signs sprouting everywhere.

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:21.624
Round-the-clock ads on radio and television.

00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:25.541
The phone rings. It's a robo-call from the president, or his opponent,

00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:28.109
asking for your money, and your vote.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.707
And while you're at it, watch their YouTube videos and like them on Facebook.

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:37.975
Election time. We all know the look and feel of modern campaigns.

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:41.907
But what was it like in the early days of the Republic, when, say,

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.158
George Washington ran for office?

00:00:44.158 --> 00:00:46.742
Well, in fact, he didn't run.

00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:50.441
When Washington became the first president in 1789,

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:53.924
there were no political parties, no conventions or primaries,

00:00:53.924 --> 00:00:56.974
no campaign, no election season.

00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:59.042
Not really any candidates.

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.259
Even the year was odd.

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:07.975
Literally. 1789 was the only presidential election ever held in an odd year.

00:01:07.975 --> 00:01:13.925
After the framers invented the constitution and the presidency 225 years ago,

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:18.375
the country set about the business of choosing its first executive.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:23.758
Agreeing with Ben Franklin, many people thought "The first man at the helm will be a good one,"

00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:26.876
and by that, Franklin meant George Washington.

00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:33.158
Greatest hero of the Revolution, Washington presided over the convention that created the constitution,

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:36.944
rarely speaking. He never discussed the job of president,

00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:41.743
or of wanting it. And when the first presidential election took place,

00:01:41.743 --> 00:01:46.625
it was a crazy-quilt affair, with many hands stitching the pattern.

00:01:46.625 --> 00:01:51.474
Under the new constitution, each state was given a number of electors.

00:01:51.474 --> 00:01:54.075
who would cast a vote for two names.

00:01:54.075 --> 00:01:57.008
The man with the most votes would be president,

00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:00.442
the second-place finisher was vice president.

00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:04.808
Ah, but who picked the electors? That was left up to the states.

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:11.776
Six of them let the people decide, or at least white men over 21 who owned property.

00:02:11.776 --> 00:02:16.075
In New Jersey, some women voted, a right later taken away.

00:02:16.075 --> 00:02:20.658
But in other states, the legislature picked the electors.

00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:26.292
At that time, many people thought democracy was one step away from mob rule

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:30.925
and a decision this important should be left to wiser men.

00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:33.825
These electors then voted for president.

00:02:33.825 --> 00:02:37.791
All the states had to do was get their votes in on time.

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.476
But there were glitches.

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:42.042
Only 10 of the 13 states voted.

00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:47.793
Rhode Island and North Carolina hadn't ratified the constitution and couldn't vote.

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:53.276
New York missed the deadline for naming its electors, and also was not counted.

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:55.957
When the votes were tallied, it was unanimous.

00:02:55.957 --> 00:03:03.958
George Washington won easily. John Adams trailed far behind, finishing second, and became the vice president.

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.790
Told of his victory, George Washington was not surprised.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.111
At Mount Vernon, his bags were already packed.

00:03:11.126 --> 00:03:14.557
He moved to New York City, the nation's temporary capital,

00:03:14.557 --> 00:03:19.374
and he would have to figure out just what a president was supposed to do.

00:03:19.374 --> 00:03:24.975
Since that first election, American democracy and elections have come a long way.

00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:28.776
The constitution has been changed to open up voting to more people:

00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:33.808
black men, women, Native Americans, and eighteen-year-olds included.

00:03:33.808 --> 00:03:40.124
Getting that basic right extended to all those people has been a long, hard struggle.

00:03:40.124 --> 00:03:43.574
So when you think you can't stand any more of those lawn signs,

00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:46.074
and TV ads, just remember:

00:03:46.074 --> 00:03:48.825
the right to vote wasn't always for everyone,

00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:51.408
and that's a piece of history worth knowing.
