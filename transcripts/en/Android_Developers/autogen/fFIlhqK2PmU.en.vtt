00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:01.710
 I have many Android users 

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.280
 Visual, physical or age-related impairments 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.580
 Seeing or using the full touch screen 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.110
 Or from hearing loss that makes it difficult for them to observe 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.640
 Audio alerts. 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.180
 I'm Joanna Smith, I want to help you understand 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.530
 How to take advantage of access considerations 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.730
 Three basic. 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.700
 Because some minor changes to your application 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.830
 It can make it accessible to most users. 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.040
 Not all Android users can interact with their devices 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.230
 In a similar manner. 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.390
 But it is necessary to make sure that your application 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.310
 Reusable by everyone. 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.370
 Access to your app can affect 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.680
 Number of installs, quality reviews for your app, 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.430
 And how long users will stay with you. 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.090
 Android makes creating affordable applications easy 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.690
 Because it gives you already 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.740
 Application interface turn text to sound, touch feedback, gesture navigation, 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.212
 Trackball, Navigation Controller. 

00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:51.920
 There are three tests 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.910
 You should do it before issuing any application 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.360
 Which will cover most access scenarios. 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.860
 While there are hundreds of improvements you can make 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.790
 Turns out to focus on these three 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.730
 Will do the purpose. 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.880
 First, provide the user interface components with content specifications 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.540
 Does not contain visible speech 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.700
 It is especially important for photo button, picture display, 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.410
 And the components of the check box, because these elements 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.210
 Often affect the effectiveness of the application. 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.180
 So use the Android format 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.990
 For content specification or setContentDescription system 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.750
 To provide this information for access services 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.870
 Of the device, so that they can provide it to the user 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.020
 To help reduce the flow of your device, 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.960
 Adjust the content settings for the decorative patterns to the cancel mode. 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.780
 I recommend using the TalkBack app 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.580
 To test each component for logical content specifications 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.890
 So as to avoid any bad surprises in your application. 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.970
 Second, make sure users can browse the screen systems 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.120
 Using hardware-based or software controls 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.070
 Oriented, such as D-pads, track balls, keyboards, 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.680
 And navigation bookmarks. 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.355
 You should be confident that your application 

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:53.750
 He will support all that. 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.099
 So be sure to test your app. 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.640
 There are many applications 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.970
 Which will help you simulate hardware controls, 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.700
 Such as the Eyes-Free keyboard, be sure 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.025
 All elements of the microcontroller are accessible and focusable. 

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.650
 When the user can not simply click on the component that is 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.620
 Interestingly, the importance of the order of each component is evident. 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.580
 So check your app's logical transformations 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.905
 Adjust the focus system as needed. 

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.030
 You can control the focus system through elements 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.970
 Adjust to be focusable or not, clearly indicate 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.970
 For the item to be traced. 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.460
 Finally, a permanent review should be provided 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.490
 Using more than one technique. 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.370
 Combine audio and secondary review 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.140
 To support deaf or hearing-impaired people. 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.980
 For example, an audio alert for a message arrives 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.760
 Must be accompanied by a notice system, 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.880
 Feedback feed if available, or other visual signals. 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.660
 As I said earlier, these three tests 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.374
 Will make your app generally accessible. 

00:02:47.374 --> 00:02:49.540
 But if you want to drill deeper into the task lists 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.380
 We have you can review the documentary. 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.310
 There are many other considerations, 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.770
 You can even set up display controls and access services 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.044
 As you wish. 

00:02:58.044 --> 00:03:00.210
 Now I hope that those changes will help your application 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.960
 On growth. But if you want to see 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.459
 Other improvements you can make, see the rest 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.890
 The styles of our Android content development, joined the community 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.860
 GL Plus for tips 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.740
 Tricks and help. But most importantly, he continued to create better designs.
