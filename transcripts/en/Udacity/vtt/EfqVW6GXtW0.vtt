00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.360
At this point, you've done
a lot with individual inputs.

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.720
You should be proud.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.570
&gt;&gt; Right, you've tried out
different input types and

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.890
you know how to pick the right one for
the right situation.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.840
&gt;&gt; You've attached useful labels
to your inputs ensuring that users

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.950
always know what they are typing
while they are typing.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.500
&gt;&gt; You've used the autocomplete
attribute to help the browser

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.850
autofill common input fields.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.530
&gt;&gt; You've used different validation
attributes to validate users' input,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.690
even before they submit your forms.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.479
&gt;&gt; And you've played with
the constraints validation API, for

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.260
those times when you need to
validate more complex inputs.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.590
&gt;&gt; In the next lesson, Ken and
I will help you to take a step

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.470
back from looking at single inputs
to looking at the forms as a whole.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.470
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.020
Let's get started.
