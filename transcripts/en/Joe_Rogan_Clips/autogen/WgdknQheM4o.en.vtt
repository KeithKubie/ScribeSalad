right now do you think he's act like you
because he sees you act like that

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670
because he sees you act like that
 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.190
because he sees you act like that
because he knows in his head that that's

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200
because he knows in his head that that's
 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.039
because he knows in his head that that's
how he's wired like that because when I

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049
how he's wired like that because when I
 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.930
how he's wired like that because when I
watch it he doesn't not like a lot of

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940
watch it he doesn't not like a lot of
 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.360
watch it he doesn't not like a lot of
this stuff he does I'd only I don't even

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370
this stuff he does I'd only I don't even
 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.050
this stuff he does I'd only I don't even
do he just does like my mom I'll come

do he just does like my mom I'll come
over and show watch him she go you know

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860
over and show watch him she go you know
 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.080
over and show watch him she go you know
he's just like you when you were this

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090
he's just like you when you were this
 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.840
he's just like you when you were this
age and it's so weird yeah it's in the

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850
age and it's so weird yeah it's in the
 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.300
age and it's so weird yeah it's in the
DNA it's in something right whatever it

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310
DNA it's in something right whatever it
 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.000
DNA it's in something right whatever it
is whether it's in cellular memory DNA

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010
is whether it's in cellular memory DNA
 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.000
is whether it's in cellular memory DNA
some sort of genetic information gets

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010
some sort of genetic information gets
 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.099
some sort of genetic information gets
passed on but the parents to the child

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109
passed on but the parents to the child
 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.539
passed on but the parents to the child
you could say that about athletics

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549
you could say that about athletics
 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.280
you could say that about athletics
though like if you know that's a little

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290
though like if you know that's a little
 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.780
though like if you know that's a little
different though but it's in the DNA

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790
different though but it's in the DNA
 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.469
different though but it's in the DNA
yeah it isn't but it's not an ethereal

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479
yeah it isn't but it's not an ethereal
 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.440
yeah it isn't but it's not an ethereal
thing like a thought
