00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We can write some assertions here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here we have some letters in my hand, seven letters, and some possible letters on the board,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and here's a long list of possibilities for plays I could make.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We can already see that this would be useful

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
for cheating--I mean, augmenting or studying your word game play.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And to make it even more useful, let's write a function

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that tells us what the longest possible words are.

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Given the definition of word play, write a definition of longest words.
