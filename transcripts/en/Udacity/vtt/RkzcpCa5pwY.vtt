Clock radios are a common consumer device which people can use without any

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.420
training and without normally making any mistakes. Never the less they

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.870
are complex, as the state chart we have produced indicates. In fact, the clock

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.540
radio that I have at home has a bug in it. If you get awakened by the radio,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.980
turn it off and then change the alarm time to a later time. For example,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.140
to waking your spouse, the radio comes back on. It still thinks that within,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.560
that it is within the hour window. Okay I call that a bug and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.360
I think that the original designers of the radio should have detected this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.140
particular situation and change that implementation. In any case it is

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.230
only by carefully modeling and validation that such situations can be avoided.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.470
State charts are a device that can help you do that careful thinking and

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.930
hopefully lead to better implementations, better understanding of

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.700
complex situations and ultimately better implementations of them.
