00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.806
I went back, to
Africa this time.

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.911
Exploration had taken on
a different modality here.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:16.048 line:0%
We were gonna explore
the upper headwaters

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:18.551 line:0%
of the Okavongo, the
Cuito river catchment

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.653 line:0%
that flows out of the
Angolan highlands.

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:23.856 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
Steve Boyes,
another NG explorer,

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:26.159
took us to the Angolan highlands

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.861
after basically 30
years of civil war,

00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:31.197
15 years of peace at this point,

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.799 align:start size:88% position:13%
to study this unexplored
river catchment.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:37.770 align:start size:88% position:13%
One of the reasons it's
still unexplored is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.240
because after wars,
there are remnants

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.910
and land mines are one of those.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:47.614
What happens here
is that these areas

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:49.582
are kept off limits
by the land mines.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.051
It's a very tragic catch-22,

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.153 align:start size:88% position:13%
and as soon as the
land mines are cleared,

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:56.889 align:start size:84% position:16%
people move in
immediately, right?

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.058
And the first thing they do is
they cut down all the trees,

00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:00.726
and when they cut
down all the trees,

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:03.396
they use that for charcoal,
then they plant cassava,

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.765
which lasts about
three years, maybe,

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.201 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then you've got basically
a dead plot of land,

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:12.338
so you're left between, well,
do we leave the land mines in?

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:14.874 align:start size:97% position:3%
Of course, you can't do that,
but as soon as you do it,

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.976 align:start size:84% position:16%
you look at massive
deforestation,

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:19.011 align:start size:84% position:16%
and that's happening
all the time.

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.214
There's no clearcut answer.

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:23.616
This is the headwaters.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:25.518
We were doing what's
called a source to sand

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.487
because the delta, or
the water of the delta

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.756
actually doesn't flow to an
ocean; it's very unusual.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:32.592 align:start size:94% position:6%
Every year, the delta
itself in Botswana floods

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:35.094 align:start size:84% position:16%
with 11 cubic
kilometers of water.

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:37.430 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's the beating heart
of southern Africa.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.632 align:start size:88% position:13%
When it floods, all
the migrations come in.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:43.135 align:start size:97% position:3%
When it dries up, disperse,
and it's very important

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:46.139
for southern Africa,
so this is the source.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.607 align:start size:94% position:6%
The idea was to put on
mokoros, or dugout canoes,

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.042 align:start size:84% position:16%
on that river flowing
out of the bottom

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:53.078
and float the entire length.

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:56.082 align:start size:84% position:16%
There was not enough
water to float.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.251
It was good for me at the time.

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:01.954 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was feeling so much anger
and pain and confusion,

00:02:01.954 --> 00:02:03.690
I'd just get in the
water with crocodiles

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.292 align:start size:81% position:19%
and just start
chopping at stuff.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.194 align:start size:88% position:13%
People were like, "Cory,
don't chop at that.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.828
"You're going upstream."

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:12.499
I'm like, oh, okay, turn around.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.437
Anyway, you know, we had this
opportunity to finally put

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:21.641
the mokoros in the
water and float them,

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:24.110
and this is what it looked
like in those upper regions.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.512
You can see the mokoros down
in the bottom of the frame,

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.781 align:start size:84% position:16%
this crystal water,
but it was slow going.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:30.583
On the right side here
is a burned section.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.418
On the left is a
healthy section.

00:02:32.418 --> 00:02:34.887 align:start size:88% position:13%
The right side is where
people have come in

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:38.157 align:start size:97% position:3%
and burned it down to flush
game and hopefully regenerate.

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:39.525
Unfortunately, all that does is

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.627 align:start size:97% position:3%
it destroys the root
structure, and when it rains,

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:46.098
it pushes more sand into the
river, destroying the flow.

00:02:46.098 --> 00:02:48.301
We were also looking at
these huge blockages.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.003 align:start size:97% position:3%
It was drudgery, it was
cutting through these things.

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:54.507
I mean, we're in the
water with crocodiles,

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:57.410
snakes, blisters, heat
stroke, all of the things

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.879
that make exploration
really not fun at all,

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.016 align:start size:97% position:3%
and this is days upon days,
and why do you do this?

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:06.619 align:start size:94% position:6%
That becomes the question,
and the answer is,

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.688
I mean, you have to do it.

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.489 align:start size:84% position:16%
We have to understand
these landscapes

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.859 align:start size:81% position:19%
because so many
people and animals

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.261 align:start size:81% position:19%
and plants are
connected to them.

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:17.896
We're all connected, right?

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.432
We have to care for each other,

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:24.036
so exploration becomes about
showing why it's important.

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:27.472
What we found, six new to
science species of fishes,

00:03:27.472 --> 00:03:29.542
dozens of new flora, reptiles.

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:33.412
We were creating a holistic
story of the river catchment

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.581
and we found the
most bio-diverse

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:38.550
unexplored corridor on Earth.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.186
These were the first people
that didn't run from us,

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:42.721
which makes sense.

00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:47.493
Why would you not run from
12 white dudes on mokoros?

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:52.098
Not a good sight to see, but
these people were concerned.

00:03:52.098 --> 00:03:54.700
They were concerned that
the government didn't know

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.003 align:start size:84% position:16%
they were there, and
quite rightly so.

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:58.604
The government didn't
know they were there.

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:00.773
The government hadn't
been there in 40 years.

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:03.709 align:start size:94% position:6%
The last time was
soldiers passing through,

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.444
and what I started
to realize was that

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:08.180
their concerns in the
bush were no different

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.450
than the concerns of the people
in Rwanda, the capital city.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.155 align:start size:97% position:3%
This is a very oil-rich place,
and there is enough money

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:20.993 align:start size:97% position:3%
to create a collective
well-being in this country,

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:23.429
but everybody's concerned
about their own well-being

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:27.066
because the country itself
is concerned about resources,

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:30.636
so as the oil prices, as
the oil crunch happens,

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.005
water becomes sort of a focus

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:34.874
because it can be used
for all sorts of things,

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:38.277
hydroelectricity,
mineral extraction,

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
there's all sorts of things
that this water can be used for,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.049 align:start size:84% position:16%
and everybody's
concerns are the same.

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.218
What happens to our water?

00:04:46.685 --> 00:04:48.521
This was really a
story about water,

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:49.955
not about just one river,

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:53.092 align:start size:94% position:6%
not just about the delta,
at least not for me.

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.161 align:start size:81% position:19%
This is a story
about what happens

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:56.862
to the artisanal fisheries

00:04:56.862 --> 00:05:01.100 align:start size:84% position:16%
after overfishing with
industrial fishing,

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.070 align:start size:84% position:16%
what happens to
subsistence fishing,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.139 align:start size:97% position:3%
what happens when governments
think first of resources

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.410 align:start size:84% position:16%
and how does that
affect us downstream?

00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:15.515 align:start size:97% position:3%
And it's not just us, it's
not just humans, we know that.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:19.451 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's big cats, and we
have a Big Cat Initiative.

00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:21.720
It's the water that
feeds the big cats.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.322
It's the aquatic life.

00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:27.560
It's everything from
the crocs to the fishes

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.529
to the algae to
the grass, right?

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:31.797
Goes all the way down.

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:35.601
To the megafauna, the
elephants, the hippos,

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.137 align:start size:84% position:16%
the rhinos, the
buffalo, all of it,

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
all the way down to the
absolute tiniest, the termites.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.810
All of this is this
interconnected web,

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.514
and the story doesn't stop
and start with one system.

00:05:48.514 --> 00:05:52.284 align:start size:97% position:3%
It expands beyond it, and
where do we fit in in there?

00:05:52.284 --> 00:05:55.654
How does the human
element come to play?

00:05:55.654 --> 00:05:59.492
Because these people, the sand
people, don't exist anymore.

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:01.793 align:start size:84% position:16%
This is for tourism;
they dress up

00:06:01.793 --> 00:06:05.131 align:start size:84% position:16%
and show tourists what
it used to be like.

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start size:94% position:6%
In fact, Chris Johns,
who's sitting right here,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.970 align:start position:0%
did one of the last stories
when this was actually genuine,

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.275
and so it's stopped since
then, so what's happened?

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:19.211
The only thing I
can think of was

00:06:19.211 --> 00:06:22.648
a Norman Maclean quote,
and it's very simple.

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.650 align:start size:84% position:16%
Eventually, all
things merge into one

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.419
and a river runs through it,

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.088 align:start position:0%
and I think that's very poignant
when I move forward here.

00:06:30.088 --> 00:06:34.193
This is the last sad picture
of my wife I'm gonna show you,

00:06:34.193 --> 00:06:37.597 align:start size:84% position:16%
but I want to just
talk briefly about it.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:43.035
It was funny, in all
of my assignments,

00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:47.807 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's only when I totally
give myself up to it,

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:50.609
when I totally give
myself over to it,

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:54.313
when I surrender, do I
actually start to see,

00:06:54.313 --> 00:06:57.082
and it was the same
with my marriage.

00:06:57.082 --> 00:06:59.285
Only when I totally surrendered,

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.053 align:start size:84% position:16%
only when she
totally surrendered,

00:07:01.053 --> 00:07:03.355
did we actually see each
other for who we were,

00:07:03.355 --> 00:07:06.192
but by that time,
it was too late.

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:11.230
We burned things down and
hopefully, they regrow.

00:07:12.397 --> 00:07:14.466
It was serendipitous
that this last spring,

00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:16.002
my sponsor, Eddie Bauer, asked

00:07:16.002 --> 00:07:17.837 align:start size:88% position:13%
if I would like to
return to the mountains,

00:07:17.837 --> 00:07:19.439 align:start size:84% position:16%
the place where this
fracture started,

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.507 align:start size:97% position:3%
the place where the
avalanche had taken my life

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:24.844
and done that with it,
and I said, of course.

00:07:24.844 --> 00:07:26.412
I'd love to go back
to the mountains.

00:07:26.412 --> 00:07:28.680
Where are we going? Everest.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.784
Okay, that sounds like a plan.

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:34.587
I'm excited to go back and
try to reconcile all of this,

00:07:34.587 --> 00:07:39.258
although I wasn't really
thinking that at the time,

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:40.792
but I knew I had to go back,

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:42.528
I knew I had to go back to
the mountains, and I know,

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:45.965
trust me, I know it's
self-indulgent for me,

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:49.968
a white American male
to go back to Everest

00:07:49.968 --> 00:07:54.039
to try to figure my
(bleep) out, like, come on.

00:07:54.039 --> 00:07:56.876 align:start size:84% position:16%
Stick with me,
don't walk out yet.

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:01.814
I went back with a guy
named Adrian Ballinger

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:04.449
and the goal was to try to
climb Everest without oxygen.

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:06.485
I didn't go as a photographer.

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:09.655
We were using, as Alice
mentioned, Snapchat.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.124
We were doing something
called EverestNoFilter,

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:14.026 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we were bringing
people along

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:16.828
up Everest as we climbed it,

00:08:16.828 --> 00:08:19.197
and we had classrooms
checking in with us,

00:08:19.197 --> 00:08:23.369
talking about physiology
and altitude and geography.

00:08:24.736 --> 00:08:26.706 align:start size:84% position:16%
It was a very, very
cool experience

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:28.541
to watch it sort of
grow organically.

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:30.342
We just wanted to take
people along and show

00:08:30.342 --> 00:08:34.513 align:start size:97% position:3%
what it was like to actually
be on a real expedition.

00:08:34.513 --> 00:08:36.782
So I took very few photos.

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:40.385
This is actually one of the
ones that I really loved

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:42.188
and there aren't that many.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.857 align:start size:84% position:16%
In fact, I'm only
gonna show you four,

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:46.559
and this is the last one.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:50.463
This is at 28,950 feet,
so just about 100 feet,

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.602 align:start size:97% position:3%
vertical feet below Everest's
summit on May 24th, 2016,

00:08:58.504 --> 00:09:02.140
and Adrian had turned around
much earlier in the morning,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.910
and I was alone, I had
just passed these guys.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.081
That's right, I passed people
without oxygen, it's cool.

00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:15.555
I'm not arrogant, what?

00:09:16.956 --> 00:09:20.459 align:start size:97% position:3%
I just passed 'em and I turned
around and I looked back

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:24.096
and I knew I was gonna
be on the summit alone,

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:28.267
which is very rare, vanishingly
rare for Everest these days.

00:09:29.801 --> 00:09:32.838
I knew I was gonna be
up there by myself,

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:36.208
and when I got there,
I cried for a second

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:40.379
'cause I'm a crier, and I
stood up as tall as I could

00:09:43.248 --> 00:09:46.352
and I just reached up into space

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:48.453
'cause that's as close
as I'm ever gonna get.

00:09:48.453 --> 00:09:51.123
I'm not gonna go back
and be an astronaut,

00:09:51.123 --> 00:09:52.824
and at the time, I
thought, you know,

00:09:52.824 --> 00:09:55.561 align:start size:97% position:3%
maybe this is the punctuation,
maybe this is the end.

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:57.162 align:start size:84% position:16%
Maybe this is the
end of the darkness.

00:09:57.162 --> 00:09:59.798
I've climbed my way out;
I was the phoenix rising.

00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:03.436
I've now proven that I
can overcome anything

00:10:03.436 --> 00:10:07.172 align:start size:84% position:16%
and that is, you
know, I'm good, done.

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:11.410 align:start position:0%
Put a stamp on it, send it away,
and what actually happened,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:14.946
and I didn't know it at the
time was that was the point

00:10:14.946 --> 00:10:17.182
where my biggest
lesson was to come,

00:10:17.182 --> 00:10:20.185
that I can run from everything,

00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:22.488 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I'm good at
it, and we all are.

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:25.824
I can run as hard and
as far and as fast

00:10:25.824 --> 00:10:28.861 align:start size:84% position:16%
from the things, my
demons that bother me,

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:33.331
that eat me inside, I can go
to the top of the (bleep) world

00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:36.235
and they're right there with me,

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:38.336 align:start size:88% position:13%
and that is a collective
human experience.

00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:41.340
We cannot run from
our issues, ever.

00:10:42.841 --> 00:10:45.644
The point is to turn
into them and face 'em.

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:47.245
That's what we have to do.

00:10:47.245 --> 00:10:51.750
You can go there, and they're
still right there with you.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.186
So, you know, my life
has never been normal.

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:57.089
I started in these mountains
and that's what brought me up.

00:10:57.089 --> 00:10:59.091 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm not a particularly
talented human,

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:02.160
but I'm willing to
try and keep going.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.862
It's hard work, it's not about,

00:11:03.862 --> 00:11:06.532
I take out a camera and
I get a perfect picture.

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:07.732
It doesn't work that way.

00:11:07.732 --> 00:11:09.234 align:start size:84% position:16%
Chris knows that
better than anybody.

00:11:09.234 --> 00:11:13.004
It is one of the hardest
things that you can do.

00:11:13.004 --> 00:11:14.306
I started with the mountains,

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:16.275 align:start size:88% position:13%
and the mountains
brought me to adventure,

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:18.677
and adventure and
exploration started

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.180
to change the way
I saw the world.

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.351
I didn't care as much about
this as I cared about this,

00:11:26.785 --> 00:11:30.923 align:start position:0%
what's happening to the planet,
so this exploration gave me

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:34.927 align:start size:88% position:13%
a different lens through
which to view it,

00:11:34.927 --> 00:11:36.295 align:start size:84% position:16%
and what I've
learned from this is

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:38.230 align:start size:81% position:19%
that we're looking
for solutions.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.831 align:start size:81% position:19%
Humans are looking
for solutions.

00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:41.600
We want answers to everything.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.336
How do we stop this,
how do we stop that?

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:48.507
What do we do, what are the
solutions for climate change?

00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:53.612 align:start size:88% position:13%
And know that those
solutions are different

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:58.249
than the solutions for the
global corrosion of culture.

00:11:58.249 --> 00:11:59.551
They're very, very different.

00:11:59.551 --> 00:12:01.019
How do we solve that?

00:12:01.019 --> 00:12:04.289 align:start size:84% position:16%
And those solutions
are different

00:12:04.289 --> 00:12:06.292
than the ones we
need for conflicts.

00:12:06.292 --> 00:12:08.727
How do we deal with that?

00:12:08.727 --> 00:12:12.564 align:start size:97% position:3%
And of course, those solutions
are very different than

00:12:12.564 --> 00:12:15.868 align:start size:94% position:6%
those that we need to help
those that are affected

00:12:15.868 --> 00:12:20.039 align:start size:97% position:3%
by conflict, former child
soldiers, areas like Aleppo.

00:12:20.039 --> 00:12:21.807
How do we deal with that?

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:23.743
What are the solutions?

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:29.781
There's a lot of questions
facing our world right now,

00:12:29.781 --> 00:12:33.119
and there aren't any
real clear answers.

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.823 align:start size:97% position:3%
One thing that I believe is
that we are all tied together,

00:12:38.823 --> 00:12:40.825 align:start size:94% position:6%
and by all tied
together, I'm not talking

00:12:40.825 --> 00:12:42.961 align:start size:84% position:16%
about a hippie
oneness of the world.

00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:44.563
I'm talking about physically,

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:47.966
everything relies
on everything else.

00:12:47.966 --> 00:12:50.402
It really does, in
our day to day lives,

00:12:50.402 --> 00:12:52.538 align:start size:88% position:13%
and we need to pay
more attention to that.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.707
How do we honor that bond?

00:12:56.207 --> 00:12:58.644
'Cause we will find solutions.

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:00.979
We are very, very good
at finding solutions.

00:13:00.979 --> 00:13:02.514
That's what humans do.

00:13:02.514 --> 00:13:06.084
We have very big brains and
we put band-aids on things.

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:09.954 align:start size:88% position:13%
As a generalist, my
goal with my photography

00:13:09.954 --> 00:13:12.358
is not to focus on one thing.

00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:15.293
I don't wanna be
great at one thing.

00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:17.129
I wanna tell multiple stories

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:19.297 align:start size:94% position:6%
through multiple different
voices and lenses.

00:13:19.297 --> 00:13:20.766
I wanna step back.

00:13:21.667 --> 00:13:23.068
I wanna ask the question,

00:13:23.068 --> 00:13:25.737
not how do we solve
the problems we have?

00:13:25.737 --> 00:13:29.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
How do we stop
creating the problems?

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:31.377
What's the answer to that?

00:13:32.777 --> 00:13:36.748
Why do I get up here and
talk about divorce and PTSD

00:13:36.748 --> 00:13:40.920
and infidelity and adventure
and confuse the whole topic?

00:13:42.621 --> 00:13:44.222
I mean, I've talked
about alcoholism,

00:13:44.222 --> 00:13:45.757
I've talked about
sustainability.

00:13:45.757 --> 00:13:49.228
You guys are like, what
is the through line?

00:13:49.228 --> 00:13:51.963
I mean, I get it, dude, but
what is the through line?

00:13:51.963 --> 00:13:53.432
Where are you going with this?

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:54.900
The through line is this.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.471
We are the stewards, and
every single choice we make

00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:02.474
has a consequence,
every single one,

00:14:03.575 --> 00:14:05.877 align:start size:84% position:16%
and that is very
important to remember.

00:14:05.877 --> 00:14:09.080 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm 35 years old; I
don't have the answers.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.749
I can tell you to ride bikes.

00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:13.952
I can tell you to eat less meat.

00:14:13.952 --> 00:14:15.854 align:start size:84% position:16%
I can tell you to
take shorter showers.

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:17.856 align:start size:84% position:16%
I can tell you to
not use plastic bags.

00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:19.391
Don't use straws, you know.

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:21.193 align:start size:84% position:16%
Buy a Prius,
whatever you can do.

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:23.194
You guys know that.

00:14:23.194 --> 00:14:25.764 align:start size:84% position:16%
We do need initiatives
like Pristine Seas.

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:27.999 align:start size:84% position:16%
We do need initiatives
like Big Cats.

00:14:27.999 --> 00:14:31.703
We do need to focus that, but
those honestly are band-aids

00:14:31.703 --> 00:14:35.073
on existing wounds,
so what is the virus

00:14:35.073 --> 00:14:37.343
and how do we address that?

00:14:39.444 --> 00:14:43.315
And honestly, honestly,
I think the answer is

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:46.551
much, much simpler
than we're making it,

00:14:46.551 --> 00:14:49.989
but I'm not audacious
enough to say that,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.261 align:start size:97% position:3%
so I'm gonna let somebody else
say it in different words.

00:14:58.663 --> 00:15:01.734
He's a little smarter
than me, not much.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:05.838 align:start size:94% position:6%
You might've heard of him;
his name's Carl Sagan.

00:15:07.405 --> 00:15:09.240
Anyway, that little dot there,

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.076
if you haven't seen this before,

00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:13.646 align:start size:94% position:6%
this photograph is
called the Pale Blue Dot,

00:15:13.646 --> 00:15:18.449 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that dot in that
sunbeam is us, that's Earth.

00:15:18.449 --> 00:15:21.887 align:start size:84% position:16%
That was taken from
3.7 billion miles away

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:26.425
in February 14, 1990,
and this is what Carl,

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:30.729
my buddy Carl had
to say about this.

00:15:32.597 --> 00:15:34.232
"Look again at that dot.

00:15:34.232 --> 00:15:37.769 align:start size:84% position:16%

00:16:59.284 --> 00:17:01.653
"In our obscurity,
in all this vastness,

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:03.789
"there is no hint
that help will come

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:07.659 align:start size:88% position:13%
"from elsewhere to
save us from ourselves.

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:10.795
"The Earth is the only world
known so far to harbor life.

00:17:10.795 --> 00:17:13.598
"There is nowhere else, at
least in the near future,

00:17:13.598 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start size:84% position:16%
"to which our species
could migrate.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.203
"Visit, yes, settle, not yet.

00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:20.973
"Like it or not, for the moment,

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:23.308
"the Earth is where
we make our stand.

00:17:23.308 --> 00:17:25.477
"It has been said
that astronomy is

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:28.313 align:start size:97% position:3%
"a humbling and
character-building experience.

00:17:28.313 --> 00:17:31.082
"There is perhaps no
better demonstration

00:17:31.082 --> 00:17:33.318
"of the folly of human conceits

00:17:33.318 --> 00:17:37.055 align:start size:88% position:13%
"than this distant
image of our tiny world.

00:17:37.055 --> 00:17:39.191 align:start size:84% position:16%
"To me, it underscores
our responsibility

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:43.028 align:start size:84% position:16%
"to deal more kindly
with one another,

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:46.865 align:start size:94% position:6%
"and to preserve and
cherish the pale blue dot,

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:49.434 align:start size:81% position:19%
"the only home
we've ever known."

00:17:49.434 --> 00:17:52.371
Now, think about
that for a second.

00:17:53.805 --> 00:17:57.543
Carl Sagan was pretty smart,
but he didn't end with policy.

00:17:59.844 --> 00:18:01.846
He didn't end with
carbon emissions.

00:18:01.846 --> 00:18:03.881
He didn't end with rainforests.

00:18:03.881 --> 00:18:08.820
He didn't end with any of that
'cause those are the wounds.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.522
That's what's happened.

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:12.458
He ended with kindness.

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:17.062
It's the most simple thing,
because when we act kindly

00:18:17.062 --> 00:18:21.433
towards one another, in this
city especially right now,

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:24.035
when we act kindly
towards one another,

00:18:24.035 --> 00:18:27.672 align:start size:97% position:3%
we hear each other, we treat
each other with respect.

00:18:27.672 --> 00:18:30.875
We might not agree, and
when there are abuses,

00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:33.112
we stand up for them,
but we treat each other

00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:36.114 align:start size:94% position:6%
with kindness and respect,
and the root of that,

00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:38.516
dare I say it as 35 year old man

00:18:38.516 --> 00:18:42.654
who's done all sorts
of horrible things,

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:44.589
the root of that
is the one thing

00:18:44.589 --> 00:18:47.859 align:start size:88% position:13%
that makes us
different as an animal.

00:18:47.859 --> 00:18:51.430
It's the single most
important thing we do.

00:18:53.164 --> 00:18:56.168
It's unique to us,
and that is love.

00:18:57.502 --> 00:18:59.170
That's what we do,

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:03.008 align:start size:94% position:6%
and that, in and of
itself, is where we start.

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:08.413 align:start position:0%
So without saying too much
more, I love you guys very much

00:19:08.413 --> 00:19:10.315 align:start size:84% position:16%
and thank you for
sharing this with me.

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:10.382
