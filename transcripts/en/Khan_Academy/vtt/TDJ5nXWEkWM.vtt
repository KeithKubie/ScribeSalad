00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:02.981
- [Voiceover] In a previous
video we used the quotient rule

00:00:02.981 --> 00:00:04.489
in order to find the derivatives

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:06.687
of tangent of x and cotangnet of x.

00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:09.221
And what I what to do in
this video is to keep going

00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:13.479
and find the derivatives of
secant of x and cosecant of x.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.140
So let's start with secant of x.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.735
The derivative with respect
to x of secant of x.

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:22.279
Well, secant of x is the same thing as

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.814
so we're going to find the
derivative with respect to x

00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:27.695
of secant of x is the same thing as

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:30.077
one over,

00:00:30.077 --> 00:00:32.859
one over the cosine of x.

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:35.526
And that's just the definition of secant.

00:00:35.526 --> 00:00:38.000
And there's multiple
ways you could do this.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.541
When you learn the chain rule,

00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:41.908
that actually might be a
more natural thing to use

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.515
to evaluate the derivative here.

00:00:43.515 --> 00:00:45.284
But we know the quotient rule,

00:00:45.284 --> 00:00:47.158
so we will apply the quotient rule here.

00:00:47.158 --> 00:00:49.035
And it's no coincidence that
you get to the same answer.

00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:51.743
The quotient rule actually can be derived

00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:54.418
based on the chain rule
and the product rule.

00:00:54.418 --> 00:00:55.749
But I won't keep going into that.

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:58.096
Let's just apply the quotient
rule right over here.

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:01.709
So this derivative is
going to be equal to,

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:05.052
it's going to be equal to
the derivative of the top.

00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:07.462
Well, what's the derivative
of one with respect to x?

00:01:07.462 --> 00:01:09.363
Well, that's just zero.

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:11.917
Times the function on the bottom.

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:15.361
So, times cosine of x.

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:16.993
Cosine of x.

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:18.642
Minus,

00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:22.768
minus the function on the top.

00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:24.940
Well, that's just one.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.368
Times the derivative on the bottom.

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:29.444
Well, the derivative on the bottom is,

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:31.863
the derivative of cosine
of x is negative sine of x.

00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:33.967
So we could put the sine of x there.

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:35.027
But it's negative sine of x,

00:01:35.027 --> 00:01:37.691
so you have a minus and
it'll be a negative,

00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:39.891
so we can just make that a positive.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.492
And then all of that over the function

00:01:42.492 --> 00:01:44.040
on the bottom squared.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.429
So, cosine of x, squared.

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.107
And so zero times cosine of x,

00:01:49.107 --> 00:01:50.916
that is just zero.

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:55.582
And so all we are left with is sine of x

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:59.057
over cosine of x squared.

00:01:59.057 --> 00:02:01.440
And there's multiple ways
that you could rewrite this

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.501
if you like.

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:07.209
You could say that this
is same thing as sine of x

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.376
over cosine of x times
one over cosine of x.

00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:16.118
And of course this is tangent of x,

00:02:17.028 --> 00:02:19.698
times secant of x.

00:02:19.698 --> 00:02:20.719
Secant of x.

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.422
So you could say derivative
of secant of x is

00:02:22.422 --> 00:02:24.693
sine of x over cosine-squared of x.

00:02:24.693 --> 00:02:28.610
Or it is tangent of x
times the secant of x.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.564
So now let's do cosecant.

00:02:31.564 --> 00:02:35.731
So the derivative with
respect to x of cosecant of x.

00:02:37.268 --> 00:02:39.179
Well, that's the same
thing as the derivative

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:43.346
with respect to x of one over sine of x.

00:02:45.174 --> 00:02:48.213
Cosecant is one over sine of x.

00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:50.540
I remember that because
you think it's cosecant.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.672
Maybe it's the reciprocal
of cosine, but it's not.

00:02:54.672 --> 00:02:56.705
It's the opposite of
what you would expect.

00:02:56.705 --> 00:02:59.717
Cosine's reciprocal isn't
cosecant, it is secant.

00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:02.805
Once again, opposite of
what you would expect.

00:03:02.805 --> 00:03:04.543
That starts with an s,
this starts with a c.

00:03:04.543 --> 00:03:06.603
That starts with a c,
that starts with an s.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:08.546
It's just way it happened to be defined.

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:10.294
But anyway, let's just evaluate this.

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:11.542
Once again, we'll do the quotient rule,

00:03:11.542 --> 00:03:13.811
but you could also do
this using the chain rule.

00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:15.103
So it's going to be

00:03:15.103 --> 00:03:19.487
the derivative of the expression
on top, which is zero,

00:03:19.487 --> 00:03:23.654
times the expression on the
bottom, which is sine of x.

00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:26.504
Sine of x.

00:03:26.504 --> 00:03:30.671
Minus the expression on
top, which is just one.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.424
Times the derivative of the
expression on the bottom,

00:03:34.424 --> 00:03:36.174
which is cosine of x.

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:40.349
All of that over the expression
on the bottom squared.

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.752
Sine-squared of x.

00:03:42.752 --> 00:03:44.106
That's zero.

00:03:44.106 --> 00:03:46.863
So we get negative cosine of x

00:03:46.863 --> 00:03:49.780
over sine-squared of x.

00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:54.134
So that's one way to think about it.

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.745
Or if you like, you could do this,

00:03:56.745 --> 00:03:58.157
the same thing we did over here,

00:03:58.157 --> 00:04:00.869
this is the same thing
as negative cosine of x

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:05.036
over sine of x, times one over sine of x.

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.517
And this is negative cotangent of x.

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:13.100
Negative cotangent of x, times,

00:04:14.392 --> 00:04:16.020
maybe I'll write it this way,

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.545
times one over sine of x is cosecant of x.

00:04:19.545 --> 00:04:22.457
Cosecant of x.

00:04:22.457 --> 00:04:25.790
So, which ever one you find more useful.
