00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:08.936
&gt;&gt;Student: During your life
so far, what has been one

00:00:08.936 --> 00:00:11.636
of the biggest goals you've set
and you were able to achieve?

00:00:12.056 --> 00:00:16.896
&gt;&gt;Man: Well, when I was high school
age, I thought that it would be--

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:19.946
&gt;&gt;Amy: You're going to need to
pick somebody, could be a relative,

00:00:20.406 --> 00:00:22.136
could be somebody in school.

00:00:22.646 --> 00:00:26.976
It could be a neighbor who
has shown grit and your job is

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:28.396
to interview that person.

00:00:28.586 --> 00:00:30.786
And then you're gonna
come back and we're going

00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:32.456
to create the perseverance walk.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.866
You're gonna take us on the journey
of that person who showed grit.

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:39.806
So here's my perseverance
walk for Jay.

00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:45.346
It has the goal setting part and it
has the things that got in the way,

00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:50.296
and then it has the part about, "I
reached my goal, and what is my life

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:53.236
like now because I was
able to attain that goal?"

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.966
So Jay Lyon joined the New
London Fire Department at 18.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.156
He loved being a volunteer
and helping out his community.

00:01:00.546 --> 00:01:04.326
When he went to college, his dad
told him, "Now is the time to think

00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:06.986
about doing what you
really want to do."

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:09.376
So what's his dad asking him to do?

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:13.426
Set that goal, good.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.496
So what I drew on here was this desk.

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:21.516
Notice that he's got a paper here
that says D plus on it, not so hot.

00:01:22.256 --> 00:01:24.396
But he's also thinking,
"I really, really,

00:01:24.396 --> 00:01:25.536
really wanna be a firefighter."

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:27.126
So I'm gonna move him over.

00:01:28.206 --> 00:01:30.536
That winter he applied
and was accepted

00:01:30.536 --> 00:01:32.706
in technical school for fire science.

00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:37.196
He loved what he was studying and
he earned a three point four GPA.

00:01:38.296 --> 00:01:42.556
Better-- way better, okay,
but still had some struggles.

00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:45.406
So I'm gonna march him
along and now where is he?

00:01:46.016 --> 00:01:47.446
He's at the firehouse, right.

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:50.396
Earning his degree took perseverance.

00:01:51.526 --> 00:01:54.636
Becoming a full time
firefighter took grit.

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:57.436
It took four years
before he was asked

00:01:57.436 --> 00:02:00.546
to be the New London's
first full time firefighter.

00:02:01.136 --> 00:02:03.826
So he reached his goal of
becoming a full time firefighter,

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:05.176
so that's a far off goal.

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:07.776
But now think about what
his life is like now.

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:10.386
He loves what he does.

00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:14.406
Does that tie back in to what I
was talking about this morning,

00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:16.516
about goals, and you
setting your goals?

00:02:16.696 --> 00:02:16.876
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:18.886
&gt;&gt;Amy: He got to set his goal.

00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:21.916
It's so important, you guys,
that you set your goals.

00:02:22.206 --> 00:02:26.496
Hopefully, you'll take these lessons
and this will become a part of you

00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:29.456
and then you can use
it later on, right?
