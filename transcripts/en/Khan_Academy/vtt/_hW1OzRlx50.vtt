00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.280
- [Instructor] We're told
that Lauren uses a blend

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.610
of dark roast beans and light roast beans

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.780
to make coffee at her cafe.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.580
She needs 80 kilograms of beans
in total for her next order.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.750
Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.770
light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.920
and she wants to spend $220 in total.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.960
And they tell us here's a graph

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.060
that shows a system of
equations for this scenario

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.680
where x is the number of kilograms

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.790
of dark roast beans she buys

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.390
and y is the number of kilograms

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.880
of light roast beans she buys.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.180
All right, let me scroll down
so we can take a look at this.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.930
And so sure enough, so this blue line,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.900
and I'll write it out in blue,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.090
this x is the number of
kilograms of dark roast beans,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.170
y is the number of kilograms
of light roast beans,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.930
and she wants to buy a
total of 80 kilograms.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.300
That's what they told us up here.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.640
We can go back to look at that.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.340
She needs, I'll underline this in blue.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.000
She needs 80 kilograms of beans.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.050
So that constraint that
the sum of the kilograms

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.490
of dark and light is equal to 80,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.270
that's represented by this equation.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.710
And if we were to graph it,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.610
that is this blue line right over here.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.350
And then this other constraint, three x,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.030
well, the dark roast beans
cost $3 per kilogram,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.730
so three x is how much
she spends on dark roast.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.920
Two y is how much she
spends on light roast

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.190
'cause it's $2 per kilogram.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.680
And 220 is the amount
that she spends in total.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.310
And they tell us that up here.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.120
Dark roast beans cost $3 per kilogram,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.740
light roast beans cost $2 per kilogram,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.760
and she wants to spend $220.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.690
So this equation is
another way of expressing

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.400
what I just underlined up here in green.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.170
And the green line shows all

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.170
of the x y combinations that
would match these constraints.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.890
And so now let's do something interesting.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.510
They've labeled some points
here, point C, D, F, and E.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.020
And we're gonna think about what do each

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.190
of these points represent?

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.190
So for example, this point
C that is on the green line,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.600
but it sits above the blue line,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.030
what does this tell us?

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.630
What does this point C represent?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.430
Pause this video and think about it.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.070
Well, if we're on the green line,

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.430
that means that the amount
that she spends on dark roast

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.080
plus the amount that she spends
on light roast is adding up

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.790
to exactly $220.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.450
So she's definitely spending $220 at C,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.590
but how many total kilograms is she using?

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.470
Well, the fact that for this given x,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.880
we're sitting above the line,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.917
that means that she's not
using exactly 80 kilograms.

00:02:54.917 --> 00:02:56.530
And we can see that over here.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.620
She's using, looks like
10 kilograms of dark,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.400
and it looks like something
like 95 kilograms of light.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.870
If you were to add those
two points together,

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.340
it looks like she's using
something closer to 105 kilograms.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.820
So point C is a situation

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.710
where she is spending exactly $220,

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.750
but she's using more than 80 kilograms

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.830
'cause it's not meeting
this second constraint.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.750
It's sitting above that line.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.750
Now let's think about point D.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.900
What does that represent?

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.660
Pause the video and
try to figure that out.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.500
Well, because we sit on the blue line,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.140
that means that we are
meeting this constraint

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.500
that the kilograms of
dark and light combined

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.000
is equal to 80 kilograms.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.200
So she's using exactly 80 kilograms here,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.450
but what about her spending?

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.440
Well, because this point
lies below the green line,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.200
that tells us that we are spending

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.017
less than $220.

00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:56.730
And we could even try it out.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.730
Three times 20 plus two times 60 is what?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.150
60 plus 120 is $180.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.590
And so this is a point where
we're meeting this constraint,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.070
but we're not meeting this constraint.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.680
We're underspending right over here.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.810
Now, what about point F?

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.080
Well, point F sits below
both of these lines.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.683
So pause your video and
think about what that means.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.930
Well, if we're sitting
below both of these lines,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.510
that means that neither
are we spending $220,

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.500
nor are we using 80 kilograms.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.620
And you can see that if you
actually look at the numbers.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.610
You don't have to do this,

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.860
but this is just to make
you feel good about it.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.020
It looks like she is
using 30 kilograms of dark

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.480
and 30 kilograms of light,
so in total she is using,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.670
so this is a situation

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.740
where she's using 60
kilograms in total, not 80.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.080
And so that's why we're not
sitting on this blue line.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.070
And if you look at how
much she's spending,

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.740
she has 30 kilograms of each,

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.140
so three times 30 plus two times 30,

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.390
that's going to be 90 plus 60.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.057
That's also less than 220,

00:05:02.057 --> 00:05:06.000
and so that's why we see this
point is below these lines.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.283
And then last but not least,
what does point E represent?

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.170
Well, point E sits on both of these lines,

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.410
so that means that it meets
both of these constraints.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.740
This is a situation where
she is spending exactly $220,

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.770
and the total number of
kilograms she's using

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.490
of dark and light is exactly 80.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.250
And so if we wanted to
say, hey, what combination

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.950
of dark and light would she need

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.660
in order to meet both
constraints, E represents that,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.953
the intersection of these two lines.
