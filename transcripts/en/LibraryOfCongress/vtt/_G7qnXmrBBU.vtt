00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.340
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:20.890
[silence]

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.190
&gt;&gt; BETSY PETERSON:
I'm Betsy Peterson,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.930
the Director of the American
Folklife Center here at the Library

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.290 position:56%
of Congress and on behalf of the
entire staff at the Folklife Center,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.910
I want to welcome you all today
to the first concert in 2017

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.210
of the Homegrown Concert series.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.480
We've got four great dance battles.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.960
Today, for you all from
dancers from Urban Artistry,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.310
but just a little bit
about the Homegrown series.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.110
The Homegrown Concert
series is a tool

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.270 position:56%
for the American Folklife Center
and an opportunity for us to be able

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.420
to work with folklorists,
ethnomusicologists,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.270
cultural specialist, cultural
organizations throughout the entire

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.400
country to help us identify
and bring the best artists

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.100
and musicians, dancers, and artists
in narrative arts to come here

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.030
to Washington DC to share
their talents with all of you.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.730
Our performance today is going
to be webcast for the collections

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.320
of the American Folklife Center

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.210
and it will eventually make
its way on to the website.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.030
Bit, with that said, if
you have a cell phone on

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.990
or any electronic device,
please turn it off now.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.120
And now I just simply want to turn
things over to Michelle Stefano

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.920
who is a Folklife Specialist on
the American Folklife Center staff

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.240 position:56%
and I'm happy to say, I think the
almost the newest member of the AFC.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.090
She's had the good fortune to work
extensively with Urban Artistry

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.480
who hails from Maryland
while she was working

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.920 position:56%
in Maryland for Maryland traditions.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.510
So, please give a warm
welcome to Michelle Stefano.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.980
[applause]

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.360
&gt;&gt; MICHELLE STEFANO: Thank you
Betsy and a special thank you

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.580
to Thea Austen for making
today run so smoothly.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.210
And thank you to you all

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.340
for spending your precious
lunch hour here in the Coolidge.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.640
So, as Betsy mentioned,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.300
before joining the
American Folklife Center,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.330
I worked for the Folklife
Program of Maryland.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.400
And it was there that I was
fortunate to meet and work

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.290
with my fellow folklorist, or as he
likes to say, citizen folklorist,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.110
Junious Brickhouse and the
mind-blowingly talented dancers,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.990
artist instructors of Urban
Artistry whom I'll introduce

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.360
in just a moment.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.530
But, first I'm curious,
who here is familiar

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.460
with Urban Dance traditions?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:10.100
Maybe such as bugaloo or
popping, locking, breaking?

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.910
Ok. That's very polite.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.210
We are in the Library.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.510
I appreciate that.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.950
But, when the music starts up
again and the battling begins,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.490
you'll have to be a
whole lot more rowdier.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.790
And I'll explain.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.210
But, for those who aren't
familiar with those traditions,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.510
of course you'll be
learning in just a moment.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.710
But, these are expressions
of movement and community

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.270
that are intimately tied to musical
traditions over decades from cities

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.750
and suburbs across the
country and of course

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.950
from musical club there in.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.220
And this is exactly what
Urban Artistry specializes in.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.950
Founded in 2005 by
Junious Brickhouse

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.670
who is not just a researcher,
but also a dancer, choreographer,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.960
educator, and executive director.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.860 position:56%
Urban Artistry is a nonprofit
organization based in Silver Spring,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.860
Maryland dedicated to research,
documentation, teaching,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.320
and safeguarding urban dance
and musical traditions as well

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.920
as supporting their respective
cultural communities throughout the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.450
DC region and far beyond.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.360
Through Urban Artistry's classes in
locking, breaking, Memphis duking,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.170
and popping, among many others
including a musical production

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.540
and DJing, students not only learn
dance forms but gain deep insight

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.710
into their histories and meanings.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.410
As shaped in the neighborhoods
and longtime clubs found

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.320
across the U.S. and
indeed, the world.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.750
Junious notes that Urban Artistry's
performing artists from beginner

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.390
to expert, are cultural ambassadors

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.190
for communities who
are often unsung.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.370 position:56%
Through their well-known educational
programs such as "Funk in Focus,"

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.120
"The House that Jack Built,"
"Mainline," and "Methods,"

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.000
as well as the International
Soul Society Festival,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.150
which this year's is
coming up in June.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.080
As well as theater productions,
they seek to amplify a whole range

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.480
of traditional dance- culture
and expressions as capital A art.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.340 position:56%
They also aim to safeguard sensitive
cultural exchange, community,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.640
rootedness, legacy, and place
that seek and help to foster,

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.440
keep vitalize these forms for
the future as well as evolving.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.080
So, I certainly recommend that
you check out Urban Artistry

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.670
and their many events each year.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.590
You can visit their website
at urbanartistry.org.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.270
Ok, so Michelle, what's
going on today, right?

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:28.660
You're all asking.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.760
So, the Urban Artistry dancers
will be coming out in just a moment

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.520
and they'll take us through
a couple of rounds of one

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.720
on one dance battles
or competitions,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.230
showcasing the wide ranging
styles of urban dance.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:45.710
And Junious, our MC will
pause things here and there

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.220
to explain the importance of
battling within urban dance culture

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.940
as well as the many styles
that you'll be seeing.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.540
And I guess you can call
that dance-splaining.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.040
And this where you come in.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.000
You are getting a little
more rowdy, good.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.980
This is where you come in- in order
for the dancers to move and advance

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.140
from the quarter finals to the
finals as much as we can fit

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.190
in an hour, they must
receive the loudest

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.120
and noisiest applause from you.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.420
So are you ready for that?

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.880
&gt;&gt; AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.180
[applause]

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.480
&gt;&gt; MICHELLE STEFANO: All right.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.780
And one last component
I need to mention

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.400
and you've already been treated to
his beats- DJ Barronhawk Poitier,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.340
a dancer, artist, educator, budding
DJ as well as the artistic director

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.230
for Urban Artistry will
be choosing the beats

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.880
to which the dancers
respond making the music work

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.270
for them and not against them.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.860
So, without further ado, I welcome
to the stage, Junious Brickhouse

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.510
and DJ Barronhawk Poitier.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:57.090
[applause]

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.390
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE:
Hello everyone.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.720
My name is Junious
Brickhouse and I'm so glad

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.350
that you guys can join
us this afternoon.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.580
You guys are ready for some music?

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.150
Some dance?

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.330
So, as Michelle said,
I'm the Founder

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.890
and Executive Director
of Urban Artistry, Inc.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.870
and today we're just going to show
you guys a little bit of who we are

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.330
and what it is that we do.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.790
So, when people talk
about Urban dance culture-

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:27.910
when you hear me say that, most
say, "you know what is that about?"

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:32.480
So, to us, urban dance
culture is the types of dances

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.260
that are inspired by the urban
experience- plain and simple.

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.980
So, by name, we're talking
about dance styles like hip hop,

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.690
like b-boying an b-girling
or breaking, like popping,

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.200
like locking, like Memphis Duking.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.120
We're talking about a lot
of different types of dance.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.470
And all of these communities
are different, but what we have

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:57.110
in common is that we come
together and we celebrate our art

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.660
in ways that are familiar to us.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.590
So, today, we're going to show you
one of those methods and that type

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:06.380
of festival is called
battling or competing.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.680
Ok? So, your part in this is

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.940
that you guys are gonna
serve as our judges.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:20.690
So, when I ask you to decide
or to give your thoughts

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:24.070
on who you feel gave
the best performance,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.830
you're going to make some
noise for me, alright?

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:31.230
We have a meter over here
that's counting that.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.800
So, by looking at that meter,
I will know and I'll also hear

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.790
who got the most applause
or most screams, alright?

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.420
So, does everybody got that,
you thing we can handle that?

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.720
[applause]

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.550
&gt;&gt; Now we got a lot of
wonderful dancers for you today,

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.710
but mostly we have
wonderful people- people

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:56.960
who consider themselves tradition
bearers who are very passionate

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.570
about what it is that they do,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.580
so please give them your
full support and yeah.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:09.950 position:56%
I think before we get started, one
thing that I do want to say is that,

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.600
we do this for a lot of
different reasons, right.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.970
But, I think our goal in what we
want to leave with you today is

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:22.730
that the way we express
ourselves today is how we preserve

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.030
our culture.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:29.360
We all come from communities
of practice so we all come

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.490
from communities that
sometimes struggle for money,

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:37.500
but dance has always been free for
us and it's given us an opportunity

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.540
to be on this stage
today and also be

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.190
around the world doing
different things.

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.690 position:56%
But, it's important that we remember
this that this is cultural dance too

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:50.750
and that we're just honored to be
able to share it with you today.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.510
So, why don't we get
this thing going?

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.850
[applause]

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:04.450
&gt;&gt; So, first I'd like to
welcome to the stage Juwan Hill.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:05.750
[applause]

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:18.860
&gt;&gt; Juwan Hill is from "Pull it
to the Floor" in Alexandria,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:24.920
Virginia and we have Diana Webby.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.150
[applause]

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:31.640
&gt;&gt; Diana is from Copenhagen,
Denmark visiting us out here today

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.750
and they're both going to
be doing a style of dance

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.260
and the first one is hip hop.

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.060
So, the way this is going to work
is that every round we're going

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.430
to have a different
style of dance, ok?

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:50.760
Each dancer will dance one minute
twice and after that, we will vote.

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.850
Ya'll with me?

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.510
Alright. DJ Barronhawk Poitier.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:15:52.040
[music]

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.340
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE: Nice.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:16:01.700
Ya'll give it up for Barronhawk
Poitier ya'll with the sounds.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.600
Ok, this is our first time up.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:16.770
Now, if you believe that Juann
had the strongest performance make

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.070
some noise.

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.370
[applause]

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:25.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:26.490
Thank you.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.790
Thank you.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.910
Now, if you believe Diana had
the strongest performance,

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:40.630
judges make some noise.

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.930
[applause] Juann is our winner.

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.050
[applause] Thank you
very much Diana.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.230
[applause]

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:55.600
&gt;&gt; Now, just that simple.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.440
That wasn't difficult was it?

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:06.710
Next up, the style we're
going to cover is locking, ok?

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:12.380 position:56%
And first person up- Rashad Pierson.

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.180
Rashad Pierson.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:19.090
[applause]

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:22.950
&gt;&gt; Rashad is originally
from New York City.

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:24.250
[applause]

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:33.210
&gt;&gt; Rashad is also my lead Artistic
Director at Urban Artistry.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:36.390
Wonderful guy, wonderful artist.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:44.320
And he will be going toe to toe
with Vince "Funky Van Go" Johnson

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:49.510
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:55.670
[applause]

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.260
&gt;&gt; So, would one of you guys like
to tell us a little about the style

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:05.550
of dance that you're going to do?

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:08.690
&gt;&gt; RASHAD: How you guys feeling?

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.250
Nice. So, I'll explain a little bit

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:13.960
about the locking style
and its traditions.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:17.710
So, originally it starts
in Southern California,

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.520 position:56%
specifically in LA County, In Watts.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:27.430
And the story goes that a gentleman
by the name of Don Campbellock kind

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:32.360
of sparked this new dance
post-civil rights movement

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.730
to funk music specifically
a lot of James Brown and Sly

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.290
and the Family Stone
and so on and so on.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:44.050
He was really trying to do a lot
of the social dances of the time

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:48.560
and fell upon a movement that
worked a lot better for him.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.510
He was really charismatic
and you know, around a bunch

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:58.620
of other people, groups like
the Go Go Brothers and so on

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:03.230
and basically everyone started
to add movement to the style.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.630
It's a really dynamic, open,
spread out, like in your face,

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:11.120
over exaggerated African
American character of that time.

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.810
I think that's probably the best
way I can explain it right now

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.940
without talking your ear off.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:22.830
So, Vince and me are going to
show you a little of what we got.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.630
Cool?

00:19:24.630 --> 00:22:09.360
&gt;&gt; [music]

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.900
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE: Ya'll give
it up for Rashad and Vince yo.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:23.650
[applause]

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:32.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt;Now, judges if you feel that
Vince had the strongest performance,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.400
make some noise.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.700
[applause]

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:40.820
&gt;&gt;Thank you very much.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:46.660
If you feel like Rashad had
the strongest performance,

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:54.770
make some noise.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:56.070
[applause]

00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:57.370
&gt;&gt;That was pretty close.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:02.210
We're going to have to
do that one more time.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.890
Do we need one more
round from these two?

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:11.200
Is that what we need?

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.510
Ok, let's do one more round.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:25:01.040
[music]

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:05.030
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE: Give
it up for these two guys.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:08.060
[applause]

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.310
&gt;&gt; Nice stuff there.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:17.000
Working hard for you up there.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:36.160
So, judges, Vince Funky Van Go.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.460
[applause]

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.260
&gt;&gt; Rashad Pierson.

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:43.600
[applause.]

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.590
&gt;&gt; Rashad Pierson is our winner.

00:25:46.590 --> 00:26:00.000
[applause]

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.300
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE:
I didn't plan that.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:12.400
Next up the style of dance
that we have is break-it.

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.710
Otherwise known as
b-boying and b-girling.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:23.570
First up, I want to call
out Russell Campbell,

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:30.840
B-boy Iron Man, Russell Campbell.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:39.640
Russell Campbell is from Cab
Crew in Silver Spring, Maryland.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:44.670
Did I say that right?

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:59.400
And next up, we have Mean 187
from New York representing TOK.

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:05.730
So, a little bit of
background on these two guys.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.030
They know each other well.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:11.360
They've met each other a
couple of times in competition

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.670
and some exhibition battles
and it's been monumental.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.980
So, it's actually a pleasure
to have them here on stage.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.530
Would either of you like to talk
a little bit about the style?

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.210
&gt;&gt; MEAN 187: I have like a hard,

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:31.510
an apparently hard New York
Latin accent, so I'm going to try

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:36.360
to tone it down for you a bit,
so I can tell you the story

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.710
about breaking a little
bit, is that ok?

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:41.010
Alright, here we go.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.770
Breaking is not just
flipping and power moves

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.050
and spinning on your head.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.710
Breaking is dancing.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.890
In the beginning, this was it.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:52.190
This was it.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.600
You might get the floor
for a second,

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.200
you can hold a drink,
talk to a woman.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.500
Hey, how ya doing?

00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.800
That's my boy.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.220
I'm breaking right
now, breaking on you.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.160
But, once someone hit
the floor and stayed

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.130
on the floor, that
changed everything.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:11.800
People go to the floor and stay
down like 10, maybe 15 seconds,

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.850
never seen it before,
never heard it before.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:18.450
It changed everything and then
someone decided they were going

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:22.700
to spin and just keep spinning
and they keep spinning.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:28.350
And they just kept spinning and
they're probably still spinning.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:30.120
But, the most important
part of breaking,

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:32.820
in my opinion, is the music.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.830
You've got to know the music and
if it wasn't for James Brown,

00:28:36.830 --> 00:28:40.020
Jimmy Cast a bunch, we wouldn't
be doing what we're doing.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.730
The most important part
of dance is the music.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:46.740
And one thing I can give
to myself and Iron Man.

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.980
Sorry, this is Iron
Man, not just Russell.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.290
We dance to the music.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.740
If you can appreciate that,
you'll appreciate our dance.

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.760
You can grow with it,
you can learn with it.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.800
And you know, we might spin
on our heads a little bit too

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:03.900
if you'd like to see that.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:06.200
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE:
Thank you, Mean.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:10.510
Barronhawk Poitier, are you ready?

00:29:10.510 --> 00:31:50.040
[music]

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.620
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE: Ya'll
give it up for Mean and Iron Man.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.920
[applause]

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.220
&gt;&gt; That's the niceness right there.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:02.280
So, judges the difficult part.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:08.490
If you feel that Iron Man had
the strongest presentation,

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:09.790
make some noise.

00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:11.090
[applause]

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:22.970
&gt;&gt; I can't with this guy.

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:31.220
If you feel that Mean had
the strongest presentation,

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:39.870
make some noise.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.170
[applause]

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:45.380
&gt;&gt; B-boy Iron Man is our winner.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.680
[applause]

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.980
&gt;&gt; Blessings.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:04.750
Give it up for these two guys.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:12.230
[applause]

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:15.840
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE: I feel like
that's going to happen a lot today.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.900
Just saying.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.580
Next up we have House dance.

00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:27.440
First out, I'd like to
welcome Latasha Barnes,

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.990
Urban Artistry Assassin's crew.

00:33:31.990 --> 00:33:41.530
Originally from Richmond, Virginia
and I'd like to welcome out Kyle

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:51.930
"Just So" Clarke from Philly
y'all- originally from Baltimore.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.890
We've got love for him here
too, We got love for ya.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:03.100
So, we're going to go ahead and
we're going to get into this thing.

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.770
You guys ready?

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:10.340
Barron Hawk are you ready?

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:12.140
Hit em.

00:34:12.140 --> 00:38:47.040
[music]

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.820
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE:
That was poetic.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:55.020
That was beautiful.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:10.280
Ya'll give it up for
Barronhawk Poitier.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.580
[applause]

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.880
&gt;&gt; Brought bangers to
the Library of Congress.

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:14.690 position:56%
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:19.610
Ya'll are going to be getting
complaints for the next month.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:28.060
If you feel that Just So had
the strongest performance,

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:36.440
make some noise.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.740
[applause]

00:39:37.740 --> 00:40:04.800
&gt;&gt; If you feel like Latasha had the
best performance, make some noise.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.100
[applause]

00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.500
&gt;&gt; Latasha is our winner.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.430
[applause]

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:17.170
&gt;&gt; Ya'all give it up for Just So.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:19.230
[applause]

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.050
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE: So, that
is our quarter final round.

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:22.800
We're moving on to our semi-finals.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.930
All of our winners will advance

00:40:25.930 --> 00:40:29.110
and now they will compete
against each other.

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:34.560
Ok? So, the turn of
events is such as this.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.510
They will no longer be dancing

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.950
within the styles they
just presented.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:42.490
Now we go into all styles- so
it's an open style category.

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:47.560
So, what that means is that Barron
Hawk is going to play an assortment

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:52.790
of music and they're going to
respond to it accordingly, ok?

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:54.730
Everybody got that?

00:40:54.730 --> 00:41:00.950
Alright, so why don't
we get this started?

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:06.790
Right now we have Juann
versus Rishad.

00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:10.180
[applause]

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:24.510
&gt;&gt; So, without further
delay, Barronhawk.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:47:04.330
[music]

00:47:04.330 --> 00:47:06.630
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE:
Give it up for these two.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:07.930
That was awesome.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:09.230
[applause]

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:10.530
&gt;&gt; And without further ado.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:22.290
If you feel like Rashad had
the strongest performance,

00:47:22.290 --> 00:47:23.590
make some noise.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:24.890
[applause]

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:36.090
&gt;&gt; If you feel that Juwan had
the strongest performance,

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:37.390
make some noise.

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:38.690
[applause]

00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:39.990
&gt;&gt; Rashad is our winner.

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:47.010
Make some noise for Rashad.

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:49.270
Thanks very much Juwan.

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:50.570

&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE:
So, we are tracking

00:55:27.930 --> 00:55:31.330 position:56%
and we are going into our Finals so.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:35.690
So we can give Latasha
a moment to rest,

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:39.970
we're going to have a
performance for you all.

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:42.170
You like that?

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:47.290 position:56%
Performances on top of performances.

00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:53.750
I'd like to welcome Ryan
"Future" Webb to the stage.

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.050
Future? [applause]

00:55:55.050 --> 00:56:05.980
&gt;&gt; Ryan is Urban Artistry's
Director of Education.

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:13.020
He's one of my right hand people
and we put in a lot of work trying

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:16.900
to build curriculum
and trying to make sure

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:19.430
that we're providing the services

00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:22.910
to marginalized communities
that they deserve.

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:27.620
Yeah, I'll let you guys see
this guy- he's pretty good.

00:56:29.510 --> 01:03:09.330
[music]

01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:22.030
&gt;&gt; Ryan "Future" Webb.

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:23.330
[applause]

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:24.630
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE:
That's what we call

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.210
in the culture, the business.

01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:27.920
That just happened.

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.020
Our Finals.

01:03:34.930 --> 01:03:37.540
Latasha Barnes.

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:45.510
Could you please come to the
stage and Rashad Pierson.

01:03:45.510 --> 01:11:00.420
[music]

01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:08.940
&gt;&gt; Give it up for Rashad
and Latasha ya'll.

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:10.240
[applause]

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.650
&gt;&gt; Good stuff.

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:15.970
Now the tough part.

01:11:17.710 --> 01:11:19.380
While they're sweating,
you guys get the screen.

01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:22.360
Isn't that a good trade off?

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:26.930
So, if you feel that Rashad
had the strongest performance,

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:28.230
make some noise for Rashad.

01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:29.530
[applause]

01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:37.530
&gt;&gt; If you feel that Latasha
had the strongest performance,

01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:38.830
make some noise.

01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:40.130
[applause]

01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:48.110
&gt;&gt; That was close.

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:53.170
So, let's try this one more time.

01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:58.160
They're about to kick us out of
the Library of Congress ya'll.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.250
Ya'll know that right?

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:01.910
They went over their time.

01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:03.740
It's time for them to go.

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:07.630
Let's try it one more time.

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:08.930
Rashad. [applause]

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:17.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:19.200
Latasha. [applause]

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:28.690
&gt;&gt; Rashad is our winner.

01:12:28.690 --> 01:12:31.810 position:56%
Ya'll give it up for Latasha Barnes.

01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:33.110
[applause]

01:12:33.110 --> 01:12:46.080
&gt;&gt; Give it up for Barronhawk
Poitier ladies and Gentlemen.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.380
[applause]

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:58.660
&gt;&gt; Can I have all of the artists
come out to the stage please.

01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:07.280
All of the artists
come out to the stage.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.580
[applause]

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:32.130
&gt;&gt; Give it up for the dancers guys.

01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:45.610
[applause]

01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:50.540
&gt;&gt; JUNIOUS BRICKHOUSE:
I just want to close out

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:53.080
and say just a few words.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.140
I want to say thank you
to everybody who showed

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:59.710
up today to dance with us.

01:13:59.710 --> 01:14:04.550 position:56%
This collaboration and these people
coming together is part of something

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:07.670
that we do all the time
in our communities.

01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:11.490
I think a lot of times
people think we're dancing

01:14:11.490 --> 01:14:15.020
because we're competing
or we're competing

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:19.870
because we don't have a connection
that's deeper than let's see

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.090
who can get the most moves

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.690
and who can get the most
Facebook likes, right?

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:31.760
But there is a bond between all
of us that is unbreakable and all

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:34.710
of these people stand
here as tradition bearers,

01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:40.060
as community activists,
as mothers and fathers,

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.850
as business professionals as well.

01:14:42.850 --> 01:14:50.750
So I want to thank them and I'd
like to quote David Mancuso said,

01:14:50.750 --> 01:15:04.250
"if we can dance together,
we can live together."

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.550
[applause]

01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:08.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, with that my esteemed judges,
I want to thank you for your time

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:11.780
and your energy and your
claps and your yells.

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.800
We appreciate you.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:23.890
&gt;&gt; BETSY: And Junious Brickhouse.

&gt;&gt; So, thank you all and let's have
another big hand for our dancers.

[applause]

01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:36.010
&gt;&gt; They were fabulous.

01:15:36.010 --> 01:15:37.810
