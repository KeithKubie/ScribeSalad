00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:02.246
- [Voiceover] What are
all the solutions to the

00:00:02.246 --> 00:00:03.361
equation above?

00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:06.391
And we have x plus
three, times x minus five

00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:08.457
is equal to five.

00:00:08.457 --> 00:00:10.257
You want to be very careful
here because you probably

00:00:10.257 --> 00:00:12.521
have some experience with
algebra that, hey, once I factor

00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:15.586
it out, maybe I could say,
okay, maybe this needs to be

00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:17.873
equal to five, or this
needs to be equal to five.

00:00:17.873 --> 00:00:19.951
That is not the way that it works.

00:00:19.951 --> 00:00:22.320
That would not make
actually logical sense.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.756
In order to, in order to kind
of make the factoring useful,

00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:27.893
you have to be able to say,
hey, the product of these

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:30.157
two things is equal to zero
because if the product of

00:00:30.157 --> 00:00:31.689
two things is equal to zero,

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.520
then you know that either one
or both of them need to be

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.321
equal to zero,

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:39.349
so we've actually have to do a
lot of algebraic manipulation

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:43.125
here to get it into that form
but let's see if we can do it.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:44.994
So the first thing I would
do is just multiply out

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:47.084
x plus three, times x minus five,

00:00:47.084 --> 00:00:48.651
so what's that going to be?

00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:53.651
Well it's going to be x
times x, which is x squared

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:56.291
plus x times negative five,

00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:59.251
so I could say that's minus five x,

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:03.511
plus three times x, so
that's plus three x,

00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:07.993
plus three times negative
five, so it's minus 15,

00:01:07.993 --> 00:01:09.956
and that's all going to be equal to,

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:12.359
that's all going to be equal to five,

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:14.855
and let's see what we can do from here.

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:16.991
We could say this is
going to be x squared,

00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:20.021
and then these two terms right over here,

00:01:20.021 --> 00:01:24.335
we can add together, negative
five x plus three x is

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:28.090
negative two x, and then we have

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.166
minus 15 is equal to five,

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.266
is equal to five.

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:38.087
And let's see, we can now
subtract five from both sides,

00:01:38.087 --> 00:01:40.954
so you subtract five there,
you subtract five there,

00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:43.195
and we're starting to
get to the home stretch,

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:47.758
and we would get x squared
minus two x, minus 20

00:01:47.758 --> 00:01:49.627
is equal to zero.

00:01:49.627 --> 00:01:50.823
So now we're in business.

00:01:50.823 --> 00:01:53.458
Now we have this quadratic
in a form where we just

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:55.188
need to figure out what x
values are going to make this

00:01:55.188 --> 00:01:58.125
expression equal to zero.

00:01:58.125 --> 00:02:02.173
And the first temptation is to
see, well, can we, is there,

00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:05.184
is there any way that we
can naturally factor this?

00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:09.414
So is there a, let's see,
are there any two factors

00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:11.954
of 20

00:02:11.954 --> 00:02:13.462
that if I, and it's going to
be, one of them is going to be

00:02:13.462 --> 00:02:14.855
positive and one's going to be negative,

00:02:14.855 --> 00:02:16.887
since their product is, gets us negative,

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:18.919
or if I add them together
I get to negative two,

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:20.804
so let's see.

00:02:20.804 --> 00:02:21.891
No, nothing jumps out.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:25.687
You have four and five, two and 10.

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.510
Yeah, nothing's jumping out at me.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.283
So, we can just resort to
the quadratic formula here.

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:34.523
When the quadratic formula
tells us that if I have

00:02:34.523 --> 00:02:39.523
a x squared plus b x
plus c is equal to zero,

00:02:39.561 --> 00:02:43.091
then the solutions of this
quadratic equation are going

00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:47.082
to be x is equal to negative b
plus or minus the square root

00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:52.073
of b squared minus four a
c, all of that over two...

00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:54.466
all of that over two a.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:57.098
Now I don't tell people
to memorize a lot in life,

00:02:57.098 --> 00:02:59.821
but the quadratic formula
is one of those things

00:02:59.821 --> 00:03:02.421
that it's not a bad idea to memorize,

00:03:02.421 --> 00:03:04.291
but you should also watch the
Khan Academy videos on how

00:03:04.291 --> 00:03:06.717
this proves and this comes just
naturally out of completing

00:03:06.717 --> 00:03:08.888
the square on this thing right over here,

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:10.955
so also understand what
it's actually saying,

00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:12.522
but it's also a good thing to know,

00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:14.925
because just like that,
we can apply it to this,

00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:18.524
so in this context, our a is one.

00:03:18.524 --> 00:03:21.520
It's the coefficient out here
that's implicitly out there.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.552
So a is one.

00:03:23.552 --> 00:03:25.189
B is negative two.

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:26.593
B is equal to negative two.

00:03:26.593 --> 00:03:28.521
That's this coefficient right over there,

00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:30.622
and c is negative 20.

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:32.851
C is equal to negative 20,

00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:37.851
so the roots are going to
be x is equal to negative b.

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.618
Well it's gonna be
negative of negative two,

00:03:40.618 --> 00:03:43.939
so negative of negative two
is going to be positive two,

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.885
plus or minus the square root
of b squared, which is four,

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:53.060
minus four times a,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.120
which is one,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.217
times negative 20, so
instead I'll put a 20 here,

00:03:59.217 --> 00:04:01.888
and since that's a negative
20, but I'm subtracting it,

00:04:01.888 --> 00:04:06.888
I could put a plus there, and
then, all of that over two a.

00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:08.227
Well a's just one.

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:09.724
All of that over two.

00:04:09.724 --> 00:04:14.724
So it's gonna be two plus
or minus the square root of

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.886
four plus four times 20 is 80,

00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:22.484
of 84 over, over two.

00:04:22.484 --> 00:04:24.957
Now, already, if I'm under
time pressure, I already,

00:04:24.957 --> 00:04:26.756
you know, see some choices
that are starting to

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:28.892
look a little bit like this,
but let's see if we can,

00:04:28.892 --> 00:04:33.060
if we can, if we can get
to the right solution here.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.255
So can I simplify this more?

00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:37.728
Well, see the square root of 84,

00:04:37.728 --> 00:04:40.526
84, that's going to be divisible by,

00:04:40.526 --> 00:04:42.557
that's going to be divisible by four.

00:04:42.557 --> 00:04:44.752
84 is, whoops,

00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:49.129
84 is the same thing as four times 21,

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.219
and all that over two,

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:53.587
and this is going to be the same thing as,

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:56.060
I'll scroll down a little bit,
get a little bit more space,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.189
This is going to,

00:04:57.189 --> 00:05:00.924
x is going to be equal
to two plus or minus,

00:05:00.924 --> 00:05:02.352
so this would be the same thing
as the square root of four

00:05:02.352 --> 00:05:04.558
times the square root of 21,

00:05:04.558 --> 00:05:08.924
which of course is two
times the square root of 21,

00:05:08.924 --> 00:05:10.654
all of that over two,

00:05:10.654 --> 00:05:12.720
so if you divide each of these by two,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.392
which we are doing right here,

00:05:14.392 --> 00:05:18.990
it's gonna be one plus or
minus the square root of 21,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.126
which is,

00:05:21.126 --> 00:05:24.411
which is this choice right over there.

00:05:24.411 --> 00:05:27.024
So it looked like a fairly
benign thing but we had to,

00:05:27.024 --> 00:05:30.727
we had to multiply it out,
set it up, in kind of a form

00:05:30.727 --> 00:05:33.920
where the quadratic formula would apply,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.572
and we got a fairly,
a fairly hairy answer.
