00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.150
because the American Dream is still
alive absolutely it's given me purpose

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.020
and it gives a lot of people purpose I
think it's harder for some together than

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.890
others yes I believe the American Dream
is still alive no the American Dream is

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.240
definitely not alive absolutely but it
depends on how you define it the white

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.540
picket fence gonna Trevor two kids
beautiful wife yes yes yes although I

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.230
think there are a lot of people who are
losing hope and being able to achieve it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.270
the American Dream was never alive a
fantasy that we've clunked - that's cost

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.440
us the American Dream as traditionally
understood is dead but it's been

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.760
reinvented in millions and millions of
wonderful ways so I would say it's more

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.600
about making it more possible for more
people and that means that we have to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.739
think about more people as America my
American Dream is that every family can

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.700
have the same opportunities as the most
privileged family in America and that we

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.630
can all make the best of this country to
be able to do what I want to do with my

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.020
life where I want to do it and
surrounded by the people that I love the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.060
most
it's really to give back to my community

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.200
my parents and everyone who's around me
that's helped me throughout my life my

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.810
American dream is to influence the world
in a positive way acknowledging our role

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.180
in the world acknowledging that we are
of the world in which every person in

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.380
the United States that healthcare could
earn a living and support themselves and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.310
have a home I love this idea of the
pursuit of happiness that to me is very

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.470
important and just to have access to the
same things about my fellow Americans

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.000
house so my American dream actually is
to become a citizen of the United States

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.380
I'm actually currently a docker
recipient my American dream is to make

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.020
my parents
my dream is who become a renowned artist

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.530
we'll see in a few years you may have a
deja vu when you see me on the big

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.160
screens and you'll say you know what I
was right that kid didn't make his dream

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.700
happen and we're out of all place in the
world and the best place which is here

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:15.949
in the United States of America
