00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.090
The first answer is ide.udacity.com. And again, that

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.870
makes sense for the same reason as, as

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.520
before. If the domains match, it's a simple

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.910
case. Of course this domain can set this cookie.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.820
The second answer, other.ide.udacity.com. This basically means if

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.250
other can set a cookie for its parents.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.939
Which works fine. What, what is not a

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.189
correct answer is udacity.com. Other.ide can't set a cookie

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.517
for udacity which would set to, you know, any sub-domain of

00:00:28.517 --> 00:00:31.725
udacity. And it can't set a cookie for, you know, a sibling.

00:00:31.725 --> 00:00:35.870
Other.udacity.com can't set this cookie. Only these two domains can set

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.850
this cookie. I want you to be aware that the domain you're

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.480
setting a cookie for is very important. And, you know, of

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.750
course, when you are developing software you can just experiment and see

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.148
which ones work. But these are the general rules. You know, just,

00:00:47.148 --> 00:00:50.720
just look for, you know, either a direct match or the server.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.053
Or the cookie should be a subset of the

00:00:52.053 --> 00:00:54.670
server. And you're in and you're in good shape.
