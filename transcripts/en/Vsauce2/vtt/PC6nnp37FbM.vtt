00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.870
As an alternative to flu shots the flu patch
concept is equipped with 50 microneedles around

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.820
the size of a hair follicle that penetrate
the skin to deliver the vaccine.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.990
And Researchers at Plymouth University found
that people trying to quit eating certain

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.890
foods or smoking cigarettes can help stave
off cravings by simply playing three minutes

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.890
of Tetris.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.890
Vsauce!

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.890
Kevin here.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.619
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.599
Scientists have studied the direct link between
our brain and the motion-sensing cells in

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.960
our eyes.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.579
Although we've known for a half century of
these cells that help us know when something

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.870
is moving - they've now studied the direction-sensing
cells link to the cortex which could help

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.260
us understand things like dyslexia.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.340
A new app is designed to predict your future.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.930
Predictables is a contemporary fortune teller
that uses an algorithm to search for patterns

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.560
in your life to help predict what you should
do next.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.850
By searching your calendar, Facebook friends,
and your interaction with the digital world

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.730
it could for instance, alert you if your significant
other is having a bad day and suggest that

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.310
you get them flowers.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.350
The PrioVR is a wireless virtual reality gaming
suit.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.940
It's made up of body sensors to give you the
ultimate 360 degree, low latency, real-time

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.220
motion-tracking experience.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.670
There are three versions - an 8 sensor upper
body unit for sitting on the couch - a 12

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.740
sensor unit for full body tracking, and a
17 sensor unit that adds extra control to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.060
the shoulders, feet, and hips.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.330
Researchers at UC Berkeley are working on
a renewable energy source that harnesses the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.040
power of waves.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.480
The sea floor carpet consists of a thin sheet
of rubber sitting atop hydraulic cylinders

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.130
that pump as it moves up and down with the
motion of the waves, the hydraulic pressure

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.310
is then pumped to the shore and converted
into power.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.340
GE is on the cusp of a refrigerator revolution
by using magnets.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.920
The process of using magnetic material is
projected to be 20 percent more efficient

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.220
than traditional methods and it uses a water
based fluid flowing through a series of magnets

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.460
to create heat rather than a chemical refrigerant
and compressor.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.370
Recycling these fridges would be much easier
on the environment and they hope to have it

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.240
available within the next decade.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.810
This drone is able to fly for five years without
refueling because it runs on power of the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.940
sun!

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.780
The MarkOne is a 3D printer that is able to
print the lightest strongest material in the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.780
world.

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.200
It's able to print continuous carbon fiber
which is stronger than metal.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.360
This breakthrough has applications ranging
from prosthetics and robotics to making motorcycle

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.360
parts.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.870
And it ships in the second half of 2014.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.520
Emospark claims to be the first artificially
intelligent emotion device.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.910
It's an android-powered wifi cube that lets
users interact through conversation, music,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:57.990
and visual media.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.360
Over time the cube creates an emotional profile
graph, essentially allowing it to feel and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.470
express those emotions according to the user.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.480
And seek joy and satisfaction from its owner.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.220
Computer simulations have shown that using
offshore wind turbines can drastically reduce

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.230
the power of hurricanes.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.240
By encountering an enormous wind farm stretching
many miles offshore and along the coast Professor

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.440
Mark Z Jacobson found that hurricane wind
speeds could be reduced by up to 92 miles

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.200
per hour and the storm surge decreased by
up to 79 percent and he says that 78,000 wind

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.330
turbines off the coast of New Orleans would
have drastically changed the outcome of Hurricane

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.330
Katrina.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.620
The world's oldest cheese dates back to 1615
BC and was recently discovered as clumps on

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.500
the neck and chests of Chinese mummies.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.530
So yeah.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.720
The Florida International University Discovery
Lab is developing a real Robocop!

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.720
Sort of.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.660
The Telebot prototype is designed to help
disabled police officers.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.569
The 6 foot tall, 75 lb robot can be controlled
remotely by officers and the head has live

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.290
video streaming in order to share visual information.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.390
The next step is developing the outer shell
and doing field testing.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.510
Finally, here's a responsive hexi wall made
up of 60 moving modules created by Thibaut.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:34.689
I'm going to leave you with Bimanual Manipulation
for Autonomous Service Robots and as always

00:04:34.689 --> 00:05:31.680
- thanks for watching.
