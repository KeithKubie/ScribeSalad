00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.160
Remember, our update function takes a single year as an argument, and

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.220
with this year, we have to filter our data.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.660
In this case, we'll actually be filtering our nested object.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.500
Remember, when we grouped our data by year,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.050
the nested object had its key property set to the year.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.660
And then our filter function, all we need to do is strip out the key and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.150
compare it to the year we want to filter by.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.740
In this case, the nested object actually has its keys as strings,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.870
so we first need to convert the string back into a date, pull the year out, and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.310
compare it to the year passed to our update function.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.460
And the filter function works just like a map except for

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.340
instead of returning every element of the array it's called on,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.360
it only returns ones where, in our accessor function, we return true.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.380
In this case, true will only be returned for the elements d,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.940
where the key is equal to the year passed to our update function.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.860
And now that we have the correct data filtered,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.420
we can begin updating our map and the circles drawn.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.930
To do this, we'll use data binding and

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.890
the special enter and exit selection that we covered in the last lesson.
