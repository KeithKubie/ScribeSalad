The endocrine system, is linked to the nervous system, by the hypothalamus,

00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:08.345
which is one of the important structures, involved in stress, along with the

00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:14.250
endocrine system's pituitary gland and adrenal glands. Neurons in the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.210
hypothalamus release chemicals, which causes the pituitary gland to release

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.880
hormones. These hormones play an important role, in the response to stress.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.414
Also important to the stress response are the adrenal glands because they

00:00:27.414 --> 00:00:32.298
release hormones called catecholamines and glucocorticoids. Catecholamines

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:36.950
control the autonomic nervous system activation. Catecholamines include

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.767
dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. Glucocorticoids are important because

00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:47.414
they maintain activation of our physiological systems during emergencies.
