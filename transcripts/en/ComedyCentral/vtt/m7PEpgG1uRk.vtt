The App Store is especially lit

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.372
because Wiz Khalifa is about
to drop his very own mobile game

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.508
entitled
 Wiz Khalifa's Weed Farm.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:11.411
-So it's kind of like
 Farmville... -On the nose.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:14.680
-...if your farm had to smell
like Portland, so... -(laughter)

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:17.050
This gives gamers a glimpse
of what it would be like to grow

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.285
and sell weed without having
to disappoint their parents.

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.354
Take it from Wiz himself,
who says...

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:26.893
(audience jeering)

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:29.162
I'm going to see it
again and again.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.464
Uh, Wiz,
if you wanted to be Pokémon,

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:34.967
why didn't you just make a game
based off Smokémon?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.970
♪ Smoke every day,
weed every day ♪

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.240
♪ We smoke weed every day ♪

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:44.143
♪ Every day,
smoke weed every day ♪

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:46.379
♪ Every day. ♪

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:48.615
(whooping, applause)

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:55.054
All the Pokestops
are park benches

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:57.356
wherever you can buy
a gas station hot dog.

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.859
Uh, now, since Wiz Khalifa
has gotten the ball rolling,

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.160
what will the next

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:03.429
controversial
celebrity video game be?

00:01:03.462 --> 00:01:05.998
-Felicia. -Kendall Jenner's
 Pepsi Challenge.

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:08.234
(laughter)

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.103
(applause, whooping)

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.676
There are no winners
in that game.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.111
Points.

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.645
Uh, Hampton.

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:22.648
 Tyler Perry Presents
 A Very Madea Ghost Protocol.

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.784
-Yes, points.
-(laughter)

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.419
(applause)

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.822
Points. Jonah.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.991
Uh, Steve Bannon's Cuck Hunt.

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.993
-All right, points! Very good.
-(audience groans)

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:35.394
-Very good.
-DAY: Yeah, that was good.

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:37.029
RAY: That's a high-level
political joke.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:39.232
-You guys don't get it.
-It's not that high-level.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.134
-No, it's real smart.
-No, you just swapped out

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.835
-It's really smart.
-the word "duck" for "cuck."

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.170
No, it's-it's okay.

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:47.536
Please, God, don't...
don't take this away from me.
