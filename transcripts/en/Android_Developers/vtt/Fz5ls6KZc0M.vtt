00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.350
[synthesizer music]

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.710
&gt;&gt;Adam: Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.930
My name is Adam Koch.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.660
Welcome to the second week of Android Design
in Action.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.160
For those of you who don't know me, I work
on the Developer Relations team on Android

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.640
here in New York.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.870
I'm joined by Nick Butcher in London.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.070
He is to my left over there.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.610
How's it going, Nick?

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.610
&gt;&gt;Nick: Good.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.960
Good to see you, Adam.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.380
&gt;&gt;Adam: So, thanks for joining us.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.030
For those of you who aren't familiar with
the show, the show is designed to follow on

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.110
from Reto and Ian Ni-Lewis's show that they
have on Friday called the App Clinic where

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.920
they look at a number of different apps.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.340
And what we're trying to do here is re-imagine,
redesign some of the screens in those apps.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.290
Nick, anything else to add?

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.870
&gt;&gt;Nick: No.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.590
This is the second time we've done this show,
so we're still feeling our way around the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.610
best way to do things.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.630
So if you have any comments, feedback on what
you'd like to see, if there's something you'd

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.540
like to see more of, then let us know.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.720
But yeah, the real goal is to really use these
make overs to demonstrate how you can use

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.800
Android design in your every day apps.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.390
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.820
And I want to give a special shout out to
Jeff Posnick, who's actually running all the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.610
fancy equipment for us today.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.670
You should listen in to his show as well on
the YouTube API which is generally weekly

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.770
as well.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:35.030
One thing I did wanna quickly mention is that
some people asked some questions about how

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.900
we set up the show and what kind of equipment
we're using here.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.530
And I just wanted to say that we're using
this really fancy tablet here--it's called

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.680
the Motorola XOOM--to show us our screen shots.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.220
And it's plugged into an HDMI and fed into
a central system here that loops in all the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.340
different video feeds.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.850
So with that, let's get started.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.280
Today's focus is stopwatch and timers.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.560
So, hopefully you watched the App Clinic last
week and saw some of the apps that they went

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560
over.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.780
Why don't we switch it over to demo?

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.780
[pause]

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.780
Alright.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.670
&gt;&gt;Nick: Great, yeah.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.950
So, actually set it last Friday.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.700
Ian and Reto took a look at a number of stopwatch
and timer apps and gave their opinions on

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.630
what they liked, what they were looking for
in their applications and what they didn't

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.630
like.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.120
So, the first application we're looking at
here is called Hybrid Stopwatch and Timer.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.180
So this came out as one of Ian and Reto's
favorite applications.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.349
They enjoyed the functionality and the design
and the big feature graphic on their Market

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.840
page.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.650
So, what we've done here is we've taken a
look at it and said, "Yeah, it's got some

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.740
pretty good functionality, but there's a few
ways in which we'd like to see Android design

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.400
applied to it."

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.569
So, taking a quick look at the screen shot
here, you can see the stopwatch page, which

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.450
lets you start stopwatch using the big red
button in the middle as well as record a number

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.540
of laps and resets.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.740
And it gives you that timer up at the top
and it shows you your latest lap time in the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.459
orange bar just below.

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.849
If you want to go to the subsequent page,
on the right you can see that it also lists

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.300
out all the lap times you recorded during
your session.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.620
So, we looked at this and we, the first thing
that strikes me really is it's quite what

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.300
we refer to as a skeuomorphic design.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.990
So, it's really trying to imitate real life
in a digital surrounding.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.600
While that can be great for bootstrapping
the user's mental model, it's getting them

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.629
to instantly see something familiar and recognize
it, you have to be aware that when you use

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.470
this kind of design, it's also gonna bring
across people's limitations of the physical

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.470
world.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.590
It's gonna start, if you have a book application
that looks just like a book--a real book--you

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.420
can't really just copy the page, the text,
or do a Wikipedia search for a certain word.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.540
So, those kind of features might not become
obvious, or might not sit very well with the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.040
design, which is really skeuomorphic.

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.739
So, there's pluses and minuses to this school
of design.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.750
It's also quite associated with the IOS world.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.500
Another thing we notice is there's quite a
liberal use of gradients throughout the application.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.720
So, every bar and so on has this textured
gradient feel, which is, doesn't quite sit

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.330
at home in the Android look and feel, the
Holo design philosophy really.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.979
And from a technical point of view we've noticed
that it's not targeting the latest versions

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:28.979
of Android.

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:34.949
So, it's using the legacy menu button, as
you can see, emulated down at the bottom.

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.949
If you go to the next slide, Adam, you can
see if you pop open the menu, they're actually

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.860
using that as one of the primary means of
navigation.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.259
So, this isn't really very advised.

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.979
Not everyone's gonna look under the menu button
for the navigation.

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.879
They might not even realize that there are
other features in the application, such as

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:52.879
the timer.

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.759
It has some advanced preferences in here.

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.180
So what we'd really like to see them do is
move towards the latest APIs, which should

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.139
be using an action bar to expose these kind
of functionality and navigation controls on-screen.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:12.610
Also, if they target the latest APIs, they'd
benefit from the latest Holo themes and styles.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.930
So, things like the updated scroll bar styles
and new text fonts and so on.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.909
They would benefit from all these modern look
and feel.

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:21.909
How about that, Adam?

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.369
Do you have any thoughts about the look and
feel of this, the Hybrid Stopwatch and Timer

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:26.369
app?

00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:27.369
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, yes.

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:30.780
So, to me, like the actual stopwatch itself
looks quite nice.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.219
As you say, it's trying to mimic real world
object.

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:39.490
But when they go and actually show the lap
times and then they have to reuse those gradients

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.610
to really make it sort of look the same as
the stopwatch, that's when it, the design

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.819
starts to fall apart if you ask me.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.430
It just doesn't look quite as nice.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.639
It doesn't really fit with the Android system
at that point.

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:54.659
So I mean, it's a choice every designer and
developer needs to make when they design their

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:55.659
app.

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.580
It's totally a valid choice if you think it
serves your users better that way, then that's

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.669
totally fine.

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.710
So, that's the design piece of it.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.929
As far as the navigation or getting around
the application, as you said, they're using

00:06:09.929 --> 00:06:11.589
the old-style menus.

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:18.119
And to me, that's not like a, visual design
aside, navigation in this app is very difficult.

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:23.189
It's one of the reasons why the menu button
has been deprecated now.

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:28.069
It's very difficult to find those additional
features in the application.

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:33.379
And I think the guys mentioned this in the
App Clinic on Friday, but not all devices

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:37.559
have soft, on-screen buttons on the bottom.

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:44.580
So, for example, the HTC One X device will
show that menu button as a horizontal button,

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.599
taking up the entire bottom portion of the
screen.

00:06:46.599 --> 00:06:47.599
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:53.569
&gt;&gt;Adam: So, it instantly makes your application
look not up-to-date, not using the latest

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:54.569
Android API versions.

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:57.210
&gt;&gt;Nick: The button of shame, I think they
call it on the App Clinic, right?

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.000
&gt;&gt;Adam: [laughs] Is that what they call it?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.229
Yes, the button of shame.

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:04.369
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, what did we do with it?

00:07:04.369 --> 00:07:05.369
&gt;&gt;Adam: All right.

00:07:05.369 --> 00:07:10.819
Oh, and I should mention that our favorite
pixel pusher Roman Nurik is off on vacation.

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:14.309
I guess we let him have one day off from work.

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:19.339
But he's here in spirit because this design
was actually something he worked on last week.

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:21.879
So here we go.

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.150
&gt;&gt;Nick: Ta-da.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.419
&gt;&gt;Adam: Ta-da.

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:25.689
And reveal.

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:32.939
So, I guess I can talk through the navigation
elements first, and then maybe Nick, you can

00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:35.409
add some comments.

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:41.289
So, what you see at the top, you've got the
action bar, which we love, the anchor of the

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:42.289
screen.

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:45.639
You've got the icon in the top left corner,
the branding.

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:48.580
And then, right next to that, you've got the
top level navigation.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:54.840
So, in this case, it's a spinner with the
currently selected item, which is the stopwatch.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.369
Right next to that you have an action item,
reset, and the action overflow.

00:07:59.369 --> 00:08:04.699
And then what we've done here is underneath,
there's two tabs which are made to easily

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:10.080
navigate between the action timer itself and
the different lap times, sort of list view

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.340
collection of a particular object.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:21.749
And then, obviously, you've got the nice Holo
theming throughout the whole application there.

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:27.349
It's worth noting that actions like stop and
lap, they could be in the action bar, but

00:08:27.349 --> 00:08:31.770
because they're so important and so critical
to this application it warrants pointing them

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.390
out and having them in a more visible and
easily accessible place.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.800
Nick, thoughts?

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.779
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, so for me, this instantly jumps
out as just feeling right at home in the Android

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:44.779
look and feel.

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:50.500
I think the application of the Holo styling
married with a accent color, which we picked

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:56.100
out from the original application, the orangy,
browny color is from the original application.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:03.430
We've used those to hint the default Holo
widgets set and create the clock face.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.120
And I just think it instantly looks much,
much more Androidy to me.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.630
So, like you said, I like use of the action
bar 'cause instantly it feels familiar to

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:12.630
me.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:17.639
I instantly know how to switch modes between
timer and stopwatch just by looking at this.

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:21.319
Incidentally, 'cause this app has these two
different modes you can run it in, timer and

00:09:21.319 --> 00:09:26.180
stopwatch, having that name right up there
in the title next to the icon is super useful.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:30.970
So, if I am switching back to the application
from resets, for example, I have the name

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.480
echoed back to me right there.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.639
So, straight away, I know which mode I'm in.

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:39.769
I think having, pulling out the lap times
into a separate tab makes it much more visible.

00:09:39.769 --> 00:09:42.819
I don't have to discover them under the menu
and switch to them.

00:09:42.819 --> 00:09:46.480
They're instantly there and just a swipe away
so you can use the horizontal swipe to get

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.480
to them.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.990
So, it's really brought that functionality
out.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:53.649
Looking at the stop and lap, I consider that
like this action bar almost.

00:09:53.649 --> 00:09:58.250
So, for me, it feels like an extension of
the actions in the application.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:02.610
But what's great about this is they've really
pulled out the key actions of start and stop

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.730
into much larger tap target.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:10.259
It makes the most important things you do
in the app, like starting and stopping for

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:13.040
a stopwatch, super easy and like, front and
center.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.920
The other thing I really like about this redesign
that Roman has done is the use of typography.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:22.990
So, this is something we keep on going on
about, but using different weights and colors

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.779
of typography to give structure and emphasis
to the application.

00:10:27.779 --> 00:10:34.220
So, I found in the old application, on the
left-hand side, all those leading zero digits

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.439
I find add noise.

00:10:35.439 --> 00:10:40.360
So, I find it harder to read it and quickly
understand the time.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.069
Whereas in the redesign, using a different
color or weight for the fonts, you can really

00:10:45.069 --> 00:10:47.470
make the important information stand out.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.279
[pause]
&gt;&gt; Adam:Yeah, definitely

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:54.439
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, for me, that's some of the major
benefits.

00:10:54.439 --> 00:10:59.649
One thing to talk about is we've always not
included the advert in the redesign, which

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:01.560
obviously helps it feel a bit cleaner.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.089
But thinking about that, I was thinking you
could easily just include the advert when

00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:06.550
it's in the non-running mode.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.769
So, for example, when you're actually using
the stopwatch and it's running, you'd be able

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:16.260
to clear that away and have a very clean interface
in the down time when you're between actually

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.560
running stopwatches, you could pop it in.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:26.040
So if you go into the next page as well, we've
taken a quick look at the lap times as well.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.430
OK.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:34.500
So, Roman's done the same redesign, applied
the same treatment to the second tap here.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.970
So, here we can see, rather than using all
these different gradients, we've gone for

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.899
a much flatter, Holo style again and really,
really cut down on all the chrome and just

00:11:43.899 --> 00:11:46.089
let the content stand out.

00:11:46.089 --> 00:11:49.790
So, one of my favorite aspects of this design
is the use of color.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:54.800
So, you can see here, we've picked out using
green and reds to show the fastest and slowest

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.079
lap times.

00:11:56.079 --> 00:12:01.149
So instantly, once you break away from the
constraints of having all these, all this

00:12:01.149 --> 00:12:05.980
chrome, or the gradients surrounding the content,
it lets you do more interesting things with

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.829
content and lets it shine.

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:10.329
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah that's [ inaudible ].

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:11.579
&gt;&gt;Nick: Any more thoughts, Adam?

00:12:11.579 --> 00:12:14.910
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, so two other things I wanted
to quickly mention.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:21.019
One, I really like the share action directly
in the action bar there, so you can quickly

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:23.249
share out your lap times and whatnot.

00:12:23.249 --> 00:12:27.009
I believe before it was in, OK.

00:12:27.009 --> 00:12:33.851
There was no way to actually share before,
I guess, using the regular menu but that's

00:12:33.851 --> 00:12:34.851
a really nice addition.

00:12:34.851 --> 00:12:40.240
And the other thing is, a lot of people ask
me about I guess second-level navigation or

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.080
how can I add a filter to my application to
a list?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.029
So, for example, in a movie application, you
might have top movies and then you wanna filter

00:12:48.029 --> 00:12:51.139
by genre, but you wanna have it all on the
same screen.

00:12:51.139 --> 00:12:58.920
So, what was added here is a secondary spinner
or drop down underneath the action bar where

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.620
you can choose lap time or total time.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:08.529
And I think this is a really nice way of adding,
easy way to change or filter the content on

00:13:08.529 --> 00:13:10.190
that particular screen.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:15.490
It's really clear that it falls underneath
the lap times on the right side.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.910
It doesn't apply to everything.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:23.069
And it's just a really easy way and visually
simple way to tell the user that there's a

00:13:23.069 --> 00:13:27.769
way to change the visuals on that particular
screen.

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:31.720
The other option, which I've seen used which
is also a decent option, is to actually put

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:37.209
something in the action bar, which is tied
to the fragment that sits on that tab.

00:13:37.209 --> 00:13:40.130
It could be like a little filter icon or something.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:45.120
And clicking that would again, pull a little
drop down which you could quickly use to change

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.930
something on that particular screen.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.300
&gt;&gt;Nick: OK.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.350
&gt;&gt;Adam: What else?

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.819
&gt;&gt;Nick: I think also just having the laps
and the stopwatch on the same hierarchical

00:13:54.819 --> 00:13:58.339
level of each other on separate tabs is great
'cause you can obviously have the stopwatch

00:13:58.339 --> 00:14:01.889
still running and switch over to have a quick
look at the lap times you've done and switch

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:03.470
back to the still running stopwatch.

00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:07.920
And it's much, much more apparent that these
are siblings in that kind of hierarchy when

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.149
they're on tabs, rather than the old design
when you were perhaps having to go in and

00:14:11.149 --> 00:14:15.230
out of different screens and you couldn't
see those two elements on the screen at the

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.230
same time.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:20.550
So I could see your way of, you could perhaps
decorate the stopwatch icon in redesign, like

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:25.870
make it glow somehow or have a different highlight
state to show that the stopwatch is still

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.839
running or stopped to indicate that at the
same time 'cause it's on-screen.

00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.769
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, that's an excellent point.

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:36.880
I guess one last thing I just wanna quickly
mention was--I think you mentioned this before--but

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.220
the use of typography and also the font sizes.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.500
For example, this screen where you've got
the stopwatch and lap time.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.529
It's very small, not much padding around it.

00:14:46.529 --> 00:14:50.779
It's kind of difficult to see, whereas in
the redesign, you can very easily make out

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:51.779
lap time there.

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:54.540
And then, the same on this screen.

00:14:54.540 --> 00:15:00.100
You've got list view on the left side on the
old design taking up just three rows, yet

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:01.889
it's hard to read the text.

00:15:01.889 --> 00:15:03.070
There's not a lot of padding.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:07.040
There's not a lot of, it's visually not easy
to break out.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:11.600
&gt;&gt;Nick: It might be a case where you wanna
look at the data, if you have analytics in

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.329
your application, and see how many lap times
people often record and use that sizing information

00:15:16.329 --> 00:15:17.579
to inform your decision.

00:15:17.579 --> 00:15:22.459
I mean, here we're making an assumption that
five or six lap times at most are gonna be

00:15:22.459 --> 00:15:26.080
shown, or else you might end up running out
of room.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.649
&gt;&gt;Adam: That's true.

00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:29.750
That's a good point.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:30.800
&gt;&gt;Nick: Cool.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.850
&gt;&gt;Adam: Excellent.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:35.000
So, should we move along here?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.050
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:42.249
So this next application is called Impetus
and it's an interval timer.

00:15:42.249 --> 00:15:47.889
So, it's an application for people doing workouts
pretty much where you want to do repeated

00:15:47.889 --> 00:15:49.370
intervals of workouts.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:55.050
So, we're gonna take a look at one particular
screen in this application, which is the edit

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.410
screen, which lets you set up one of these
interval sessions.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.959
So, taking a look here on the screen on the
left, you can see we're in an edit tab for

00:16:03.959 --> 00:16:07.350
editing that particular set up.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:12.019
And it lets you enter a period for, of prep
before your interval training session and

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:16.850
then a number of rounds of interval that you're
gonna go through, made up of work and rest

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:17.850
periods.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.459
And then a cool down at the end, giving you
a total.

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:25.480
And what happens when you edit these values,
each of these rows per se, a tappable clicking

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:32.230
on which launches a pop-up you see on the
next screen, which gives you a spinner and

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:37.860
the option to go back to the screen and choose
another time to set or use the arrow buttons

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.910
to advance back or forth between the different
sections.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:48.379
So, taking a look at this, Adam, do you wanna
give any initial thoughts on this photo screen?

00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:56.149
&gt;&gt;Adam: So first of all, they are using action
bar and they have the design, tab designs

00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:57.199
and whatnot there.

00:16:57.199 --> 00:16:59.269
So, that's a great start.

00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:03.200
I think the guys on Friday mentioned this
as well.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:09.310
As far as this sort of, I guess, work flow
goes, going through and adding all these things,

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.140
to me it seems like a lot of work.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.240
Like, a lot of tapping, a lot of changing.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.604
It's not really, when I see all these fields
and I know I have to configure them all, to

00:17:20.604 --> 00:17:24.709
me it's already in my head and mentally, it
makes it feel like a lot of work to me.

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:30.419
I do like how they added the arrows, so that's
an attempt to make it easy to quickly navigate

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:35.080
through the different things, but I'm not
sure if it like, really, it really solves

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:39.600
the problem of quickly getting through and
configuring all these things.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:45.200
&gt;&gt;Nick: To expand on that feeling hard, for
me it's what you would refer to as a mode

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.830
problem because in the first sense, you launch
the app.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:52.250
You come in and you see a particular timer
and then you have to hit the edit tab, which

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.529
is like going into edit mode.

00:17:53.529 --> 00:17:57.230
So, it's like you're already in mode on top
of the standard timer.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.490
And then, every time you hit edit, there's
a pop-up which comes up on top, which is like

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.210
a mode on top of the mode in my mind.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.210
So, this is--.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.210
&gt;&gt;Adam: Must go deeper.

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.910
&gt;&gt;Nick: When you're putting all these different
layers on top of each other, you're asking

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:12.190
the user to hold a lot of state in their mind,
which is what makes it feel hard to use or

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:15.160
hard to keep it all in your mind at once.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.909
So that's one of the main problems which we've
really tried to address with it.

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:25.080
Some other minor stuff I wanted to call out
from the page as well is it had a good attempt

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.690
to theming the Holo look and feel.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.460
So you can see they've used the orange accent
on the tap bar, for example, which picks out

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.240
the color schemes from their icon, which is
great.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.029
But they haven't quite taken that further
throughout the application.

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:38.970
So you see when the pop-up comes up to show
the time.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:42.510
They're using the standard Holo dark blue
accents.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:47.270
So, 'cause you have these two different color
accents on-screen, for me that feels a bit

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.140
like a clash and that they haven't really
gone far enough with the customizations.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.549
I'd like to see that kept consistent throughout
really.

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:54.630
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, that's a good point.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:19:00.340
And just on that, they are using the dialog
header from the Holo theme, but then everything

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:06.080
below that in the dialog just doesn't conform
to the standard Holo theme at all.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.520
You've got this custom time picker, which
is lighter in color.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.409
And then below that, you've got three buttons
which aren't the standard dialog buttons from

00:19:14.409 --> 00:19:15.409
the Holo theme either.

00:19:15.409 --> 00:19:16.409
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:19:16.409 --> 00:19:23.190
If there's a dialog, I expect to see the button
bar style where you have just the outline

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.750
separating like the OK, cancel buttons or
whatever the buttons might be.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:30.130
And another one--it might sound minor as well--but
just looking at the main screen on the left,

00:19:30.130 --> 00:19:31.520
the alignment feels really off.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.360
It feels like the total isn't aligned to the
things below it.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:40.559
And then, within each of the rows, the text
is hard-lined to the left and not quite center

00:19:40.559 --> 00:19:41.559
aligned vertically.

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:44.850
So for me, just looking at it, it just feels
unwieldy.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:49.559
It doesn't feel very regular or very even
at all.

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:54.060
There's no extra weight given to total, even
though that is, you know, totaling up what's

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.520
going on.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:02.580
And at first blush, it might not be obvious
that rounds refers to, the eight rounds refer

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.080
to work and rest periods, but not to the cool
down or prep.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.429
They're separate to those things.

00:20:09.429 --> 00:20:11.820
There's no grouping or anything there.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:14.360
So, for me, there's quite a lot going on.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.200
It's not particularly aligned to make it easy
to scan and understand what's going on.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:25.490
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, and we have a recommended standard
padding that you have in use around the different

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:26.490
text fields.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:30.799
And you can see here it's just the text fields
are up against the sides of the screen on

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:32.310
both sides.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.440
So, some padding there would have definitely
helped as well.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:36.990
&gt;&gt;Nick: Right.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.080
So onto the redesign.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.950
&gt;&gt;Adam: It's, here we go.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:44.950
[pause]

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.570
Is that synced over for you now?

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:47.570
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.080
I can see it now.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.510
[laughs] Cool.

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.220
So, what we've gone for here with the redesign
is--.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.919
&gt;&gt;Adam: Also, one quick thing.

00:20:55.919 --> 00:20:58.490
Our very own Nick Butcher did this redesign.

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.299
So, good stuff there, Nick.

00:21:00.299 --> 00:21:01.299
Go ahead.

00:21:01.299 --> 00:21:04.820
&gt;&gt;Nick: In Roman Nurik's absence, there's
a poor substitute there.

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.950
I do with it what I can.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.940
So what we've gone for here with this redesign
is more like a wizard-style.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:17.280
So, the idea here is that you come in to this
summary screen showing you what's the summary

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:23.140
of the workout is and then you can swipe right,
go through each of the individual sections

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:28.269
that you can configure, each of which contains
a number picker letting you set it.

00:21:28.269 --> 00:21:33.401
So, we've gone for like a scroll bar indicator
at the bottom as well to indicate that there

00:21:33.401 --> 00:21:37.299
is this horizontal scrolling affordance, very
similar to the home screen, the default home

00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:40.580
screen you might have in the launcher app
on Android.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:45.590
And also, clicking on each of the items would
jump you to the right section.

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:51.169
So, the idea here is instead of having to
go in and out of each of the sections with

00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:54.660
dialog popping up, being dismissed, a new
dialog popping up, being dismissed, you have

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.309
this one consistent wizard feel that lets
you configure the whole thing.

00:21:59.309 --> 00:22:00.980
And then you're done.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:06.730
And speaking of done, instead of having it
as a mode within the main UI, it's a tab within

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.760
the main UI.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:13.380
We've launched this as its own separate activity
and used a pattern copied from contacts and

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:18.179
calendar applications, where we had this done
and discard bar at the top.

00:22:18.179 --> 00:22:22.710
So instantly, this bar stays the same and
you know how to dismiss it and say, "Yes,

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.370
I'm done, " or "No, get rid of this."

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:27.110
Have any thoughts, Adam?

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:28.110
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:33.830
I really like the layout you've chosen here
with the big edit timer.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.740
Sorry, the little thing's coming off.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:42.630
And then you've also bolded and made the total
time really, really noticeable and easy to

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:43.630
read.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:48.690
As far as the actual wizard goes, I think
that's a pretty unique take on it.

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.750
There's something that's traditionally pretty
mundane, like filling out a bunch of fields

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.380
like in a preference-style screen.

00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.570
You've taken and really made it into something
more interesting.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:04.059
So, just so I've got this right, the initial
screen is a summary and then you can either

00:23:04.059 --> 00:23:09.370
start swiping left, swiping across to edit
each of them one by one, or if you want to

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:13.279
jump to a specific one, you just tap on it
and it'll slide across to the correct field.

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:14.279
Is that right?

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:15.279
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:17.650
Will you show us the next slide on the XOOM?

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:18.650
[pause]

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:19.650
&gt;&gt;Adam: Ah.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:20.650
Bingo.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.650
&gt;&gt;Nick: OK.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.900
So here's an example.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.260
You tap on the rounds link on the center,
for example.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.799
It'll pan you across to the right page and
you'll get a standard Android number picker.

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:34.190
And so, you can progress, keep on swiping
across to go to the next one.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:38.370
And as you can see at the bottom, there's
the scroll bar affordance at the bottom, similar

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:43.200
to the home screen letting the user know where
they are in the page, how far along they are,

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:46.409
and also just signifying that there is this
horizontal swipe affordance.

00:23:46.409 --> 00:23:47.450
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:55.289
And I definitely like how it's its own screen
rather than being a tab on the main screen.

00:23:55.289 --> 00:23:58.720
As you were talking about modes before, like
to me this is much clearer.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.120
It's almost like when I'm viewing a contact
or editing a contact, viewing a timer or editing

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.560
a timer.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.230
So I really like that.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:12.520
And then I noticed that you've got this standard
system number picker here as well, which fits

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.049
in nicely with the Holo theme.

00:24:14.049 --> 00:24:15.049
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:21.779
Speaking of Holo theme, we've really gone
for using just typography and standard controls

00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:25.630
to give the application structure rather than
having these bounding boxes, which you used

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:28.110
to have around the controls.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:33.590
So you can see we've used the different colors,
for example, like on total and edit.

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:38.230
It just give the, make those stand out as
important sections rather than putting dividing

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.970
lines in and so on and lining things up, really.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:47.690
So, we've used the standard 48 DP rhythm here
to give the application this steady rhythm,

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.760
which makes it much easier to scan and read
and understand what's going on very quickly

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.720
and make certain things jump out, like the
total time.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:25:01.159
We've also taken the orange accent color,
which the original application used in the

00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:04.130
tab bar, and run with it and really use that
to theme everything.

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:10.640
So, from the standard number picker to the
page title and the total bar, for example.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.640
[pause]

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:12.929
&gt;&gt;Adam: Excellent.

00:25:12.929 --> 00:25:14.669
I really like it.

00:25:14.669 --> 00:25:19.230
One question, so around the done and discard,
I think we had a slide on this last week as

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.990
well.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:29.700
Why the twist to show both at the same time
rather than, say, push one into the overflow

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.700
menu?

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.740
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, I would say that really comes
down to the expected behavior here.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.399
So, how is the user gonna use this?

00:25:37.399 --> 00:25:42.250
If it's the kind of thing where they're gonna
come in and then once get rid of the, what

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.990
they've done, is quite likely, then I think
having discard as a primary option works very,

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:48.030
very well.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:52.960
If it's something where they expect to back
out and not have it discard what they've done,

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:58.350
but have it just cancel the edit--so think
about editing a contact, for example--you

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:01.970
wanna have a big done button at the top, but
you're very unlikely to want to actually just

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:07.669
completely discard, then that justifies putting
it under the overflow.

00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:10.720
The other option as well is obviously, 'cause
this pattern takes up the entire action bar

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.761
at the top, if you did have other options,
other actions, that you wanted to put under

00:26:14.761 --> 00:26:19.610
the overflow button for example, you couldn't
really have room for both the large buttons

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:20.610
and the overflow.

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:23.710
So that's a case where you might wanna pick
the most likely candidate as a stand out one,

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:26.591
like maybe just the done button and then have
other options under the overflow.

00:26:26.591 --> 00:26:27.591
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yeah, that's a good point.

00:26:27.591 --> 00:26:34.649
And I guess, like, I don't know if this way
that users would, I guess you'd have to analyze

00:26:34.649 --> 00:26:42.039
how users use this application, but if it
was unlikely to undo via common action to

00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:46.651
discard what you find there, I'd say push
it into the overflow menu, have 'done' as

00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:47.651
the primary action.

00:26:47.651 --> 00:26:53.850
That also means that, say, if the user hits
the back button, they know that we're going

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:58.190
backwards and we're gonna save whatever state
was there rather than not knowing if it's

00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:59.279
gonna be done or discard.

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:02.950
&gt;&gt;Nick: Actually, my take on this was that
this isn't the kind of application where you're

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:03.950
gonna install it.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:07.710
You're gonna go in and set up a bunch of interval
times--these are the workouts which I'd like

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.710
to do.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:09.710
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yep.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:10.710
&gt;&gt;Nick: So you're gonna go in there and do
a bunch of them.

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.320
And you're probably just gonna set them up
and you're either gonna want to save it, say,

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.320
"Yeah, that's it."

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.320
Or, you're just gonna decide, "Oh, no.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.320
That's not what I wanted."

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.320
Discard it.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.320
Throw it away.

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.320
There's not actually gonna be a lot of curation.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.299
You're not really gonna be coming in and out
and changing it very much.

00:27:23.299 --> 00:27:26.039
So this is why I went to the plain done and
discard.

00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:29.179
If you did think that people were gonna be
curating them, using them a lot more, then

00:27:29.179 --> 00:27:34.169
you might go for the pattern with just the
'done' button and discard under the overflow.

00:27:34.169 --> 00:27:36.200
&gt;&gt;Adam: Excellent.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.169
Well, I think we're almost out of time.

00:27:40.169 --> 00:27:41.169
[pause]

00:27:41.169 --> 00:27:44.640
We don't have any more slides.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:49.899
So, any other last thoughts, Nick, before
we call the show for this week?

00:27:49.899 --> 00:27:50.899
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yes.

00:27:50.899 --> 00:27:55.450
So, I wanted to use just a little bit of time
that we have left just to go over a few headlines

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.860
in the world of Android design.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.690
Just pull out some activity that's been going
on in the community and really highlight it.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:08.790
So, for me, last week we had an event here
in London called DevFest London, which is

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.990
run by local Google developer group, which
is awesome to meet up with a bunch of Android

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.409
developers as well as one of my favorite Android
designers, called Marie Schweiz, who was over

00:28:17.409 --> 00:28:21.480
from Berlin, who draws lots of cute Androids
and was going around the Hackathon prettying

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.620
up everyone's applications.

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.320
So that was really awesome.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.259
But out there in the design world, I also
wanted to call out an excellent blog post

00:28:28.259 --> 00:28:32.419
I saw last week from Juhani of AndroidUIPatterns.com.

00:28:32.419 --> 00:28:34.750
It's a fantastic blog.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:39.679
He did a great job of putting together a bunch
of community tools which have been out there,

00:28:39.679 --> 00:28:45.549
put out there for helping you to customize
the Holo controls as well as using the assets

00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:52.649
you go to create a Holo-looking icon and the
action bar generating studio to customize

00:28:52.649 --> 00:28:53.649
your action bars.

00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:57.460
So, he did a really, really nice post pulling
those three brilliant tools together, showing

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.380
how you can use them in conjunction to customize
your app.

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.870
So check out AndroidUIPatterns.com for that
post.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.039
&gt;&gt;Adam: Excellent.

00:29:05.039 --> 00:29:10.889
And this is not really new news this week,
but something I just did wanna quickly mention

00:29:10.889 --> 00:29:14.710
is the draw pattern, which is becoming very
popular recently.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.169
For those of you who don't know, there actually
is a section up on the design site.

00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:24.809
It's under the action bar page which has some
information on our best practices around implementing

00:29:24.809 --> 00:29:27.900
a draw, how it should work.

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.330
If you are building draws out there, I would
encourage you to look at that and try and

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:37.120
follow those guidelines before everyone implements
this pattern and does it differently.

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.500
It would be good to standardize around that.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.990
We don't have any code samples out at the
moment for the best practice pattern, but

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:48.190
at least the design site's been updated with
some information there.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:52.650
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I'd say for the major takeaway
for the draw pattern is look at the YouTube

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:53.990
application, is the best way right now.

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:55.450
The best example we have is implementation.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.450
&gt;&gt;Adam: Yep.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.470
&gt;&gt;Nick: So, our advice is that the draw shouldn't
move the action bar, 'cause that's such an

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:05.060
important anchor in your application, that
you shouldn't be really shifting that in and

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.060
out of the way.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.919
And the draw should come from underneath that.

00:30:09.919 --> 00:30:13.679
And also the draw should only be available
from top-level navigation items.

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:17.920
So, once you go down in your view hierarchy,
you shouldn't have instant access to it or

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:21.409
else it just ends up as like a bag of links
rather than having any kind of structure to

00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:22.409
it.

00:30:22.409 --> 00:30:25.130
So those are my major takeaways and tips for
implementing your draw patterns.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:26.130
&gt;&gt;Adam: Fantastic.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.130
Alright.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.480
Well, we're out of time.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.710
Thanks for tuning in and we'll see you next
week.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.929
See you guys.

00:30:37.929 --> 00:30:41.419
&gt;&gt;Nick: Cheers.

00:30:41.419 --> 00:30:43.159
Bye.
