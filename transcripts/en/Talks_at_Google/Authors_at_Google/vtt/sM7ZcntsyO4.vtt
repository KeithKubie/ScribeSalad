00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.030
JON SKEET: So good afternoon.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.820
We hadn't met before
this afternoon,

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.830
but we've had a
very productive hour

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.050
and a half getting
to know each other

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.960
and talking with other Googlers.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.870
But my guess is that
most of you won't yet

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.790
have read Catherine's book.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.590
So I wonder if you
could start off just

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.100
by telling us a bit about
the book itself and I guess

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.750
what made you write
it in the first place.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.360
CATHERINE MAYER: With pleasure.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.660
And I hate to start
by contradicting you.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.020
But of course, we
haven't met in person.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.336
But we know each other online.

00:00:48.336 --> 00:00:50.210
And one of the things
that's been interesting

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.240
is we've been having ongoing
discussions about gender

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.840
equality and the difficulties
of reaching it online.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.670
And the reason I wrote this
book was because I couldn't--

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.890
I went out looking
for a book that

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.770
would tell me the things
that are in this book,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.850
and I couldn't find it.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.770
So I wanted to find a
book that would tell me

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.900
where the debate was now
that would possibly explain

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.480
to me what the different
waves of feminism

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.160
were but, much more importantly,
would explain how it was

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.735
that here we were in this
century, in this year,

00:01:31.735 --> 00:01:33.860
and that there is still
nowhere in the world that's

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.830
gender-equal and what
were the mechanisms that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.870
were holding women back.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.180
And I went to look for a
book that had all of that,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.260
and I couldn't find it.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.690
So I started thinking that
maybe I'd better write it.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.110
There's another twist to that
story that I may get to later.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.290
But then there was
another missing element

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.710
that I didn't realize until I
was already writing the book.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.370
And this was in May 2016.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.530
The political party
that I founded--

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.450
the Women's Equality Party--

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.550
ran its first-ever elections
for the London Assembly,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.790
for the Welsh Assembly, and
for the Scottish Parliament.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.160
And when I was out
canvassing on the doorstep,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.020
I discovered that perhaps one
of the reasons that we had not

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.060
made faster progress
to gender equality

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.340
was because people didn't
know what it looked like

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.170
or what it would be like.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.860
There was nowhere in the
world you could point and say,

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.130
of course we want to
be in this society,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.130
because what a
lovely place it is.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.060
And in fact, people
had ideas about it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.500
that were all about repression.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.900
They were all about a
place that would enforce

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.370
some kind of gender neutrality,
rather than diversity,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.290
and that would censor and ban.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.900
And I thought, no, no, that's
not what we're working for.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.720
And then there were
also questions about,

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.650
would a gender-equal world
be more equal in other ways?

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.820
Would a gender-equal world just
simply replicate the world that

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.090
we have now, but have some women
with big shoulder pads who were

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.950
just taking the place
of the men and--

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.600
JON SKEET: The
eponymous 50 foot women.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.350
CATHERINE MAYER: Well, possibly.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.280
So again, I felt that needed
to be in some way described.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.860
And I realized I had a really
clear idea of what I thought

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.320
a gender-equal world
would be, but maybe I'd

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.290
better try and find a
way of telling people.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.520
So in this book, I not
only label the mechanisms

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.740
that hold women back,
but I then take you

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.650
on a tour of a gender-equal
world that I call Equalia.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.360
Though yesterday, I was
interviewed on the BBC,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.170
and the interviewer told
me that it was Equalia

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.090
and that that was
BBC pronunciation.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.851
And who am I to gainsay the BBC?

00:03:49.851 --> 00:03:52.100
JON SKEET: Well, it's nice
that they've considered it.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.974
CATHERINE MAYER: Yes.

00:03:52.974 --> 00:03:55.530
JON SKEET: So you sort
of dropped in there

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.290
"the political party
that I founded."

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.000
Now I'm sure most of us have
founded political parties?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.840
Any-- no?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.600
No?

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.040
You describe how
you accidentally

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.485
founded a political party.

00:04:05.485 --> 00:04:07.009
Do you want to
tell us that story?

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:09.050
CATHERINE MAYER: Well,
it's not dissimilar to why

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.920
I wrote the book.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.620
I have a habit, if I can't
find something I want,

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.280
of creating it instead.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.041
So in 2015, there's a
fantastic festival--

00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:20.540
I don't know if any
of you know it--

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.430
called the Women of the
World Festival, WOW,

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.290
at the Southbank Center.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.660
And I went to that festival.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.180
And there was an event
about women in politics.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.650
And it was involving
three fantastic female MPs

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.960
from the three
biggest old parties--

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.570
or at the time,
biggest old parties--

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.540
the Conservatives,
Labor, and the Lib Dems.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.320
And I was listening to
women talking in the cafe

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.120
before that event,
and they were all

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.040
saying that they
were so disillusioned

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.540
with the political
parties that they

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.490
weren't going to vote at all.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.950
And the idea of women not
voting when we are not even yet

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.670
at the 100-year celebration
of the partial enfranchisement

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.550
of women was one I found
deeply distressing.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.030
But it also made me think
about how very depressed

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.760
I was with mainstream
politics, as somebody

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.700
who has, both as a journalist,
covered politics for the best

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:20.310
part of 30 years, but also been
politically active and engaged.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.117
And yet, I didn't feel
any of those parties

00:05:22.117 --> 00:05:22.950
were speaking to me.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.700
And I thought that they were all
talking about gender equality

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.350
but not delivering it.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:34.880
And so at this meeting,
when the Q and A opened up,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.050
I got to my feet.

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.880
And I said to the politicians
on stage how much more excited

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.790
we would all be if one
of them, or all of them,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.230
were the leaders
of their parties.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.300
And the room sort of erupted.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.530
And I said, but you're
not, and maybe we

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.580
need to think about ways to
create change within politics.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.000
And I'd been watching UKIP.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.180
And it was really clear to
me that the main parties,

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.090
in seeing UKIP
gaining popularity,

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.010
instead of challenging
its positions

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.140
were trying to make
themselves more like UKIP.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.930
So I said, what about if we
do the same thing for gender

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:13.860
equality?

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.410
What if we found a
women's equality party

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.290
and we proved that gender
equality is a vote winner?

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.470
Will those big parties start
trying to make themselves

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.340
more in that image?

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.010
And I said, anyway, if
anyone wants to discuss it,

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.870
I'll be in the bar,
which got taken

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.220
to be an invitation to everyone
to join me at the bar, which

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.920
could have been really
expensive And indeed,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.960
given what's happened
to my life since,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.500
was very expensive,
because also then,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.660
by the time I got
home, social media had

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.530
decided not that I was
saying might it be an idea--

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:50.348
[PHONE RINGING]

00:06:50.348 --> 00:06:52.300
Oh.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.240
--might it be an idea to
found a party, but saying I

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.040
was going to found a party.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.420
And then the final bit to
this story is that I rang--

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.120
many of you may know
who Sandi Toksvig is.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:13.200
She's a fantastic journalist,
presenter, comedian, writer.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.220
She can do everything.

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.510
She's also a really good cook
and baker, and it's amazing.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.260
But she and I had been on the
founding committee of the WOW

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:22.860
Festival.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.670
And we had been talking
for a while about how

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.820
frustrated we were at the
slow progress towards gender

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.430
equality.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:33.570
So I rang her up and said,
this thing's happened

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.030
and people think I'm
starting this party.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.930
And instead of saying,
that's interesting,

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.365
she said, but that's my idea.

00:07:41.365 --> 00:07:42.990
And I said, what are
you talking about?

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:46.140
And she said, at the
end of WOW every year,

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.960
she does something called
"Mirth Control," which

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.420
is a fantastic finale.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.250
And she was
intending to showcase

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.310
a women's party and a sort
of women's government.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.030
And she said, Darling, would you
like to be foreign secretary?

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:07.920
So that sort of set us off
on this very interesting

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.350
experiment to see
whether you can start

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.480
a party that will do this.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.130
And the answer
appears to be yes,

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.460
because we now have 65,000
members and registered

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.955
supporters and more than
70 branches across the UK.

00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:21.830
JON SKEET: Fantastic.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.660
And I have to say,
I'm a member myself--

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.990
--which is how all of
this today came about.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:35.130
So you mentioned
there being a lack

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.640
of a vision for what a
gender-equal world would be

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.600
and also that when
you spoke with people

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.380
before the proposition of
the Women's Equality party

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.690
that current political parties
weren't doing politics in a way

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.480
that's engaged.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.830
Do you get the feeling
there was a vision for what

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:01.440
more engaging politics
would look like at all?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.640
And does that-- slightly
leading question as well.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.040
You mentioned that you were
taking some ideas for UKIP.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.759
But I know personally
that I don't

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:12.300
think the Women's Equality party
really works in the same way

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.274
as UKIP, other than the
idea of taking votes.

00:09:17.274 --> 00:09:18.690
CATHERINE MAYER:
Well, there is, I

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:21.750
hope, another parallel with
UKIP, which is, whatever you

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:26.730
think of them, they have proved
that a party with extremely

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.190
small amounts of
elected representation

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.710
can create seismic
political change.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.710
Now I observed that before
the Brexit referendum.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.130
But at their peak, they have
never had more than two MPs.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:43.470
And yet, they have changed the
course of this country totally.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:47.100
So I'm saying, we can
do this in a benign way.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.460
In that sense, we can be like
UKIP, not in any other sense

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.040
that I can think of.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:59.040
But I would say-- well, there is
one other way in which they may

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.050
have, at times, been better.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.620
And that is in actually
understanding who their voters

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.310
were and talking to their voters
and engaging on grassroots

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.820
level, because one of the things
about mainstream politics--

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.670
and it's interesting sitting
in Google's headquarters

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.210
and talking about this-- but
the digital revolution has had

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.450
a very interesting effect on
mainstream politics, which is,

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.230
quite a lot of people have
retreated into a sphere where

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.920
they don't actually go
out and talk that much--

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.380
where they substitute
the digital interaction

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.350
for the real interaction.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.830
But that's part of a much
bigger process that's going on.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.630
And I don't actually want to
entirely blame the mainstream

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.410
parties for what's
happening, because also,

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:48.420
part of the digital
revolution is

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.290
a loss of trust in public
institutions, public bodies--

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.030
a kind of rapid cycling of so
many things that are going on.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.920
And it's creating crises.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.900
And it's creating turbulence.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.050
But one of the things, I
guess, that happened with us

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:05.940
is that we saw in
that turbulence

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.550
a possibility of
beneficial change,

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.820
as well as the dangers
that you see around you.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.980
And so we leapt into the
space that that was creating

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.282
that wasn't there before.

00:11:18.282 --> 00:11:19.740
And there's something
else I'd say,

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.970
which is, the political
system in this country

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:30.720
is a very, very bad one in
terms of letting in newcomers,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.100
in terms of preserving things
that are dead and should

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.090
have been cleared away.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.717
So that's another reason
the mainstream parties

00:11:39.717 --> 00:11:40.800
have got the way they are.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.110
They're protected
but also damaged

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:47.280
by a system that allows them
to assume that they own votes

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.860
rather than having to
go out and earn them

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:53.400
and that allows them
to resist change

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.610
and is also incredibly good
at keeping out women in ways

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.830
that I try and
explain in the book

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.860
and that were, in some
ways, revelatory for me.

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.530
Even though I'd covered
politics for 30 years,

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.480
I had no idea how
bloody expensive

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.730
it was until we
started doing it.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.050
And how that works and
how that keeps out women--

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.590
there's a lot I've
learned in these years.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.930
JON SKEET: So I
think we understand

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.000
that the Women's
Equality party is not

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.290
going to be like other parties.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.970
We've said that we
wish to disband,

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.580
which most political parties
aren't ready to disband

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:30.980
as soon as the job's done.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.460
Are there any other
ways where you

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.000
think that the Women's
Equality party is really

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.700
showing a way forward that
other political parties could

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.876
take on?

00:12:39.876 --> 00:12:41.250
CATHERINE MAYER:
I would hope so.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.800
Being collaborative,
I think everybody

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:46.260
is really sick of
the politics that you

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.860
see that prime
minister's "Question

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.470
Time" at Westminster
typifies, which

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.110
is that punch-up that you have.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.140
And I was actually
watching it today.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.220
And there wasn't
one moment where

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.860
the prime minister or the
leader of the opposition

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.680
actually engaged and debated.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.100
What they did was they tried
to score points off each other.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.720
And it is really clear that
one of the reasons people

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.790
were being turned off
by politics and not

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.850
voting is because for women--

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.960
but for a lot of
people in general--

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.070
they cannot see themselves
in this kind of shouty,

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.280
"you have to be exactly
like this" form of politics.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.730
And they want something more
pragmatic, more collaborative,

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:37.990
something that gets things done.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.850
They understand that it's
very hard to find something

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:44.940
where you're going to agree
with every single opinion

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.860
of a party, particularly
one of the ones

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.070
that is trying to
legislate for absolutely

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.520
everything in the world.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.700
But that shouldn't be
a reason, therefore,

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.990
to dismiss the good
things that are happening.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.721
So people want to find ways
of looking at the good things

00:13:58.721 --> 00:13:59.720
and moving them forward.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.540
And the old parties
and the old system

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.610
entirely mitigates against that.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.950
So practical things we did--

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.650
we started by saying,
we are collaborative.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:14.010
We open our membership to
members of other parties, which

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.440
no other party does.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.890
We also said, we are
not left or right.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.770
We are a nonpartisan
political party.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.900
The fight for gender
equality, which

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.780
is very often thought to
be a preserve of the left,

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.140
is too precious to
be allowed ownership

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.560
of a part of the spectrum
that is not doing enough

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.600
to move it on.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.630
And anyway, there are vast
areas of common ground

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.550
that we can identify
that don't fall

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.980
into that left-right spectrum.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:50.550
And we also invited the other
parties either to work with us

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.370
or to steal our policies.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.090
And one of the very
first things we did

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:57.390
is we started going, look,
here's a bright, shiny policy.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.320
Please come and take it.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.100
So I don't think people do that.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:07.740
And I'm going to point over at
this woman sitting here who--

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:12.720
Halla Gunnarsdottir is our head
of policy and partnerships.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.640
And as you might
guess from the name,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.940
Icelandic and was part of
the Icelandic government

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:26.280
that came in after the 2008
crash and did amazing things.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.460
And we have been learning
from Halla's experience.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.219
But we've also together been
finding ways of doing things

00:15:34.219 --> 00:15:35.010
really differently.

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.300
So we have got a way of
selecting our steering

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.500
committee, for example,
that no other party does.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.630
We do some traditional things.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.350
We vote in some of the members
through our party conference.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.550
We appoint some of the members.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:54.360
But we also have a complete
random draw of the membership.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.180
And she got to ring up
people and go, hello,

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.660
you have been selected to sit
on our steering committee.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:06.150
And apparently, a couple of
them declined that opportunity.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.190
But everybody else
very eagerly joined.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:12.585
And it's an interesting way of
making politics more porous,

00:16:12.585 --> 00:16:14.970
of bringing people in.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:17.010
All the candidates
we've run have

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.590
been people who have
never stood before

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:24.720
and probably would never
have got through the--

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.790
they'd have got through
selection processes

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.190
at the end of them,
because they were

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:33.180
incredibly able candidates.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.730
But they would not
have been able to go

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.950
through the processes
that you need to go,

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:40.410
in order to reach
those committees, which

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:42.480
involve a lot of time-serving.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:49.200
And for women-- women so often
have caring duties, one way

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:49.800
or the other.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:55.370
And for them, it would
have been an impossibility.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.000
And so another thing
that we're doing

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.520
is we raised bursaries
for candidates

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.470
who can't afford to run.

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:05.193
And we raise money for
childcare costs for candidates.

00:17:05.193 --> 00:17:07.109
JON SKEET: I think one
of the wonderful things

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:09.480
we've seen since the
Women's March in January

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.290
is in the US, huge numbers
of women, who would never

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.420
have thought of
standing for office,

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.790
now enrolling with the
various organizations, which

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.069
can support them
in a different way.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:22.530
But I've certainly found
that very, very exciting.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:22.859
CATHERINE MAYER: I know.

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:24.358
It's one of the
really funny things.

00:17:24.358 --> 00:17:26.640
It's like, I don't
want to sound like I'm

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.550
grateful to Donald
Trump for anything,

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.650
and I really don't
think we should be.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:38.400
But that election did
something important, which

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.670
was, when we first
started the party,

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.560
the thing that we
most frequently heard

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.490
is, surely a party like
yours isn't necessary.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.250
Surely you already
have gender equality.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.540
You've got the Equal Pay Act.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:53.070
What more do you want?

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.010
And as soon as Donald
Trump was elected,

00:17:57.010 --> 00:17:59.310
we had people coming up
to us in the street going,

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:01.380
how fast can you fix things?

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.980
So I think the spirit of
the Women's March is--

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:13.350
we are in a period of
new energy and activism.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.890
And actually, we're now
rolling out, we call it,

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.880
the fifth wave--

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.300
we think there's a fifth wave
of feminism that's starting.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.850
But we're going to be
running activism camps

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.430
not just for members of
the Women's Equality party,

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.370
but for anybody who
wants to learn what

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.442
to do with all their
energy, because that

00:18:31.442 --> 00:18:32.400
was the other question.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.160
People coming up is like, this
is terrible, but what do I do?

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.750
And so now this is our answer
is like, come and learn

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.597
what you can do.

00:18:41.597 --> 00:18:43.180
JON SKEET: So one
of the things that I

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:49.090
found sort of selfishly
pleasant in the book

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:50.740
was in one of the
chapters where you

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.370
talk about difficult topics--
pornography and prostitution.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:58.990
And you say you went into
a meeting with strong views

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.690
in one way and came out
with lots of questions

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.990
and thinking maybe that
wasn't the right way

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:07.690
or even that a
different way was right.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.320
And me, as a novice feminist,
I get confused a lot.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:17.680
And my guess is that when a
lot of these new activists

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.790
come along, there
will be heated debates

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:24.280
about all kinds
of topics where we

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.260
may agree that
something is wrong,

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.096
but not agree on the
best way forward.

00:19:28.096 --> 00:19:29.470
Have you learned
anything you can

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:33.040
share about how that can
be done most productively

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.870
and what the dangers are?

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:39.760
CATHERINE MAYER: I guess one
of the most interesting things

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.630
for me, in terms of trying
to build a movement that

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:47.680
was as broad and diverse
and inclusive as possible,

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.470
was how easily even
ideas about inclusivity

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.130
can prove anything but and can
actually start being things

00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.900
that people argue about.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:04.720
And it is a constant
frustration, to me,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.750
how splintered the women's
movement can become,

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.030
because divide and rule
is a very real thing.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.850
And so what we're
doing is trying

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.994
to do exactly the opposite.

00:20:13.994 --> 00:20:15.910
And what I was trying
to do with this book is,

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.640
there are some areas that
are really difficult.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.990
And when I say I came out of
that meeting with questions,

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.930
I'm still finding my way
through some of these things.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:31.210
And it's because I think
90% of what we need to do

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:34.510
is really straightforward
and really self-evident.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:38.530
And the shocking thing about
the lack of gender equality

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.830
is that everybody knows
that we need to do things.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:47.440
Everybody knows things like
that diversity in businesses--

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.600
the way through from
the top to the bottom--

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.610
actually makes those
businesses better.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.390
Everybody knows that
increased female participation

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.810
in the economy makes
the economy more vibrant

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.900
and, therefore, is good for
everyone, not just for women.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.290
People know those things.

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.100
And yet, they still don't
do enough to get to them.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.910
But there are a few issues
that are much more complicated

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.800
and where actually
there isn't necessarily

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.380
a clean and perfect solution.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.580
And those tend to
be ones where we

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.240
can spend way too much energy
fighting when actually, there

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.770
are, I think, ways
of talking about it

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.020
and ways of coming through it.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.394
And that's one of the things
I've tried to do to the book

00:21:28.394 --> 00:21:33.370
is I haven't shied away
from any of the most hotly

00:21:33.370 --> 00:21:37.360
contested areas of debate.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.765
But I have admitted the
areas where I don't know

00:21:40.765 --> 00:21:43.830
or where it's been
difficult for me,

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:48.370
in an attempt to
try and move things

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:53.830
on from that sort
of thing that says,

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.860
this person has one
opinion I don't agree with.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.510
I agree with all of the
rest of these opinions,

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.080
but because they hold
that one opinion,

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.900
I'm going to put
them out of my life.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:08.500
And that is something
that happens too often.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:16.660
And to make this change, we
need as many people as possible

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.520
on board for it.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:23.780
And I hate the phrase "bigger
picture," but in this case,

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.680
we really need to see
the bigger picture.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.510
JON SKEET: Right.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.750
You mentioned diversity
and boards and women

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.730
in business, in general.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:39.580
One of the things that
hasn't been resolved for me

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.350
is, I think it's
fairly straightforward

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:49.240
to see how if you take a board
that's got 20 men and no women

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:53.470
or 18 men, two women,
adding women to that mix

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.800
is clearly going to help
in terms of diversity

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.570
of life experience and things.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:02.500
What's less clear to me is
if you have a board that--

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:04.979
I think there are probably
remarkably few examples

00:23:04.979 --> 00:23:06.520
of this-- but if
you had a board that

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.610
had 17 women and
three men, is it

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.150
that women are naturally
better for boards?

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:19.830
You mentioned in the book being
less risk-taking, for example,

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.170
in ways that would
have discouraged

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.480
the financial
crisis, for example,

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:29.130
in which case, maybe a 20 women,
no men board is for the best.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.611
Or is it actually
the diversity that's

00:23:31.611 --> 00:23:34.110
the most important thing, which
can, of course, be diversity

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.305
of all manner of things?

00:23:36.305 --> 00:23:37.680
CATHERINE MAYER:
So you know when

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.930
you said as a novice
feminist, you sometimes

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:41.535
get yourself in trouble?

00:23:41.535 --> 00:23:43.170
You're not in trouble,
I promise you.

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.480
But you used the word
"naturally" in there.

00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:51.170
And the word "naturally"
is one of the concepts that

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:55.050
is a difficult one, because
we have no idea what

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.020
men and women would
be if we were freed

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:02.880
from the constraints of the
socialization of the upbringing

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.600
that we have that tells us what
gendered roles are and tries

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.910
to impose them, in some cases.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.480
And so one of the things
I also do in the book

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.670
is I look at the science.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.210
And I poke at these ideas.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:23.820
The person who said that if
Lehman Brothers had been Lehman

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.340
Sisters, it might
not have collapsed

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.480
was Christine Lagarde,
the head of the IMF.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.010
She did say she was
joking when she said that,

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:35.250
but there are a lot of
people who think that women

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.260
are more risk-averse.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.020
And there is some research
that suggests that.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:45.300
But whether women are naturally
more risk-averse or whether--

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:49.050
as in whether this is
a biological thing,

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:52.890
that's a whole other thing.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:59.260
And actually, research on
this is moving all the time.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:03.630
But what remains absolutely
stable to your point

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:06.780
is that diversity is
incredibly important,

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.560
and diversity meaning
not just people

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.360
who look different
or sound different,

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.550
but bring different
perspectives and make

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:16.210
each other uncomfortable.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.370
What isn't good is
people in the room

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.440
who all feel so
cozy with each other

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.570
that they don't
challenge each other.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.270
And then they get into
dangers of group think.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:30.920
And that's where you see the
great corporate disasters is

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.800
you look and go, how on
Earth did this decision ever

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:35.730
get made?

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.560
And the answer is
that nobody spoke up,

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.740
because they were all used
to being nice to each other

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.230
and reinforcing it.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:47.040
But to give you an example
that's a sort of obvious gender

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.430
one, in terms of
then the absence

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:54.210
of female representation at
decision making in politics--

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.360
the very famous thing about
treating sanitary items

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.580
as a luxury item.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:05.370
No room that had women in
it, or enough women in it,

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.500
would think that
sanitary items could

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.470
be classed as a luxury item.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:15.270
And that's, again, the dangers
of decision making if you only

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:17.580
have men around the table.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:21.630
JON SKEET: She evokes the
picture of Donald Trump signing

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:22.620
around women's health.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:25.590
CATHERINE MAYER: Or
indeed yesterday, there

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:29.670
was a picture from Saudi
Arabia of a new girls council,

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:33.690
and it was all men,
the girls council.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.900
JON SKEET: I'm sure I've seen
similar equality commissions

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.432
and things in the UK somewhere.

00:26:38.432 --> 00:26:40.140
CATHERINE MAYER: Well,
I joked on Twitter

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.880
that I'm going to
start a game show.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.880
And it's going to be
called "Cherchez La Femme."

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:50.120
JON SKEET: I think
we should explore

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.890
where things can be better.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.940
And this is where we may wish
to bring in Halla, talking

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.292
about Iceland.

00:26:59.292 --> 00:27:00.750
Rather than me give
the background,

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.190
why don't you give
the background

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.335
for what Iceland has done
and where they are now?

00:27:05.335 --> 00:27:06.960
CATHERINE MAYER:
Well, the thing that's

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.870
really interesting about
Iceland is for seven years,

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.990
they've been top of the
World Economic Forum's

00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:16.920
global rankings of
gender equality.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.300
And it is, in many
ways, a country

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.340
that deserves that ranking.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.730
But again, it shows you how
far we still have to go,

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:29.490
if you realize that they still
have a really big gender pay

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.530
gap there.

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:34.410
Halla can speak to
these experiences

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.140
with more authority.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.310
She can speak to most
things with authority.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.950
One of the jokes
I make in the book

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:44.054
is, Nordic women have missed the
memo that tells them to soften

00:27:44.054 --> 00:27:45.220
the edges of their opinions.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.550
But it's one of the
great things about--

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:55.680
the Nordic countries
are all ahead of the UK

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.390
on gender equality.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.160
And one of the ways
in which you notice

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.430
it is that women find
ways of talking that

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:08.640
are not as apologetic as we
are acculturated to be here.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.750
So I, for years, worked in
various management levels

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.300
in journalism.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:19.230
And I would find myself kind of
trying to let men in the room

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.180
think that the opinion
had come from them

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.810
rather than me or the
idea to get it through.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.330
And it's something you were
actually semi-trained to do,

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.490
which, in the end, is unhelpful.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.400
And it's wonderfully
bracing to be

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.330
around women who speak
their minds more directly.

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:43.500
But one of the things that
was most interesting to me--

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.220
I felt I had to go and spend
time in Iceland for this book.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.412
And Halla fixed up
for me basically

00:28:49.412 --> 00:28:51.120
to meet the whole of
Iceland, because she

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.270
knows the whole of Iceland.

00:28:54.270 --> 00:28:57.592
And when she hadn't fixed up
for me to meet people, I'd go in

00:28:57.592 --> 00:28:59.550
and they'd go, do you
know Halla Gunnarsdottir?

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:02.100
Yeah.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:06.450
But what I hadn't realized--

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:12.510
I knew that they had had this
famous Women's Day Off in 1975.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:17.460
And 90% of Icelandic
women took the day

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.160
off from paid and unpaid work.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:23.820
And I'd assumed that that had
been the start of Ireland's--

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:31.080
Iceland's journey to gender
equality, because it had

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:32.670
galvanized the women.

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.560
It was only when I got
there that I realized

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.770
that it is a nation where
the men are all on board

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.760
with the project in a way that
I really wish was true here.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.090
And I'm afraid I was
slightly whinging to John

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:49.950
before I came in that I'm going
round talking about my book

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.620
at the moment, or I'd go
around talking about the party,

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.120
and we'd get these great crowds.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:56.100
But there are not enough men.

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.560
I'm really pleased
to see the men here.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.980
But the idea that we should be
having these conversations as

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.590
if these were women's
issues rather than things

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:08.520
that affect all of us-- men need
to be in these conversations.

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.090
And in Iceland, men are
in these conversations.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:15.360
And so I came back really
excited about the Women's Day

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:16.227
Off.

00:30:16.227 --> 00:30:18.060
And I came running into
the office and went,

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.070
we have to do it here,
we have to do it here.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:24.660
So we're working to organize
a Women's Day Off in 2018

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.850
where we need 90%--

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:31.350
we just need 90% of women
in this country to stop work

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.110
for all or part of the day.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:35.380
And we're trying to
work out how to do it.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:45.490
But yeah, when I talk
about the gaps in Iceland,

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:47.040
you see those very clearly.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:51.990
But I'm right, aren't I,
that Icelandic men are more

00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:53.700
with the program than men here.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:58.478
You've lived here long
enough to feel that.

00:30:58.478 --> 00:31:00.850
HALLA GUNNARSDOTTIR: Yeah.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:04.212
So yes, they are
more [? empowered. ?]

00:31:04.212 --> 00:31:05.670
And I think there
are conversations

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:09.840
that I have here that I haven't
had in Iceland for a long time.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.290
So it was almost like
starting over again,

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.960
because I got involved
with Icelandic Women's

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:22.140
Movement in the late '90s
and early this century.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.630
And then some of
the conversations

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.210
that I'm having here
now are just exactly

00:31:27.210 --> 00:31:32.550
the same conversations.
and even from before

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.380
that-- so even from
times that I didn't

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:38.200
engage with this conversation,
was too young to do so.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.830
And there are issues
here that I feel

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:42.570
Iceland and most of
the Nordic countries

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:45.670
have solved very long time ago.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:53.250
And that includes child care
and shared parental leave.

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.180
And these are probably
the two policies

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.710
that the Women's
Equality party has

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:02.600
that would significantly
change the state of play

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.830
here in the UK.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:09.090
And almost overnight-- a system
of truly serious parental leave

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:14.630
where there is a "use it or
lose it" proportion for men,

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.540
for fathers--

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.490
it changes everything
overnight, because that

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:22.047
means that they start
taking the time off

00:32:22.047 --> 00:32:23.130
to be with their children.

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.700
It means that employers
know that dads can

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.330
disappear just as well as moms.

00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:32.810
And they're even more of a
risk, because they can have kids

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.460
until they're like 97.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.820
There's a certain time where
women don't have children

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.320
anymore.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.850
And I get a lot of
questions here in the UK,

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:45.805
often from women,
who say, I'm not

00:32:45.805 --> 00:32:47.180
planning on having
children, what

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.860
does this have to do with me?

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.290
And my answer is,
everything, because this

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:57.050
impacts all women and, of
course, all men as well.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.230
Women in a certain
age probably know

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:02.630
that-- that it impacts
the opportunities we have,

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.480
the potential salaries that
we may have, and so on.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:10.540
So it's this understanding
of women's issues

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.410
as not only
something-- like what

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:14.340
does this have to do
with me as an individual,

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.410
but those are a
collective thing.

00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:19.220
And I feel in
Iceland that we are

00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.810
in a different place for that.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:25.482
But of course, as you
say, it's no utopia.

00:33:25.482 --> 00:33:27.440
And none of the Nordic
countries are a utopia--

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.180
far from it.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.880
There's still high rates of
gender-based violence, which

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:35.870
I think is probably the most
significant manifestation

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:38.960
of women's inequality.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:41.690
But there are some things that
I think can be learned from.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:43.315
And the Women's Day
Off is one of them.

00:33:43.315 --> 00:33:47.260
So I hope all of you join
us in making that happen.

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:50.730
JON SKEET: So I guess to wrap
two previous topics into one,

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:54.480
you've said that you want more
men to show up, basically,

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.842
physically to events, but also
in terms of gender equality--

00:33:58.842 --> 00:34:01.050
CATHERINE MAYER: Am I allowed
to say I want every man

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:02.460
to read that book as well?

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.680
JON SKEET: Yes, absolutely.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.600
CATHERINE MAYER:
Because a lot of men

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:12.190
don't get why it has to
do with them, that point.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:14.280
And so one of the things
I would really hope--

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.350
and this is a rare man.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:17.550
He's read my book.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:18.810
Hurrah.

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.600
JON SKEET: It is
only out for a week.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.340
So that's fairly rare.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.230
CATHERINE MAYER: So I said I
might get to another story.

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:30.239
So I actually sort of wrote
this book by accident as well,

00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:34.739
even though I was explaining I
did it because it didn't exist.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.739
The last book that I
wrote was a bestseller.

00:34:37.739 --> 00:34:40.770
And when you have a
bestseller, what happens

00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.620
is publishers come to you and
say, what's your next book?

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:46.440
And they were all trying to get
me to write a book for them.

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:51.227
And I said, I'd like
to write a biography.

00:34:51.227 --> 00:34:53.310
And they were really
pleased, because my last book

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.620
had been a biography, and
that was a bestseller.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.660
And then I said,
of Angela Merkel,

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:00.660
and their faces fell
like, she's boring,

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.790
we're not interested in her.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:08.690
And Angela Merkel is most
definitely not boring.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.270
She is one of the most
important political leaders

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.280
of my lifetime.

00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:16.320
And at the point where
I was proposing it,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:19.710
it would have been significantly
ahead of this election where,

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:22.170
of course, who knows
whether she's going to be in

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.680
later this year or not.

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:30.510
And then eventually, they
were coming back to me

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:33.010
and saying, well, because it's
you, we'll make you an offer.

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:36.120
But they were offering me
really low money for it.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:41.880
And the money they offer is
based on the expected sales.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:46.830
And I had bucked the trend,
because I had, as a woman,

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.070
under a woman's name,
unlike JK Rowling,

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.900
I had written a book
that sold really well

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.420
to men, my last book.

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.840
And I had, as a woman,
written a biography of a man--

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.940
as it happens, Prince Charles.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.050
But that book sold
really well to men

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.910
and was by a woman about men.

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:08.110
That doesn't happen
in publishing.

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.210
And so the idea of a
woman with a woman's--

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:14.880
not hidden by initials-- not
C. Mayer, but Catherine Mayer

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:18.090
writing a book about a woman,
even though that woman was

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:22.800
the most important
political leader in Europe,

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:26.250
was, for the marketing
departments who did the number

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.370
crunching, was bad.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:30.840
And that's because men do
not buy books by women.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.460
And men are-- again, when
we talk about what's natural

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:39.480
and isn't, everything
in society tells you

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.610
that we're not
worth listening to.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:44.190
And there are all sorts
of famous statistics

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:48.000
about, if I've been
talking a lot--

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.130
hopefully because
you want me to--

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:54.600
but if a woman talks a quarter
of the amount of time of a man,

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.390
it is perceived by the
man to be already talking

00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.210
as much as the man.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.730
And in films, there's
all this stuff.

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:06.120
I have the statistics
in the book about films

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.350
where in a crowd scene
in a typical film,

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:13.020
it should be 50/50 in
a real world split.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:16.830
And instead, only 17% of
the crowds will be female.

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.270
In cartoons, everybody
tells you "Frozen"

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:24.300
is this wonderful feminist
cartoon by Disneyland.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:29.100
And it has two princesses
as the main characters.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.180
But they have only
43% of the dialogue.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:36.270
And the female
characters have 43%

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:38.640
of the dialogue, which is
good, by Disney standards,

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.040
because there's one that I
don't know how to pronounce.

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.440
I was told I was pronouncing
it wrong the other day.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.325
"Moulan," "Milan"--

00:37:44.325 --> 00:37:46.410
JON SKEET: "Mulan."

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:48.660
CATHERINE MAYER: Apparently
the dragon talks more

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.190
than the heroine--

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:51.300
the male dragon.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.020
And the heroine speaks less
than anyone else in the film.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:00.490
So this isn't stuff that's
being done on purpose.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:03.990
This is all this unconscious
bias playing out.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:07.470
But it plays out in
really profound ways.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.340
And so when I say, I really
want men to read this book,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.380
or I really want men
to come to meetings,

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:17.190
I really want men to engage with
the issues we're talking about,

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:21.210
because these are issues for
you that directly concern you.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:24.900
And yet, everything you were
told is that it doesn't-- that

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:26.100
it's women's issues.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:29.520
We put it in separate silos.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.040
So I kind of have a question
for everyone in the room,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.456
really, which is,
how do you think

00:38:33.456 --> 00:38:35.370
we should get men on board?

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:36.730
Sorry, just a small question.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.590
I know I'm supposed
to be answering them.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.140
JON SKEET: If you
raise your hand,

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.521
we can bring a mic around.

00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:43.770
Yes, that was a real question.

00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.188
That wasn't hypothetical.

00:38:45.188 --> 00:38:45.688
Anyone?

00:38:49.195 --> 00:38:50.570
AUDIENCE: I was
just saying, just

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.786
change the name of
the theme itself,

00:38:52.786 --> 00:38:54.410
because I think
sometimes just the name

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.960
itself kind of makes
them feel like they

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.500
are going for a specific--

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:02.870
they're supporting
that topic already.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:05.640
But maybe they just want to
have a general conversation

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.170
and just want to know more.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:11.220
So maybe that will be it.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.410
AUDIENCE: It's half a comment
and a half a question.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:14.800
I was just really interested.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:21.190
I'm a marketer as well, so
sorry, on behalf of my people.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:24.160
My question-- you said that
the marketing department were

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:29.260
fretting because men
don't buy women's books.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:31.140
Well, maybe they should
be better marketers.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:33.640
And maybe that's the challenge
we need to lay ourselves down

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.884
a bit more is, our
job as a mar-- well,

00:39:35.884 --> 00:39:38.050
the way I've always interpreted
my job as a marketer

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.330
is to make sure that
the audience access

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:42.190
things that will interest them.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:44.920
And if I'm a marketer, then
I'm simply not doing my job.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.670
And that's simply
not acceptable.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:50.120
So the marketers at those
publishers should be thinking,

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.550
how can I do this, not, this
product is unmarketable,

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:54.520
in my opinion.

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.260
CATHERINE MAYER:
I probably should

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.150
defend marketing
departments, only

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.880
in the sense that
what they're doing

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:06.280
is, when they have a book pitch,
they look the sales figures.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.320
Has there been another
book on this topic,

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:10.060
and how did it sell?

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:15.610
And there are reasons I explain
in the book for why people

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.170
underestimate Angela Merkel.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:18.730
And she's done it
on purpose as well.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:20.500
She doesn't actually
like you noticing

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.170
how interesting she is.

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:25.750
But the overall
trend of men thinking

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:28.770
that things that are by
women are not for them

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:30.710
is a huge trend.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.520
And I think that
there is definitely

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.220
in marketing a tendency to
say, well, this doesn't work,

00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:40.420
we already know this doesn't
work, so we won't do it.

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.700
So yes, I would hope that
marketing departments would

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:45.010
really start questioning
rather than saying,

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.800
this is conventional wisdom,
because conventional wisdom

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.710
is usually not wisdom.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:51.460
JON SKEET: Are these
marketing departments

00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.679
usually populated
by men or women?

00:40:53.679 --> 00:40:54.470
And does it matter?

00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:56.080
CATHERINE MAYER: It can be both.

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.420
One of the things
you must not assume

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:02.680
is that women are not
inculcated with the same ideas.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:06.880
And we saw that in
a very graphic way

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.650
with the results
of the US election

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.800
where although a
majority of black women

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.650
voted for Hillary Clinton,
the majority of white women

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:16.270
voted for Donald Trump.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:21.140
And again, something
I unpick in the book--

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:28.310
but yeah, we are the products
of the same cultural soups.

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:30.160
Sorry if that's a strange
way of putting it,

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.201
but you know what I mean.

00:41:31.201 --> 00:41:32.560
JON SKEET: So I think--

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.220
was there a--

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:41.440
Something you mentioned
right now is that--

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.270
the men I've been talking to
when I went to, say, evenings

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:49.360
that had women tech
makers, stuff like that,

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.750
where they didn't know they
were actually welcome there

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.210
or if when they
came there, women

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:57.370
would look at them like,
you're an intruder,

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:59.470
you're not supposed
to be part of this.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:02.120
So the invitations themselves--

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.470
also something that you said--

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.780
that the title can
be intimidating.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:13.410
And if there were special
sessions for male allies,

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:15.280
that they would
feel more invited.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:18.800
So I don't really know
how to solve this.

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:21.790
But this has been an issue with
the people I've talked to why

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.505
they don't go to these events.

00:42:24.505 --> 00:42:25.380
JON SKEET: Thank you.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.590
And just to speak
to that directly

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:30.200
from personal experience, I
joined the Women's Equality

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:32.930
party after reading an
interview in "The Guardian"

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:37.070
where it was made very, very,
very clear that men were

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:40.610
welcome and needed,
because equality is better

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:44.054
for everyone, as
our tagline goes.

00:42:44.054 --> 00:42:46.220
So yes, I think that does
definitely have an impact.

00:42:50.737 --> 00:42:51.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:52.680
That's so interesting.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:57.740
And I'm proudly married
to a male feminist.

00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.850
And we're raising two boys.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:03.060
And it's been a really
interesting experience,

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:06.495
because even just
things from reading

00:43:06.495 --> 00:43:08.250
all the traditional
storybooks, I

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:11.580
hadn't noticed before that I'm
reading to my two-year-old,

00:43:11.580 --> 00:43:14.640
indoctrinating this
male-dominated patriarchy,

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:18.760
which I hope is a world that
they won't grow up into.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.130
And intentionally,
my husband and I

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:25.290
have gone out and sought
almost specialist storybooks

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:28.050
that feature strong
women characters in them

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:30.185
to make sure that--

00:43:30.185 --> 00:43:32.100
and "Rosie Revere,
Engineer," if anyone's

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:35.560
interested in that
range of books.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:39.570
They're very exciting, but
they're not readily available.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.750
They're on special order
and all sorts of things.

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:48.810
I guess for me, part of
making women's equality more

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:51.570
of a reality is in how
I raise my children

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:57.450
and finding those opportunities
to grow little boy feminists.

00:43:57.450 --> 00:43:59.619
And it's not as easy
as I thought it would

00:43:59.619 --> 00:44:00.910
be to find those opportunities.

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:06.960
So I think making it clear
and making a clear choice

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.080
path for parents, I think, is an
important part of that mission

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:10.641
as well.

00:44:10.641 --> 00:44:13.140
CATHERINE MAYER: I think one
of the most interesting things,

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:16.530
when I was looking at the
science of sex and gender,

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:19.560
is the research that
shows how very early

00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:23.040
the gendered messaging
is going through--

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:26.130
the sort of pink and
blue binary that you get.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:30.980
So a lot of my
friends said to me,

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:34.992
oh, I didn't think that boys
and girls were necessarily

00:44:34.992 --> 00:44:37.200
that different and that it
was all culturally imposed

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.370
until I had my children.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.230
And then the moment
I had my children,

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.480
I realized, oh,
no, it's absolutely

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.770
from the moment they're born.

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:46.311
And actually, all the research
shows you that from the moment

00:44:46.311 --> 00:44:48.260
they're born, they are
getting those messages.

00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.490
So even people pick
up girl babies more

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.247
than they pick up boy babies.

00:44:52.247 --> 00:44:53.580
And they treat them differently.

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:57.450
And they've done all sorts of
very interesting experiments

00:44:57.450 --> 00:45:01.530
in dressing babies but in
a culture that makes people

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.580
think they're a different sex.

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:06.570
And they've done
experiments with monkeys

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:10.510
as well to try and find out
what it would look like.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:13.350
And then they realize that
monkey communities actually

00:45:13.350 --> 00:45:17.920
pass on gendered roles,
too, in interesting ways.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:24.810
So it's very, very hard
to avoid that messaging,

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.110
even for people who
are trying to bring up

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:30.570
their kids as feminists.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:36.810
But making that effort already
makes such a difference.

00:45:36.810 --> 00:45:39.150
And it is amazing
when you go back

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:43.650
to books and films that
were childhood favorites

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:46.220
and you haven't looked at
them since you were a child,

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:50.560
and then you look at them
and they're terrifying,

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.670
they're kind of propaganda.

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.120
And it's amazing.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.014
JON SKEET: And TV shows and
films and all of culture.

00:45:57.014 --> 00:45:57.930
CATHERINE MAYER: Yeah.

00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.820
Which is, by the way,
something I deal with in my--

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.380
let me pronounce
it in the BBC way--

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:03.880
Equalia.

00:46:07.380 --> 00:46:12.210
One of my questions in
terms of, do we actually

00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:15.960
have to censor and get rid of
this huge cultural heritage

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:19.540
in order to create and
maintain a gender-equal world?

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.140
And I think any
society that starts

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:24.750
destroying its cultural
heritage is, in fact,

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:26.100
veering into fascism.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.750
So the answer is, no.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.600
But you can see all
sorts of countries

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.170
where they have found ways to
contextualize what they have

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:35.610
and to treat it differently.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:40.830
So it's a very real issue.

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:42.930
And it's a very real impediment.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:46.650
And you just pick up
any newspaper any day

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:49.500
and you look for the
women in that newspaper.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.199
And you will very often
find an attractive woman

00:46:53.199 --> 00:46:53.990
on the front cover.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:56.190
I happened to see "The
Times" on the way here today.

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:57.870
And there was a
very nice picture

00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:59.450
of Angelina Jolie on the cover.

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:02.730
Now she's doing
something very important.

00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:04.809
But that's not why her
picture is on the cover,

00:47:04.809 --> 00:47:06.600
because it's a picture
of her on the cover.

00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.820
It is not a big story
about what she's doing

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.860
or a headline about
what she's doing,

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:14.130
which is the way a "men's
issue" would be treated

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:15.930
would be with the
headline and the story

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:19.080
and not much of a picture.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.630
The other women that
you will find in papers

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:24.390
are very often
victims rather than

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.670
having agency of their own.

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:30.270
So this everywhere
you look, it's

00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:32.430
really, really hard
to find something

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:35.010
where that isn't happening.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:41.700
And for parenting, I think
it is one of the absolutely

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:45.270
key issues, but dealable with.

00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:49.020
We can do this.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.610
JON SKEET: And just
to reassure you

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.170
that your experience of
finding children's books

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:56.110
is certainly not only
yours, there was a video--

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.780
I think Sophie may have
Tweeted it-- recently

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.990
of a mother and
daughter at a bookstore.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:03.940
And they took the
children's section

00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:05.710
and first removed
all the books that

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:07.100
didn't have any women in them.

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.410
And that was most of them.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.810
And then removed the
ones where women only

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.080
had tiny or didn't
say anything, and then

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.470
the ones that only served to
be princesses or whatever.

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:24.070
And it's just terrifying,
all of these things.

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:26.320
I think we're probably at
a stage of opening it up

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.880
for any other questions.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.740
So I will run the mic around.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.708
That's fine.

00:48:32.708 --> 00:48:34.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:35.610
Thank you so much.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:36.640
I have a question.

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.060
Imagine you're
the CEO of Google.

00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:42.840
How would you foster gender
equality in the world

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.717
if you had all the resources?

00:48:45.717 --> 00:48:47.550
CATHERINE MAYER: If I
was the CEO of Google,

00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:49.682
how would I foster it in
the world or the company?

00:48:49.682 --> 00:48:51.390
AUDIENCE: Gender
equality-- in the world.

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:53.370
CATHERINE MAYER: In the world.

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:57.690
I would probably do even
more than Google is already

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.280
doing to foster
it in the company,

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:03.510
because starting at home is
always a really good place.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:06.150
Google is a really
interesting company

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:12.760
and looking for huge,
transformative technologies.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.600
And I know that I
actually talk in the book

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:20.370
to Sarah Hunter at Google X
about the potential impact

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:21.750
of the self-driving car.

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:25.980
And there is a gendered
impact of that.

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:29.350
It's quite difficult to
tease out, at this point.

00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:31.500
But it could be
something that helps

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.750
women in all sorts of ways.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:39.060
It might have ways of
enhancing female security.

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:43.500
It might help with women
because of that unequal share

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.930
of caring duties, et cetera.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:47.430
But on the other
hand, you might say

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:50.430
that it would be better to share
out the caring duties more,

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:52.020
rather than solving it.

00:49:52.020 --> 00:49:54.840
So that's, by the way,
always a danger of technology

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.810
is that technology will
come at solving things.

00:49:57.810 --> 00:49:59.570
Rather than solving
the root problem,

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:02.820
it will say, OK, let's maintain
this structural imbalance

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:08.010
but find a way to fix
it in a different way.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:11.160
But I would like Google X--

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.390
in fact, they can take me on.

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:16.990
Sorry, this is not
a job application--

00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:22.080
but to devote the
same amount of energy

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:26.565
that it is devoting to
solving problems of--

00:50:30.089 --> 00:50:31.380
well, there are so many things.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:36.500
Self-driving cars are-- but all
sorts of other energy issues

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.480
and the other things that
Silicon Valley is looking

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:42.000
at the moment, like
universal basic income,

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.380
and all these great moonshot
technologies and thought

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:47.590
processes.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:49.710
But I see very little
that's actually designed

00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.430
to create gender equality.

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:54.330
So where is the
moonshot technology?

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.220
Or where is the
great, big thinking

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.160
and the great, big investment
in gender equality,

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.990
because gender
equality is something

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:02.250
that will benefit everyone?

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:05.460
So it isn't just a
matter of social justice.

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:08.220
It's a matter of logic
and self-interest.

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:12.480
And the reason I'm saying
that is because I don't really

00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.530
expect business--

00:51:13.530 --> 00:51:15.400
I expect businesses
to be ethical.

00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.810
But I don't expect them
to necessarily respond

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:23.700
to social justice concerns.

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:25.410
But this is good business.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:27.510
This is good economics.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:28.680
It should be happening.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:34.110
So yes, Google X, do your thing.

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:37.540
JON SKEET: Other questions?

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:38.621
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:38.621 --> 00:51:39.120
Thanks.

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:43.300
So I just wanted to ask a
bit around how much outreach

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:48.060
you're doing to, I guess,
leverage the female members

00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:49.185
of other political parties.

00:51:49.185 --> 00:51:50.880
To put this into
context, my mother

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:55.240
is women's officer for her
local labor constituency.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.740
And she has had such
difficulty prising away

00:51:58.740 --> 00:52:03.680
the list of female members
from all the other officers who

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.220
are all men.

00:52:05.220 --> 00:52:09.356
She's really struggling
to leverage that.

00:52:09.356 --> 00:52:11.730
And when I spoke to her about
the Women's Equality party,

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:14.040
she wasn't aware that she
could be both a Labor party

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:17.790
member and a member
of your party as well.

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:25.110
How much do you look to work
together actively and leverage

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:27.930
the fact that politics
doesn't have to be

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:30.139
a monogamous relationship?

00:52:30.139 --> 00:52:31.180
CATHERINE MAYER: Exactly.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.110
No, that's a hugely
important point.

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:36.270
The answer is, we've
been working right

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:39.660
from the very beginning,
talking very intensively

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.840
to other parties, looking
at really inventive ways

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.510
of working with them.

00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:47.250
Hadda's actually been
involved directly

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:52.410
in drafting legislation on--

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:55.890
she worked with the Lib
Dems on drafting legislation

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:58.380
to combat revenge pornography.

00:52:58.380 --> 00:53:00.690
And that's going through now?

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:01.540
Where's--

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:02.865
HALLA GUNNARSDOTTIR:
No, it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:02.865 --> 00:53:03.510
CATHERINE MAYER: It's dead.

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:04.080
OK.

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.788
That's the problem
with all these things.

00:53:05.788 --> 00:53:08.130
It was going through
the last time I looked.

00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:13.140
And on Brexit, we
had an amendment,

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:17.730
which was put forward for us by
Caroline Lucas of the Greens,

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:23.340
that we drafted and that got the
most cross-party support of any

00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:25.270
of the amendments.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:29.220
So that's a more
straightforward way

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.510
of working with the parties.

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:32.160
But we're also
looking at other ways

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:36.990
of collaborating, exploring
all of these possibilities.

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:41.430
On the membership question,
we opened our party

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:44.230
to members of other parties.

00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:46.800
Some of the other
parties then reacted

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:52.830
by trying to push out some of
the people who had joined us,

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:56.100
because they want to
enforce monogamy at a time

00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:01.590
when clearly we should
all be polyamorous.

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:08.670
But we have had really good
collaboration from most

00:54:08.670 --> 00:54:09.930
of the parties anyway.

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:12.810
So at our first
party conference,

00:54:12.810 --> 00:54:15.180
I shared the stage
with Sal Brinton, who's

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:19.080
the president of Lib
Dems, with Nicky Morgan

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:23.460
from the Conservatives, and with
Amelia Womack from the Greens.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.950
The Labor party
didn't send anyone.

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:29.910
And I think that one of
the things with Labor

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.980
is they tend to think they are
the party of gender equality.

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.880
So we have more of
a job of work to do.

00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.850
All of the women in Labor
know that's not true.

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:42.930
But they're quite conflicted
about how to respond to that.

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:46.530
I think there are such
great women in that party.

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:50.470
And it has done great things
for women in the past.

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:52.860
So none of this is
to speak against any

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.720
of the achievements of Labor.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:00.150
But somebody Tweeted during
the Labor party leadership

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:04.800
recently that if Labor
ran a race for leader that

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.390
was all women, a man would win.

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:10.324
And sometimes you feel
that that is true.

00:55:10.324 --> 00:55:12.240
JON SKEET: We have time
for one last question.

00:55:15.949 --> 00:55:17.490
I won't speak to
the irony of letting

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:19.230
a man have the last word.

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:20.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:21.300
That was great.

00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.780
One of the conflicts or
constrictions I have is,

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.850
you said that equality
isn't about minimizing

00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:29.430
the differences, which
I completely agree with.

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.930
But then--

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:30.570
CATHERINE MAYER: That
it's not about it.

00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:33.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's not about
minimizing the differences.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:35.340
And then on the
other hand, if we

00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:37.710
say it's about celebrating
those differences,

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:41.311
we fall into this trap
of stereotyping genders.

00:55:41.311 --> 00:55:43.560
And I think we often say
that, oh, the differences are

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.910
that women are
always collaborative

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:46.660
and men are always
forthright or whatever,

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:48.077
which we know is not true.

00:55:48.077 --> 00:55:50.160
So I find it very difficult
to balance in my head,

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.955
how do we go about equality
not being about making us

00:55:52.955 --> 00:55:55.980
all the same, and then
on the other side of us,

00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:58.477
not saying that a woman has
to be like this or a man

00:55:58.477 --> 00:55:59.310
has to be like that?

00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:01.350
How do you balance
that in your head?

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:02.730
And how do we communicate that?

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:04.521
CATHERINE MAYER: It's
a very good question.

00:56:04.521 --> 00:56:07.380
And I think one of the
reasons that women are often

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.770
quite defensive and in terms
of describing ourselves

00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:14.070
as nicer and more collaborative
than your lot is because you've

00:56:14.070 --> 00:56:15.420
allowed us so little--

00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.550
I don't mean you
personally-- but we

00:56:17.550 --> 00:56:24.150
have been allowed so little
ownership of most of our lives

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:26.610
or defining ourselves
that the bits

00:56:26.610 --> 00:56:28.200
that we can define
for ourselves,

00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:30.600
we get a bit too defensive
about sometimes--

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:34.500
so the myth of us being a
lot nicer than you, which

00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:38.600
was exploded for me on about
the third ad hoc steering

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.880
committee that we had
where we started arguing

00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:44.730
and came up with a
much better solution.

00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:53.900
And I think having said that,
one happy coincidence is

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:56.420
that I deal with a lot
of this in the book.

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:59.460
So when you read the
book, you'll know.

00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:04.310
But I think it is a
really important question.

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:08.570
What we have to do is find
ways of knowing who we are

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:10.460
and what we could
be if we did not

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.950
have these stereotypes
imposed on us.

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:16.640
So it is not our business
to enforce stereotypes,

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:21.180
but to encourage and
celebrate diversity.

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.420
We are also an
intersectional party.

00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:28.370
So we are a party that
understands that being female

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:31.220
is a huge structural
disadvantage that

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.950
intersects with other
kinds of disadvantage

00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:35.277
and discrimination.

00:57:35.277 --> 00:57:36.860
So if you are a woman
of color, you're

00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:40.320
going to be at a far greater
disadvantage, for example,

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:44.840
than me, who grew up without
that particular thing.

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.780
But now that I'm getting
older, I'm encountering ageism.

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:52.220
So there are all
these ways that we

00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:55.610
need to analyze what's
going on and understand it.

00:57:55.610 --> 00:57:59.990
But to analyze and understand
differences is also to be

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:04.850
on the way towards also
appreciating and celebrating

00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:09.530
and enabling, rather than-- this
is not about creating some kind

00:58:09.530 --> 00:58:12.140
of one-size-fits-all solution.

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.800
And it is definitely not about
replicating the current order

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:19.430
but just with a few women
sitting in glass offices

00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:21.800
at the top of towers.

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.190
But the Equalia that I
describe in the book--

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:26.600
the gender-equal world--

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:28.490
it is not a perfect world.

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:29.660
It isn't a utopia.

00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:31.820
But the point about it
is that it's achievable,

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:34.405
and it's a lot
better than this one.

00:58:34.405 --> 00:58:36.530
JON SKEET: That sounds like
a very positive message

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:37.950
on which to finish.

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:39.590
So thank you so much.

00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:42.299
We could keep talking for hours
and hours and hours, I'm sure.

00:58:42.299 --> 00:58:44.090
And hopefully, we will
have you back again.

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:45.890
And we can continue
the conversation

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:48.870
and continue it on social
media and everything else.

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:51.616
But for tonight, thank
you so much, Catherine.

00:58:51.616 --> 00:58:52.740
CATHERINE MAYER: Thank you.

00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:54.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.390
Thank you, really.
