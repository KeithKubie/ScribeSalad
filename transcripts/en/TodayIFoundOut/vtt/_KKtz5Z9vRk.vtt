00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.160
Born Elizabeth Jane Cochran in 1864, Nellie
Bly was considered the most rebellious of

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.970
her father’s fifteen children.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.020
(Yes, fifteen) Her family was thrown into
poverty when her father died when she was

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.660
just six years old; in a time when women weren’t
expected to hold down a job, it was difficult

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.320
for her mother to find work enough to support
the family.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.540
By the time Elizabeth was fifteen, she decided
to go to school to become a teacher.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.910
Unfortunately, she didn’t have enough money
to continue studying past the first semester,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.450
and she returned home to her mother in Pittsburgh.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.079
There weren’t a lot of options there, either—she
helped to run a boarding house, but full-time

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.070
work was difficult to come by.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.339
Not long after, Elizabeth read a series of
articles by “Q.O.” or “Quiet Observer”—the

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.480
pen name of one Erasmus Wilson, one of Pittsburgh’s
most well-known journalists.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.039
The man had quietly observed that women belonged
in the home, no doubt barefoot, pregnant,

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.500
and making their husbands’ dinners while
simultaneously rubbing their feet and bringing

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.860
them a beer…

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.860
😉

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.300
Q.O. called working women “a monstrosity.”

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.720
Elizabeth was angered by the statements, as
she knew that she and many other girls had

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.620
to work to maintain some quality of life for
themselves and their families.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.001
Perhaps exhibiting that “rebellious” streak
that her parents had discovered in her as

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:27.380
a child, Elizabeth wrote a strongly-worded
letter to the newspaper about the offensive

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.380
articles.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.140
They liked the spirited nature and quality
of writing exhibited in her letter so much

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.079
that they hired her on as a writer, giving
her the pen name “Nellie Bly.”

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.289
Her first article talked about the difficulties
faced by poor working women, but the newspaper

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.890
insisted on her covering stories for the women’s
pages.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.140
Nellie wasn’t interested in writing about
fashion, and she soon quit and headed for

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.789
New York, where she got her big break.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.280
On September 22, 1887, Nellie Bly was approached
by the New York World to write an article

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.250
about the inner workings of the notorious
Blackwell Island Insane Asylum.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.690
They wanted to know what went on behind the
barred doors and the smiles of white-clad

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.310
nurses, and Nellie was determined to find
out.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.870
The editor offered her no solid plan to get
her out of the institution once her observations

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.950
were completed, but promised her it would
be achieved somehow.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.460
Her instructions were simple: “Write up
things as you find them, good or bad; give

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.670
praise and blame as you think best, and the
truth all the time.”

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.709
But first, Nellie had to get herself committed,
which meant she had to feign insanity convincingly.

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.340
She decided to pose as a poor girl looking
for work at the “Temporary Home for Females”

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.660
under the name Nellie Brown.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.630
There, she started displaying “insane”
behaviour in an attempt to get herself committed.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.760
She said she was afraid of the other women,
spoke vaguely, and spent that first night

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.019
staring blankly at a wall rather than sleeping.

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.519
She reported that another woman staying at
the home had a nightmare that a crazed Nellie

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.280
rushed at her with a knife—her plan was
working.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.819
The assistant matron of the house ended up
calling for police officers to take Nellie

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:06.819
away in the morning.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.970
Nellie was brought before Judge Duffy, who
ruled that she had undoubtedly been drugged

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.180
and had a doctor come in to examine her.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.069
She was declared insane.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.920
She was examined by a second medical expert,
who said of her

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.000
Positively demented.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.110
I consider it a hopeless case.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.330
She needs to be put where someone will take
care of her.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.440
The first of Nellie’s observations about
insane asylums was that it wasn’t very hard

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.440
to get into one.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.020
The doctors were incompetent in determining
who was actually insane and who wasn’t;

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.329
Nellie met several other patients who didn’t
seem to have anything wrong with them, either.

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.799
She and her new comrades weren’t necessarily
ill-treated those next few days while they

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.020
waited to be taken over to Blackwell Island,
though the food was sub-par and the sleeping

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.250
arrangements were chilly and uncomfortable.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.030
As her incarceration drew a bit of publicity,
one of Nellie’s biggest worries was that

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.569
a reporter would come around to find out more
about her, because “if there was anyone

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.189
who can ferret out a mystery it is a reporter,”
and she didn’t want to be recognized.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.840
Nevertheless, she managed to make it to the
island undiscovered, and once on the island,

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.969
Nellie watched as the patients were brought
before the doctors.

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:12.319
One woman had simply been sick with fever
leading up to her commitment to the mental

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.500
institution, and was no more insane than Nellie
was.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.410
Another woman was German and, since the doctors
couldn’t understand her, wasn’t given

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.209
a chance to tell her story.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.110
When it was Nellie’s turn, she was asked
several questions largely unrelated to the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.670
question of her sanity.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.060
The doctor was far more concerned with the
nurse, with whom he flirted.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.419
Bly decided to drop her feigned insanity and
act as she did in her everyday life as soon

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.650
as she got to the island.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.800
The nurses barely took notice, adding another
concerning element to Bly’s stay in the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800
institution.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.060
She noted that, “the more sanely I talked
and acted, the crazier I was thought to be.”

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.449
Asylum life, Nellie soon found, was unsuitable
even for the truly insane.

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.000
She was forced to endure ice-cold baths, freezing
nights, both verbal and physical abuse at

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.660
the hands of the nurses, isolation, and fear
of fire (the doors were individually locked-

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.110
so no easy way to unlock them all at once-
and the windows were barred; if a fire broke

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.539
out, it was likely a majority of the patients
would die).

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.380
Bly was only at the asylum for ten, cruel
days, but she noted that,

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.000
What, excepting torture, would produce insanity
quicker than this treatment?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.471
. . . Take a perfectly sane and healthy woman,
shut her up and make her sit from 6 a.m. to

00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:28.181
8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow
her to talk or move during these hours, give

00:05:28.181 --> 00:05:32.630
her no reading and let her know nothing of
the world or its doings, give her bad food

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.250
and harsh treatment, and see how long it will
take to make her insane.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.270
Two months would make her a mental and physical
wreck.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.080
At one point, Bly was visited by a reporter
who she knew quite well.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.800
He was shocked to find Nellie Bly where he
thought to write an article on the insane

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.930
Nellie Brown.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.050
Bly begged him not to blow her cover, and
he didn’t—saying only that she wasn’t

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.870
the woman he had been sent to see.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.040
He ended up leaving shortly after.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.410
Towards the end of her stay, Bly pressed the
doctors for answers.

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:03.530
How could they determine whether or not a
woman was insane if they didn’t listen to

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.530
them?

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.520
She insisted on a full examination to determine
her sanity, but the doctors only brushed her

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.520
aside, thinking she was raving.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:14.020
Bly wrote that “The insane asylum on Blackwell’s
Island is a human rat-trap.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.560
It is easy to get in, but once there it is
impossible to get out.”

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.330
Luckily for Bly, her editor made good on his
promise to get her out of the place.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.890
After ten days in the asylum, she was on her
way back to New York.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.220
The first installment of her report on the
conditions in the asylum was published a few

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.220
days later.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.419
Readers were horrified, and Bly was made a
celebrity of sorts, praised for her bravery

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.040
during her time in the asylum.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.030
The doctors and nurses were full of excuses,
but they weren’t heeded.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.830
Bly’s story forced many changes to be made.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.910
In addition, just under $1 million more was
appropriated to the Department of Public Charities

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.699
and Corrections (about $25 million today)
as a result of her story, allowing for better,

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:58.950
and safer, conditions and better treatment
of the patients.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.750
One of the women Bly had befriended during
her stay said,

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.199
Ever since Miss Brown has been taken away
everything is different.

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:07.770
The nurses are very kind and we are given
plenty to wear.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.009
The doctors come to see us often and the food
is greatly improved.”

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:15.750
Masquerading in an insane asylum wasn’t
the last of Bly’s adventures.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.530
She went on to have a great many more, including
traveling around the world in 72 days almost

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:25.360
completely unchaperoned- which was a much
bigger deal back then for a woman particularly.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.270
This was done as part of a race with another
reporter who was traveling in the opposite

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.350
direction, to see who could beat the other
and if it were possible to beat the “80

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.460
days” from Jules Verne’s novel.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.340
During her trip, she even met Verne in France.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.190
Bly would later marry an extremely successful
businessman and herself become the president

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.840
of the Iron Clad Manufacturing Co., making
her one of the most prominent women in business

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:51.699
in the U.S. for a time, besides being one
of the more well known female reporters.

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:56.710
Not bad for a little girl born one of fifteen
to a poor family in a time where women were

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:35.060
actively discouraged from venturing outside

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:50.180
the home for work.
