00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.220
RICHARD MUNSON: Nikola Tesla.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.190
He is getting a bit
of a popular revival.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.610
In part, as we were
mentioning, it's

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.850
because your boss, not long
ago, referred to him as a hero.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.370
Everybody's
thinking, oh my gosh,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.442
if Larry Page
thinks he's a hero,

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:23.150
maybe we need to learn
a little bit more.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.180
And then suddenly
Elon Musk decides

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.160
that he's got a car
company and a car that's

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.340
named after this character.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.160
So who the heck is he?

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.170
There are sort of
two broad categories,

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.600
of at least those
folks that sort of know

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.120
something about him, at
least my experience is.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.250
One says that he's
this Superman that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.460
has provided us these
amazing inventions that

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.690
underlie our economy.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.930
The other side says that
he's kind of quirky,

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.320
like he's an odd character.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.220
I mean, he abhors jewelry.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.800
He gets a fever if
he looks at a peach.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.710
He counts his steps as he walks.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.330
And if they're not
divisible by 3,

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.720
he has to go back and do
his whole journey again.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.460
So that you've got
this sort of contrast.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.590
But I guess what I want to do,
for you know, maybe about 20,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.170
25 minutes or so, is talk a
bit about some observations

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.680
that I came up with in the
course of doing the research--

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.190
things that sort of surprised
me that may surprise you,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.440
hopefully.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.772
And then I'd welcome, actually,
just having a dialogue.

00:01:25.772 --> 00:01:27.230
Answering some
questions about what

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:35.060
you want to know, or know about
this remarkable individual.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.330
So let me start with just--

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.710
my first observation is, I
was unaware of the extent

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.150
of his genius.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.150
This man got 300 patents.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.690
He invented the electric motor.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.156
He invented the long distance
electricity transmission.

00:01:51.156 --> 00:01:53.030
According to the United
States Supreme Court,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.940
he provided us the
basics of radio.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.320
He did remote control,
he did robots.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.620
I mean, the list goes on.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.120
According to the
American Institute

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.570
of Electrical Engineers, were
we to seize and eliminate

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.370
from our industrial world the
result of Mr. Tesla's work,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.080
the wheels of industry
would cease to turn.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.450
Our towns would be dark.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.380
And that's not all.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.720
Long after his death, his
visions inspired great minds.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.230
I mean, he foresaw cell
phones radar, laser weapons,

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.890
artificial intelligence,
vertical lift airplanes.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.960
Cell phones for instance, this
guy is-- about 110 years ago--

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.730
he's talking about
a device that can

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.480
provide news, and stock prices,
and all sorts of information.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.250
And he said, "We shall see and
hear one another as perfectly

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.410
as though we were face to face,
despite intervening distances

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.030
of thousands of miles.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.080
A man will be able to carry
one in his vest pocket."

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.910
110 years ago.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.050
He didn't invent it.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.180
But he sort of thought about it.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.690
That envisioning is, I
think, quite amazing.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.050
He does come across as
a bit of a magician.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.040
He would do presentations
at various universities.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.310
And he would admit that
electricity is this force

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.790
that even physicists will
admit, they don't fully

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.400
understand what it is.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.350
But he was-- and
others as well--

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.200
were able to capture
it and utilize it.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.520
And in fact, last century,
you asked engineers

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.680
as to what was the
major accomplishment

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.330
of the 20th century, they
ignored the internal combustion

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.790
engine, the computer chip, all
these other sort of things.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.730
They said the most amazing
thing was the ability

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.580
to capture and transmit
electric power.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.180
And this man, this
magician, was one of those.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.830
He created lightning.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.230
This was something that had
been reserved only for nature.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.710
But he zapped it
all over the place.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.320
You know, hundreds
and hundreds of feet.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.570
He also made lamps glow.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.900
They were not attached to wires.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.820
So this man was, in
fact, a magician.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.280
But you should also
recognize that he

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.350
had some quixotic notions
that complicated his legacy,

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.810
or made him more
interesting, depending

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.459
upon your perspective.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.290
He spent a lot of time
trying to figure out

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.600
how to communicate
with intelligent beings

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.779
on other planets.

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:23.570
He spent a lot of time
trying to figure out

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.810
how to read your mind by
putting little monitors

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.000
near your retina.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.670
So he was both practical, as far
as coming up with, if you will,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.990
systems.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.290
He was a visionary, in
thinking about new things

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.780
that he couldn't actually
make, because the equipment

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.670
or technology just wasn't there.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.720
And he was also a little
weird and off sometimes.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.000
And I think it's
that combination that

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.250
makes him so interesting.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.130
The second surprise for me--

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.450
as was noted, I'm
an environmentalist.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.560
I run the Midwest office of
the Environmental Defense Fund,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.550
working on clean energy issues.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.400
And so for me to find out that
Nikola Tesla, not only did

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.230
he invent the electric
motor, but he also

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.270
was a clean energy pioneer.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.100
That to me was pretty exciting.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.100
And he remains an
inspiration, I think,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.810
to a variety of solar and
battery manufacturers.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.730
Elon Musk-- who we
mentioned before-- has

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:23.396
his car and his company
named after him.

00:05:23.396 --> 00:05:25.700
But he contributed
a million dollars

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.370
to revitalize the Tesla
laboratory up on Long Island.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.900
I actually work in a
shared office space.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.610
It's sort of a
startup incubator.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:40.770
And there is, right--

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.050
10 feet behind my desk
there is a full sized

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.784
cut out of Nikola Tesla that--

00:05:46.784 --> 00:05:48.200
at least, I used
to tell my wife--

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.330
was haunting me from behind
to go home and write more.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.120
But he is-- his
leadership on clean energy

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.200
began actually, in 1900,
about 118 years ago.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.690
He published an article
in "The Century"

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.710
which then was the nation's
largest circulation periodical.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.200
It was entitled "The
Problem of Increasing

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.450
Human Energy With
Special References

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.970
to the Harnessing of
the Sun's Energy."

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.570
Again, published 118 years ago.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.230
Was probably the earliest,
most detailed look

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.640
at how to capture power
from the sun and the wind.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.600
For me, as a
environmental advocate,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.070
he inspires me to think
of, if he was here today,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.110
how great it would be to focus
on the electricity industry,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.050
which he helped start.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.050
But today, largely because it
is monopolized-- in other words,

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.940
the electric utilities
have total control

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.840
in many states over
both the generation

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.460
and the delivery
of electricity--

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.040
this industry has become
innovation averse,

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.650
has become risk averse,
it has become stodgy,

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.880
it has become frayed,
the list goes on.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.020
If, in fact, Tesla was around,
he'd be off thinking about,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.020
how am I going to
send power wirelessly?

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.330
How am I going to make it
without having pollution?

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.160
How am I going to electrify
other sectors of the economy,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.800
particularly transportation?

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.470
How am I going to
bring drudgery saving

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.710
electric power to
everyone around the world,

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.160
perhaps for free?

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.740
Including that we have two
billion people on this planet

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.010
that do not have access to
electricity at this moment.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.990
He-- in my mind--

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.100
if he were with us today, would
be thinking outside of the box,

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.740
away from sort of
the monopoly think

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.420
that currently
degrades that industry.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:44.410
My third surprise was his
constant attempt and need

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.610
to balance the present
and the future.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.900
Call it apocryphal, call it
weird, call it appropriate,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:08:00.790
but he was born during a
giant lightning storm, exactly

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.940
at the stroke of midnight,
between the 9th and 10th

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:06.940
of July 1856.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:08.140
That's weird enough.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.680
Just in the midst of a gale.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.524
And this became
part of Tesla lore.

00:08:12.524 --> 00:08:14.440
You know, his family
sort of thought this was,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.260
you know, this was
how Nikola came in.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.350
And he, I think, thought
he was kind of special,

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:23.800
because he had this trait that
he was born at this weird time.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:28.300
For me as a biographer, I
was able to get the sense

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:33.100
that in fact, the birth
story sort of figuratively

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.080
placed him in the
present as well

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.720
as in the future, both
today and tomorrow.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.260
And I think he spent
his life trying

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.320
to struggle to find this
balance between focusing

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.930
on current realities
and envisioning

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.570
the future, the unknown.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.420
And consider, for
example, the year 1897.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.910
He had just figured out how
to transmit the enormous power

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:03.400
from Niagara Falls 26 miles
all the way to Buffalo,

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:06.790
and then a total of 400
miles down to New York City.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.230
This is huge.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.020
Because the technology
that Thomas Edison--

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.360
who everybody looks
towards of thinking he

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.780
was the electrical genius.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.350
He, however, favored
direct current,

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.320
which could basically move
maybe half a mile, maybe a mile

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.640
if you're lucky.

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:27.040
Tesla was able to move
this power 400 miles.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.300
The "New York Times" referred
to this Niagara project

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.080
as the unrivaled engineering
triumph of the 19th century.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.000
And who did the
paper give credit to?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.240
They said, "To Tesla belongs
the undisputed honor of being

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.707
the man whose work made this
Niagara project possible."

00:09:47.707 --> 00:09:50.290
And of course there are statues
to him on both sides, Canadian

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:52.180
and the United States.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.590
He did this amazing thing.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:57.640
He was praised by "The Times,"
and at parties, et cetera.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.530
And he was bored.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.630
This was too much today.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:02.980
He had done this.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.860
He needed to look
towards the future

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.770
to create a new area of science.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.530
And he called this
[? tellemetonics, ?] or what we

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:13.470
might call robotics.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:20.040
His initial project was a
radio controlled model boat,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.540
measured about--
oh, I don't know--

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.290
4 feet in length and
maybe about 3 feet high.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:29.530
And he-- although he was
a rather shy scientist,

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:33.900
he was capable of being
a showman if he had to.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.170
And so, he had the debut
of this [? tellemeton ?]

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:38.940
at the Madison Square Garden--

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.760
huge arena.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.940
This is the old one,
but this is where

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.180
it happened-- during the
electrical exposition

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.550
in May 1898.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.000
Remember, this was
about two months

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.184
after the Battleship Maine
had blown up in Havana Harbor.

00:10:55.184 --> 00:10:56.850
We were in the midst,
just the beginning

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:58.020
of the Spanish-American war.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:00.430
So there was a lot of interest
in trying to figure out,

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.400
can we develop new weapons?

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.590
And so here comes Tesla.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:05.820
He has this model boat.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.900
He builds a pond in the
middle of the exhibition hall.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.790
And he invites possible
investors, reporters,

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.420
other inventors and scientists,
and he tantalized them

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.130
for 15 or 20 minutes.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.540
He moved the boat backwards
and forwards, around the pond,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.600
he made it dance almost
like a water bug.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.461
And so, everybody was
mesmerized by this.

00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:30.960
You know, some
people were thinking,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.251
there's a tiny monkey in there.

00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:36.060
I'm sure there's a
tiny monkey in there.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.640
But then, after a while, he
then turns to the audience

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.680
and says, all right, who wants
to ask the boat a question?

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.720
And everybody's thinking, you
don't ask boats questions.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.330
Some probably
future Google person

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.010
came up and said, all right,
what's the cube root of 64?

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:53.490
And Tesla, you
know, with his hand

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:58.410
hidden on a lever
underneath the panel

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:02.710
arranges to flick the lights
on the boat four times.

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.510
And he said, he
created a sensation,

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:10.260
"such as no other invention
of mine has ever produced."

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.320
His success at this
was further highlighted

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.670
by Marconi's failure.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.230
Remember, Marconi
is the one who's

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.820
given public credit for
wireless transmissions.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.680
But about three
months later, Marconi

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.560
tried to do a very
similar project.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.720
Built his own pond,
he built a model

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.960
frigate that he was to guide
over to what was referred

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.539
to as the Spanish boat.

00:12:35.539 --> 00:12:37.080
And it would have
little bombs on it,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.310
would blow the tiny little
Spanish boat to smithereens.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.800
Unfortunately, Marconi
had not mastered

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.320
how to send
individualized messages.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.690
So when his assistant
punched the button,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:54.060
the Spanish ship was just fine.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.480
But there was a loud explosion
in the back room where Marconi

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.640
had kept his miniature bombs.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.500
Because that's where
the signal went.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.540
He hadn't figured out how
to get it to the right spot.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.260
And so, there were
loud blasts and smoke

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.020
that went throughout
the exhibition hall.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.510
Not surprisingly,
Tesla was never

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.180
satisfied with
just a model boat.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.810
And to the Navy, was
not satisfied to suggest

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.490
this was a submarine
that would carry

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:21.870
bombs to blow up a frigate.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.070
That was kind of boring.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.580
You know, they're thinking,
it's the Spanish-American war,

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.640
this is great.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:35.260
But he thinks this is a new
non-biological form of life.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:39.660
This is a machine that is
embodied with a borrowed mind.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.610
This mind, of course,
happens to be his.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.270
But he's foreseeing
artificial intelligence,

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.410
and he's predicting that this
[? tellemeton ?] not only would

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:54.400
quote, "follow a course laid
out or obey commands given far

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.300
in advance, but it will be
capable of distinguishing

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.450
between what it ought and
what not ought to do."

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.300
This is, again, over
100 some odd years ago.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.270
We were beginning to
think, in his mind,

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.590
about artificial intelligence.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.350
My fourth surprise, actually,
as I was telling Richard,

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:17.995
resulted from the discovery
at the Library of Congress

00:14:17.995 --> 00:14:24.070
of boxes of letters that either
Tesla had written or had been

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:25.900
written to him by
friends, or colleagues,

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:28.191
[? et ?] [? cetera. ?] From
a biographer's perspective,

00:14:28.191 --> 00:14:31.330
this is like manna from heaven.

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.610
You know, suddenly
you get to see

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:37.600
this man's voice in real time.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.920
What those letters showed, I
think, was an overlooked side

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.480
to this remarkable genius.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.105
As I mentioned at
the beginning, you've

00:14:45.105 --> 00:14:47.660
got this school of people who
think that he was a Superman.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.810
In fact, one
biographer called him

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:53.110
a supernova in the
galaxy of the human race.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.960
And no doubt the combination
of electric motors, robots,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:00.160
remote control, radio, these
are all super accomplishments.

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.050
I'm not taking anything
away from that.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.020
But this scientist
was also human.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.790
And charmingly so.

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.580
And that was the fun part to
sort of get behind and tell

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:10.690
that story.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:14.320
His closest friends were
the Johnsons, Robert--

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.030
who edited the
"Century Magazine,"

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.250
which I mentioned before
was the largest circulation

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.720
periodical--

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.790
and his wife, Catherine.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:24.220
They operate in an
intellectual salon

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.620
at their townhouse in
Manhattan's Murray Hill

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:27.850
neighborhood.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.480
They were not particularly
rich, but they sort of

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.680
acted that way.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.634
And they gathered around them
this cadre of writers, artists,

00:15:36.634 --> 00:15:38.050
and sculptors, and
would have them

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:41.110
over for all these great
dinner conversations.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:44.770
Mark Twain came
to most of these.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:47.810
And he and Nikola Tesla
became great friends.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:52.150
This is Mr. Twain, and Tesla
there is in the background.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:54.580
So he would come to
Tesla's laboratory.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.160
And the two of them
would just play.

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.470
They'd send electrical
sparks across the room.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.490
They'd hold up globes that
were unconnected to wires

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.580
and make them glow.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.950
They would X-ray
each other's hands.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:13.450
They were two kids having a
great time in their laboratory.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:18.370
They just happened to be the
engineering genius of the time,

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.710
and perhaps the best
writer at our time.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:24.550
One cute story about this
is that when they first met,

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:29.210
Tesla recalled that when
he was 14 years old,

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.250
he had been quite sick.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:34.030
And his parents had given
him some Mark Twain novels.

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.900
And at least,
according to Tesla,

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:40.210
he told Mark Twain this, that
you saved my life, because I

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:42.040
got through this sickness.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.040
And then Tesla said--

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.070
commented upon Twain-- he said,
this great man of laughter

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:50.020
broke out into tears.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.940
I just thought that was so cute.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.070
So the two of them were a pair.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.620
But I think this
relationship that Tesla

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:00.910
had with both Robert
and Catherine reveals

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.730
sort of a jovial
and relaxed side

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.569
to this usually
intense inventor.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.509
They exchanged
almost daily notes.

00:17:09.509 --> 00:17:11.050
They were talking
about their health,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.640
the writings of
other scientists,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.160
Tesla's latest inventions,
the state of the Johnson kids.

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.099
Just to give you one
sense of one letter, when

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:23.530
Tesla had had a cold
for a little while,

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:24.819
Robert wrote to him.

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:27.910
And he said, "It's been a
whole week since we saw you,

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.590
and you need cheering up.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.900
Come as early as
possible and get cheered.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.200
We're in a jolly mood, and the
fire is lighted on the hearth,

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.000
and we only need you."

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.890
So here is this unbelievably
intense inventor

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.900
who really loved to
spend most of his time

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.990
by himself in his lab.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.080
He was human.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.630
Charmingly so, would
be my observation.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:53.340
He never married.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.610
He did fall in love once, with
a woman that I never found out

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.380
her last name, is Anna.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.760
Supposedly beautiful eyes.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.740
And the two of them,
when he was 23 years old,

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.350
they would walk
through Austrian parks,

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.320
and plan how they were
going to have a big family,

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.030
and he was going to go
off to engineering school.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:12.940
That did not happen.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.356
He went off to
engineering school,

00:18:14.356 --> 00:18:17.040
the relationship did not pursue.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.910
But he later would
admit that inventors

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:22.667
are not to be intimate.

00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:24.000
That was sort of his conclusion.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.059
He said, you know, you can be a
musician, you can be an artist.

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:28.600
You can be all these
sorts of things.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:32.280
But if you're an inventor,
you're too intense.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.930
And if you become
married, that will

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:41.010
take away from the intensity
and focus that you need to have.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.320
And there was one sad note
near the end of his life.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.649
And he says, yeah,
that may be true,

00:18:45.649 --> 00:18:46.815
but it also makes us lonely.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:56.520
So this very human
scientist, I think also

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:01.380
give us lessons about the
role and the example of being

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.330
a discoverer and an inventor.

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:09.820
He reveled most in the
excitement of discovery.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:11.640
I just have a few
pictures of him

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.530
sort of going through his life.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.220
He would say, "I do not think
there is any thrill that

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:20.580
can go through the human heart
like that felt by the inventor

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.750
as he sees some creation of
the brain unfolding to success.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:29.100
Such emotions make a man forget
food, sleep, friends, love,

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.344
everything."

00:19:30.344 --> 00:19:31.510
So where did this come from?

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.690
Where did this inventing
spirit come from?

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.390
Some has to be just
innate, the guy was bright.

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.580
I mean, he could speak
eight languages fluently.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.320
He could recite lengthy poems
and stories just from memory.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.860
He also had a father who was
a Serbian Orthodox priest who

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.290
gave him mental exercises.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.100
He had to remember
sequences of numbers.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:56.290
He had to recite long stories.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.530
And the list goes on.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:03.120
He also was a little strange.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.160
This man who was born during a
midnight lightning storm, when

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:12.480
he was young, used to have
strobing light flashes

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.200
in his brain that led him
to admit that sometimes he

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.010
couldn't tell the difference
between reality and something

00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:21.300
that was fake.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.160
It also sort of
led him to go off

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.290
on journeys, mental journeys.

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.720
So he had daytime
and nighttime sort

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.710
of dreams where he would travel
around the world to new lands,

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:36.000
meet new people, who were
almost real friends to him.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.640
So where did it come from?

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.040
Exercise, natural
brilliance, and a little bit

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.630
of strangeness, I think.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.460
But that's probably
true of all of us.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:46.770
Not that yours
truly is any genius,

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.930
but it is that combination.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:52.800
He however, had a particular
type of invention, that I think

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.290
is somewhat missing today.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.870
And that's unfortunate.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:02.600
His was a curiosity driven
quest for discovery,

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.510
or for invention.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:06.050
And it was motivated
by idealism.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:09.500
And this is in contrast to
Thomas Edison, who basically

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:11.434
invented because he
was an entrepreneur

00:21:11.434 --> 00:21:12.600
and he wanted to make money.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.160
And nothing wrong with that.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.440
But Tesla, although he certainly
enjoyed his fancy dinners

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.740
at the Delmonicos, and
he had a nice apartment

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.540
at the Waldorf Astoria.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:28.910
But he said that technology
transcended the marketplace.

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:33.750
That invention should not
just be tied to profits.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:37.970
He wrote, "the desire
that guides me in all I do

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.370
is the desire to harness
the forces of nature

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.530
to the service of mankind."

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.320
So what does this
teach us, if you will,

00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:52.550
about his inventing style
that we might utilize today?

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.790
One observation-- two.

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:59.300
One is that, he
firmly demonstrated

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.900
the link between a
love of humanities

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.300
and the love of science.

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.660
He loved poetry, would
recite it at length,

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.330
was deeply into, as I
said, foreign languages

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.760
and foreign
literature, et cetera.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.330
And to give you an
example, he envisioned

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.640
his revolutionary
electric motor--

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.970
the thing that made the
electricity industry possible--

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:26.930
he envisioned it while walking
through a Budapest park quoting

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.250
Goethe's "Faust."

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.730
And then he picked up a stick
and drew a little design of it

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.100
in the sand.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.440
It's this mix of
humanities and science

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.710
that I think we are
somewhat missing today.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.740
We separate them
more than, I guess,

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.230
Tesla would argue is necessary.

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.140
The other observation,
sort of my final one,

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.100
is that he would observe--

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.880
I think-- that we
have moved too far

00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.480
away from the individualization
of the inventor

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.740
or the discoverer.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:03.810
We now do things with teams.

00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:06.270
And this is not a
knock at all on teams.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.700
But a lot of inventing--
as you probably know--

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.040
you have your own
teams here, there

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.490
are teams at universities,
research centers,

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.170
corporate laboratories,
et cetera.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.710
And they work marvelously.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:22.650
But what's missing,
he would argue,

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.070
is that sometimes you just need
the isolated individual who's

00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:30.810
free enough to go out there
and be stupid and alone.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:32.110
That's not to say--

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:35.580
he needed to balance,
again, this envisioning,

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.080
individualized inventing,
with some reality.

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.560
And he did that largely
because he had--

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:42.330
at least for a brief
period of his life--

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.770
a lawyer who kept him in check.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:45.750
And he needed that.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:49.440
And it's not like you just have
some individual wacko out there

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.390
just thinking about the future.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.680
You do need a team, if you will.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.220
But he would argue you
don't need as big of teams

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.674
as we currently mostly focus on.

00:23:59.674 --> 00:24:00.840
I don't know if that's true.

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.710
I'd welcome your
insights on that one.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:07.500
But that would be my guess of
what he would come at this.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:11.640
My final comment is that I think
he aimed high, perhaps higher

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.970
than any other inventor.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:16.630
Just a few more shots of him.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:20.700
He worked tirelessly to
bring electric power freely

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:21.900
to the world.

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:24.540
And he built robots
that he thought

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:27.000
would reduce life's drudgery.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.780
He was, in short,
driven by inner forces

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.590
that made shear creation
the most important thing

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.180
in his life.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:39.780
And we are the better for it.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:40.950
Thank you very much.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:46.340
I hope you enjoy reading
about this mastermind.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.440
And I also hope that
you help give him

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.740
more of the due recognition
that at least I, and your boss,

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.440
thinks that he deserves.

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.050
So I'm happy to take
a few questions.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.850
There are books that are
available for the people that

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:03.350
are here.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.639
But I'd welcome some
questions and some dialogue.

00:25:05.639 --> 00:25:06.680
What do you want to know?

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.874
Or what do you know?

00:25:08.874 --> 00:25:10.290
AUDIENCE: I'll
start off with one.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.040
RICHARD MUNSON: Oh good.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.390
AUDIENCE: So, how did he end up?

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:13.800
What's the end of the story?

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.600
RICHARD MUNSON: He
ended up poor and alone.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:26.100
And lived his final
days sort of isolated

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.510
in the Hotel New Yorker,
where he refused to see anyone

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:34.500
and would restrict the maids and
others from actually spending

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.680
much time with him, and just
sort of shoving his gruel

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.850
to him.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:43.110
And the only reason that he
even had enough money at the end

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.860
was because some scientists at
the Westinghouse Corporation--

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.930
which he essentially
made possible

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:51.720
because he formed this
partnership with George

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.750
Westinghouse to do the
Niagara Falls project.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.770
And so Westinghouse bought,
initially, his patents

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.520
for his electric motor.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.690
But at the end, it was a few
scientists at the Westinghouse

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.850
Corporation that convinced
the corporation that it

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:11.010
was an embarrassment
to their company

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.620
that he had just
declared bankruptcy,

00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:16.000
and they needed to give
him enough of a stipend

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.850
so that at least
he could survive.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:19.490
Now that said, he died--

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:21.750
I forget the room number
in the Hotel New Yorker,

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.693
but it was divisible by--

00:26:23.693 --> 00:26:24.400
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.870
RICHARD MUNSON: Very good.

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:30.220
And more than 2,000 people then
attended his funeral service

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.430
at the Cathedral St. John
the Divine in New York City,

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:34.862
out by Columbia University.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.420
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming today.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.920
It's really nice to see someone
speak without a teleprompter

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.924
here at Google.

00:26:43.924 --> 00:26:44.209
RICHARD MUNSON: Oh, really?

00:26:44.209 --> 00:26:44.709
OK.

00:26:44.709 --> 00:26:46.120
AUDIENCE: Most people use it.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.340
But it's nice when it's natural.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.490
So my question is, you
know, you told this story

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.770
about when he was born.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.130
How much do you think
someone's success

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.380
is based on what
they believe they

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:07.360
can do throughout their life
versus their natural born

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.470
intelligence?

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:11.462
RICHARD MUNSON: Well this
is a tough one for Nikola.

00:27:11.462 --> 00:27:13.670
And this is probably a longer
answer than you wanted.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.740
But his life, his early life up
until he was about seven years

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.120
old, was blissful.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.790
He had two older sisters that
doted on him, lived on a farm,

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.027
having a great time.

00:27:23.027 --> 00:27:25.360
But when he was seven years
old, his older brother Dane,

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.770
who was then I think 12 or
13, and he was Nikola's idol.

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.140
And was the family favorite,
was considered gifted

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:33.340
beyond all means.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.210
And he would follow his
father into the priesthood.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:42.340
Unfortunately, the
family's white stallion

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:45.530
bolted and threw his
brother to the ground,

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.770
and he died that night
from his injuries.

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.680
And Nikola there witnessed this.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.490
So this was a real
changing event in his life.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.330
Where this comes
back to your comment

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.640
is that, you would
think his parents

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.030
would then say, oh, we've
got our remaining son,

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.080
let's focus on him.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.095
But no.

00:28:03.095 --> 00:28:07.600
His mom and dad are thinking,
oh, if only Dane had lived,

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.250
he would have been great.

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.840
Think of the amazing
accomplishments

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.080
that he would have had.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.580
So Nikola claims that he
grew up without any sense

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.050
of confidence.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.600
Because anything he did
that was noteworthy,

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.500
his parents would think oh,
Dane might have done it better.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:32.680
So he had this constant struggle
to find his father's affection.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.230
And it never came.

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:38.000
In fact, he-- this is far more
than your question wanted.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.410
But I mean, he ended up
finally getting his father

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:43.150
to allow him to go to
engineering school.

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:46.000
And he did it for two years
and got stellar marks.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.560
But whenever he
got stellar marks,

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.950
his father was still, oh,
Dane could have been better.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.880
And so he drops out of school.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.770
Nikola Tesla drops
out of school,

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:57.340
takes up gambling and
billiards, moves secretly

00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:01.660
to a town like 200 miles away,
gets arrested for vagrancy,

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.519
and is brought back by
the police to his parents.

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:06.310
You can imagine, they're
not exactly happy.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:10.270
And I'm not suggesting this
is the model for any Google

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.680
tenure.

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.130
And his father died not long
after that just from the shock.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.990
So I don't know that--

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:18.580
I mean, he's not an
example of someone

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.520
who was told all your
life, you are the greatest.

00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.740
He was told that he
was not the greatest.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.680
And yet he persevered.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:29.860
And in part he persevered
in response to his father,

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:32.890
trying to get his
father's attention.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:37.750
And he said that he went through
these strobing intense light

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.570
dreams that he had were
in part sort of a response

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.430
to this father figure.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.640
But no, he did not grow
up with confidence.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.860
It was actually
quite the opposite.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.420
AUDIENCE: Tesla, as
we're discussing,

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.970
is a bit of a cult
figure in odd ways

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:55.340
and actually turns up
in popular culture.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:00.410
He shows up in some movies in
somewhat ahistorical fashion.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.662
What's your take on that?

00:30:05.662 --> 00:30:07.370
RICHARD MUNSON: The
thing that amazes me,

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:13.220
is that as I wrote
this book, my publicist

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:19.580
posted a small excerpt of
it on a Nikola Tesla club.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.590
I think it was based in Chicago.

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:25.790
And then suddenly the
Nikola Tesla club in Toronto

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:26.750
picked it up.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:29.240
And then there was a Nikola
Tesla club in Minneapolis.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.370
There are hundreds
of these things.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:35.710
And they're fervent
followers of the man.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:39.620
And so the dialogue that
goes back and forth on

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:42.650
whether what I wrote was halfway
true, or their new theory

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:46.280
of some conspiracy that was
associated with his final days.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.450
And whether he in fact did
do a death beam and the CIA

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.870
has squashed it.

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:57.140
So yes, he has a cult following.

00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.330
In the movie, I mean,
the perfect person

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:03.410
played him in one
movie, David Bowie.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:04.680
Is that not great?

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.970
I mean, David Bowie
and Nikola Tesla.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.750
And yes, they were not exactly
accurate in their depictions.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.260
They had this one scene
where Tesla's one dream was

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.950
that he was going
to send electricity

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.760
into the earth, a burst of the
lightning, artificial lightning

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.950
if you will, into the
earth and take advantage

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:28.730
of what he felt was the Earth's
natural electrical charge.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.760
And also take advantage of
resonance, or an echo of force.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.620
So that he could have charge
go throughout the planet

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:39.050
and people could basically
plug something into the earth

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.750
and have free
power, essentially.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:42.620
Well in this movie.

00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.000
It's really quite great.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.250
I mean, the stars are out there,
they're screwing light bulbs,

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.960
like hundreds of them
across this field.

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.330
That did not happen.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:00.290
But he does have,
indeed, a cult following.

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:03.380
And I think it's fair.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.930
I think it's in part--

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:10.130
he hasn't received the
recognition that, say,

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:11.730
Edison or Marconi have.

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:15.360
And this is not any knock
on those great inventors.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.130
But the "New York
Times" in their obituary

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.870
basically said that it was Tesla
who was the inventor of radio.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:25.910
And it was Tesla who brought
us the electric motor

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.680
and electricity transmission.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.860
And I don't think most people
recognize that and give him

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.600
his due.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:37.580
So if that necessitates also
having kind of the weirdness

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.140
involved, OK.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.600
What other questions?

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.600
AUDIENCE: Anything else?

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.000
RICHARD MUNSON: Yeah, please.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.010
So I was really curious about
you saying that he died poor

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.990
and he's like this
great inventor.

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:53.250
And I wanted to know what you--

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.850
I mean, what did
he feel about being

00:32:54.850 --> 00:33:00.480
rewarded, at least monetarily,
for this passion that he had?

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.370
And also, yourself as a
writer, and writers in general

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.260
also, being such hard workers
and not being [? venerated. ?]

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:07.760
I think--

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.385
RICHARD MUNSON: Boy,
is that the truth.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.300
You know, I'm not exactly
answering your question,

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:18.370
but let me try an angle and
you can tell me if I get there.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.180
He actually could have
been amazingly wealthy.

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.490
I mean, when he sold
his electric motor

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:26.304
patents to George Westinghouse,
he was living high on the hog.

00:33:26.304 --> 00:33:27.720
As I said, he was
eating his meals

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.550
at Delmonico's every
night, filet mignon.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:34.710
He lived in a large apartment
at the Waldorf Astoria, probably

00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.260
the best hotel then
in New York City.

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.390
He got tons of money.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:44.790
But Westinghouse, in large
part because JP Morgan--

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:49.650
the banker who was not exactly
a nice man, he wasn't--

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:53.160
tried to squeeze out George
Westinghouse not long

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:54.540
after the Niagara project.

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.400
Which is, you know, they
obviously spent a lot of money

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.240
to make this happen.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.250
And so they were a
little cash short.

00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:01.594
And the economy sort of
just does its cycles.

00:34:01.594 --> 00:34:03.010
And this was in
one of the cycles.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.900
So Westinghouse was
in not great shape.

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.840
And JP Morgan basically
tried to squeeze him out.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.250
And said, you know, you
either cut expenses immensely,

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:16.590
or you give your
company to me, and I'll

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:19.020
create the total
electricity trust, just

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:22.120
like what he did with
the steel industry.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.460
So Westinghouse goes to Tesla
and says, I'm in a real jam

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.370
here.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:29.489
You know, I'm about
to lose my company.

00:34:29.489 --> 00:34:35.870
And you have this royalty,
$2.50 per horsepower of motor.

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.639
I can't afford it.

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:41.310
Tesla is sitting there,
he has all the cards.

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:42.079
He has the patent.

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:44.510
He has the contract.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.650
And he's not a really
good businessman.

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:49.290
So he turns to
George Westinghouse

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:54.540
and says, oh, you've
been nice to me.

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:58.770
You're the one who will bring
my electric motor to the world.

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.800
I'm willing to tear
up my contract.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.070
He tore up a billion
dollars of money

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:06.280
that would have come his way.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.389
Simply, number one,
I don't think he

00:35:08.389 --> 00:35:09.430
was a great business man.

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.460
He certainly was a
horrible negotiator.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.260
But because he was an idealist.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.782
Here was a man who was going
to bring his invention, which

00:35:15.782 --> 00:35:17.740
he thought was the greatest
thing in the world.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:21.150
And I'm not [INAUDIBLE]
argue with that.

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.210
And for that, he was
willing to sacrifice

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.187
an amazing amount of wealth.

00:35:26.187 --> 00:35:28.020
I'm not sure if that
answered your question,

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.490
but I like that story better.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.300
AUDIENCE: Where was the lawyer?

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.665
RICHARD MUNSON: The lawyer
had died about a year before.

00:35:34.665 --> 00:35:34.950
AUDIENCE: Aw.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:35.939
RICHARD MUNSON: I know.

00:35:35.939 --> 00:35:37.230
This is when you need a lawyer.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:40.900
There are so many times you
don't, but this time you did.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.980
What other questions?

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.272
Yes please.

00:35:45.272 --> 00:35:46.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.070
Thanks very much.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.980
I was wondering if you ran
into any associations of Tesla

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:54.220
with the Boston area at
all during your research?

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:58.390
There is a Tesla Ave in
Medford over by Tops.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:01.160
And I've heard stories that
he used to live over there.

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.160
RICHARD MUNSON: I don't
know that he lived here.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:08.080
There is a very
interesting MIT connection,

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.090
which I probably shouldn't say.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:15.250
So in his later years,
when he was, to be honest,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:18.140
a little bit senile, but
also had flashes of genius,

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.140
he would have birthday
parties for himself.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.910
And he would invite reporters.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:25.060
And really, 50 of the major
reporters from the "New York

00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.310
Times," the "New York
Herald," "Time Magazine,"

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.710
all these people would
come and sit at his feet

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:33.570
for like five hours as the
great man would ramble on.

00:36:33.570 --> 00:36:37.270
90% of the time about
gibberish, and 10%

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:39.820
of the time about something,
oh my god, you know?

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:46.600
So one of his visions during
these birthday parties

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.990
was a death beam.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:53.610
Something like Star Wars
that could zap battleships

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:56.100
and airplanes out of the air.

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:58.884
All right, we're talking
in the early 1940s,

00:36:58.884 --> 00:37:00.550
at a time when we're
about to go to war.

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:05.560
And the thought of Nikola Tesla
dying and he had the designs--

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.580
possibly-- for a
death beam did not

00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:11.530
make the Federal
Bureau of Investigation

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:15.580
all that excited about allowing
his papers to go anywhere

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.250
in the world.

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:22.710
So they hired an MIT physicist
and assembled all of his papers

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:25.330
together, which
were in huge boxes.

00:37:25.330 --> 00:37:28.750
And he spent at least a week,
if not a couple of weeks,

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.620
being overseen by Naval
intelligence and federal FBI

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:34.330
agents as he went
through the documents.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:37.660
And there was one
that he actually

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.280
put the top secret clearance
on, because it was, in his mind,

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:48.610
close enough to being practical
that it needed to be considered

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:49.960
to be top secret.

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:52.120
The rest of it, he says,
basically the ramblings

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.010
of an old man.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:57.130
And I say that feeling old.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:38:00.040
But here's the
critical question.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.320
Does anybody know
who the MIT professor

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.370
was that they hired to do this?

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:07.746
John Trump.

00:38:07.746 --> 00:38:09.370
John Trump was a
member of the National

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.420
Academy of Engineering.

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:13.672
He won the National
Academy of Sciences award.

00:38:13.672 --> 00:38:15.880
He also happens to be the
uncle of the 45th President

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.924
of the United States.

00:38:17.924 --> 00:38:20.071
How's that?

00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:22.570
And in fact, when the current
president of the United States

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:26.260
was running for office, he
would refer to his uncle

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.480
as somebody really bright.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:33.466
Notice that I have a lot of
smart genes, I'm really bright.

00:38:33.466 --> 00:38:35.620
And it's because that's
my only sort of Boston

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.990
connection through MIT
was through Mr. Trump.

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.968
What other questions?

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:52.300
AUDIENCE: So what brought
them from Austria to the US?

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:56.440
RICHARD MUNSON:
He came because he

00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:02.266
had been installing Edison phone
systems in Budapest and Paris.

00:39:02.266 --> 00:39:04.390
To be honest, he had been
spending most of his time

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.560
thinking about electricity.

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.650
And in the Budapest park,
envisioned the engine.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:14.890
But he had done such a great job
that his supervisors sent him

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:18.520
to New York to actually work
with Thomas Edison himself.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:20.680
And they sent him
with, probably,

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.770
the greatest letter
of recommendation

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:25.210
that's ever been written.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.250
They said to Thomas Edison,
this letter to Thomas Edison,

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.040
I know of two great men.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.940
You are one of them and
this young man is the other.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:37.390
So they worked
together, actually.

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:41.380
But I mean, they were totally
different temperaments.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.200
I mean, Edison was frumpy.

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.350
He was crass.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.350
I mean, he was a genius.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:48.183
I'm not-- you know,
there's no knocking him.

00:39:48.183 --> 00:39:49.390
He just sort of was.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:56.260
Tesla was this immaculately
refined cosmopolitan

00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:01.090
that spoke eight languages, knew
literature fluently, and looked

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:04.090
like he dressed like he was
ready to go to the opera

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:05.899
during the day.

00:40:05.899 --> 00:40:06.940
So the two of them just--

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:08.564
they were different
sort of characters.

00:40:08.564 --> 00:40:12.772
And they argued vehemently
about how to transmit power.

00:40:12.772 --> 00:40:14.980
I mean, Edison wanted to do
it through direct current

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.310
because he thought it
was, number one, his.

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:20.740
And safer was his
biggest argument.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:23.470
And Tesla was far more
interested in trying

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:25.600
to send it long distances
so that more people

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.790
could take advantage of it.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:30.340
And in fact-- this is
more than your question

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:37.450
was-- but they split
because Edison refused

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:43.180
to provide the promised
bonus if Tesla would increase

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.630
the efficiency of one of
the dynamos, or generators.

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:49.390
And Tesla had worked
like three months

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:51.710
to triple the output
of this thing.

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:54.040
Then he goes to the Wizard
of Menlo Park, who he still

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.000
idolized at this time,
and Edison basically

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.260
just mocked him.

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.500
And said, oh come
on, that was a joke.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.876
And then, to this
young immigrant

00:41:03.876 --> 00:41:06.250
who is still a little sensitive
about being in the United

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.392
States, he says, you're
such an immigrant.

00:41:08.392 --> 00:41:09.850
If you were only
an American, you'd

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.280
appreciate an American joke.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.290
[? Edison ?] of
course, did not laugh.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:16.620
He put on his bowler
hat, appropriately so,

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.160
and walked out and quit his job.

00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.730
And started his own company.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.600
So that's how he got
to United States.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.690
AUDIENCE: All right,
thank you very much again.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:22.900
It was wonderful.

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:23.260
RICHARD MUNSON: Thank you.

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:24.910
I appreciate you guys having me.

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:26.159
And I hope you enjoy the book.

00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:28.890
[APPLAUSE]
