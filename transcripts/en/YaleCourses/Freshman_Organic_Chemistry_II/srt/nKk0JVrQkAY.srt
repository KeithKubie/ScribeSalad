1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,561
Okay.

2
00:00:01,561 --> 00:00:06,240
So we've been talking about electrophilic
addition and the nuclear fillic aspect

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:07,074
of it.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,000
And today we'll extend that to talk about
Psycholo audition and also there'll be

5
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:16,710
some practical applications with respect
to epoxides and ask the towels and how

6
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:21,280
they work. Okay, so first
about that problem, uh,

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
I gave you last time about drawing nice
curved arrows to show the Pinot call

8
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:30,420
rearrangement. So how does it start out?
What's the first thing that happens?

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,540
Wells. Do you have an idea
for acid ketalysis here?

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,870
What's the very first thing that happens?

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,990
Do early in the morning?
First funny. Sorry.

12
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,170
Probates. What? Okay.

13
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,570
So protonate the Oah and
then water can leave.

14
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,640
Why is it good for water to leave,
Chris?

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,073
Okay.

16
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,840
Uh, yeah. Oh, three

17
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,270
plus. He's good at losing things. How
about the other aspect I'm going to have,

18
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,190
I think it's leaving other
than the water charge. Yeah.

19
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,610
How about where the charge goes?

20
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,910
What's it going to be when the water
leaves? The water will reduce your trash.

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,710
Pardon me? That from a positive
charge. Neutral charging space.

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,610
Yeah, the water wheel. But we're caring.

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,980
We care about the organic thing
more than about the water.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,860
We left a negative check. No, no.

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,410
The thing is a cad. I am,
if you lose neutral water,

26
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,140
the charge will stay.

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,600
Where will it be on the art?
Is that a good place for it to be?

28
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:47,440
A yes. Why?

29
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:51,010
Why is tertiary store share?

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,590
All right. Okay. So we get a nice tertiary
cat. Die. Now. Does anybody, what?

31
00:01:55,591 --> 00:02:00,090
Did anybody think about the
next step here? Yeah, Kate.

32
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,920
Uh Huh.
I thought I'd shift good.

33
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,470
So the method could shift
over at rearrangement.

34
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,000
And now you have this cat I and now, okay,
you're going to tell me about this cat.

35
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:18,880
I, and we started already with a very
good cad ion, a tertiary cad ion.

36
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,800
Right? That's as good as
they get with, uh, with,

37
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,450
unless you have double bonds next door.
Okay. But what's the driving force?

38
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:29,690
Why should it go this direction?
What's good about being on the right?

39
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,580
Uh, uh, no, I don't think
you could say the CEO,

40
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:51,220
but it's true. It's true that
the CEO bond is a lower Lumo. Uh,

41
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,690
but to the extent that the oxygen, the
reason it's low is because of the oxygen.

42
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,620
Right? And that oxygen is
withdrawing charge from carbon,

43
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,170
withdrawing electrons from the carbon
tended to make the carbon positive anyhow.

44
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,870
So if the carbons already positive,

45
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,230
it's not such a great place
to put more positive charge.

46
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,470
So to the extent that that
sigma bond is important,

47
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,450
you'd think it would
go the other direction.

48
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:20,590
The oxygen would be electron
withdrawing and destabilize a cat. I am.

49
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,840
Can anybody see why it could be good

50
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,450
to have the oxygen next door?
It's certainly not that sigma bond.

51
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,810
What about the unshared pair?

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,180
Yeah. You know, actually

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,320
I would say the other way around
the electrons or something real.

54
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,053
Right.

55
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,150
And they get stabilized by mixing with
the low vacant orbital that's associated

56
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:03,110
with a positive charge. It's the
electrons that get lower in energy. Okay.

57
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,070
But you're absolutely right.

58
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:07,550
So you can draw a resonance structure
like that and that's why it's good to go

59
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:11,150
to the right. Okay. Now how do
you get from there to the product

60
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,290
Jack? Yeah, you just lose a proton.

61
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,500
Right? And you forgot the
product. So that's the niche,

62
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,430
the mechanism of the pinnacle
rearrangement. It's all
steps that you, uh, no, well,

63
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,780
but you have to think and
put them together. So that's
just an exercise in that.

64
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,191
Okay.
Now,

65
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:42,191
back to these simultaneous reactions
that are involved in addition to alkanes.

66
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,880
Simultaneous in the sense that
there's both a electro file,

67
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:49,700
which is what they're typically
called electrophilic additions,

68
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,240
but also a nuclear file that's
participating at the same time.

69
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:56,240
When we saw this last time with,
with Dai chlorocarbon,

70
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,410
which your neighbor came on edge on and
then rotated in order to make the two

71
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,360
new bonds to give a cycle of propane.

72
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,070
And we saw it in hydro bore ration
where the vacant orbital on the BIA tax,

73
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,810
but at the same time,
the high a homo B h, uh,

74
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,250
mixes with, with the,
uh, with the, uh, uh,

75
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,740
Pi Star orbital.
Okay.

76
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,520
So now we're going to go on to a different
kind of way of making a cyclo propane

77
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,620
with what's called the
Simmons Smith Reagent,

78
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,360
and then into an epoxidation add
in just an oxygen to a double bond.

79
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:37,361
To give a three membered oxirane
ring and then Ozal analysis,

80
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:38,710
which is a,
uh,

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,800
a more dramatic kind of cyclo audition
to give a ring and then we probably won't

82
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:49,991
get today to a catalytic hydrogenation
and to a polymerization and metathesis

83
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:55,520
wear metals are involved. So
we'll do those others. Uh, today,

84
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,210
first so called Simmons Smith,
uh,

85
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,700
our reagent or a car being annoyed.

86
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,720
We talked about CCL two
a car been last time.

87
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:10,700
That's a free species. It's pretty
reactive but it's, but it floats free.

88
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:11,870
It has an existence.

89
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,370
These are called carbon oil because
they don't really give a free car been,

90
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:21,670
but they give a product as if it were a
car being that is the ch two in a three

91
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:26,480
membered ring and the the
reagents as you can see,

92
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:28,300
our uh,
uh,

93
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,340
methylene iodide ch two I two and
a thing called zinc copper couple.

94
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,850
And I don't know where the name couple
came from except that they're two metals

95
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,510
there.

96
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:42,530
But it turned out that having a little
copper with the zinc made it work better.

97
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:46,460
So I don't know. Anyhow, zinc as
they is the operative group here.

98
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,130
But something the copper clearly
has something to do with it.

99
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:53,600
This was developed at dupont
central research in Wilmington,

100
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:56,600
Delaware where Howard Simmons
was the director of research,

101
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,260
first of worried about metals
and [inaudible] highlights.

102
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,740
So you have a metal and an Al Haylight.

103
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,330
Now metals tend to be over on
the left of the periodic table.

104
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,880
What does that mean about their electrons?

105
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,930
Are the highest valence electrons held
tightly or are they able to give up

106
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:18,764
electrons

107
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,490
compared to most things?
They have a high homo.

108
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,220
Yeah.

109
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,340
Things that are on the left
of the periodic table don't
have such a big nuclear

110
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:30,620
charge given the row they're in.

111
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,030
So they're relatively good at
giving up electrons. How about rx?

112
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,780
What makes it reactive?
A halide on our,

113
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,250
what's its characteristic reactivity?
Ayesha?

114
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,840
Yeah,
low Lumo Sigma Star.

115
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:50,320
So we have something that could give
electrons and something that can take it.

116
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,330
So it won't surprise you that this,

117
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,710
that you can get an electron transfer
from the metal and it's just uh, you know,

118
00:07:56,711 --> 00:08:00,940
a metallic metal. It's not an ion in
solution, it's just a metal. Okay.

119
00:08:00,941 --> 00:08:04,570
But at the surface of the metal and
electron could be transferred to Rx.

120
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,720
Now where does that electron go in the rx?

121
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,600
I show you got us onto this.

122
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,700
Yeah. What oracle does it go
into and what does star mean?

123
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,730
That

124
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,270
the bonding.

125
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:23,100
So what's going to happen when you
put an electron and get our x minus?

126
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,700
It's also a radical, it's got an odd
number of electrons. But what does,

127
00:08:26,701 --> 00:08:28,650
what's the role of that last electron?

128
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,220
What does the star mean?
Anti-Bonding what happens?

129
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,610
You put electrodes in the anti-bonding.
Orbital. What does it do? Right?

130
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,560
Breaks the law.
The electric

131
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,500
brakes breaks the bond.
Okay,

132
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:48,501
so that the apair we'll go there and now
you've got x minus and the are radical,

133
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,560
but the are radical is generated
right next to them to the metal.

134
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,010
So you can get a transfer of making of

135
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,360
a bond between that radical
and an Adam in the metal. Okay?

136
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,910
So you get an owl keel,
metal bond, and x minus.

137
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,040
This is shown,
uh,

138
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,730
this is shown as if the
metal is divalent like zinc.

139
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,170
So it makes a bond to our and has a
positive charge and then it's associated

140
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:20,370
with the x minus. If it had been
a monovalent metal like lithium,

141
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,840
then it wouldn't have had the charge.
It would be our lithium. Right.

142
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:27,720
And there would be two lithium
Adams would've been involved.

143
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,160
Another one would be lithium
plus that goes with the x
minus. But at any rate, uh,

144
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,930
this is how you make, uh, uh, Al
Kio metal bonds in the first place.

145
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,640
Okay.

146
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,640
So the next three slides
suggest a plausible mechanism
for this formation of the

147
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:49,200
Cyclo probate. But as we'll
see, it's probably not correct,

148
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,120
but let's just take this as an
opportunity to practice, uh,

149
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,670
figuring out how mechanisms might work.
Okay.

150
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,900
So we could react zinc
with a methyl chloride,

151
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,790
right. And we get, uh,

152
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,290
we get this reaction that was shown
on the bottom of the previous slide,

153
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,020
a metal zinc bond and chloride.

154
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,070
And I've shown it covalent between
the chloride and the zinc. Right?

155
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,280
We showed plus minus last time.
Okay.

156
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,840
And this we're going to use as
a model for the actual reaction,

157
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:26,520
which had a ch two I two as the
starting material with zinc.

158
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,620
So it gave I z e n c h two eyes.

159
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:33,270
So we've simplified it here so we can
draw orbitals that are a little simpler.

160
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,010
Okay?
That's the Lumo of that model compound.

161
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:41,160
And mostly it's a four
s orbital on the zinc,

162
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:45,160
which is anti bonding to the things
on either side, right? Which,

163
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,010
which take away part of it. Okay. Cause
you have anti-bonding nodes there.

164
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:50,844
Of course.

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So that's the Lumo and the homo
is mostly a p orbital on the zinc.

166
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,010
Okay? That's actually
the Lumo plus one. Okay.

167
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,750
Now if you bend the zinc,
you'll mix those two.

168
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:11,520
They'll hybridize. So if you bend
it, that's the four P on zinc.

169
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,060
If you bend it as it's approaching the
transition state where the zinc is going

170
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:19,440
to be approaching the CC double bond,

171
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,610
then you hybridize that central one and
you get an orbital. It looks like this.

172
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,530
And that's an sp hybrid sp
something or other on the zinc.

173
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,420
Okay. Now notice that,
that uh, that's the Lumo,

174
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,070
right?

175
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:39,540
So what's it well set up to
do with respect to the alkene?

176
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,550
What can it overlap with?

177
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Amy Sigma is down in the middle
of where the of the carbons,

178
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:55,480
the pie right is sticking up where
you need it to overlap. Okay?

179
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,570
So that can overlap with the homeowner
and you're going to get a pair of

180
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:01,060
electrons that's bonding
between these two things,

181
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:06,010
between the zinc and the two
carbons. Okay. But this is again,

182
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:06,821
one of those cases.

183
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:10,600
So we have an electro file on
top of Lumo attacking an Alkane,

184
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,650
but we can also look at the homo on top.
Oh,

185
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,840
that's the electron shifting
into the bonding region.

186
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,630
So we can also look at the homo on top.

187
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,660
And what does that look well set up to do.

188
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:28,760
Matt, what do you say it
with respect to the alkene?

189
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:32,120
What orbital of the alkene
could that react with

190
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,473
the,

191
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,900
yes. What about the double bonds? Which
specific? Orbital. That's a double bond.

192
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,020
The Pi Star Five Star, right?
Which is the vacant orbital,

193
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:46,070
which is what you want this, the whole
model. The Lubo downstairs is the,

194
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,790
is what we want there. And you see
those are well set up to react.

195
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,470
So we could do electron donation in the
other direction. Top to bottom. Right?

196
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,700
So were you were taking electron pair
from top to bottom also previous slide,

197
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:02,210
bottom to top. So we're
forming two new bonds, right?

198
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,710
So we can draw curved arrows
like this and like that. Right?

199
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:12,340
And what we've done now is
form this product where zinc
is added at one side and

200
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,770
methyl at the other.
Okay.

201
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,280
Now if head we remember this, we just
drew. So the orbitals would look simpler.

202
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,720
If we had been using that thing that
had to Aja dins audit instead of one

203
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:29,120
chlorine,
then the product would have been,

204
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:33,740
this would've been the same
reaction. Okay. But that
would have been the product.

205
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,140
And now what makes this reactive?

206
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,660
Could you see where there
might be a low Lumo in this?

207
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,393
Any ideas?

208
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,860
Cassie Sigma star in
the carbon halogen bond,

209
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,660
right. That would be a low
Lumo. Okay. How about the homoe?

210
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,230
Where would it be an unusually high homo?

211
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,850
So carbon with a halogen is unusually low,

212
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,760
right? What's the analog that's
unusually high carbon with what

213
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,080
was a battle right is unusually high.

214
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:19,770
So the carbon zig bond would
be unusually high. Sigma,

215
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:24,771
zinc c and the Lumo is sigma star CCL.

216
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:30,900
I left one of the C's out. Okay,
so could you see what could happen?

217
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:32,943
Yeah,

218
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,420
what, what, what, what?

219
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,320
So you have a high homo
attacking a c x Bod.

220
00:14:38,321 --> 00:14:39,670
Where have we seen that before?

221
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,890
What reaction has a high homo attack?

222
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,920
Sigma Star see x where x is a halogen?

223
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,690
Pardon me? Okay. Theories.

224
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,190
Hydro duration is such a case,

225
00:14:57,191 --> 00:14:59,350
and I'd have to think about
whether this is an example.

226
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,480
I had an even simpler example in mind.

227
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,080
S and to write a backside
attack by the high homo.

228
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:12,820
So we can have the homo form
of attack, the carbon, right?

229
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:17,500
The iodide is the leaving group, right?
And that then would form the double bar,

230
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,630
the the three membered ring.
Okay.

231
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,230
So that's a very plausible mechanism.
It has two steps.

232
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:29,290
First you have the addition of zinc,
zinc,

233
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,970
haylight and the,
and the carbon group.

234
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,120
And then in a second step you do the,

235
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,750
the sn two type reaction to
s to form the second bond.

236
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,880
So the first reaction for them,

237
00:15:40,881 --> 00:15:45,560
the bond on the right between the two
seats CHDS and the second reaction form

238
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:50,180
this one. Okay, but that
probably is not the way it goes.

239
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:54,470
It's probably not to transition states,
we just guessed that.

240
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:59,000
But there was a quantum
mechanical calculation of
what the transition state for

241
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,640
this should look like and they
found something different.

242
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,790
So although that mechanism is plausible,

243
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,250
it probably occurs in a
single step according to this
calculation with this bent

244
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,830
transition state.
Okay.

245
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,670
So this is the transition state where
everything is happening at once.

246
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,830
And let's look at what that is.
Okay.

247
00:16:18,831 --> 00:16:22,730
First we could look at how the thing
moves through the transition state.

248
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,410
You see the carbon's going closer.

249
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,280
The IOD is going away from the
carbon and the zinc going away. Okay.

250
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:29,114
Let's see what happens.

251
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,140
Notice incidentally that the ch two
group is like this and is rocking in.

252
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,350
Where have you seen that before?

253
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:39,730
Yeah.

254
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,440
Where's the ch two group is so excitable
approaches sideways and then rocks in

255
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,140
seen that before. Ellen. Yeah,

256
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,310
a true,

257
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,980
a true carbines CCL two did exactly that
in order to get the orbitals to match

258
00:16:56,981 --> 00:17:01,510
up. So let's look at the orbitals in the
transition state for this on the way to

259
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:04,360
making the cyclo propane and,
okay,

260
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,740
so this is at the transition
state geometry, right?

261
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,230
And here's the Lumo.
What is that?

262
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,350
That the Lumo of the zinc reagent.

263
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:17,340
Okay.

264
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,340
What would you call that? Orbital. Yeah,

265
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,813
yeah,

266
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:25,650
yeah. Sigma Star between
zinc in the eye then. Right,

267
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,860
so that's the Lumo and it mixes.

268
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:32,850
You can see it's well set up to mix
with the Pi Homo at the same time.

269
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:37,020
This is the homo minus two,
so it's very near the homo.

270
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:39,030
So very high energy or but what's that?

271
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:43,290
Well set up to overlap with Matt here,
our expert on this.

272
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,570
What about the Alkene as well?
Set up their Pi Star, right?

273
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,510
Blue on the right. Read on the left. Okay.

274
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:55,140
So we can do both of them at once and
make the two new bonds and break the

275
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:59,280
others. Okay. Now, here's the next
reaction we want to talk about,

276
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,670
which is an analogous reaction in the
sense of forming two bonds at once with a

277
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:09,330
reaction between an alkene
and a per carboxylic acid.

278
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,910
If we didn't have the red oxygen there,

279
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:14,520
if that hydrogen were directly
attached to the oxygen,

280
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:17,520
below that group would
be a carboxylic acid.

281
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,910
This is called a per asset per means.

282
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,850
Two oxygens linked together,

283
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,070
which is of course not a very stable bond.

284
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,950
Do you remember why it's not so
stable to have two oxygens in a row,

285
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,400
right? You have two pairs of electrons
that are repelling one another across the,

286
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,680
across the bond.
Okay,

287
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:47,681
so that's a medical hero per benzoic
acid is a commonly used reagent for this

288
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,470
and the product you see,

289
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:54,471
he gives the more stable carboxylic acid
and oxygen attached to the double bond.

290
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:57,020
Our question is what the mechanism is.

291
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,320
It's also interesting to wonder why you
use metta chloro per Roxy benzoic acid.

292
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:09,080
Why up? Why not para? Why is it
that just seems a weird choice.

293
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,530
It's interesting why it's chosen.

294
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,800
It's because it crystallizes very easily
and that the crystals of it are very

295
00:19:18,021 --> 00:19:22,070
stable. So it can be stored for a very
long time without NDD composition,

296
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:25,460
even though essentially it's
rather unstable compound. Right?

297
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,700
So it's that practical application that
means that this particular one is the

298
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,300
one that's often chosen,

299
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:35,630
although others could be used as
well as there are groups on the,

300
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,130
on the per acid functionality.
Okay.

301
00:19:40,131 --> 00:19:42,140
So you see that in this particular case,

302
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,050
which I took as an example
from the Jones book,

303
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,110
it was done in a at 25 degrees,

304
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:52,730
had benzene for five hours and gave
an 81% yield when our is and Hexcel.

305
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:56,420
So it's a pretty good reaction.
Okay.

306
00:19:56,421 --> 00:19:58,880
So to look at what the
orbitals are involved,

307
00:19:58,881 --> 00:20:02,820
let's just make that our group
instead of Metta Chloro, uh,

308
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,310
benzene, make it the, uh,
make it just a hydrogen.

309
00:20:07,311 --> 00:20:12,311
So this is per oxy formic acid where the
extra oxygen is obviously here and that

310
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:17,240
hydrogen been here. It would've
been formic acid. And let's just,

311
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:18,380
uh,
uh,

312
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,400
distort that to the geometry
it has at the transition state.

313
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,490
So you see the oxygen oxygen
length increased a little
bit in the hydrogen bent

314
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:31,940
up a bit. Okay. Now we'll rotate it.

315
00:20:31,941 --> 00:20:36,110
So to get the idea of how we're going
to look at it and rotate it back a bit.

316
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,890
Okay. And now we're going to
look at the orbitals that has,

317
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:44,370
so it has a bunch of occupied orbitals of
course, but the one we're particularly,

318
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,880
and it has a bunch of unoccupied orbitals
but we're particularly interested in

319
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:50,710
its Lumo.
Okay.

320
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,700
What's the Lumo going to be at Lisa?
What do you think?

321
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,990
There's several possibilities
that come up with anything.

322
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,800
Anybody else got an idea?
Carl Sigma Star.

323
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:19,570
Oh remember that's oxygen. Big
Negative. Big nuclear charge.

324
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,410
Okay.

325
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,410
Can you see any other thing that might
be a low Lubo Carl Pi Star of CEO is also

326
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:31,450
low. So in principle either of those
might be the reaction. So you learn,

327
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,343
you learn.

328
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,340
So that's the really the problem often
in choosing mechanisms that there's

329
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:40,030
several possibilities and you
have to consider them all.
And if they're, you know,

330
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:42,970
two possibilities and then at the
next step to more in two more,

331
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:45,220
just to be a pretty big number.
But at any rate,

332
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,740
those are the two that you
might consider at the beginning.

333
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:49,560
And once you know that,

334
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,100
once you've tried these several paths
than you can see which one's going to give

335
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:57,280
you the product that you know by
experiment is actually the product.

336
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,310
And it turns out to be the,
this one, the sigma star. Oh,

337
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,370
okay. Now, uh,

338
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,670
now how about the Lumo of this thing
or the department? That was the Lumo.

339
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,620
Here's the homo. Actually it's not
the homo, it's the homo minus three,

340
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,930
but,
but do you see what it's made of?

341
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:21,810
Yeah.

342
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,190
What's this big thing here?

343
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,250
That's The p orbital on oxygen,
right? The unshared pear.

344
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,350
And it's mixed with this up here,

345
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:36,400
which notices three p orbitals in a row.
Right?

346
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:40,810
So that's a p orbital on
this oxygen and that, uh,

347
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:46,110
the Pi electrons of the CEO Double Bond
mixing together in a bonding way here,

348
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,660
but anti-bonding here.
That's why if it had had been bought,

349
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,700
had this been read in that been blue,

350
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,040
then this would have been
a lower energy orbital.

351
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,360
So this is the anti-bonding combination
of those two and it happens to be home

352
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,010
minus three. Okay, so that's the, that's
the homo we're going to be interested in.

353
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,540
So that's mostly as we said,
the Pi on that oxygen,

354
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:10,280
the p orbital and also Pi Alcoholic.

355
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,070
Remember Al Lilly is three P orbitals
in a row all pointing in the same

356
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:17,170
direction.
So they overlap side decide.

357
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,593
Okay.

358
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,150
And there we've turned it a little further
just so you can see that it's those p

359
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:27,470
orbitals and now we're going to look
at it as it interacts with the carbon

360
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:28,580
carbon double bond.

361
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:34,130
So the first interaction is going to
be that that Lumo of the oxygen oxygen

362
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:36,680
bonds Sigma Star,
that's the electro file.

363
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:42,010
That's the Lumo and the high occupied
orbital is going to be our old favorite,

364
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:46,310
a Pi of the double.
Okay,

365
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:50,570
so that will do this. What does that
reaction reminds you of? A little bit.

366
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,290
When something comes in from one side
and a group believes with its electrons

367
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:58,040
from the other side,
sn two of course.

368
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,830
So it's the same kind of reaction.
Okay.

369
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:05,810
So that's an sn two attacking
oxygen, not carbon of course. Okay.

370
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:10,580
So that's going to form a new bond and
the leaving group notice is a fairly good

371
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:13,460
and I on Carbox alight,
right.

372
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,780
Better Than Ben r o minus.
Okay.

373
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:23,120
Now what makes this reactive?
What could happen next? Elisa?

374
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,260
Oh,
we it

375
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,000
positive charge on carbon. So that's going
to be a very low energy orbital there.

376
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,480
Okay.
And uh,

377
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,390
where it could be a Hobo
that would react with that.

378
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,820
Hi.
Occupied Orbital Leon.

379
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,420
Okay. It could be that that
wasn't what I expected you to say.

380
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,880
That's going to be what it is.
But what other possibilities Leon

381
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,530
[inaudible]

382
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,990
Leon,
what are what,

383
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,150
what other possibility is there in that
when you look at this picture for a high

384
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:01,984
homo,

385
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,200
we've got a negative charge up here.

386
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:18,640
This oxygen looks to me like it has
a higher homos and this one does.

387
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,080
What advantage does yours have
over the one that's up there?

388
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:29,430
Pardon? It's closer, right? So the,

389
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:34,000
the electro file is going to be what Elisa
said that the p orbital on the carbon

390
00:25:34,001 --> 00:25:37,090
plus,
but the p orbital on the,

391
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,990
on the oxygen is going to
be the nucleophile and it
has the advantage of being

392
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:43,660
nearby. Okay? So that,

393
00:25:43,661 --> 00:25:46,570
that means we can do this
and make a second bod.

394
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:48,923
Hey,

395
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,300
and of course the plus charge will
move when we share the electrons.

396
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,690
Now what do we have for a Lumo here?

397
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,860
If we're going to do another reaction,

398
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,460
it's something to do with
the positive charge. What,

399
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:12,720
what particular orbital would you point
to if we had to choose a particular

400
00:26:12,721 --> 00:26:16,290
orbital? See the, the, the
charge is not an orbital.

401
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,030
The charge makes an orbital low,

402
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,960
makes the electrons in an
orbital low in energy nearby.

403
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,830
But what orbital will we look
at? Jack, you got to idea,

404
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,820
all right. Pardon me?
I couldn't get a pie.

405
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,500
Which pie?
A

406
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Oh, a. A P orbital on
oxygen. Uh, there's not a,

407
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,070
that's not a v P orbitals on oxygen
are all filled with electrons.

408
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,610
We're looking a vacant orbital,
right?

409
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:49,080
It's true that the unshared pair on
oxygen is lower in energy than it would

410
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:53,220
normally be, but that doesn't
make it reactive. Right?

411
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:57,840
A pair for a pair of electrons to be
reactive, they have to be high in energy,

412
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,020
not low. We want some vacant
orbital that'll be low,

413
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,740
unusually low in energy.
Chris,

414
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,530
the d orbital, no, it, you know,
if you get to sulfur or something,

415
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:12,540
if you get down to the next
row of the periodic table,

416
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:16,770
then their d orbitals that are
vacant in the valence shell,

417
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,070
but on Oxygen D is,
is way up in the next show.

418
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,770
A sigma stars of could be Sigma Star CEO.

419
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,640
And the other possibility could be seeking
to star Ceo any other possibilities

420
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:36,090
of Sig Sigma Star Oh, age, right?

421
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,320
That's the kind of thing you're
thinking of because when you have,

422
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,970
when you have an old plus that's
protonated, right? Three bonds,

423
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:49,810
one of them a proton. What do you
think of happening? Losing the Proton,

424
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:55,150
right? That, that's that sigma star. Ooh,
okay. So that's going to be our, our,

425
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,800
uh,
our electrify all.

426
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:00,250
That's where the electrons are going to
go into sigma star Oah and break that

427
00:28:00,251 --> 00:28:03,610
bond. Where are they going to come
from? Where's the High Homo? Leon?

428
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:08,020
Let's go back to you now.
Now you've got the negative charge here,

429
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,930
but there's something interesting
about this negative charge.

430
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,130
The reason that was a good place to put
a negative charge that Karbach slate was

431
00:28:15,131 --> 00:28:20,131
a good leaving group was that there was
a carbonyl group of c o double bond next

432
00:28:20,141 --> 00:28:22,660
door,
and we can denote that.

433
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,690
So we're going to have an sn two at age,
right?

434
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:30,190
We're going to attack and notice where
we're going to attack from backside,

435
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:35,410
right? These attacks are always
backside to break a sigma star. Okay?

436
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,490
Now,

437
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:41,440
so the trouble with this oh
minus is it's not backside.

438
00:28:41,441 --> 00:28:42,280
It's out in the front.

439
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,750
Can you see how we could
get it into the back?

440
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,210
How can we get this charge back near here?

441
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:00,800
What Way Carl suggested is to move the
anti and it's not bonded after all. Okay,

442
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:05,470
but there's a clever way to do it.
Not that you're not covered.

443
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,393
What's this?

444
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,940
Does that suggest anything?
That's why carboxylase is a
good leaving group, right?

445
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:20,090
Cause its resonance stabilized.
But what does that suggest,

446
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,133
Sebastian?

447
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,600
You don't need to use this at a high end.

448
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,850
You could use this and I am, because
the charge is both places here, right?

449
00:29:33,851 --> 00:29:35,320
So we could draw that,

450
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,190
put the charge over there and a
double bond here in front. Okay.

451
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,520
So now we've got it where it needs to be.
Okay,

452
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,260
now we can do the backside attack,
move the Proton over,

453
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,453
right?

454
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,880
And we have those products,
the carboxylic acid without its oxygen,

455
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,290
that extra oxygen that the
per acid had and oxygen,

456
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:04,040
they added to the carbon carbon double
bond to give a three member green and oxy

457
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,980
reign as it's called,
or an EFP oxide.

458
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:12,020
Now the interesting thing
about this is why did you know,

459
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:15,050
I said Carl had the great idea,

460
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,150
let's just move it to
where it needs to be.

461
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:20,480
But there's a reason I
didn't want to move things.

462
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:26,290
The reason is that in fact
all those steps are not steps.

463
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,820
They all happen at the same time,

464
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,883
right?

465
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,580
So in fact, when you start with that
material and bring it up to the carbon,

466
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:39,000
carbon double bond,
all those things happen at once,

467
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:44,700
right? It made sense looking at
them one of the time, but in fact,

468
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:47,400
they could all happen at the same time,
right?

469
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,360
So you have minimal atomic displacement
and you are directly from this to

470
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:52,760
transfer the oxygen atom

471
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,000
and get that,
okay?

472
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,390
But they don't happen
strictly in parallel.

473
00:30:58,391 --> 00:31:01,810
Just because they're all happening at
the same time doesn't mean that they're

474
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:05,820
all halfway done at the same time.
Some were a little leading somewhere,

475
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,700
a little trailing, but they're
all happening together with men.

476
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,650
Minimal atomic motion.
How do I know that?

477
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:16,210
Because of this paper that was
published in Jacs at 1991. Now,

478
00:31:16,211 --> 00:31:20,080
that's 20 years ago, and you can do
much better calculations, I'm sure now.

479
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:23,500
But this is when it was done and
published and it's, it's believable.

480
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,760
This is what they calculated for the
geometry at the transition state,

481
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:31,930
and they give and every,
uh, in every case, what the,

482
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,030
what the length of that bond and
what the bond angles are. Okay?

483
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:40,570
Now notice that that Oh woe is strongly
stretched at the transition state,

484
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:45,110
so it's really broken a lot, right?
But in the electrons in the anti bonds,

485
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,460
it started to break.
It's 1.87 where it,

486
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,960
where normally it was 1.5 roughly.
Okay.

487
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,270
But notice that the Oah bond,

488
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:59,710
remember that h is going to transfer
from o one to o three at the transition

489
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,330
state is hardly stretched at all.

490
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:06,331
It started at about one angst drum and
it's 1.01 here at the transition state.

491
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,863
So it,

492
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,960
it actually is going to do most of its
motion after the transition state and I

493
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:17,200
put k h k d is about one that is,

494
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,660
there's not a kinetic
isotope effect on this.

495
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,830
Does that surprise you that there's
not a kinetic isotope effect

496
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:28,480
that deuterium and hydrogen are
transferred at the same rate?

497
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,750
Yeah.
What?

498
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,870
What does it tell you when there's a,
when there's a hydrogen isotope effect,

499
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,150
hydrogen deuterium isotope effect.

500
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,780
What does that you about the
mechanism about the transition state,

501
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,830
but it's an intermediate. No, it
doesn't tell you it's an intermediate,

502
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:50,160
oh,
pardon me.

503
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:54,830
Step,

504
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,280
the hydrogen is being transferred
not before, not after,

505
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:00,530
but at the rate limiting step.

506
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,880
But in this case the bond isn't much
stretched at the transition state.

507
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:09,410
So there's not an isotope effect
because the most of the transfer of the

508
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:11,960
hydrogen is happening later.
Okay.

509
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,370
So this shows the motion
successive motions.

510
00:33:16,371 --> 00:33:17,840
Here's the transition state.

511
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:23,050
Then p one p two are subsequent
stages on the reaction pathway.

512
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:27,560
And if you look at the motion
of each ass of each atom,

513
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,820
you see the hydrogen does most of its
motion from this auctions or this oxygen

514
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,480
after the transition state.
Right?

515
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,590
So just because all these
things are are coordinated,

516
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:43,100
you don't have distinct intermediate,
you have only one transition state,

517
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,450
but they don't all have to be 50% of the
way from starting material to product

518
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:49,970
at exactly the same instance.
Okay?

519
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:54,600
So you can see how the others are moving
as well. So notice that this, that,

520
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,790
that, that what after the transition
state this, the hydrogens are,

521
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,730
are moving down a little bit.
The carbons are moving up,

522
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:04,190
the oxygen is moving in
here to make the new bond.

523
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:07,370
And so on and the hydrogen
moving away and this thing,

524
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:11,690
this the carboxylated at the
top is rocking away, right?

525
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:16,010
Breaking the oxygen oxygen bond
here and forming the Oah bond here.

526
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,000
So there's only one transition state.

527
00:34:20,001 --> 00:34:23,180
This is said to be concerted in the
things in the sense that things are

528
00:34:23,181 --> 00:34:26,930
happening at the same time,
not several distinct intermediates,

529
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,010
but it's not synchronous. It's not
all happy. Exactly in parallel.

530
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,900
Okay.
Now the name of this transition state is,

531
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,510
they called it spyrow transition state.

532
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,700
Spyrow means two perpendicular
rings sharing a common atom.

533
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,740
So here it's Oh one here's one,

534
00:34:45,741 --> 00:34:49,370
this five member green here
and a three membered ring here,

535
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,640
but they're perpendicular to one another.
You see if they share it out,

536
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:56,330
and that's what spyrow means to
have a two rings that are Aspiro,

537
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,120
they share an out them and are
perpendicular to one another,

538
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,200
but in fact a very similar mechanism.
In fact,

539
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:07,560
arguably the same mechanism was
proposed by Professor Bartlett,

540
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:11,060
your grandfather in 1950 but he didn't.

541
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,740
This was before people thought so much
about spiral and about the arrangement in

542
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:18,080
space of orbitals as they do now.
In fact,

543
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,940
they didn't think about orbitals at all,
really in 1950 so he had in a pen,

544
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,660
in a paper in 1950 he drew this structure,
right,

545
00:35:26,661 --> 00:35:28,040
which shows the per Roxy,

546
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:32,240
carboxylic acid twisted around so the
hydrogen can make it from here to here

547
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,690
and, and the oxygen then
be transferred to that.

548
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:40,350
So this picture is taken from that
publication in 1950 but you'll notice that

549
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:43,470
the arrows were not at
all carefully drawn.

550
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,810
And what it's not clear what they mean.

551
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:51,180
This hydrogen in fact started attached
to this oxygen and is now moved over to

552
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:56,580
this oxygen and the product. So I have
no idea really what that Arrow meant.

553
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:01,410
Okay. So, but that was old days, right?

554
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:04,830
Before people talked about
orbitals and so on 60 years ago,

555
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:10,170
the problem is how about now? How
carefully do people draw such things now?

556
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:10,801
Well,

557
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:15,750
we could look at a modern textbooks
that has a drawing of this particular

558
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:17,670
reaction and draws it in that way.

559
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:22,230
And what I'd like you to think of as a
for a problem is compare the arrows in

560
00:36:22,231 --> 00:36:26,880
this textbook illustration with the ones
that we developed in the previous frame

561
00:36:26,881 --> 00:36:30,420
to show where homos and Lumos we're
interacting and how electron pairs were

562
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:31,254
shifting.

563
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:36,350
And see if you can draw your own diagram
that's more accurate than this textbook

564
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:41,310
one is. Okay? Okay.

565
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:44,700
Now, stereo specificity
of this APP, oxidation,

566
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,660
if the oxygen is really being
transferred this way all at once,

567
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:53,400
the two new bonds have to be on the
same face of the double bond, right?

568
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:58,910
So if you started with trans to
beauty and use this medical roper,

569
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:03,930
benzoic acid, then this is
a specific example, Don,

570
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:07,860
in this solvent Dioxane at
zero degrees for 10 hours.

571
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,490
Notice that this,
that,

572
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,890
that these two methyl groups are on
opposite sides of the three membered ring

573
00:37:13,891 --> 00:37:18,630
just as they were on opposite
sides of the Pi Bod here. Okay?

574
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,340
And this happens with
50 to 52 to 60% yield,

575
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:28,580
but more significant is that it's greater
than 99.5% trans that now a lot of

576
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:34,470
this,
this is an actual 52 to 60% yield.

577
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:38,340
That's what they actually got of pure
stuff and put it in the bottle. Right?

578
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,730
And you know that if you have to
distill stuff at the end and so on,

579
00:37:41,731 --> 00:37:46,580
you don't always get 100% so most
of this loss in this case, uh,

580
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:50,130
if all they had said was that a 60% yield,

581
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:55,200
you'd worry what's that other
40% could it be the CIS isomer?

582
00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:00,200
Right? But in fact, that's not what it was
because they tested and found that was,

583
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,470
there was no assist.
There was 99 more than 99 and a half.

584
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,420
The limits of their detection was trans.
So it's a concerted sit in addition,

585
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:14,020
both new, both do bonds from the
same face of the, of the, uh,

586
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,550
alkene.
And you'd worry about this also,

587
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:21,180
that this is the more stabilized them
or where the methyls aren't running into

588
00:38:21,181 --> 00:38:23,850
one another.
Maybe it wasn't specific,

589
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:26,010
but you just got the one
that was most stable.

590
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,610
So of course what they did
is do the CIS one as well.

591
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,710
And that's also a greater than 99
and a half percent CIS now not trans.

592
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,530
So it's clear that that the
reaction is stereo specific. Okay.

593
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:45,360
Now they did that in order to prepare
those epoxides for a dip for a another

594
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:46,510
purpose.

595
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:51,510
It had been prepared before in 1936 by
an alternative mechanism and this was

596
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:56,680
reacted it, it was two steps to do
it, so it was a harder way to make it.

597
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:01,480
But they started with the reagent,
h o c l hypochlorous acid.

598
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,900
How do you think h o c l will react?

599
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:09,663
Any ideas?

600
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,340
What are the reagent that
we've talked about reacting?

601
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:20,341
Does that remind you of this is a quarry
with an electro negative bond to it

602
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:25,420
bond to oxygen. What's
the, what's the, uh,

603
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,670
Lumo of that do you think?

604
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,480
Right. Oh, see all sigma star the
same as cc Clc, all sigma star.

605
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,440
And what kind of thing happens
with CLC? All Sigma Star. Remember?

606
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,340
Yeah.

607
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,750
If you reacted with an Alkane,

608
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,323
all right?

609
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,190
It forms a hallowed IA,
Mayan like that, right?

610
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,940
If the only difference is that in that
case it was, see all minus that's leaving,

611
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,930
in this case, it's o h
minus, that's leaving, okay?

612
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:10,250
But that's drawn in brackets because it's,
it's just an intermediate,

613
00:40:10,251 --> 00:40:12,980
it's not something that you isolate.
It's very reactive.

614
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:16,610
And what does it remember
you made hydroxide.

615
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,010
So what's going to be the
next stage of the reaction?

616
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,290
How will this react with hydroxide?

617
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,550
How did the one that had a
chlorine on it react with chlorine?

618
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:32,710
All right. It's an sn two kinds
of reaction, right? And in fact,

619
00:40:32,711 --> 00:40:34,630
you have water here that can also do it.

620
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,660
So it goes a 55% yield after distillation
of this stuff where you notice what

621
00:40:40,931 --> 00:40:45,820
happened was the oxygen attacked
back side open this ring, right?

622
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,010
So this caloric,

623
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:51,640
this methyl group is back and this methyl
group is back since we started with

624
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,280
sis.
Okay?

625
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:57,820
So we've got correlated configurations
that these two carbons notice,

626
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:01,180
it would've been just as easy for
the oxygen to attack this carbon.

627
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,040
It attack this one. It could have
attacked this one, right? So it could,

628
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,800
it came this way.
It could have come this way.

629
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,610
What's the relationship between the two
products you would get if you did those

630
00:41:12,611 --> 00:41:13,570
two reactions?

631
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,920
Hello there.
Even too much.

632
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,150
So you get not just this compound,
but also it's an anti tumor,

633
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,710
right?

634
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:33,890
But you don't get ones where this methyl
would be in fraud and the hydrogen and

635
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:38,660
back as shown there. Right? There are four
dietary verse. You only get two of them.

636
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:42,590
You get the two enantiomers.
Okay, then that,

637
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:44,180
so that's the first reaction they did it.

638
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:49,181
They got a 55% yield after distillation
and then very reacted it with Koh.

639
00:41:49,371 --> 00:41:54,290
Notice it's 20 molar Koh.
Pretty strong solution at 90 degrees.

640
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:59,060
That's a vigorous conditions in water
for two hours. How do you think,

641
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,620
Ooh, minus will it will react with this
stuff. I want several possibilities.

642
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,303
Okay.

643
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,270
What could ooh minus
attack in this molecule,

644
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,260
Chris deprotonated,
nitrogen,

645
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,940
deep protonate the hydrogen. What would
have been another possibility? Chlorine.

646
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,670
It could have been. It could have attacked
none an sn two here on the other one,

647
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:23,550
but it's rather a little bit hindered.
Right?

648
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:26,760
And generally proton
transfers are pretty fast.

649
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:32,360
So you were right the first time the
Koh takes off that and generates that an

650
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:37,170
ion. Now again, I've drawn
that in brackets because
it's just an intermediate.

651
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,700
What does it do?

652
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,280
Okay,

653
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:45,600
what does this, oh minus do Chris,

654
00:42:45,601 --> 00:42:46,470
you just told me.

655
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,420
Yeah.
What can it attack?

656
00:42:56,290 --> 00:43:00,670
It is the lone pair on the oxygen. What?
That's the high homo. What's the low Lumo?

657
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,980
See all the carbon
sigma star Carbon Sigma,

658
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:07,500
Star Card

659
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,460
chlorine.
What would you call that kind of reaction?

660
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,010
Ever see a reaction like
that before where? Oh,

661
00:43:12,011 --> 00:43:14,470
minus the tax carbon and chloride leaves.

662
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:19,780
Noel,
you ever seen a reaction like that?

663
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:24,070
And here it says send to,

664
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:24,851
right.

665
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:28,420
And it's helped out because this is held
very close to where it needs to be to

666
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:30,160
do the reaction.
Okay,

667
00:43:30,161 --> 00:43:35,161
so we do that and now
we formed the EFP oxide,

668
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,850
right?
Notice the Stereo Chemistry of,

669
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:41,920
this is interesting that the two,

670
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:46,180
the two carbons are on the same side of
the ring the same way they were on the

671
00:43:46,181 --> 00:43:50,210
same side of the Pi bond
here, right? But it happened.

672
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,160
The Stereo chemistry happened in
sort of an interesting way, right?

673
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,610
This is a 90% yield that they
got to this in the second step,

674
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,600
but since they'd had to do two
reactions from the starting material,

675
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:06,100
the overall yield was only 45% from
the original starting material,

676
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,150
right?

677
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,590
Do you remember what it was when they
used metal chloro per Roxy benzoic acid in

678
00:44:11,591 --> 00:44:13,570
the previous example,
to make this,

679
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,570
to make this same substance
from the same starting material?

680
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,010
You remember what the yield was
not, yeah, it was 60% right?

681
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,520
So nearly half again as much.
At least a third again as much.

682
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,300
And in just one reaction you had didn't
have to do this distillation and so on,

683
00:44:28,301 --> 00:44:32,580
so it was much more convenient that one,
the oxygen just went straight on.

684
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:37,710
Right? And it was a sin edition. This
one happens in an interesting way, right?

685
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:42,390
Because first it's a sin edition of
the cl plus both from the same side,

686
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:47,460
but then there's this sn two kinds of
reaction and it's an inversion at this

687
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:52,290
carbon. And then here there's
an inversion of that carbon.

688
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,330
Right? So overall, it's
still a sin edition,

689
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,620
but by two inversions.
Okay. So That's interesting.

690
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,420
Okay.
And this is,

691
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,810
this is somewhat reminiscent of
what we talked about last semester,

692
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,590
which is the Sharpless
asymmetric epoxidation it. Well,

693
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,410
I'll just run through this quickly.
We've done it several times before.

694
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:18,590
So you lose the Aro minus than a
proxy group comes up to the titanium,

695
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,311
right?

696
00:45:20,311 --> 00:45:25,170
We get that intermediate and
react it with Allie allow alcohol.

697
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,570
The OAH of the Al Alcohol replaces
that. Oh, are or that the,

698
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:32,940
the Aro replaces there to get this,

699
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,090
and now this double bond is
being held near this oxygen.

700
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:41,250
So the Lumo is the sigma star up there.
The same thing we've been talking about,

701
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,260
and the homo is pie.
And so we've made a bond,

702
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,850
right?
In fact,

703
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,620
this probably this pair of electrons
probably then makes a bond between oxygen

704
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:57,420
in this titanium rather than the aro
going away. But at the same time,

705
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,110
there's also the p on the
oxygen attacking Pi Star of CC.

706
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:03,120
This is exactly the
same thing we saw with,

707
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:07,890
we just saw a few slides ago
with the per benzoic acid. Okay?

708
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:12,210
So we make two bonds and put the
oxygen on from the same face.

709
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,150
But this particular arrangement makes the,

710
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:19,620
our configuration at this
tetrahedral carbon, right?

711
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:23,550
If we wanted to get the other
one, we'd have to rotate this, uh,

712
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:27,810
rotate this bond to be in front and this
to be in back so that we could attack

713
00:46:27,811 --> 00:46:30,840
the other face. Rotate
it back like that. Okay.

714
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,510
But you'll notice that if you do that,

715
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:38,970
those two groups in front are big
and they would run into one another.

716
00:46:38,971 --> 00:46:39,960
So you don't do that.

717
00:46:39,961 --> 00:46:44,220
You do the other one and they gives us
specific enantiomers of the epoxide.

718
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:48,540
But the relevance at this stage
that we talked about last semester,

719
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:53,250
the relevance at this stage is that it's
essentially the same mechanism that's

720
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:57,720
involved in the peroxide benzoic acid of
the electrons forming the two new bonds.

721
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:03,000
Okay,
so that that was a chiral oxidizing agent.

722
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:09,320
Now this is a big time making EFP
oxides from alkyds is really a big time

723
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:11,880
operation as is shown here.

724
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:17,300
This is done with silver ketalysis at 15
atmospheres of pressure and 250 degrees

725
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:22,761
Celsius and you notice that the source
of oxygen is o two in this case,

726
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:26,340
that's a really cheap source of oxygen.
In fact,

727
00:47:26,341 --> 00:47:30,610
they do use o two there are other people
who use who do the same kind of thing

728
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:31,840
who use air,

729
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,100
but it turns out to be worthwhile to use
o two rather than air because you get a

730
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:36,934
higher yield.

731
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,560
So what you get is an oxygen
that's transferred like that,

732
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,920
that's called ethylene oxide and that
process is generates 20 million tons a

733
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:54,340
year at worth $20 billion
of making ethylene oxide.

734
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,150
Just to give you an idea,
here's an aerial view of new haven.

735
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,440
And down here is where most of
you live on the old campus, right?

736
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,640
So if you had a bucket that would hold
that much ethylene oxide is a liquid,

737
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:09,190
it's a gas.
But if you condensed it to a be a liquid,

738
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:14,110
that's how big the bucket would be.
It would be a,

739
00:48:14,111 --> 00:48:18,820
I think it's 15 times as high as harkness
tower and covering the entire old

740
00:48:18,821 --> 00:48:21,850
campus, right? So that's
a lot of material.

741
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:26,470
Now that reaction gives 84% yield,
right?

742
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,980
The rest,
the rest oxidizes.

743
00:48:29,981 --> 00:48:34,150
The rest of the original athlete
oxidizes to see co two and h two O.

744
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,900
Suppose you could adjust the
conditions to make the yield higher.

745
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:43,830
Suppose instead of 84% you can increase
it by 5% if you could raise the yield by

746
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:48,400
5% that would be worth more
than a billion dollars a year.

747
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,520
So here's a way for you
to make your fortune,

748
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,950
although I will caution you that people
have worked on this a lot to try to get

749
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,980
every last percentage out of it,
right?

750
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,970
Okay.
But in fact,

751
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:09,060
why we 20 million tons of ethylene oxide
only 0.05% of it is used as ethylene

752
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:14,230
oxide. It's a, it's a,

753
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,370
it's a disinfectant that's
used in some applications.

754
00:49:18,371 --> 00:49:23,290
It's a gas and you can put it in to
kill microbes or something. But very,

755
00:49:23,291 --> 00:49:25,960
very little of it is used
for what do they use it for?

756
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:30,850
Two thirds of it is used
to make that compound.

757
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:32,050
Just add water.

758
00:49:32,051 --> 00:49:35,500
And the reaction that we were just kind
of thing we were just talking about to

759
00:49:35,501 --> 00:49:38,740
make that compound. Does anybody
know what that compound is called?

760
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:41,590
You could call it dihydroxy ethane,

761
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:44,410
but it has a more common name.

762
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:49,990
It's called ethylene glycol.
So it's antifreeze.

763
00:49:49,991 --> 00:49:54,190
So a lot of it is used for antifreeze,
but it's also used for solvent also.

764
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:58,870
It's incorporated in polymers.
The, the uh, the uh, uh,

765
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,071
polyethylene,

766
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:04,210
terra Thali that the stuff that makes
a soft drink bottles for example,

767
00:50:04,211 --> 00:50:08,860
has its used in making that
glycols an interesting word.

768
00:50:08,861 --> 00:50:13,720
The delay is from the Greek root.
That means sweet.

769
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,230
Like glucose is the same root.

770
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:20,110
It's because ethylene glycol tastes sweet,

771
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:24,130
although we don't taste it
because it's poisonous. So, so,

772
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:29,060
but the original people did. So that's
why it's called glycol. Great. Okay.

773
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:33,170
Now that reaction to, to, to change, uh,

774
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:38,380
ethylene oxide into ethylene glycol
occurs either with basic analysis or acid

775
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:43,730
ketalysis. So since the focus
of this lecture has been,

776
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,040
uh,
whoops,

777
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,990
this lecture is over.
Sorry, I got carried away.

778
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,840
We'll talk about the mechanisms next time.
Thanks.
