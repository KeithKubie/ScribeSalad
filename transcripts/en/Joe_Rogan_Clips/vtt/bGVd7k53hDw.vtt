00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
The comics have a lot of pumpkin house.
You know,
I did,

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.570
but I didn't start this fucking broad breaks out.
I'm watching it.
Two tables,

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.351
girls and guys,

4
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:11.310
and there's a girl in the middle of their fists up like she took three fucking

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.460
Tibo cloud title classes.
She's,

6
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.470
and she takes a swing and hits one of the bounces.

7
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.980
I watch this other bound to come across the room and drop her like a fucking use

8
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:26.640
rubber.
I mean,
hit her like she was a guy.
Really?
Oh my God.

9
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:30.510
I don't know how this guy didn't do jail,
but these broads,

10
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.280
this is what this feminist movement has taken them.

11
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.620
Now they jump in every time you see a fight and a football game,

12
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:39.480
the stands is women involvement.
Yet they really fucking think,
I'm sorry,

13
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:43.890
but legislation.
You can't fucking legislate the DNA out of us.

14
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.020
And uh,
they're always in the middle of it.

15
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:49.200
You notice that a lot of fucking broads think they can Duke it out now we'll do

16
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:53.250
our bunch.
Right.
Have a dilute.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They seem to,
any wonder woman movies.

17
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.240
Exactly.
They've been brainwashed.
Well,
there's a lot of people in general,

18
00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:00.080
they think they could go around punching people like come about all these a

19
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.800
Antifa dorks that or a least show you face.
Well then not only that,

20
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:07.710
they're starting fights with people and they have zero idea how to find date.

21
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.720
They're swinging at people that you see the one guy,

22
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.860
a guy swings at this guy with a bat or with a baton.

23
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.870
The guy catches the baton [inaudible] him in the face and chaos and his head

24
00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:22.530
snaps back and his head bounces off the concrete.
When he falls down,

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.850
it's awful to watch.

26
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:27.180
Like what the fuck made you think you could just hit a man with a stick?

27
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.900
Cause you guys disagree with each other.
Yeah.
And and you're right,

28
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:33.720
when they interview him after,
a lot of times they,
not even after a fight,

29
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.750
but they end to be somebody on TV.
They sound like almost swishy.
Yeah,

30
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.550
some of them swishing like homosexual.
So are you saying that fuck of feminine?

31
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.190
Well there they want to become a look.
Look,

32
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.860
the Antifa is just like any other group of people.
They they,

33
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.080
they give you a community,

34
00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:53.570
whether it's a gang or whether it's a w w a criminal organization or what,

35
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.350
you know,
whatever it is,

36
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.790
people fall in line with the sensibilities of that organization.

37
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.600
And then you do what you can to support that organization to show that you're a

38
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:05.520
valued member.
And then,
you know,

39
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:08.520
you start wearing their fucking ski masks and hitting people with sticks and

40
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:11.610
everybody's practicing karate in the park because they think they're going to be

41
00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:15.030
able to defend themselves.
The whole thing is ridiculous,

42
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:17.850
but because their life has no value outside of that.
Oh,

43
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.080
isn't it weird to you that,
look,
my parents were hippies and when I grew up,

44
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.680
I always thought that people on the left,
we're peace loving though.

45
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.520
That was what the,
the,
the knock was there were peace,
loving,
well educated.

46
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.290
But you're seeing now people on the left,
like these certain factions of them,

47
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:37.410
not all of them,
but are people that are calling for violence.

48
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.500
They have violent pacifists.
Ironically.
Yes.
Well,

49
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:42.870
they don't want to do it themselves,
but they're calling for other people to do,

50
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.050
right?
Yeah.
Right.
They're calling for people to get punished.

51
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.840
Like that kid with the a hat,
like raise the Osl on Ron.

52
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:53.070
Have you ever seen him more punchable face?
What the fuck are you saying?
Yeah.

53
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.641
You know,

54
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:58.641
it's like this extreme lack of empathy for young people to like young people

55
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.480
that,
that don't fall in line with their ideas.

56
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.200
They don't give a fuck that fuck that kid punched him,
throw him in jail,

57
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.660
lock them up.
It's just like,
it's,

58
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.670
there's a lack of empathy and a lack of thought behind it.

59
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.690
It's very consultative.
Media is only throwing gas on that.
Yeah.
