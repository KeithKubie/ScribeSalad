00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:11.000
Like the Industrial or the Einsteinian Revolution,
the Space Race is a trope, or way of organizing

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.440
historical events into a story that makes
sense.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.539
In this story, the two great powers that emerged
after World War Two—the United States and

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.810
Soviet Union—competed to send communications
satellites, dogs, and people into outer space…

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.330
And also to intimidate the other side with
the prospect of nuclear war.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.000
But before humans could send anything into
space, first they had to get into earth’s atmosphere.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.960
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.010
Folks dreamed about flying up into the heavens
for centuries. You might have seen Leonardo

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.410
Da Vinci’s sketches for personal flying
machines, for example. But these didn’t

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.350
work.
Starting around CE 220 in China, people have

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.859
used unmanned sky lanterns—hot air balloons—to
help messages escape the ground for everything

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.040
from military signaling to festivals.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.210
And human hot air balloons became popular
in Europe in the late 1700s, starting in France.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.310
But these devices didn’t travel fast; they
couldn’t handle strong winds; and they weren’t

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.890
very safe.
So historians tend to start the history of

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.280
air travel with two dudes from a large family,
Orville and Wilbur Wright.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.270
These bros ran a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio.
Actually, let’s be clear, their sister Katherine

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.909
ran the household and handled their business
finances.

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.130
But the brothers wanted to build a flying
machine. And at the end of the Second Industrial

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.610
Revolution—they did!
Orville and Wilbur made lots of gliders, and

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.509
eventually a powered plane. They used wood
and fabric, with a petrol-powered internal

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.130
combustion engine and some bicycle parts.
And keep in mind, the bicycle itself was only

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.090
twenty-five years old!
But first, they collected tons of data about

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.229
wing shapes and air flow using a small homemade
wind tunnel.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.229
People had tried to build flying machines,
sure. But the Wrights used physical data to

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.430
design one.
And then the brothers took off on the first

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.090
heavier-than-air flight on December 17, 1903,
at Kitty Hawk in the Outer Banks of North

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.530
Carolina. They made four flights on that first
day. None was very long or high by modern

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.450
standards, but all were extraordinary in 1903.
The Wrights wanted to commercialize their

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.040
fliers. But it took a while before people—other
than the aviation-obsessed French— to believe

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.250
that they had actually flown.
Eventually, however, the Wrights conducted

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.940
more demonstrations and convinced the U.S.
military to invest. Aviation took off for

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.250
war, but also for mail and passenger services.
With a more advanced engine, Charles Lindbergh

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.580
flew across the Atlantic in 1927. And by the
early 1930s, well-off passengers could ride

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.690
commercial airlines. This revolutionized the
whole tourism and cargo industries. And global

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.230
culture: it made the world feel smaller.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.870
In terms of technical effects, air travel
spawned whole industries. Think about the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.700
many integrated technologies that allow you
to fly: fuel refining, baggage processing,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.011
ticketing, air traffic control, and so on.
And, despite our angry tweets, commercial

00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:05.480
air travel is one big, highly functioning,
and safe system today.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.100
But air IS NOT space.
Flying using a jet engine in a plane with

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.370
fixed wings can get you high—into the cold,
oxygen-low strata of the atmosphere. But to

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.670
escape the pull of earth’s gravity, you
need more power.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.889
The solution? A really big chemical reaction.
Basically: an explosion. The inspiration for

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.669
the solution? Science fiction.
In 1865, French adventure writer Jules Verne

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:34.729
wrote a book called From the Earth to the
Moon. In it, members of a gun club decide

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.230
to go the moon by creating—wait for it—a
giant gun!

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.100
Verne saw American settler-colonization as
a great adventure. Why not head to the moon

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.930
and exploit the Mooninites!?
So science fiction matters! It influences

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.760
how we, including real-life scientists and
engineers, think about what the future can

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.100
be. In this case, Verne was notable for trying
to imagine a pretty dang realistic plan for

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.540
space exploration, given nineteenth-century
technology.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.261
Still, real-life giant gun-making, AKA rocket
science, didn’t take off immediately. Between

00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:13.260
Verne and World War Two, the discipline of
chemistry took off, especially in Germany.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.070
Scientists had access to new materials that
had simply never existed before.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.660
So leading up to the war—and directly inspired
by Verne’s novel—Nazi physicist Doctor

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.440
Wernher von Braun developed chemical reactions
that could propel a weapon far, far away.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.840
And late in World War Two, the Nazis launched
his V-2 rockets—the first long-range, guided

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.830
ballistic missile—against England, killing
civilians.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.230
But after the war, guess who forgave this
Nazi’s crimes to make use of his engineering

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.910
genius? Yup: the U S of A. Von Braun became
Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.980
at NASA.
Like airplanes, rockets changed warfare forever.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.100
Missiles replaced long-range bombers for delivering
nuclear weapons. And thus the Cold War began:

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.530
Russians and Americans could now strike anywhere
in the world. Apocalypse was only a button

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.530
away.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.720
(By the way—this is still the case!)
It’s good to think about how we tell the

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.720
history of the invention of weapons. For example,
one curator at the Smithsonian argued that

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.600
rockets on display there should be pointed
down, so that visitors would be confronted

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.630
with destruction—rather than pointed up
and away, which implies victory without consequences.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.540
With new German-designed rockets, Soviet and
American engineers competed to fly farther.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.240
Much of the Cold War relates to this Space
Race.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.510
It began when the USSR launched the first
satellite, Sputnik, on October 4, 1957. This

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.430
shocked the world and terrified many in the
United States.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.490
Only a few years later, in 1961, the Soviet
Union sent the first human into space. Yuri

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:53.360
Gagarin made one whole orbit of earth in a
Vostok spacecraft, becoming the first cosmonaut—or

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.271
“space sailor.”
Like Sputnik’s launch, Gagarin’s flight

00:05:57.271 --> 00:06:03.040
was utterly mind-blowing. It symbolized just
how far the Soviet physical sciences had come,

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.630
very quickly. Out of an empire of serfs, the
USSR had evolved into a scientific leader

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.660
capable of breaking new ground—including
cultural ones.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.900
In 1963, cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova piloted
Vostok 6, bringing womankind to space.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.900
She’s still alive, by the way—and has
offered to take a one-way trip to Mars!

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.940
So how did the Americans respond to all this?
In 1961, U.S. President John Kennedy publicly

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.639
threw down a major scientific challenge: “to
land a man on the moon before the decade is

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.550
out.” Bam! Verne strikes again!
The Mercury program of the early 1960s put

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.750
Americans into space. But the Apollo program
successfully landed humans on the moon.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.180
ThoughtBubble, show us the wonder of moon
travel:

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.250
This program was complex, but it boiled down
to a few components: Using advanced computers

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:58.450
to chart a course to get to the moon, crossing
thousands and thousands of miles.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.200
Training pilots to be astronauts—or “star
sailors.”

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.510
Designing a command module that could land
on the moon and then take off again.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:12.120
And building a rocket to leave the earth with
enough force to carry not a small satellite,

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.660
but astronauts, in a module.
The launch vehicle that got humans to the

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:21.540
moon was the Saturn series, designed by Wernher
von Braun’s team. Like other giant liquid-fuel

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:26.100
rockets, it worked by mixing chemicals that
would react violently, creating tremendous

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.620
force that was directed straight down, sending
the vehicle up in the opposite direction.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.620
In this case, the chemicals were liquid oxygen,
liquid hydrogen, and “rocket propellant

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.650
one,” or RP-1. Which is basically kerosene
that has a bunch of dangerous chemicals added

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.680
to make it super explosive.
After several missions, and a few disasters,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.400
NASA felt they could safely send humans to
the moon and back in 1969.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.590
So on July 16, astronauts Neil Armstrong,
Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins took off

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.920
from Merritt Island, Florida, on the eleventh
Apollo mission.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:04.190
On July 20, their Eagle lander touched down
in the moon’s Sea of Tranquility. Neil Armstrong

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:10.330
became the first human to set foot on a planetary
body other than earth. He was joined by Buzz

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.200
Aldrin.
As young men on vacation will do, Buzz and

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.110
Neil planted the flag of the United States,
took some moon-selfies, called President Nixon,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:22.730
and stole some moon-rocks. Total hooligans!
And then they returned to earth, four days

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.730
after landing on the moon.
Thanks ThoughtBubble. There are lots of movies

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:32.430
about the Apollo program’s numerous successes
and even one of its terrifying failures, Apollo

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.490
Thirteen. Which was arguably the most successful
mission, by the way, because NASA was able

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.599
to correct the disaster!
And the Apollo program was as much a managerial

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:46.960
success as it is a technical one. It’s a
great example of big science—research projects

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.650
so big that no individual lab can do everything
from beginning to end, so work is broken off

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:56.810
into chunks. Like the Manhattan Project.
But not all big space science has been about

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:02.140
winning wars. Take the Hubble Space Telescope,
Mars rover, or Cassini-Huygens satellite.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:08.580
The epistemic value of these missions is incalculable.
Their practical utility, almost zero.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.860
Alas, space exploration is super expensive,
and Congress has to choose how to spend taxpayers’

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.810
money. On the same day that they cancelled
funding for the revolutionary physics experiment,

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:23.141
the Supercollider Superconductor, in 1993,
they approved funding the space shuttle. This

00:09:23.141 --> 00:09:26.560
was a big loss to particle physics, but a
win for astronauts.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.270
The shuttle program itself was retired in
2011. One response to this lack of public

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:36.630
funding has been an explosion of private space
agencies, developing space tourism.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.680
Another solution has been international collaboration:
despite persisting political tensions, Russia

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.470
and the United States collaborate on space
science today!

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:50.250
Perhaps most notably, since 1998, Americans,
Russians, Japanese, Europeans, and Canadians

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.630
have worked together to run experiments on
the International Space Station.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:59.010
It’s above us right now—humanity’s only
outpost beyond the safety of the atmosphere,

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:03.430
and a physical symbol of how the quest to
understand our universe can bring us together.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:08.560
All this space travel has given us new epistēmē—such
as better understandings of the age of the

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:15.100
universe AKA everything. And new technē—including
solar cells, freeze drying, digital cameras,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.420
GPS, and better weather prediction. It’s
also given us modern communications technologies.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.700
And, oh yeah, spy satellites.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:26.890
But space science has also filled space with
tons of junk, including rocket parts, dead

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.940
satellites, and human waste.
Which raises the question of whose job is

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:36.400
it to clean up? That is, who owns space!?
Well, space law generally says that no one

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.570
gets to own space.
But that becomes problematic for geosynchronous

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:47.760
orbits, or circular paths, 35,786 kilometers
above sea level, that follow the rotation

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:52.500
of the planet and so are fixed above specific
points on earth. You can only have so many

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:58.010
satellites at useful geosynchronous points.
The US, Russia, China, and EU already have

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:02.620
many of the best spots. This is another way
that equatorial countries face an unequal

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.200
landscape in science.
So space science raises tough questions about

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:10.870
power and knowledge, shared resources and
competitions between nations. But there’s

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:16.100
only one earth, and space science also provides
some good models on how to share.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:21.560
After all, the Apollo project was named after
the Greek god of music, truth, and healing—not

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:24.930
war.
As President Kennedy said in 1962: “…We

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:29.710
shall not see space filled with weapons of
mass destruction, but with instruments of

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:34.090
knowledge and understanding.”
Next time—we’re coming back to solid ground,

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:40.160
with a new perspective on earth’s place
in a vast universe. It’s the birth of ecology

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.980
and earth systems science!

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:47.120
