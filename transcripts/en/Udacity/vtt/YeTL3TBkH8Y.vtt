00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.470
In closing, we covered a lot of ground on operating system structuring. We saw

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.988
how the vision of extensible services, which had its roots in the

00:00:10.988 --> 00:00:14.540
HYDRA operating system, and the visualization

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.695
technology for hardware, that started with IBM

00:00:17.695 --> 00:00:21.480
VM/370. How all culminated in the

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.170
virtualization technology of today that has now

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.520
become mainstream. Data centers around the world are powered by this technology.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.230
All the major IT giants of the day from chip makers, to box makers,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.820
to service providers are all in this game. Processor chips from both Intel

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.400
and AMD have started incorporating virtualization

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.060
support and hardware that makes it easier

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.950
to implement the hypervisor, especially for overcoming architectural

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.930
quarks that we discussed in the context of VM were like

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.190
full virtualization. Even Xen, which started out with

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.450
paravirtualization, has newer version that exploit such

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.380
architectural features of the processor architectures to run unmodified

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.700
operating systems on top of Xen,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.030
a technique that they call hardware-assisted virtualization.
