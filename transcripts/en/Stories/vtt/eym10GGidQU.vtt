00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.120
NARRATOR: In this
small Japanese town,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.166
residents take the concept
of recycling very seriously.

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.780
KAZUYUKI KIYOHARA:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:00:14.352 --> 00:00:15.810
NARRATOR: They
separate their trash

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.334
into a whopping 34 categories.

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:19.875
KAZUYUKI KIYOHARA:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.910
NARRATOR: Welcome to Kamikatsu,
Japan, the zero waste town.

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:41.420
HATSUE KATAYAMA:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.480
NARRATOR: Hatsue Katayama
diligently separates her waste

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.535
according to Kamikatsu's
rigorous, zero waste program.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.880
HATSUE KATAYAMA:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.410
AKIRA SAKANO: In
the very beginning,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.810
Kamikatsu was doing
open incineration.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.830
But people could
see that's really

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.890
hurting the environment
at the same time

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.250
the health of the people.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.670
So general waste was created.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.870
NARRATOR: Since the
program began in 2003,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.890
80% of the town's garbage gets
recycled, reused, or composted.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.310
The rest goes to a landfill.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.511
But by 2020, the goal is
to be 100% zero waste.

00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:37.010
HATSUE KATAYAMA:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.390
AKIRA SAKANO: It's
been very tough,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.920
in a way, to gain the
understanding of the people.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.340
Of course, when they
had to separate garbage

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.236
into 34 categories, which is
massive, it's really tough.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.720
NARRATOR: Residents must
washed, clean, sort, and then

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.480
bring all of the materials to
the city's recycling center

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.310
where monitors such
as Kazuyuki Kiyohara

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.567
make sure it's
being done properly.

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:42.260
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:02:47.007 --> 00:02:48.590
KAZUYUKI KIYOHARA:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:03:03.102 --> 00:03:04.560
NARRATOR: Signs on
each of the bins

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.540
tell consumers what their
trash will be recycled into,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.520
and how much that process can
cost or earn the community.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.020
HATSUE KATAYAMA:
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.870
NARRATOR: The town has
what's known as a [JAPANESE]

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.290
shop, meaning circular, were
residents can bring in and take

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.320
used items for free.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.020
There's also a factory where
local women make products out

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.280
of discarded items.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.830
AKIRA SAKANO: We have
lots of old kimonos

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.770
or old clothes or these
flags not used anymore.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.380
So we asked all these
grannies, who really

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.020
had the skills for the sewing.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.060
Then they made it into a craft
like teddy bears or bags,

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.120
or what I'm wearing
right now, as well.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.630
It's made out of
all these fish flags

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.370
that we celebrate and use
for the Children's Day.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.360
NARRATOR: Businesses
all over Kamikatsu

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.620
have incorporated ways
to become zero waste.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.650
AKIRA SAKANO: We are cutting,
by doing the recycling, the cost

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.410
into one third compared to when
we actually burned everything.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.149
We are trying to focus more, and
totally change our lifestyles,

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.190
to not to produce any waste.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.690
Even in this small town
with only 1,700 people,

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.100
everyone looks up to each other.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.470
And they look after and
take care of each other.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.905
So this kind of
supporting system

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:34.450
that was in the
community really helped

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.300
for the implementation
of the zero waste.

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:40.130
NARRATOR: Let us
know if you have

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.650
any unique tips for reducing
your environmental impact

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.750

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.520

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.100
SPEAKER: Two years of trash
in this tiny little jar.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.030
In my values are having a
really low environmental impact.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.740
I have to live like I want that.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.570
And so that's why I decided
to change my lifestyle.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.540
