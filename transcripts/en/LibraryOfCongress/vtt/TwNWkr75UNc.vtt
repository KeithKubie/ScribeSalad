00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.930
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.470
&gt;&gt; John Haskell: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.920
I'm John Haskell, the
Director of the Kluge Center,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.190
and on behalf of our staff,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.490
welcome to the Trans-Atlantic
Call: People to People.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.520
This has been a week-long
work-a-thon,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.310
is what we're calling it,
sponsored by the John.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.540
W. Kluge Center and the
American Folklife Division.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.050
We have brought together
former AHRC, the Arts

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.500 position:56%
and Humanities Research Council
Kluge scholars to apply their skills

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.920
to the transcription, annotation,
contextualization, digitization,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.420
and preservation, the words, most
of them have "ation" in them,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.800
of Trans-Atlantic Call and other
related broadcast materials

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.310
that are being brought
together online

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.880
by the American Folklife Center.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.150
On this, the final
day of this program,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.370
our esteemed scholars here
will present related topics

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.560
that will highlight the
national/international relevance

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.810
of the library's folklife
collections.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.500
I should note that sometimes
people note that the side --

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.050
the acoustics aren't as good.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.420
And if that's a problem today, then
it's much better in the center.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.190
I'm going to turn it over to the
Head of the Folklife Division here

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.490
at the library, Todd Harvey.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.840
[ Applause ]

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.340
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Thanks, John,
and I think I should say,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.660
welcome back to the library.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.120
We've missed you.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.580
I am not the Head of
the Folklife Center.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.040
I am a curator at the
American Folklife Center.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.970
I'd like to thank the Head of the
Folklife Center, Betsy Peterson,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.290
for helping us to make this happen.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.450
And especially John Fenn, the
Head of Research and Programs

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.580
at the Folklife Center, who
really did a lot to get us going,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.570
as did Travis Hensley
at the Kluge Center.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.150
And especially, Mary Lou Reker,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.130
without whom we would
not be here today.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.880
You have all of our gratitude.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.130
I'd also like to thank our
sponsors, the Library of Congress,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.380
your national library since 1802.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.270
The John W. Kluge Center
at the Library of Congress,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.160 position:56%
the Library Center for Research and
Scholarship, now taking applications

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.750
for the Henry A. Kissinger
Chair in Foreign Policy

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.940
and International Relations.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.380
Our sponsor, John Regan Music
Service, a trusted and proven name

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.800
in sound reinforcement
throughout the D.C. area.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.680
And the American Folklife Center
at the Library of Congress,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.700
join us for real folk
cultural explorations

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.870
on a film next Friday and Saturday.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.020
See our website for
more information.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.370
The American Folklife
Center, preserving

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.450
and presenting American
folklife, because it's the law.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.510
Well, we have a great show today
featuring a truly trans-Atlantic

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.810
group of scholars.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.010
Let's give a big Kluge
Center welcome to Kate Neale

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.470
from London Town, Lawrence
Davies of Edinburgh, Scotland,

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.760
Delaina Sepko of Glasgow,
the Birmingham of the North,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.640
the man from Cork, Alan
Noonan, and from Chapel Hill,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.410
North Carolina, Sarah Tomlinson.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.790
Did you get mine up?

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.100
Our special guest today, of
course, is America's most notorious

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.280
and famous folklorist, from
the great state of Texas,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.940
the man who recorded the
world, one Alan Lomax.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.860
Tell us Alan, where
you been so long?

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.200
The man who recorded the world-- .

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.510
If were in 1939, we'd
be dead, but-- .

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:47.040
[ Inaudible audio playing ]

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.680
Well, these five scholars
with me on the podium today,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.680 position:56%
have had way too much fun this week.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.800
It's been an exhausting week,
and we've spent the week

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.850
with a single goal in mind.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.340
That is to provide greater
access to the radio programs,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.500
created by Alan Lomas over a
20-year period, from 1939 to 1959,

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.590
with a coda [assumed
spelling] in 1968.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:17.410
These 300 programs,
showcased the patchwork

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.780
of expressive culture
found around the globe

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.860
and most specifically,
in the United States.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.990
And I'll trust the
audience today here

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.720
to make their own investigations
about Alan Lomax, using the tools

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.380
that the American Folklife
Center has placed online,

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.150
tools that include more than
300,000 pages of manuscripts,

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.320
sound recordings, and photographs.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.530
Each member of the panel, will
contextualize a singular aspect

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.860
of Lomax's broadcast output.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.630
And then we'll summarize as a
group our ideas about audience --

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.560
the audiences that might benefit
from using these materials

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.490
and the tools that we can
employ to reach those audiences.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.080
Our hope is that you will
become engaged as we are,

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.570
and as we have been in
the Lomax radio programs,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.500
realizing that this badia
[phonetic] is a small part

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.450
of the American Folklife Center's
10,000-plus hours of broadcast.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.060
Hispanic radio, Polish
radio, Yiddish radio,

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.560
and that the library's total
broadcasts are easily 10-fold that.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.310
This is a great radio town,
with the library's holdings,

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.430
those of other institutions
around town, broadcast outlets

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.440
such as The Voice of America,
some commercial stations,

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.370
and the crown jewel located a
mile up North Capitol Street,

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.510
National Public Radio,
concentric circles, expanding

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.130
and engaging our aural senses.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.060
So, let's get started with our
esteemed visiting scholars,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:02.190
and I will invite Sarah Tomlinson
up to talk about 1939 radio.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.840
&gt;&gt; Sarah Tomlinson: From
October 1939 to April 1940,

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.570
Alan Lomax began his first
radio series of many,

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:29.410
when he hosted 25 Folk Music
of America radio broadcasts,

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:33.280
for the CBS American
School of the Air.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.240
These broadcasts listened
to during a school day,

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.430
by students in upper grades and
high school, included a wide array

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.050
of folk music from sea shanties
to children's songs of play.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.540
Lomax and his collaborators, also
prioritized musical diversity

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.620 position:56%
as they featured works by women
composers like Ruth Crawford Seeger,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.900
African American performers like
Huddie "Lead Belly" Ledbetter,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:06.220
and broadcast themes such as
poor farmer songs and hobo songs.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.550 position:56%
As folk music scholar Rachel
Donaldson has argued, the Folk Music

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.040 position:56%
of America broadcasts, show Lomax's
early concern for multi-culturalism.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.980
And throughout the week,
my work-a-thon colleagues

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.290
and I have also discussed how
this manifested in Lomax's idea

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:27.170
of cultural equity, a phrase
that he coins later in life.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.680
Lomax's early engagement with
many different styles of music

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:34.920
and identities of people, also
extended to his audiences.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.850
Looking to the Folklife
Center's rich body of material

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:42.060
on the Folk Music of America
broadcasts, we can see

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.190
and hear how Lomax engaged
with radio listeners

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.760 position:56%
in multi-faceted ways, such as
through fan mail, classroom manuals,

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:53.260
singalongs, and song collecting.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.060
We can begin tracing Lomax's
engagement with radio listeners

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.080
by looking to one of
the many fan letters

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.070
in the Alan Lomax CBS
Radio Series Collection.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.380
In 1940, Bill Damon [phonetic],

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.200 position:56%
a member of Mrs. Seegle's [phonetic]
class at the Stratford Ave. School

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.890
in Garden City, New York,
wrote to Alan Lomax.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.510
"We have been listening to
your radio programs ever

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.790
since the first of the year.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:25.350
We have enjoyed them very much, but
we have a few criticisms to make."

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.260
And to two of these
criticisms first.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.190
"The Negro Quartet
on Tuesday the 13th,

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:36.720
the Negroes clapped their hands
so loud that it was very hard

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.350
to understand the words."

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.260
And second, "It would
be a lot better

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.700
if the programs were not changed."

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.560
And then he wrote under,
"What We Enjoyed,"

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.860
"These programs give
us a wider vocabulary

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.160
of different types and
some of the songs."

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.880
The grammar there in
school child [inaudible].

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.220
So, this one letter written by
young Bill, came in with a stack

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.650
of other letters, all by
students in Mrs. Seegle's class.

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:10.670 position:56%
And so, she had each student write
to Lomax with criticisms and praises

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:15.090
about broadcasts that aired in
January and February of 1940.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:20.530
Bill references the broadcast that
the class listened to the same day

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:22.360
that they wrote their letters.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.640
The broadcast was Negro
Folksongs, featuring spirituals,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.020
and aired on February 13th, 1940.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.620 position:56%
His complaint that the programs had
changed, refers to a schedule change

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.070
from the originally planned
program for February 13th,

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.360
which would have been British
Ballads in America, a Part II.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.940
Indeed, several of his peers
made similar complaints,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:47.790
not only about the schedule change,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.110
but also about the
quartets vocal clarity.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.700
The quartet was the
famous Golden Gate Quarter

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.970
of African American singers
from Charlotte, North Carolina.

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.450
And the students' common
grievances hinted

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:05.630
that there had been a class
discussion about the Folk Music

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.880
of America broadcast,
showing another manifestation

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:13.310
of listener engagement, and through
these letters, we can imagine what

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.030
that class discussion
must have been like.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.490
While Mrs. Seegle did not
send a letter herself,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.960
her students' words revealed

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.320
that she may have had some
racialized notions that musicality

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.230
of the African American musical
styles and musicians are difficult

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:33.720
to understand, in addition to her
preference for schedule regularity.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.290
To Mrs. Seegle's credit, the
February 13th broadcast did depart

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:42.580
from an important tool for listener
engagement: The American School

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.530
of the Air teacher
and student manuals.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:49.720
Schoolrooms used these guides
to prepare for and follow along

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.050
with the radio broadcast.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.540
On Folk Music of America, Lomax
specifically designed them

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.560
to facilitate singalongs.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.080
To prepare for the Negro Spirituals
program originally scheduled

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.010
for February 6th, the
manual instructed students

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.830
to learn the chorus of
the folk song, "Samson."

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:11.590
And when the program did
air on February 13thm,

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:15.070
Lomax invited students to
sing along as they listened.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.180
And so, in the spirit
of audience engagement,

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.670
I invite us all to do the same.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:24.460
So, first what we'll do is, I'll
sing and we're actually only going

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.630
to learn half the chorus,
the first half.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.090
So, we'll do as --
I'll call in response,

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:35.330
and then I'll play the broadcast
and you can sing along with that.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:38.510
And so, if Lawrence could
give me an [singing].

00:12:38.510 --> 00:13:01.530
[ Singing ]

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.820
And now, we'll -- oh, one cue is

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:09.110
that you will hear the
quartet sing the chorus.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:10.580
That's so that you can remember it.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.750
And on the second time,
Lomax will say --

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:16.040
he'll say, "And everyone
in on the choruses,"

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.370
and that's the time
that you'll sing.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.210
So, wait until you
hear him say that.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.890
And I'll cue you too.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:26.510
Okay, you can play the audio.

00:13:26.510 --> 00:15:16.050
[ Inaudible audio ]

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:17.350
Excellent.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.510
Thank you for -- I think we
should clap a little bit.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:26.740
[ Applause ]

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.060
Yes, so, by singing along,
Lomax was doing something

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:35.120
that he did throughout his career,
which was breaking down the barrier

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.890
between professional
musician and amateur,

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.550
saying that we're all musicians.

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:40.850
We should all participate.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.890
And in fact, the singalongs are
one of many devices that he used

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.400
to convince children and
general audiences listening in,

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.840
on the Folk Music of
America broadcast,

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.030
that they too were
contributors to American music

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:56.560
and its cultural history.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.140
At the end of every program,

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:03.850
announcer Niles Welch reminded
listeners, an audio here-- .

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.360
&gt;&gt; Will continue to collect
the folk songs and ballads

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.870 position:56%
in your own community, and send them
to Alan Lomax in care of the station

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.270
to which you are listening.

00:16:17.270 --> 00:16:20.320
&gt;&gt; Sarah Tomlinson: So,
students and their teachers sent

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.940
in the folk songs, and indeed,
some of the most exciting materials

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.110
in the Folklife Center
are folk songs sent

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.250
in by Folk Music of
America listeners.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.890
Similarly, to Mrs. Seegle's class,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:35.220
they also provide a record
of classroom engagement.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:38.760
When Mr. Herr's [phonetic] class
from Bethel Township schools

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:43.450
in Pennsylvania, sent in Playground
Songs, there's four of them here,

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:49.200
Lomax replied, "The most pleasing
thing about the American School

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.450
of the Air broadcast,
is to receive new songs

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.230
and rhymes, that listeners send in.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.650
Your game songs will be added
to the collection in the Archive

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:03.040
of American Folksong in the Library
of Congress, and will be kept there

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.190
for study and for future
generations."

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.640
And here we are at a future
generation, singing along,

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.860
listening along, and continuing
to engage with these materials.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.450
So, let's keep it going.

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:18.950
Learning how Lomax engaged radio
listeners in multi-faceted ways,

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:22.560
through fan mail, [inaudible]
manuals, singalongs,

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:26.460
and song collecting, sort of
an early crowdsourcing, right,

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:30.750
certainly engaged my colleagues and
I throughout this work-a-thon week.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.490 position:56%
And I hope that this engagement
also extended to our audience today.

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:37.230
And I look forward to
thinking enthusiastically

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:40.500
about how we can continue to
engage new and diverse audiences,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.870
with the Lomax radio materials.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:45.670
Thank you.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:53.930
[ Applause ]

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:58.510
Oh, this is Kate Neale.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:03.480
[ Applause ]

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.610
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Kate Neale:
Good afternoon.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:11.280
The collection and
dissemination of traditional music,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.100 position:56%
has often had a political dimension.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:17.910
Folk music has frequently been
coopted into nationalistic projects

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:21.190
in the context of conflict,
often propagating

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.190
or constructing an
idealized national identity,

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.460
which in many cases was based
on the perception that a soul

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:31.420
of a nation is reflected
in its rote culture.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.360
This was particularly
important in the context

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.860
of Alan Lomax's radio work
during the Second World War,

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:38.930
during which time, he
was involved in a number

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.490
of groundbreaking radio programs,
both in the U.S. and the U.K.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:46.190
And due to his institutional
and professional connections,

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:51.110
Lomax was in a unique position at
this important historical juncture.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.800
However, Lomax recognized that
folk song was not only as the voice

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.150
of the people, but as
the voice of the peoples.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.680
Rather than promoting a monolithic
vision of an American identity

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.430
and culture, he was at pains
to emphasize the plurality

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:10.170
and the diversity of people
and culture within the nation.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.250
This was born out in the
two projects that I'd

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:16.710
like to talk about: The Radio
Research Project of 1941 to '42,

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:19.970
and the broadcast series giving
the title inspiration for this work

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:22.740
from Trans-Atlantic
Call: People to People.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:26.860
So, at the outset of World War II,

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.500
Lomax was already an
established ratio broadcaster

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.820
and folk music collector, here
at the Library of Congress.

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.050
And in 1941, he was transferred
from the library to the U.S. Office

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.360
of War Information, which
was a government agency,

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.190
created to disseminate
information on both domestic

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:48.240 position:56%
and overseas fronts, but also to
build morale in the American public.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.060
And from there, he became involved
in the Radio Research Project,

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:53.860
which was funded by the
Rockefeller Foundation,

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.400
and developed by the
Library of Congress,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:20:00.020
Dr. Archibald MacLeish at the time.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.180
Lomax's writings of this period,
showed that he considered folklore

00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:07.010
and its process of communal
generation selection

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:10.670
and development, to be a
democratic process in itself,

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:14.200 position:56%
but he was also conscious that this
was true of the many varied regional

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.040
and immigrant communities
within the U.S.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:20.950
During the war, the library's
activities had to be contextualized

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.300
by their contribution
to the war effort,

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.320
and Lomax wrote several
proposals relating to the use

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.930
of folklife material, gathered
by the institution, exploring

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.480
and articulating the role of the
Archive of American Folk Song,

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.690
in the National Defense Program.

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:40.670
He identified the problem
faced by America, thus.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:44.790
He wrote, "Well in advance of any
armed aggression against a state,

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.670
fascist forces have prepared
the way by spreading dissention

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.610
and producing cleavages
among its people.

00:20:51.610 --> 00:20:55.250
In counteracting such tactics,
especially in an emergency,

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.810
there will be a tendency
towards cultural regimentation,

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.960
and writing roughshod over
the emotions and sensibilities

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.800
of the nationality groups,
and immigrant populations.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.490
An effective defense program
calls for national unity.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.450
But any effort towards
national unity

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:16.750
that disregards cultural diversity,
will defeat its own ends."

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:19.560
With this in mind, the Radio
Research Project responded

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.980
to the problem in one of its out
[inaudible], the Regional Series,

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:29.260
as follows, "In short, we show or
hope to show, the real significance

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.010
of the big concept words such as
democracy, liberty, and America,

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.280
by breaking them down into
their everyday manifestations

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.330
in communities or regions
throughout the country.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.560
These programs do not
speak in generalities,

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.240
catch phrases, or glorious words.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:49.580
The stories are simply told
in dramatic and human terms,

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.440
sometimes through the eye of an
individual, be he a reverend,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.770
and old sailor, a coal
miner, or even a river."

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.990
In total, the Radio
Research Project,

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:02.420
resulted in six broadcasts
and two -- sorry.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.480
Six radio series and two
standalone broadcasts,

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.890 position:56%
included not only the folk music
and ballad hunting that we associate

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.660 position:56%
with Lomax, but also, oral histories

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:14.520
and cultural memory drawn
from across the country.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:22.110
Lomax's promotion of national
unity through the medium of radio,

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:24.190
therefore not only took account of

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:27.140
but celebrated America's
internal diversity.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.820
And then we see these ideas
applied in an international setting

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:34.190
in his work on Trans-Atlantic
Call: People to People,

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.060
which immediately followed
but was not a direct output

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.630
of the radio research project.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.620
Lomax was invited to work
on Trans-Atlantic Call

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.760 position:56%
by the Columbia Broadcasting System,

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.940
and the program was a collaborative
venture between the CBS and BVC,

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.660
which ran between 1943 to '45.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.940
And was explicitly designed to
foster a friendly appreciation

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.880
and understanding between listeners

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.520
in the United States
and the United Kingdom.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.060
Initially conceived as alternating
half an hour broadcasts coming one

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.160
week from the U.S., and the
next week from the U.K.,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.900
Lomax and his team visited
communities across America,

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.990
taking field notes,
making recordings,

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:18.570
and interviewing local people
in order to capture the breadths

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.880
and depths of American
vernacular life.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.620
Throughout the broadcasts,
emphasized the impact of the war

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.300
and the changes in life
that have been brought

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:30.400
to bear on everyday communities.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.010
The broadcasts directly
addressed the British audience,

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:35.350
explaining the industry's
terminologies

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.360
and technologies evident
in each location.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.910
One representative
episode featured Mason City

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.060
in Iowa, a large farming city.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:47.790
And Lomax's field notes, show
that he interviewed characters

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.730
from a wide range of
ethnic backgrounds,

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:53.910
including Irish farmers, Greek
canteen workers, and I also wanted

00:23:53.910 --> 00:23:56.000 position:56%
to show this rather -- oop, hold on.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.940
Charming photograph, of Lomax
recording a flock of turkeys

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:02.830
that were eventually
broadcast in the program.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:07.090
And also, actually got into
conversation with Lomax

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.110
and his interviewee at the time.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:13.590
So, Lomax's field notes
became scripts

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.830
that were then voiced by actors.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:18.220
So, the scripts are fairly
expositionary [assumed spelling],

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:21.880
highlighting potential confusions
from Americans or British English.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.690
Explaining it out for example,
what Americans call corn,

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.500
the U.K. farmers would
call maize, pigs, the hogs,

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.330
explaining the differences between
English farms and America farms.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:35.060
And, so on.

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.210
As part of his attempt to capture
the breadth of America's social

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:42.340
and cultural diversity,
Lomax also ensured

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:45.280
that American urban life was
represented alongside more

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:46.770
rural communities.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.340
And in one particular
broadcast from 1943,

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.430
Lobal visits New York's Upper
East Side, and throughout,

00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:55.190
the emphasizes again the range

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:59.140
of ethnic backgrounds living
alongside each other in harmony,

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:03.550
with one character exclaiming,
"Italians, Jewish, Irish,

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.210
Negroes, all the same here.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:08.680
My name's Coco, yours is
Cohen, yours is Fennesey.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:12.910
We're all alike, 100% Americans."

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:16.460
Later in the series the
format moved from actually --

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:20.070
from half an hour from one country
and then half an hour from another,

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.310
to actually switch to
broadcast halfway through,

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:25.070
so there would be a
15-minute segment from America

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:28.090
and then a reply immediately
with 15-minutes from the U.K.

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:32.020
And unfortunately, we don't
have the reply from Soho

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.290
which would have replied
to the Upper East Side.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.450
But it would be fascinating
to see if

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:40.530
and how the BBC reflected the
diversity of Central London

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.650
in a manner similar
to Lomax's conception.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:49.600
However, we are able to listen
to one of the replying programs

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.630
from the BBC, which
focused on the experience

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.880
of women in wartime Britain.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.330
The narrator has just
been seen the morning

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.150
after a bombing raid,
and we pick it up there.

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:03.560
If we could have the audio?

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.510
&gt;&gt; There are a lot of
people standing around,

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.460
people who lost their homes, and
well, they were being advised

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.690
by the women and the Women's
Voluntary Service, you know the--

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.040
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes, I know the WVS.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes, that's it.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.980
Well, I went in to see if
there was anything I could do

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:17.280
to help, I guess.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.260
And standing in front of one
of the tables was an old lady.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.740
I suppose she was about 60.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:29.260
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry to be
troubling you like this.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:32.510
You must have a terrible lot to do.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.080
&gt;&gt; We're here to help, Mrs. Brown.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.600
That's our job.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.860
&gt;&gt; Well, you see, I -- I
lost everything last night.

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:45.160
My house down, my husband,
they took him

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.790
to hospital, but it wasn't any use.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.750
&gt;&gt; I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Brown.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I don't hardly know how to begin.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:58.430
I -- you see, I've
nowhere to go now.

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.740
My girl was killed in
the Blitzen [phonetic].

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:03.210
I've no one I can go--

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:05.320
&gt;&gt; We can take care of
that for you, Mrs. Brown.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.530
The rehousing people at the
Emergency Center will fix you up.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:09.830
&gt;&gt; Oh thank you, miss.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.800
I don't know where it is.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.240
I thought perhaps you might--

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.470
&gt;&gt; One of us will take
you around there.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.980
And we'll call the
Assistance Board as well.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:21.270
If your house is gone, there's
a lot of things you'll need,

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:23.670
money and clothes and
food and things.

00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:25.600
&gt;&gt; That's very kind of you, miss.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:29.500
I don't want to be any trouble.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:34.100
I'm sure that there must
be lots worse off than me.

00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.760
&gt;&gt; I don't think anyone could lose
more than you've lost, Mrs. Brown.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.340
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Kate Neale: So,

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.580
these returning broadcasts explored
aspects and impacts of the war

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:45.170
in Britain that were outside
the realms of experience

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.290
for your average American citizen,

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:51.100
often in very dramatic
and poignant terms.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.910
So, Trans-Atlantic Call
and Radio Research Project,

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.640
both intended to build [inaudible]
communities with particular social

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.930
and political goals in mind,
fostering cultural dialogs

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:03.600
at both sub and international
levels.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.690
The Library of Congress's
holdings relating

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.370 position:56%
to the Radio Research Project and
Trans-Atlantic Call itself, are rich

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:12.470
and broad and include
Lomax's original field notes,

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.360
correspondence, institutional
policy reports and documentation,

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.920
as well as the radio scripts
and audio files themselves.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.810
And as an ethnomusicologist,
I'm fascinated by the use

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:26.820 position:56%
of musical material in culture, in
these projects, to build communities

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.490
and develop particular
narratives around them.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.900
And there are many interesting
strands to be drawn out.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.610
In particular, how Lomax'
description so much gives a voice

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:38.460
to the voiceless perhaps,
but script the voiceless,

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:42.000 position:56%
because these scripts were carefully
constructed, curated, and of course,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.810
eventually approved for broadcast
by the Office of War Information.

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.490
However, the material begs
attention from a wide field

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:50.790
of academic disciplines

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.290
since Lomax's radio work offers
fertile ground for the exploration

00:28:54.290 --> 00:28:57.640
and intersection of media
and institutional approaches

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.930
to folk like, the construction
and delivery of propaganda,

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.840
and the inclusions and the
exclusions of marginalized groups,

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.940
all of which concern
us in the present day.

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:09.740
Thank you very much.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:17.860
[ Applause ]

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:23.510
Very pleased to introduce my
co-work-a-thon, Lawrence Davies.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:31.900
[ Applause ]

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:33.200
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: Thank you.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.930
It's great to be back
at the Kluge Center.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.450
&gt;&gt; Tell us a little about yourself.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:56.750
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: Okay.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:01.540
I'm just finishing up my PhD
at King's College, London.

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.370
And I was a British
Research Council Fellow here

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:06.340
at the Kluge Center last year.

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:14.730
Some of my work then was on
Alan Lomax and his radio career,

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.530
but also how Alan Lomax
presented in particular,

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:22.820
African American folksong
and blues and jazz,

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.070
both in America and in Britain.

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:29.970
And one of the things that
I was continually amazed

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.720
by at the Kluge Center,
was the facility to bring

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.230
in books, right to your desk.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.040
It was a fantastic experience.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.250
And one thing I thought was quite
interesting, is I thought, "Oh,

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:42.960
well I bring -- I won't
bring my own books,

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.170
because I'll be able
to order them here."

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.960
So, I [inaudible] just being
able to create my library

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.920
at home, effectively here.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.300
But within about a month,

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:58.000
it was clear that I was actually
creating an entirely new library

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.460 position:56%
effectively, on my shelves here,
looking at books, making connections

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:06.010
between scholarship that
was entirely different

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.630
to what I had made at home.

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:13.980
So, I think that's a really good
testament to Trans-Atlantic travel

00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:18.050
for the purposes of scholarship.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:25.980
Yes. And of course, the American
Folk Life Center was invaluable

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:31.160 position:56%
for my research, in particular, the
work with and assistance given to me

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:39.310
by Todd Harvey and all of the other
curators at the Folk Life Center.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:44.260
Being able to really get to grips
with this material firsthand,

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:48.360
and in paper form, brings
things home to you in a way

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:54.990
that even accessing them
online doesn't quite give you.

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:59.300
So. The Art of the Negro, is really
a series that Lomax write not long

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:02.820
after his arrival in
Britain in 1951.

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:06.620
And although, much of Lomax's
work in Britain is on British

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:11.750
and European folk music, and The
Art of the Negro examines the link

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:15.950
between African-American folksong,
religious music, jazz, and blues,

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:20.210
and contextualizes these traditions
within African-American experiences

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:22.850
of life in the segregated south.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:26.470
So, what I want to talk about today
is not only how Lomax put together

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:31.370 position:56%
these programs about American music,
but -- whilst he was in the U.K.,

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:36.080
but also how these programs were
used to challenge the status quo,

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.570
such as it was in the
1950s, about attitudes

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:44.050
to the broader cultural value of
African-American music and culture.

00:32:44.050 --> 00:32:47.870
And I should also say at this
point, that some of the language

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:52.090
in the extracts that we'll read and
listen to have [inaudible] marks

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:54.930
of the time at which
it was recorded.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:33:01.560
The series was produced for
the BBC's Third Program.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.140
This was the BBC's Arts
and Culture Station,

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.970
formed after the Second World War,

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:08.050
to complement the corporations
of the networks.

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:11.490
The Home Service, which was current
affairs, and the Light Program,

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.860
which was mainly for music
and variety entertainment.

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:17.940
And the station's approach, the
Third Program's station's approach,

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.640
was firmly highbrow
and intellectual.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.090
The first evening of transmission
began with a lecture on how

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:27.170
to listen, and it included
recordings of Bach's

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:30.360
"Goldbergs Variations,"
Monteverdi's "Madrigals," a lecture

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.100
on current affairs by the
Prime Minister of South Africa,

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.060
and a concert with
English composers,

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.780
[inaudible] from the
BBC Symphony Hall.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:42.110
What the station did on select
occasions, widen its remit

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.410
to the subject of folksong,

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.700
particularly if the presenter
was a well-regarded authority

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.000
on the subject.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.730
And Alan Lomax was
certainly recognized as such,

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:52.030
by the station's controllers.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:56.530
So, the Art of the Negro is a
short series, compared to some

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.890
of Lomax's other radio projects,

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.710
running to only three
hour-long episodes.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.390
These are Mr. Jelly Roll,
about the jazz composer

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:08.070
and pianist Jelly Roll Morton and
the birth of jazz in New Orleans,

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:11.240
Trumpets of the Lord, about
African-American religious worship,

00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.290
and then finally Blues
in the Mississippi Night,

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:18.960
about the origins, themes, and
social meanings of the blues.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.230
The AFC's holdings
on these broadcasts,

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:24.810
are limited to a set
of finished scripts.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.660
However, these are
exceptionally rich documents.

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:29.610
They reveal how Lomax
constructed each episode

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:32.210
from a wide range of audio sources.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:34.730
Lomax drew from across
his own earlier fieldwork

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.950
and musical knowledge, including
recordings made while working

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:41.340
for the Archive of American Folk
Song, more recent interviews

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.110
that he had conducted with
folk singers and musicians,

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.890
and then commercial
recordings of blues and jazz.

00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:49.670
And without wanting to
go into too much detail,

00:34:49.670 --> 00:34:52.420
it's possible to use the
holdings of the Lomax collection,

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.720
to dig right down into
this process of authorship.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.100
This slip for example, show
Lomax using the BBC's in-house

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:04.930 position:56%
reproduction services to make copies
of interview materials he'd brought

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:07.460
with him in preparation
for the broadcast.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.110
And then correspondence files
show the BBC and the Library

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:14.700
of Congress already had a
well-established exchange program,

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.650
meaning that many of Lomax's
earliest field recordings,

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:22.950
were actually already over at the
BBC and in their record library.

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:28.130
Lomax [inaudible] source approach,
was integral to his belief

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.520 position:56%
that folk song or folk culture was
a bedrock of American popular music.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.120
In Blues in the Mississippi Night,
Lomax begins by casting the blues

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.180
as the musical voice
of a modern nation.

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.990
"The term 'the blues'
is old," he says.

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:42.520
"Shakespeare used it.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.430
The song form, is like
the Cante jondo

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:46.520
of Spain, the Fado of Portugal.

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:51.090
All three are routed in Africa,
but the blues is the folk song

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:55.890
of the 20th Century, at home with
machinery, and on city streets.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:01.510
If America had one national
song, it's probably-- ."

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:09.140
[ Music ]

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.750 position:56%
Can we play that from the beginning?

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:14.730
I'll do my radio intro again.

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:16.530
Or Lomax's radio intro.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:34.700
[ Music ]

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:39.400 position:56%
National music then, to Lomax's
ears, was music created and consumed

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.460
by the people, within
their everyday lives.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:45.540
This is evident in Lomax's
recollection of his first encounter

00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.000
with the blue's musician,
McKinley Morganfield,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.670
better known now as Muddy Waters.

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:52.230
And he recorded, while
collecting songs

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:56.840
in the Mississippi delta
during the summer of 1941.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.490
"He was barefooted
in ragged overalls.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.970
His house, in the middle of one
of those endless cornfields.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:06.550
He played every Saturday for
little dances in his county,

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:10.090
but he had never seen a good
guitar before he picked up mine.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.140
But listen to his song.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:15.930
A complex, delicately
balanced, syncopated poem,

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:19.510 position:56%
perhaps the finest blues on record."

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:55.950
[ Music ]

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.850
So here, Lomax is again
turning conventional opinion

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:01.340
about musical value on its head.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:05.260
Even those who were confined to the
bottom rungs of American society,

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.870
with few material resources
and little formal education,

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:12.520
could produce music with immense
artistic value and beauty.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.710
For British listeners
of the Third Program,

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:17.130
this would have been
a powerful image.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.580 position:56%
While they could access commercial
blues recordings with relative ease,

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.390
they lacked any real awareness
of the music's folk roots,

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:25.620
or the environment in
which it was created.

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:28.980
And this is the real
emphasis of this social --

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:33.550
emphasis on social context
rather, it's the real centerpiece

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:36.630 position:56%
of Lomax's broadcasts here, I think.

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:39.320
Lomax draws on a series of
interviews with blues musicians,

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.210
Big Bill Broonzy, Memphis
Slim, and Sonny Boy Williamson,

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.680
that he had made in
New York in 1947.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:47.530
But they are presented
here as taking place

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:50.390
in a back-country Mississippi
juke joint.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:51.860
"The night settled down.

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:54.220
One of those hot, [inaudible]
August nights

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.520
in the Mississippi [inaudible].

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.450
The blues was rolling
slow, sleepy, and tired.

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:00.650
It was time to ask questions.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.190
I said, 'Listen, Bill.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:03.950
You sit here and sing
the blues all night,

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:05.330 position:56%
and never seem to get tired of them.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.570
What are they about anyway?'"

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:14.920
&gt;&gt; Some people say that
the blues is a [inaudible],

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.910
but I don't say it like that.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:20.340
I say it's a man that's got a
companion and she turned him down.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.520
And things like that
happen, you know?

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.350
And that's why I gets
the blues from.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:29.530
When I want to see my baby,
and want to see her bad,

00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:32.060
and something happened
and I can't find her,

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.400
and that gives me the blues.,

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:37.340
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: So, although
Lomax's setting is fictionalized,

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:41.150
the musicians' testimony was
direct and from the heart.

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:44.880 position:56%
Speaking under pseudonyms to protect
their identities, Broonzy, Slim,

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:48.180
and Williamson, spoke candidly
about their experiences

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.660
of crushing manual labor, harsh
treatment by white bosses,

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.820
and how the blues could be used

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.650
to voice the trauma
of these experiences.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:01.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I've known guys, they wanted to
cuss out the boss, and he was afraid

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.290
to go up to his face and tell
him what he wanted to tell him.

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.240
And I've heard him say sing
those things, sing words,

00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.130
you know, back to the boss.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.870 position:56%
Just be behind the wagon, hooking
up the horses or something, and then

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:14.170
or the mules of something.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:15.940
And then he'd go to
work and go to singing,

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:19.150
and said things to
the horse, you know?

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:21.150
Horse [inaudible] like the
mule, stepped on his foot.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.630
Said, "Get off my foot, God damn
it," or something like that.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:26.530
You know? And he meant he
was talking to the boss,

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:30.180 position:56%
"Son of a bitch, [inaudible] get off
my foot," and such things as that.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.480
That's the point.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.000
&gt;&gt; Yes, blues is kind of
a revenge, you know it-- ?

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.510
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: So, these
accounts laid bare the evils

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:40.000
of segregation, but also the
optimism and resourcefulness

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.920
of spirit that helped
people survive.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:45.320
Such as this apocryphal
yet sinister tale

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:47.360
of a delta farm owner
named Mr. White.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.660
&gt;&gt; I know a man at my home.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.720
They call him Mr. White.

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:56.020
That was at on the plantation.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.320
Well, he had his own place there.

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.230
It was about 50 or 60
miles of his place.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.730 position:56%
It's a square, you know what I mean?

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:04.450
From one side to another, you know?

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:08.230
And all his fences around
his place was white.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:11.720
The trees, he painted them white
up as far as you could get.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:17.240
And all the cattle and the sheeps,
the goats, and the hogs, and cows

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.680
and mules, horses, and
everything on his place was white.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:25.540 position:56%
And anytime that his cow or his goat
or [inaudible] have a black goat

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:30.110
or a black sheep or a black calf,
a black colt, anything like that,

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:31.690
he give them to the niggers.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:35.430
He didn't want nothing
on his plantation black.

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.250
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: To be
able to hear such lengthy

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:41.100
and personal accounts of life
in the south and in such detail,

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:44.680
was unprecedented, not only in
Britain, but in blues scholarship

00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.290
as a whole in this period.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:48.970
These broadcasts were
therefore an early step

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.460
in understanding the unique
circumstances that gave rise

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.950
to African-American
traditional music, and how Black

00:41:54.950 --> 00:42:00.110
and expressive culture inspired
American popular music as a whole.

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.440
Moreover, we can trace
from this one broadcast,

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:06.480
how Lomax continually reused and
reformulated the field recordings

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.760
and interview materials
that he used in the Art

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.760
of the Negro throughout his career.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.960 position:56%
His interviews with African-American
musicians became the inspiration

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.320
for several books, LPs, and
even a documentary film.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:25.050
Lomax clearly heard great
power in these recordings,

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:29.020
and I think we can hear that same
power when we listen to them today.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:32.140
In this way, the future engagement
with Lomax's radio materials

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:34.710
that his project aims to inspire,

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.420
will hopefully allow
the important messages

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.030
of the AFC's collections
to continue to be heard.

00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.830
Thank you.

Thank you very much for
joining us this afternoon.

It really means a lot
to us to have you hear.

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:19.510

first sound clip, please?

everybody, and ride with me.

This is Alan Lomax, your ballad man,

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.950
inviting you for another
ride on the Folk Song Train.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:47.510
The train that runs wherever
the people make their music.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:44:00.090
[ Music ]

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:01.390
&gt;&gt; Dr. Delaina Sepko: Thank you.

00:44:01.390 --> 00:44:05.740
I'm here to just introduce you
a little bit to another one

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.040
of his radio broadcasts, called the

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.860
"The Ballad Man" or
"Your Ballad Man."

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.590
And to a particular episode
called, "Singing Newspaper."

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:19.960
Now, the broadcast took place
on the 17th of July, 1948.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.910
And it was one of 60
episodes that aired

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:27.200
between October 1947
and January 1949.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.900
In terms of construction, there
were two 15-mintues halves,

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.550
with a total of 30 minutes,
and the broadcast took place

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:37.880
on Mutual Broadcasting Network,
which could be considered one

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:42.370
of the four major broadcasters
of that time.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.000
They were topical in nature.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.370
So, when they were put together,
they might be about women and men.

00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:50.510
In this case, it's
about popular topics

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:55.040
that you might find in a newspaper.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.890
This particular episode, which
I have here the playlist for,

00:44:59.890 --> 00:45:04.430
shows that it's generally
composed of recorded music,

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:08.720
some live performances,
and Lomax gives commentary

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.530
over the top of most of it.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.980
So, it might be what
you would find familiar

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:16.370
from today's radio broadcasts.

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:18.550
So, in that respect,
it has a very sort

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:21.260
of dee-jay sort of approach to it.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:25.820
However, this playlist is
entirely made-up of prerecorded,

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.100
commercially recorded music.

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:35.690
What we can see from that is
that we've got a combination

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:39.240
of live performance and recorded
music that's happening during each

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:44.820
of these broadcasts, and what
we can see, although I'd hoped

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.100
that was a little bit bigger there,

00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:52.460
what we have is a request
for reissue, basically.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.900
So, what was happening is the
broadcast would play a song,

00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.200
people would write in, in the way

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:00.090
that my colleagues been already
telling you about, asking,

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:01.930
"Where can I buy that record?

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:03.280
Where can I get that song?"

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.820
Well, a lot of them were really
difficult to get your hands on.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:10.330
So, here we can see
a demand for reissue.

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:12.550
People are wanting copies.

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:17.790
Copies that are commercially
produced, in this case.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:19.580
Now, anybody who's familiar
with commercial music,

00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:22.290
knows that there a few hoops that
you need to jump through in order

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.080
to be able to play them, and
this was the case even back then.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.750 position:56%
So, here we can see a list
including some of the songs that are

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:36.210
on this particular episode, asking
for those tracks to be cleared.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:40.790
Meaning, given permission
to play them on the radio.

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:45.380
So, what we're starting to see
in this case, is a little bit

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:50.070 position:56%
of tension between folk music,
which is generally seen as something

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:53.990
that you share, that
you do as a community,

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:57.230
and that's something that's very
much part of American cultures

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:01.360
in that respect, versus,
commercial recordings,

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.670
things that are commodified and
require permission for broadcast.

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:12.490
However, Lomax still incorporates
a lot of the traditional formats

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:16.300
that he's been using in all the
other broadcasts where he's asking

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:18.810
for input, looking for
feedback from people,

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:21.720
and really wanting an exchange.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.980
The sort of recursive
format, a back and forth.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.900
Something that is reflective
of the folk communities

00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:31.350
that he works for and with.

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:35.810
And in this respect, you could
sort of see these broadcasts

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:39.700
as [inaudible] a conduit
for folk music

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.630
and folk cultures that
they're part of.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:47.370
So, in this case, we
have a letter, and --

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:50.210
that he's written to
somebody who sent stuff in.

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:53.650
And it's just an expression
of gratitude.

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:55.870
I hope that he can get
it into his broadcast,

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:59.440
but that he's only got eight songs
that he can play per episode,

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.630
it might take him a
little while to get to it.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:07.630 position:56%
And then the other image is in
fact, a list to honor those requests

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:10.470
that came through,
a list of requests

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:12.720
that have been made from fan mail.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:17.540 position:56%
So, they are keeping track of these,
with you know, hopefully the intent

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.940
to include them at a later date.

00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.900
Whether they made it in or
not, I can't say right now.

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:25.150
I think there's probably
another talk in that.

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:31.240
But what we can see from
here is that back and forth.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.370
However, let's go back to the fact
that this is a constructed format,

00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:42.160 position:56%
and here we can see -- although it's
seven years prior to this broadcast,

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:47.630
already Lomax is being selective
about the things that he's playing.

00:48:47.630 --> 00:48:51.610
And when it comes to
commercially available folk music,

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.550
he is very selective.

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:58.930
In fact, [inaudible] probably worth
reading a little bit of it here.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:02.960
So, "After listening to 3,000-odd
commercial records of white

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:08.050
and negro songs, and tunes from
the south, I've compiled this list

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:13.800
of 350 representative titles in
order that the interested musician

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:18.420
or student of American society,
may explore this unknown body

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.580
of Americana with readiness.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.190
But, I have come away from
this listening experience

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:28.000
with the certainty that
American folk music,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.790
while certain folklore specialists
have been mourning its decline,

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:36.590
have been growing in new
directions to compete

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:39.870
with thick musical
commercial music."

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:45.190
So, here we have a sense
that he wants to share,

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:47.650
but he's careful about
what he shares.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:52.540
So, while we can see a lot of back
and forth, a very discursive sort

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:54.990
of program going on, he only wants

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:56.850
to share very particular
sorts of things.

00:49:56.850 --> 00:50:01.000
So, while he is a conduit,
he an arbiter of sorts.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.300
So, it's worth bearing in mind
that that's what's happening here.

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:09.760
So, we begin to see a tension.

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:12.190
If you're not aware of it
already, on the one hand,

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:17.730
we have conservation and the very
acts -- the field recording trips,

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:21.310
the concerts, the broadcasts,
the books, and the recordings,

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.220
all of the things that
Lomax is involved in.

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:27.530
All of the projects and all of
the output that's he creating.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:33.110
These are an attempt for
him to both find, collect,

00:50:33.110 --> 00:50:40.100 position:56%
and share American folk music with
Americans and the rest of the world.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:45.080
And in this case, because at
the time, he is sort of in

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:50.540 position:56%
between Library of Congress work and
his trip to the U.K, he is very much

00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:54.410
within the music industry
at the time.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:59.110 position:56%
So, he's working within a very
commercial industry in that respect.

00:50:59.110 --> 00:51:05.360
And here we can see that he will do
that to achieve some of these aims.

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.810
However, we can start to
see issues of dissemination.

00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:14.240
How that product, how
that music, gets to people

00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:16.680
who might be interested in it.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:22.190 position:56%
So, here we can see that he's used
the wide-reaching formats like radio

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:26.680
and commercial recordings
to achieve that.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.130
We can also see that there are
administrative hoops that need

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:35.890
to be jumped through, in
order to gain access to some

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:39.180
of those recordings
and to play them.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:45.250
So, what we start to see is the
tension within, the intimacy,

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:49.640
and the personal ownership,
something that is therefore there.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:52.110
Something that someone
can identify with,

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:58.260
rather than something that's
released en masse to everyone else.

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:01.130
Now, I think that it would be easy

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:04.180
to start asking questions
like, "Whose is this?

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.480
Was he right?

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:06.780
Was he wrong?

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:08.700
Who's got the right
answer in this case?"

00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:10.340
And I think that the
really interesting thing

00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:12.720
about having collections
like Alan Lomax's,

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:15.090
is that it's up to you
guys to make that decision.

00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:16.740
This isn't for me to tell you.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.440
It's not even for Alan
Lomax to tell you.

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:23.330
These collections, these songs,
belong to everyone, and that's part

00:52:23.330 --> 00:52:25.620
of what we're trying to get
across here to you today,

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:27.010
to give you the opportunity

00:52:27.010 --> 00:52:29.910
and to give you the
inspiration to look into them.

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:32.460
And find -- we were privileged
enough to go down and look

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:36.780
into the vaults the other day,
and even us, even us old hands

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:40.690
at doing this, still find
joy in just looking at it,

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:41.990
let alone listening to it.

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:43.790
Thank you very much.

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:49.130
[ Applause ]

00:52:49.130 --> 00:52:53.510
And finally, I'd like to
introduce my colleague Alan Noonan.

00:52:53.510 --> 00:53:00.180
[ Applause ]

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.670
&gt;&gt; Alan Noonan: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:07.160
It's such a sincere privilege
to be here before you

00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.690
at the tail end of
my Kluge fellowship.

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:15.250
I almost want to just
enjoy the moment, you know,

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.500
as we were all kind of
talking about what an absolute

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.320
and sincere pleasure it is to
be here and stand in these halls

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.870
and do this research,
and look out here and see

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:27.200
so many people interested in
the materials and the things

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.550
that we're looking
at and talking about.

00:53:29.550 --> 00:53:32.660
I would like to give a quick
thanks, if that would be okay?

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:34.520
And I might slip back
into my [inaudible] accent

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.060
at certain times during
this presentation,

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.280
so I hope you all understand
me at that stage.

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.370 position:56%
I'd like to thank Steve, Jen, Nancy,

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:42.920
and especially Todd at
the Folklife Center.

00:53:42.920 --> 00:53:49.630 position:56%
Mary Lou Travis, Ted, John, Dan, and
Emily, as well at the Kluge Center.

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:52.690
And I'd also like to thank
my other fellows who were

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:55.820
with me throughout the year and
who are wonderful and sincere help

00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:01.710
and I'd just like to
really emphasize the fact

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:03.700
that my experience here has been

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:06.500
such a wonderfully,
productive exploration.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:12.160
And I want to use the word
"exploration" quite purposefully.

00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:15.990
So, allow me to shift gears, which
is probably a bad phrase to use

00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:17.740
since Americans use automatic,

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.680
but my presentation will
be slightly different.

00:54:20.680 --> 00:54:24.370
And in the way of it
being an exploration,

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:27.770
in the way that Alan Lomax explored
certain collections and tried

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:31.820
to collect material, I too came
here, exactly a decade ago,

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.700
to explore American
history and Irish history

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:36.950
and the ways that those intersect.

00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:40.810
And I had just begun my
graduate career, I was younger

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:45.310 position:56%
and a little less gray at that
stage, at the University of Montana.

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:46.930
And with the help of
Professor Flores

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:50.070
and Professor Emmons [phonetic], I
began to dig deep into the history

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:53.030
of 19th and 20th Century American
cultural and social history.

00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:57.120 position:56%
It wasn't long before I heard a
song that would become very familiar

00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.610
to me in my time in Montana.

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.990
And it is with this
version of a song,

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:04.650
that I would like to
begin my exploration

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:08.760
into these fascinating
sources with you all today.

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:14.340
So, this is -- yes.

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:18.470
&gt;&gt; Well you hear this old song,
way off out across the flats,

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:24.510
or you can hear bouncing off
the walls of them boxed canyons.

00:55:24.510 --> 00:57:20.500
[ Music ]

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:24.880
That song stands for Texas and
Colorado and Wyoming and Montana

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:28.250
and every other state out there,
west of the Mississippi River.

00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:32.300 position:56%
We don't aim to miss none of them on
this old Cannonball Express neither.

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:36.520
Sometimes though, we call
this train Victory Cannonball.

00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:39.490
Sometimes we call her
the War Bond Special.

00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:43.700
That's because everybody that rides
this train is a war bond daddy.

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.940
We had a meeting about
war bonds the other day,

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:49.450
and the main question was-- .

00:57:49.450 --> 00:57:51.040
&gt;&gt; Alan Noonan: And then that
section would lead directly

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:52.920
into a piece promoting war bonds.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:56.540
I mean, they're --
this radio broadcast,

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:59.720
the [inaudible] Armed Forces
Radio Service, Bound for Glory,

00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:01.410
was produced by Alan Lomax,

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:04.970
and of course that was the famous
Woody Guthrie playing that song.

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:07.820
He invited American musicians
to come onto the show

00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:11.870
and play their favorite songs or
even reimagine their own songs

00:58:11.870 --> 00:58:13.590
that they had already known.

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:15.940
And of course, with all
the references to Montana,

00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:17.950
that should be a fairly
familiar song at this stage.

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:20.490
And I really just couldn't
interrupt it.

00:58:20.490 --> 00:58:23.260
There's an awful lot of layers that
we could dig in further into that,

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:26.300
but I just wanted to start off
with what I kind of started off,

00:58:26.300 --> 00:58:28.740
when I was starting to dig
into these collections.

00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:33.950
But with this song echoing in
your ears, allow me to pass

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:37.720
onto the next stage which
was, because we had so much --

00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:41.050
so little time to dig into the
collections, we decided to divide

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:44.450
up particular broadcasts
into sections.

00:58:44.450 --> 00:58:47.190
And so, it was given
to me to look into.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:51.120
A Ballad Hunter looks at Britain,
which was produced in 1957,

00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.470
and had these eight episodes.

00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:59.500
Now, strangely enough, I started
to look online at these sources.

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.540
All of them were on the Library of
Congress, digitized at this point.

00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:05.430
The scripts for the episodes,
that is, I should say.

00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:09.660
And I was redirected to the
episode, Dublin to Donegal.

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:13.310
This was just me looking up A
Ballad Hunter, Library of Congress.

00:59:13.310 --> 00:59:16.440 position:56%
And as a proud [inaudible], I didn't
think I was going to learn too much

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.900
that I did not already
know about Ireland.

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:21.860
Alan Lomax, on the other
hand, expected to find just

00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:24.450 position:56%
about everything travelling Ireland,

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:26.940
but in the two decades
preceding his arrival,

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.430
the arch government had
established a folklore commission.

00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:31.920
And that was charged with
the preservation of songs

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:34.720
and stories from older generations.

00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:41.590
Lomax met Seamus Ennis, and he
is an intimidating authority

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:44.570
on Irish music, who
we will look at next.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:49.010
But these clips are from Lomax's
diary, travelling around Ireland

00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:54.910
where he talks about the many,
many late nights that he had.

00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:56.780
[Inaudible] band till 3 a.m.

00:59:56.780 --> 01:00:01.070
And then the following
day, "In bed with the flu."

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:03.900
And I'm not sure if it is exactly
the flu that struck him down,

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.820
but there were many nights
where his diary notes

01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:09.240
that he had ended the night
before, 4 or 5 in the morning,

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.970
singing these songs and of course,

01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:15.330
when you get these almost
sanitized radio broadcasts,

01:00:15.330 --> 01:00:19.140
we're not exactly sure what
exactly are the cultural settings

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:21.900
of these recordings.

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:26.040
Now these diaries again, open up
that sort of deeper understanding

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.630
that these were where
songs were sung.

01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:29.570
These were where these
traditions kind of developed.

01:00:29.570 --> 01:00:32.760
These were where people would
stay up and tell stories,

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.370
recite poems, sing songs.

01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:37.510 position:56%
So, that's just one brief layer that
I kind of wanted to just highlight

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:41.270
that the collections might
not dig into too much.

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:44.770
This is Seamus Ennis
and Lomax's impressions

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:47.060
of Ireland I think
are quite charming.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.300
He describes it of course
at first, you know, gray,

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:53.430
winter sky, but a soft gray.

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:56.760
"Further sky on this, and the mists
were a gentle screen from the cold

01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:01.140
of the upper heavens, and not
the barbs of snow or ice."

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:07.510
And so, we'll play
the first recording.

01:01:07.510 --> 01:02:42.700
[ Singing ]

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:46.020
So, that's Seamus Ennis
reciting what he believed

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:47.320
to be a Dublin song.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.410
And I don't know if anybody else
has made the connection yet,

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:53.490
but Alan Lomax made that connection
with something very quickly.

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:56.370
Can we head back to the other one
and play the second recording?

01:02:56.370 --> 01:02:57.670
Sorry, thank you.

01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:02.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alan Lomax: When I heard that
song, I realized I'd come to the end

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:03.870
of a ballad trail that had run

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:07.160
through my own family
history for a long, long time.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.530
Forty years earlier
in a Texas cow town,

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:11.590
my father had recorded
the same song,

01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:14.710
but dressed up in cowboy
chaps and a sombrero.

01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:17.770
Instead of the old [inaudible]
baby, it as the cowboy

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:21.510 position:56%
and his little orphaned [inaudible].

01:03:21.510 --> 01:04:00.300
[ Music ]

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:03.640
You can imagine how I felt when I
found that the roots of this best

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:06.610
of all cowboy ballads
in a Dublin kitchen.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:09.230
And when Seamus told me that
he'd heard the same tune sung

01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:11.270
in gallic somewhere down
in Cork, my [inaudible].

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:14.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alan Noonan: Well, I thought I'd
cut it off there because immediately

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:17.560
when I heard that part of the
recording, I was like, "Oh, oh no.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.460
I've never going back
to Cork again now."

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.770
And of course, where
else would I end

01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:23.580
up when I was doing
research over in America.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.780
But you know, my own native Cork.

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:29.260
And he travelled down to
Macroom, to meet with a woman,

01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:31.570 position:56%
Elizabeth Cronin there on the right.

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:37.380
And Macroom is a few short miles
away from where my people are.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.210
And we'll play that recording now

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:44.930
of Elizabeth Cronin
singing the song in Gallic.

01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:46.230
&gt;&gt; Alan Lomax: But we
haven't come to the end

01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:49.650
of the trail till we call
a Mrs. Elizabeth Cronin

01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:52.570
who at [inaudible] was
wrinkled and rosy and sweet,

01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:55.370
like an apple that's lasted out
the winter, and from her basket

01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:58.740
of tunes, she straightaway
produced this Dobe [phonetic] song,

01:04:58.740 --> 01:05:00.540
put in Gallic this time.

01:05:00.540 --> 01:05:14.770
[ Singing ]

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:19.270
The old people say that this
is the oldest tune in Ireland.

01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:21.280
And it was the Virgin Mary's croon

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.510
when she was rocking the
infant Jesus to sleep.

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:37.400
[ Singing ]

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:40.270 position:56%
Well, that shows you how a ballad
hunt can bring you back pretty close

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.570
to the beginning of things.

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:44.860
And in Cork we found there was
a special lilt in the music.

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:47.390
There in Cork, where the red
earth and bluish rock curl

01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:53.130
up through the green, you can look
around you and believe in fairies.

01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:55.130
&gt;&gt; Alan Noonan: I like that
charming phrase by Alan Lomax

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:56.560
because there's a lot
to unpack there.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.670
People have this impression of the
fairies being these genial, nice,

01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:02.940
lovely things that you might see
on the front of cereal boxes,

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:06.640
but in actual fact, they were quite
malicious and the rumors and curses

01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:09.350
and stories and tales
about the fairy folk

01:06:09.350 --> 01:06:13.720
or the wee folks are not something
that would be said lightly,

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.490
which is funny the way that they've
been so sanitized over history,

01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:20.650 position:56%
and even in the way that Alan
Lomax, back in the 40s and early 50s

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:24.030
when he's compiling these
recordings, is talking about them.

01:06:24.030 --> 01:06:28.690
Regardless of that, Elizabeth
Cronin's own story is

01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:34.890 position:56%
in itself sanitized and mythologized
in its own way because the story

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:38.680
that she is saying, that it is the
oldest song and that it was sung

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:43.060
by the Virgin Mary, is a beautiful
story to tell, but unfortunately,

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:48.950
the deeper origins of the song
are quite dark and depressing.

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:52.690
So, this is Padraic O'Keefe
playing the oldest version

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:54.300
of the song that we have.

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:58.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alan Lomax: With Padraic O'Keefe,
the fiddler, who knew the tune

01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:01.790
and said it was composed
during the famine.

01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:05.270
"Nobody left in the town, not
even to bury the dead," Pat said.

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:08.660
"Only an old man, he rocking
a hungry baby [inaudible]."

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:12.510
And old Padraic made his
fiddle say, "Mama, Mama."

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:37.150
[ Music ]

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:42.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alan Noonan: So, for Padraic, his
response to initially being recorded

01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:48.400 position:56%
when he was told my Alan Lomax is,
he told him that it was for the BBC.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.750
Padraic replied, "I don't care
if it's the BBC or the ABC."

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:54.740
He was going to tell a story
and have it be recorded.

01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:57.160 position:56%
And so, he played that song for him.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.850
And a few short miles from Macroom,
where these songs were recorded,

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:04.930
is where I spent my
earliest years in Kilmichael.

01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:09.330
And right there, in that
graveyard in the corner,

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:12.450
far left of that photo,
is a famine commemoration

01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:15.680
which has recently been
established by the local community.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.570
It was the site of a mass
grave during the famine,

01:08:18.570 --> 01:08:21.640
where they would have used coffins
with hinges to put the bodies,

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.630
because they had to reuse them.

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:26.720
And on the opposite
view, is my own grave --

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.560
or the gravesite of my grandfather.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.610
Not my own gravesite,
but yet another.

01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:34.990
But my grandfather is buried
in that same graveyard.

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:39.630
And yet, this act of
remembering, commemorating,

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:43.750
thinking about the past,
and finding something

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:48.000
that you would never expect to
see, in the Library of Congress,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.730
about your own people
and about your own past,

01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:54.360
is something that has
really caught me off guard.

01:08:54.360 --> 01:09:01.050
And if feels appropriate then,
that here, in these hallowed halls,

01:09:01.050 --> 01:09:03.650
and I think I can use the term
"hallowed halls," of the Library

01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:08.320
of Congress, that I, like
Alan Lomax, found a connection

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:10.220
that links me back to
the beginning of things,

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:13.440
if not for all things,
then for at least me.

01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.400
And in this search, the
sense of cultural equity,

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.100
really shines through,
that we can read

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:24.830
and understand our shared human
experience, and the shared music,

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:29.270
poetry, and stories within these
collections, and within each of us.

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:31.070
Thank you very much.

you turn them all

&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Twenty past.

01:09:58.050 --> 01:09:59.370
So, another 15 minutes or so, but I
want to accomplish a couple things

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:01.420
in this 15 minutes, and that is

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:04.320
to let you all interact
with us, if you want.

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.540
I think there are some
microphones around.

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:15.680
But also to talk about -- I
mean, you've heard some moving

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:21.200
and thoughtful stories today
about the Lomax material.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:25.220
How it's impacted each of
these scholars and granted,

01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:28.310
we're a bit under the spell at
the moment, because we started

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:30.350
at 9 o'clock on Monday
morning, and I don't think any

01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:32.600
of these folks have
really slept since then.

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.140
They have just had
their nose into it.

01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:38.040
And that's what happens
in a week of this.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:40.590
We started with nothing
and we've ended with this.

01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:44.460
But it's not enough for
us to do the scholarship.

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:52.750
I think what's important is that
we're able to reach more people

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:55.200
than we would just
reach on this podium.

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:58.400
John, can you also put
my PowerPoint back up?

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:01.720
And so, we need to
talk about audience

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.780
and we need to talk about products.

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:09.330
And I have a couple slides that I
think will help to move us forward.

01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:10.630
Who had that-- ?

01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:11.930
&gt;&gt; It's up on the [inaudible].

01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:16.520
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Can you
grab it for me, please?

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.820
Well, of course the Library

01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:22.660
of Congress is interested
in both of these things.

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:27.650
And we've done in a fairly passive
way, because it's just available

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:29.190
on the library's website.

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:31.590
We've put up a lot of
these materials online.

01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:36.080
It's an expectation now, I think
that material be accessible online

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.060
and we're trying to oblige.

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:42.320
As I said, putting up 300,000
pieces of paper is no small feat.

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.740
And if you work a little bit
through this, you'll find many,

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:49.570
many recordings, photographs,
and other things.

01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:53.370
But there are other ways that
we reach out to the world,

01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:54.910
which is different than
reaching the world.

01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:59.990
We reach out to the world using
a number of enterprise products.

01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:04.790
And that would be for example,
the library's online catalog

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:07.830
which is a great place to
search and find things.

01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:12.790
And then outreach, such as
the library's blog series

01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:15.670
and Folk Life Today's --
American Folks Life Center's blog.

01:12:15.670 --> 01:12:16.970
If you don't subscribe, you should.

01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:18.410
It's a lot of fun.

01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:20.700
And through podcasts.

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.530
And we have a Facebook page.

01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:25.250
We have the library's
Twitter account.

01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.080
I think there's an
Instagram account.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:31.950
So, we're trying, but as
I said, that's different

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:33.850
than reaching to audiences.

01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:39.840
And we had a really robust
discussion yesterday about reaching

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:45.980 position:56%
to audiences and if I can summarize,
and then ask for you input.

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:50.990
We have identified kind of
two classes of audience.

01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:55.900
And the first would be communities
of origin, or niche communities.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:13:00.030
And in terms of communities
of origin,

01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:08.570
we can see how the Irish
broadcast can reach back to Cork,

01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:13.840
and have that kind of
meaning to a man from Cork.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.820
Probably a deeper meaning
that I could understand

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:17.840
because he's a community of origin.

01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:23.350
And a niche interest group
might be the educational kind

01:13:23.350 --> 01:13:27.260
of classroom setting that
you were describing earlier.

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:30.890
And those kinds of
things take partnerships.

01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:32.190
They take dedication.

01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:40.810
They take long patience and thought
and feedback from the communities,

01:13:40.810 --> 01:13:43.580
in order to craft something
that's meaningful to them.

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:46.530
Engagement with the mass media
is something else entirely.

01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:49.160
And the Folk Life Center does that.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:54.460
You know, we're going to screen
American Epic, which was a film

01:13:54.460 --> 01:13:58.320
that was released on
PBS, I believe recently.

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.840
And made a big splash.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:04.560
It was a feature film and
they used some of our footage

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.760
from the Lomax footage in it.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.070
And so, we can engage
with the mass media.

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:14.420
We can talk to filmmakers
about how to use our stuff.

01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:18.690 position:56%
We can even reach out to filmmakers,
but it's in a very different way

01:14:18.690 --> 01:14:21.520
than approaching communities
of origin.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.480
It's a press release or a packet
or something like that saying,

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.080
"Hey, this is what we have."

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.380
Then they take it and
use it in their own way.

01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:32.570
Have I at least approached
the discussion that we had?

01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:40.110
I think everybody's lob
[phonetic] is up now.

01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:41.410
Delaina's?

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.710
&gt;&gt; Delaina Sepko: No,
I think you have,

01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:44.510
and thanks for the recap, Todd.

01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:49.870
And we definitely struggled with
there are almost too many options.

01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:54.500
And what was the best way to
do justice to the collections

01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:58.910 position:56%
to get them out as much as possible,
but to do it in a meaningful

01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:00.650
and thoughtful sort of way.

01:15:00.650 --> 01:15:03.660
We recognized that we have an --

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:06.400
lessons from the past
that we can look towards.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.510 position:56%
Broadcasts like Trans-Atlantic Call,
that we can look to the formats

01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:13.900
that maybe Lomax has
used previously,

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:17.350
and maybe adjust them a little
bit for a modern context.

01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:21.740
But we also know that time has
moved on and things have changed.

01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.940
So, in what sort of way
might we need to adjust those

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.080
to make them relevant now?

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.550
We know that we have fairly
effective tools in terms

01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:33.510
of reaching a large audience.

01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:36.880
The Twitter, the Facebook,
all of these kinds of things,

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.680
but they are not an
-- they are a vehicle.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:42.530
They are not a product.

01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:46.190
And so, we were very aware of how
we might be able to use those,

01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:50.960
in a way that like I said
before, did everything justice.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.620
Did the people that we were
trying to reach a service

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.700
and in the same way,
do right by the things

01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:58.440
that we were trying
to connect them with.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.580
It's not an easy task.

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:06.130
I'm not sure that we've even
come up with a firm sort of idea,

01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:13.490
but we have at least had
time and spent the time

01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:15.620
to consider these sorts of things,

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:18.480
and that is precisely why
we're opening up to you guys

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:22.260
at the moment, because we don't
have a final kind of product.

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:25.330
We want everyone else's
collective experience.

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:27.300
We want to maybe hear
your suggestions.

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:30.870
We want to know what you've tried,
what's worked, what hasn't worked,

01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:34.830
and then what things would you
be interested in as a member

01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:37.820
of a niche community, as
a user of social media,

01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:40.310
and all the things
that fall in between?

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:45.720
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Do you want to
talk about maybe a concrete idea

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.260
that we discussed yesterday?

01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:53.890
&gt;&gt; Sarah Tomlinson: Sure, so I
teach a music appreciation class

01:16:53.890 --> 01:16:56.120
at a school in Durham,
North Carolina.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:16:59.730
And so, bringing some
of the radio materials

01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:03.410
that were originally created for
kids, to the classroom there,

01:17:03.410 --> 01:17:07.220
is something that I already have
a community partnership with,

01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:08.600
and that we can make happen.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.900
And so, that type of -- and that
sort of fit into our conversation

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:16.040
about communities of origin.

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.280
And actually, when we first
found the stack of letters

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.050
from Mrs. Seegle's
class, we said, "Oh,

01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:25.520
we have to go to the Stratford Ave.
School and show them the letters

01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.580 position:56%
that maybe their grandparents wrote.

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:32.360
So, even a more you know, a
school as a community of origin

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:37.640
for school programs, but also the
specific school can sometimes work.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:41.300
A way you can sort
of incorporate it,

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:45.030
like the Golden Gate Quartet being
from Charlotte, North Carolina.

01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:47.290
So, bringing that particular
broadcaster.

01:17:47.290 --> 01:17:49.990
They were actually on many
of the school broadcasts,

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:51.310
bringing one of those too.

01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:54.710
Some more in Charlotte and
highlighting that local connection.

01:17:54.710 --> 01:17:58.630
And I think we also talked
about, that way you sort of see

01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:01.830
and know the impacts that you
have in doing outreach activity,

01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:05.950 position:56%
when you work with a specific group,
rather than when you put something

01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:07.850
on a mass media platform.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:13.020
There's more uncertainty about what
its use will be, and the anxiety is

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:16.770
that it will sit there, and nobody
will actually engage with it.

01:18:16.770 --> 01:18:20.420
But then of course,
it has the potential

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.720
to affect that many more people.

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:26.980
So, I think that tension was
what we were going back and forth

01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:30.210
about do you want to do a
[inaudible] impact to a kind

01:18:30.210 --> 01:18:36.960
of smaller group or big, but
possibly more risky project, yes.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:39.490
And we even thought
about packaging --

01:18:39.490 --> 01:18:43.850
you can make a podcast about
going to a school, you know.

01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:46.160
You can bring them together
in interesting ways.

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:49.610
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Right,
that would be the hybrid.

01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:50.910
&gt;&gt; Sarah Tomlinson: Yes.

01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:52.210
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: If we could
find an institutional partner

01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:55.420
to create a series of podcasts
about us going back to the schools

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:57.520
to engage with communities
of origin.

01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.390
It might be something --

01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:05.030
I don't suppose anybody
from NPR is here, are they?

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:11.100
What kind of foster questions
do you all have, if any?

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:19.810
The Folk Life Center you know,
has a lot of experience engaging

01:19:19.810 --> 01:19:23.040
with communities, back into --

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.300
well, the most prominent
example I can think

01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:30.980
of is our federal [inaudible]
project, where we made taped copies

01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:34.620
of [inaudible] of Native American
communities, and then disseminated

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:37.530
to those -- you know,
their -- those communities,

01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:39.190
their own intellectual property.

01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:41.070
Their own cultural heritage.

01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:44.170
And those are partnerships
that began with that gesture

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:47.740
and have continued in
a major way ever since.

01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:53.320
So, we you know, that kind of
thing is I think very much in line

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:56.250
with the partnerships with
the communities of origin.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:20:00.660
And engagement with the mass media
is something entirely different.

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:02.080
What do you think, Nancy?

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.760
You have a microphone right there.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.170
&gt;&gt; Actually, I was going
to take the opportunity,

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:10.980
since we have some panelists
from outside the U.S.,

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:16.760
to ask what the impression
is of the Library of Congress

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.530
and the American Folk Life Center?

01:20:18.530 --> 01:20:21.470
Among both scholars -- I assume
scholars generally know what we

01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:27.210
have, but perhaps also musicians
and community historians

01:20:27.210 --> 01:20:30.340
and how we might be able
to up our visibility

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:36.030
in the U.K. and in Ireland?

01:20:36.030 --> 01:20:38.420
&gt;&gt; Alan Noonan: I might start
digging at that question.

01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:41.540
That's a really good question.

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:43.800 position:56%
I know that [inaudible] was the
Lomax fellow here several years ago,

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.100
and she actually turned
me on to the Library

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:47.870 position:56%
of Congress's collections a little
bit more than I probably would have,

01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:50.280
and that was kind of
leading me into to apply

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:52.310
for the Kluge fellowship
here and really start digging

01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:55.490
into the 20th Century oral
record, oral histories,

01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:59.700
and records of miners and mining
communities, around the U.S.,

01:20:59.700 --> 01:21:01.200
whereas you know, I
might have gone --

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:05.260
just stayed in the nice
confines of the 19th Century.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:12.000
But I think a project like this
gives us a huge opportunity

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.120
and a huge avenue to explore
a greater collaborative sort

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.250
of outreach, and I
know that that word

01:21:18.250 --> 01:21:23.970
"outreach" is awfully dangerous,
but all of us are former fellows

01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:28.130
of this institution, and all of us
have had this wonderful opportunity

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:30.860
to be here, even if
just for this week.

01:21:30.860 --> 01:21:35.780
I think underutilizing people
like [inaudible] or even myself,

01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:39.350
this project here, gives us a
chance to reestablish those links

01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:45.100 position:56%
and reemerge with some other sort of
project and some other reassessment

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.310
of these connections that do exist.

01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:49.090
I mean, again, like even myself,

01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:52.930
and I wouldn't consider myself
you know an [inaudible] Corkman,

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:54.230
I didn't know about
these connections.

01:21:54.230 --> 01:21:56.840
That was kind of why I'm kind
of coming to you saying that,

01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:01.040
this was a local connection that
I had, that I never understood.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.680
That it added richness and
depth to my own understanding

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:05.490
of who I am and where I come from.

01:22:05.490 --> 01:22:09.180
And for a Corkman to admit
that, is a big thing.

01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.430
So, I think that there is
definitely a path forward.

01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:15.980
Where we go on from here, is
really a sort of exciting question.

01:22:15.980 --> 01:22:17.840
I think you've touched
on that question,

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:21.740
but we can go further than that.

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:26.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: I would add to
that, that yes, there's a temptation

01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:30.710
so much at the moment to think
in terms of national boundaries,

01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:37.350
both in -- and borders, both in the
U.S. and also in the U.K. You know,

01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:40.460
we have the British Library.

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:43.080
We have the British
Broadcasting Corporation

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.670
and obviously this is
the nation's library here

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:46.970
at the Library of Congress.

01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:50.190
But in reality, the people who've
worked for these and continue

01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:53.670
to work for these institutions,
and the collections that they house

01:22:53.670 --> 01:22:58.020
and the things that they produce,
always overspill those boundaries.

01:22:58.020 --> 01:23:02.740
And so, ways of formalizing --
continuing to formalize those

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:07.450
and to exchange material
and to use material,

01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:08.750
could only be a good thing.

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:11.590
I don't want to talk too much
about the Trans-Atlantic Call

01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:14.850 position:56%
because I mean, you've done the work
on it, but one other thing we found

01:23:14.850 --> 01:23:19.550
as you said, there's no -- we
can't see the other side of the--

01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:21.040
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Kate Neale: Yes.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.340
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: The -- yes.

01:23:22.340 --> 01:23:24.070
You go through it, yes.

01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:26.120
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Kate Neale: So,
what's missing but not missing

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:31.210
because it's not Lomax material
are the BBC replies in some cases

01:23:31.210 --> 01:23:32.510
to the Trans-Atlantic Call.

01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:36.480
So, I mentioned in the little
talk that I did just then

01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:40.670
about we don't know what Soho said
to New York's Upper East Side.

01:23:40.670 --> 01:23:45.650
And we don't know the institutional
kind of processes and priorities

01:23:45.650 --> 01:23:48.040
that would have informed
that broadcast,

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.890
whereas we do know
that from this side.

01:23:49.890 --> 01:23:53.430
So, what Alan Lomax
actually achieved you know,

01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:57.130
a Trans-Atlantic Project at
the time of a war, you know,

01:23:57.130 --> 01:24:00.570
now with our incredibly connected
world, I think we should be able

01:24:00.570 --> 01:24:04.190
to build on that and
do something more.

01:24:04.190 --> 01:24:08.290
But yes, finding the partners,
building the partnerships,

01:24:08.290 --> 01:24:12.490 position:56%
I think there's a huge amount of
mileage in going back to communities

01:24:12.490 --> 01:24:16.990
of origin because the people
who live there now, I mean,

01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:18.290
we talked about migration.

01:24:18.290 --> 01:24:20.510
We've talked about all sorts of
things, but the people who live

01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:24.150
in these locations now, may not
know that there was such interest

01:24:24.150 --> 01:24:27.110
from America in their
traditions and their cultures.

01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:28.570
Even within America, you know?

01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:34.140
Mason City, some of the news
reports that were so excited

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:37.620
about how Mason City would be
presented, not only to the U.S.,

01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:44.240
but to the U.K. I think that
it's easy as an ethnomusicologist

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.160
and a folklore enthusiast
to be enthusiastic about it

01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:51.570
on a personal level, but I think
there's a much broader audience

01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:54.200
than just in this room, for that.

01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:56.600
&gt;&gt; Alan Noonan: Yes, what's
the phrase we were thinking

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.210
of something in partnership?

01:24:58.210 --> 01:24:59.510
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Kate Neale: Sorry?

01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:00.810
&gt;&gt; Alan Noonan: There were two
Ps that we were working off of.

01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:02.200
The something and partnership.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:05.620
The differentiation between --
product and partnership, is it?

01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:11.220 position:56%
That we would go to various groups,
be they local, historical societies,

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:13.560
or museums, or local
institutions and things like that,

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:16.410
and we would arrive, and we would
offer them something of interest.

01:25:16.410 --> 01:25:18.220
Maybe an exploration
of these sources.

01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:23.070
Not necessarily done by us,
but offer them this material

01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:26.880
that they might explore themselves
and you know, we would be there.

01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.430
If they want a collaborative
project,

01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:29.980
we would be available for that.

01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:34.010
But that -- these alternative
formats might be something

01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:35.790
that they themselves could explore.

01:25:35.790 --> 01:25:39.530
And so, again, the localism
isn't simply like us going

01:25:39.530 --> 01:25:41.530
into the local communities
and saying like,

01:25:41.530 --> 01:25:42.830
"We will tell you your history."

01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:46.960
It's them further exploring
what's going on at the present,

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.880
what happened in the past, and
contextualizing it from there.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:54.050
&gt;&gt; Sarah Tomlinson: Yes, and
again, what type of product--

01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:55.350
&gt;&gt; Alan Noonan: Exactly.

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:57.660
&gt;&gt; Sarah Tomlinson: -they would
use, or that they already use,

01:25:57.660 --> 01:26:01.560 position:56%
so that it can -- so that we're
creating something that is you know,

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.510
going to be effective, yes.

01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:13.380
&gt;&gt; One of the words I -- thank you.

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:18.660 position:56%
One of the words I heard pop-up over
and over again, in different forms,

01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:24.300
were collaborative outreach,
crowd-sourcing, a reiteration.

01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:30.130 position:56%
And what I hear in that is something
like what Lomax did originally,

01:26:30.130 --> 01:26:35.430
which was to go out to the
people and get material coming

01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:39.510
in to the collections, you know?

01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:42.600
And so, much of what
you're looking at,

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:46.780
I imagine there's still many people
who have heard these broadcasts,

01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:51.150
you know, have photos,
have recollections

01:26:51.150 --> 01:26:54.490
that could be added to
what's already there.

01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:58.910
And putting up something
like chronicling America

01:26:58.910 --> 01:27:03.830
which so many newspapers that
scholars use, that researchers use,

01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:08.080
wonderful, but the addition
that I keep hearing from you

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.540
of bringing in the audience.

01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:13.620
I really applaud that.

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:16.140
I think that's wonderful.

01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:21.590 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Delaina Sepko: Well, I think that
was a big part of and how we started

01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:23.930
out this week, is that
instead of being --

01:27:23.930 --> 01:27:27.720 position:56%
you know, we all know a thing or
two about music or about Alan Lomax,

01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:32.390
but that doesn't make us an
authority on any of it, you know,

01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:35.900
in that respect or all of
it, you know, in that way.

01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:39.890
And that what we were very keen
to do, was to invite people

01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:44.390 position:56%
into that conversation to bring them
into the process, and in a sense,

01:27:44.390 --> 01:27:47.410
leave the produce almost
open-ended at the back,

01:27:47.410 --> 01:27:51.240
to allow that space for,
not just for access to old,

01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:53.180
but for the ingest of new.

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:58.260
And any sort of form or you know,
we've been calling it product

01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:01.390
for a lack of a better word, but
it really does feel like more

01:28:01.390 --> 01:28:06.170
of a process, where
things are an added,

01:28:06.170 --> 01:28:11.160
things are reimagined,
and then reproduced.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:17.490
And so, you know, almost the
broadcast, this podcast was a way

01:28:17.490 --> 01:28:20.530
to potentially do that, and
that we had an opportunity

01:28:20.530 --> 01:28:25.230
to showcase what maybe happened
say, during Trans-Atlantic Call.

01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:29.580
You know, when Soho called
and the Upper East Side.

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:32.010
You know, that -- you know,
we know that that half

01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:34.520
of the conversation is
missing, but what happened if --

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:37.060
what would happen if
Gloucester, Massachusetts,

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:38.770
calls Gloucester, England?

01:28:38.770 --> 01:28:41.800
What would happen today
if that happened?

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:45.330
Or what if Durham, North
Carolina calls Durham, England?

01:28:45.330 --> 01:28:50.770 position:56%
You know, there's a real opportunity
there just in using a city name

01:28:50.770 --> 01:28:56.580
as the linchpin and just be able
to work an idea around that.

01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:01.810
And create more folk, more
folk culture, more folk music,

01:29:01.810 --> 01:29:04.300
the folk whatever comes into it.

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.710
And that's where we saw an
opportunity to use things

01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:12.820
like social media and other various
kind of digital platforms to allow

01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:18.760
that ingest, and then also
to share it back out again.

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:21.850
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: I see -- Josh, do
you have a question back there?

01:29:21.850 --> 01:29:23.610 position:56%
And then we'll do one more question,

01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:24.910
and then I think we
need to take it out.

01:29:24.910 --> 01:29:27.380
We're almost out of time.

01:29:27.380 --> 01:29:29.710
&gt;&gt; First of all, thank you for
five excellent presentations,

01:29:29.710 --> 01:29:31.320
and six including Todd.

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:32.820
Thank you very much.

01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:34.120
I enjoyed it a lot.

01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:38.750
So, on the point you guys were just
raising, I think Nathan Salzburg

01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:42.180
at Cultural Equity, the Alan
Lomax Archive in Kentucky,

01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.290
has actually done exactly this.

01:29:44.290 --> 01:29:48.050
And he's actually managed to work
with local historical societies

01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:51.160
and local schools about
Kentucky history in specific.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.220
That just seems like
a natural synergy

01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.820 position:56%
for what you guys are proposing here

01:29:54.820 --> 01:29:58.960
since other Alan Lomax areas have
already even had the same concept.

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.260
I mean, it's a great
concept, of course.

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:01.560
Yes, absolutely.

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.860
So, that's what I wanted
to say about that.

01:30:02.860 --> 01:30:04.160
And he'll be at the conference too.

01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:05.520
You can talk to him
there [inaudible].

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.820
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Right.

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:12.780
Right. And don't forget the Radio
Preservation Task [inaudible]

01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:15.800
Conference coming up
in five weeks or so.

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.100
Did you have [inaudible]?

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.480
And wait for the mic.

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:23.060
And then we're going to
let Alan take us out.

01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:27.040
&gt;&gt; My question was just more
specific towards your presentation.

01:30:27.040 --> 01:30:31.470
Did you have any audience?

01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:35.070
Did you have -- sorry, I'm
like super nervous right now.

01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:41.380 position:56%
Any audience feedback from the U.S.?

01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:42.680
Did you look into any of that?

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:46.380
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: Not on those --
on the Arts of the Negro program.

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:48.880
So, those were broadcast
in Britain--

01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.180
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:30:50.180 --> 01:30:51.480
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: -only.

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.780
And--

01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:54.080
&gt;&gt; And the audience?

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.380
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: There
is some audience feedback.

01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.680
There's some in the collections but
they're unfortunately not relating

01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:57.980
to the episode that I looked at.

01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:04.420
There's some to Episode 1, which is
interesting because it's a mixture

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:09.250
of sort of seeing you know, people
here, power and authenticity

01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:10.870
and Jelly Roll Morton playing.

01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:13.940
And we sort of -- we can
think about that in two ways.

01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:16.460
We can either take it at face
value or we can sort of say

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:20.660
that there was -- it fitted --
it may have fitted a stereotype

01:31:20.660 --> 01:31:27.790
or something that British
listeners may have imagined

01:31:27.790 --> 01:31:29.090
that New Orleans was -- you know,

01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:32.640
New Orleans at the turn
of the century was like.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:36.210
There may be more at
the BBC archives

01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:38.260
and the BBC archives are a
little bit more difficult to get

01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:40.840 position:56%
into than the Alan Lomax collection.

01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:44.250
So, that's another thing about
this you know, partnerships,

01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:47.260
actually matching up these
Trans-Atlantic things.

01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:52.460
But of course, as I sort
of gestured to at the end,

01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:55.920
this material was used by Lomax
over and over and over again.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:32:00.620
And so, we can also look at the
reception to his work more broadly

01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:04.730
about things like The Land Where
the Blues Began, the Rainbow Sign

01:32:04.730 --> 01:32:07.760
and these various other books,
and things that he wrote.

01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:11.920
So, I think it's an area that we
need to look more at basically.

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:13.220
But thanks.

01:32:13.220 --> 01:32:14.520
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Excellent question.

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:15.820
And you know, the blues

01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:18.090 position:56%
and the Mississippi Night recordings
I think were considered too hot

01:32:18.090 --> 01:32:19.390
to release.

01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:20.690
He had intended to release them.

01:32:20.690 --> 01:32:22.340
I don't think he released
them for another decade.

01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:23.640
&gt;&gt; Lawrence Davies: Yes.

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:24.940 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Because they -- yes.

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:27.140
Because of the imagined reaction.

01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:32.050
I want to say thank you to everyone

01:32:32.050 --> 01:32:36.260
for spending your Friday
afternoon with us.

01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:41.850
And I can't even say thank
you enough to my friends.

01:32:41.850 --> 01:32:47.350
And let's have a little
Lomax radio to take us out.

01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:49.650
La Partenza.

01:32:51.510 --> 01:33:45.850
[ Music ]

01:33:45.850 --> 01:33:47.970
&gt;&gt; Alan Lomax: This is the
music of the old port of Genoa,

01:33:47.970 --> 01:33:51.330
whose many storied,
close-packed, palazzios,

01:33:51.330 --> 01:33:55.290
make a sort of downtown
Manhattan on the Mediterranean.

01:33:55.290 --> 01:33:57.410
Winding through those narrow
lanes, you must arrive

01:33:57.410 --> 01:34:01.190
at precisely the right hour of the
evening, at a particular wine shop,

01:34:01.190 --> 01:34:05.120
that looks like all the other bars
in that foggy and obscure district.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.170 position:56%
And there you will find, the Genoese
dock workers, drinking flasks

01:34:09.170 --> 01:34:11.990
of their white Ligurian
wine, and improvising

01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:14.510 position:56%
in the seven-part, trallalero style.

01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:22.060
[ Music ]

01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:26.360
Trallalero is a music as richly
textured as a Medieval tapestry,

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:30.280
and is bountifully joyful as
its own green Ligurian hills.

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:34.140
To most Italians however, it seems
unfamiliar and even un-Italian.

01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.670
You must listen again and hear the
docker who thrums guitar noises

01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:40.370
out of his throat, the
tram-conductor's soprano

01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:43.480
with his [inaudible]
southern arabesques of melody,

01:34:43.480 --> 01:34:47.200
the Tuscan operatic bravura
of the tenor and baritone,

01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:49.540
the incredible Sardinian basses.

01:34:49.540 --> 01:34:51.170
Listen to this, and realize

01:34:51.170 --> 01:34:54.510
that trallalero is the musical
sum of Italian folksong.

01:34:54.510 --> 01:35:41.040
[ Music ]

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:42.840
&gt;&gt; Todd Harvey: Thank you all.

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:47.890
[ Applause ]

01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:52.460
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
