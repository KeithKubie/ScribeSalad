TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:00.916 --> 00:00:03.270
I'm Timothy Jordan, and this
is your very quick update

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.660
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.430
Working together
as a community is

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.650
key to supporting
women in tech, which

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.470
is why we're excited to announce
the Women Techmakers Udacity

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.509
Scholarship.

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.800
This new scholarship provides
the opportunity for women

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.040
to earn online certification
in Android basics, Android

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.260
developer, front
end web developer,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.940
and full stack developer.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.360
All courses co-designed
by Google experts.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.700
And includes opportunities for
women at multiple skill levels.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.800
Head on over to the post
linked in the description

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.160
below to learn more, and
apply by June 9, 2017.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
Cloud Source Repositories,
our hosted git version control

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.320
system, is now
generally available.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.450
We've increased the
supported repository size

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.910
from one gigabyte
to 50 gigabytes,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.410
which should give
your team plenty

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.210
of room for large projects.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.520
And there's a new
pricing model, complete

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.220
with a robust free tier that
should allow many of you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.380
to use it at no cost.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.900
Get started with the post.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.140
We've introduced two new ways
to harness the speed of AMP

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.370
to improve advertising
performance.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.310
First, a new ad words
beta that lets you

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.770
use fast loading AMP
pages as the landing

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.540
pages for your search ads.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.780
And second, we're speeding up
ads served across the Google

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.270
Display Network by using
the same technology that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.240
makes AMP pages so fast.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.860
Last week, at Google
Marketing Next,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.010
we shared the next generation
of Ad Words, DoubleClick,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.410
and Google Analytics
Tools, each of them

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.420
shaped by your
feedback, and built

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.230
to help you work as productively
and efficiently as possible.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.030

updates, check out
