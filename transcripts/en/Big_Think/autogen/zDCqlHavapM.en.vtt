00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990
that question I want to I know you're
 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.750
that question I want to I know you're
asking about now and I can and I'll get

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760
asking about now and I can and I'll get
 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.640
asking about now and I can and I'll get
back to now but when you talk about

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650
back to now but when you talk about
 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.800
back to now but when you talk about
cultural trigger points that's exactly

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810
cultural trigger points that's exactly
 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.960
cultural trigger points that's exactly
what there was I mean at least that's

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970
what there was I mean at least that's
 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.670
what there was I mean at least that's
exactly the question that I that I

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680
exactly the question that I that I
 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.170
exactly the question that I that I
wanted to try to answer I mean why if no

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180
wanted to try to answer I mean why if no
 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.300
wanted to try to answer I mean why if no
one had thought about time travel as an

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310
one had thought about time travel as an
 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.330
one had thought about time travel as an
idea before was it suddenly possible for

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340
idea before was it suddenly possible for
 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.820
idea before was it suddenly possible for
HG Wells to create this powerful fantasy

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830
HG Wells to create this powerful fantasy
 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.950
HG Wells to create this powerful fantasy
and I should jump in here and say that

00:03:58.950 --> 00:03:58.960
and I should jump in here and say that
 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.650
and I should jump in here and say that
your book makes the surprising but

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660
your book makes the surprising but
 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.660
your book makes the surprising but
evidently very well researched claim

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670
evidently very well researched claim
 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.120
evidently very well researched claim
that indeed HG Wells essentially

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130
that indeed HG Wells essentially
 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.040
that indeed HG Wells essentially
invented the idea of time travel that it

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050
invented the idea of time travel that it
 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.130
invented the idea of time travel that it
barely shows up before the book the time

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140
barely shows up before the book the time
 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.350
barely shows up before the book the time
machine yeah it was a surprise to me and

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360
machine yeah it was a surprise to me and
 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.090
machine yeah it was a surprise to me and
I'm and I'm still prepared to be

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100
I'm and I'm still prepared to be
 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.190
I'm and I'm still prepared to be
defensive about it because because

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200
defensive about it because because
 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.349
defensive about it because because
everyone's first reaction seems to be

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359
everyone's first reaction seems to be
 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.940
everyone's first reaction seems to be
wait that can't possibly be true well

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950
wait that can't possibly be true well
 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.680
wait that can't possibly be true well
yeah what about the ancient Greeks

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690
yeah what about the ancient Greeks
 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.780
yeah what about the ancient Greeks
didn't they you know at least think

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790
didn't they you know at least think
 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.490
didn't they you know at least think
about what about the future

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500
about what about the future
 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.310
about what about the future
well it's you know it's a tricky

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320
well it's you know it's a tricky
 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.330
well it's you know it's a tricky
question of course

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340
question of course
 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.280
question of course
you think about the future and you have

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290
you think about the future and you have
 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.170
you think about the future and you have
fortune tellers that's there's hardly

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180
fortune tellers that's there's hardly
 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.540
fortune tellers that's there's hardly
any cultural tradition that's older than

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550
any cultural tradition that's older than
 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.900
any cultural tradition that's older than
that can you predict what's gonna happen

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910
that can you predict what's gonna happen
 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.550
that can you predict what's gonna happen
to me

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560
to me
 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.670
to me
soothsayers and diviners and and all of

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680
soothsayers and diviners and and all of
 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.040
soothsayers and diviners and and all of
that but most of the time you discover

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050
that but most of the time you discover
 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.840
that but most of the time you discover
that people are wondering about their

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850
that people are wondering about their
 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.060
that people are wondering about their
own future right you know you want to

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070
own future right you know you want to
 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.280
own future right you know you want to
know am I gonna live a happy life what

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290
know am I gonna live a happy life what
 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.840
know am I gonna live a happy life what
they were not capable of asking was how

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850
they were not capable of asking was how
 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.510
they were not capable of asking was how
is the world going to be different for

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520
is the world going to be different for
 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.990
is the world going to be different for
my grandchildren what wonderful things

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000
my grandchildren what wonderful things
 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.840
my grandchildren what wonderful things
will they experience and surround

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850
will they experience and surround
 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.140
will they experience and surround
themselves with that don't exist in the

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150
themselves with that don't exist in the
 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.590
themselves with that don't exist in the
present so that brings us to

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600
present so that brings us to
 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.420
present so that brings us to
technological advancement and also the

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430
technological advancement and also the
 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.550
technological advancement and also the
concept of culture as a whole

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560
concept of culture as a whole
 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.830
concept of culture as a whole
exactly yeah yeah I mean you have to

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840
exactly yeah yeah I mean you have to
 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.529
exactly yeah yeah I mean you have to
have technological change accelerating

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539
have technological change accelerating
 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.460
have technological change accelerating
to a kind of critical point where a

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470
to a kind of critical point where a
 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.129
to a kind of critical point where a
person can look around the landscape and

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139
person can look around the landscape and
 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.040
person can look around the landscape and
see trains whizzing by where there

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050
see trains whizzing by where there
 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.390
see trains whizzing by where there
didn't used to be where there used to

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400
didn't used to be where there used to
 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.240
didn't used to be where there used to
just be farmland and realized that this

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250
just be farmland and realized that this
 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.390
just be farmland and realized that this
newfangled electric telegraph is really

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400
newfangled electric telegraph is really
 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.390
newfangled electric telegraph is really
altering people's living habits right

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400
altering people's living habits right
 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.090
altering people's living habits right
and then you start to ask well gee could

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100
and then you start to ask well gee could
 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.980
and then you start to ask well gee could
things be different what land and you

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990
things be different what land and you
 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.600
things be different what land and you
ask what marbles will the future bring

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610
ask what marbles will the future bring
 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.460
ask what marbles will the future bring
right and and that's what happened and

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470
right and and that's what happened and
 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.170
right and and that's what happened and
so I explore the history of that a

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180
so I explore the history of that a
 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.779
so I explore the history of that a
little bit but now I mean because you

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789
little bit but now I mean because you
 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:57.540
little bit but now I mean because you
asked yeah yeah about know now think now

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550
asked yeah yeah about know now think now
 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.610
asked yeah yeah about know now think now
it's very different because we're so

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620
it's very different because we're so
 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.830
it's very different because we're so
used to it we're so familiar with it we

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840
used to it we're so familiar with it we
 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.570
used to it we're so familiar with it we
know all about time travel we're kind of

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580
know all about time travel we're kind of
 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.700
know all about time travel we're kind of
experts all right from from the cradle

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710
experts all right from from the cradle
 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.980
experts all right from from the cradle
so it's interesting to me that people

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990
so it's interesting to me that people
 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.710
so it's interesting to me that people
keep finding new variations yeah I mean

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720
keep finding new variations yeah I mean
 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.080
keep finding new variations yeah I mean
even my eight-year-old son has come up

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090
even my eight-year-old son has come up
 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.510
even my eight-year-old son has come up
with a essentially incomprehensible but

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520
with a essentially incomprehensible but
 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.300
with a essentially incomprehensible but
I've probed it I don't get it but it's a

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310
I've probed it I don't get it but it's a
 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.580
I've probed it I don't get it but it's a
paradox that he seems to think is

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:20.590
paradox that he seems to think is
 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.279
paradox that he seems to think is
coherent about time travel where he's

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289
coherent about time travel where he's
 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.080
coherent about time travel where he's
like oh if I went back in time and then

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090
like oh if I went back in time and then
 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.270
like oh if I went back in time and then
but the best I can understand is that he

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280
but the best I can understand is that he
 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.640
but the best I can understand is that he
thinks that time travel is some kind of

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650
thinks that time travel is some kind of
 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.440
thinks that time travel is some kind of
virtual reality machine where you're

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450
virtual reality machine where you're
 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.659
virtual reality machine where you're
actually it's just amassed all the data

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669
actually it's just amassed all the data
 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.850
actually it's just amassed all the data
from everything that's ever happened and

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860
from everything that's ever happened and
 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.890
from everything that's ever happened and
so when you go back you're creating new

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900
so when you go back you're creating new
 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.830
so when you go back you're creating new
data and then you're it's a very crazy

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840
data and then you're it's a very crazy
 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.270
data and then you're it's a very crazy
well that sounds he said in very

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280
well that sounds he said in very
 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.280
well that sounds he said in very

something I think and and maybe this is

part of the real answer to your question

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600
part of the real answer to your question
 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.960
part of the real answer to your question
which is we know that that the

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970
which is we know that that the
 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.340
which is we know that that the
technological change that we're

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350
technological change that we're
 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.760
technological change that we're
experiencing is all bound up with

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770
experiencing is all bound up with

it it is different but what I'm trying

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660
it it is different but what I'm trying
 

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:50.270
it it is different but what I'm trying
to say is that on the one hand were

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:50.280
to say is that on the one hand were
 

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.370
to say is that on the one hand were

an unending present and I think you're
 

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.950
an unending present and I think you're
very right to say that we don't really

very right to say that we don't really
 

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.170
very right to say that we don't really

that makes me think you're writing about
 

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:39.560
that makes me think you're writing about

were thinking the same way we think and

people you admire living in the past say
 

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.610
people you admire living in the past say
the most atrocious things about about

the most atrocious things about about
 

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.970
the most atrocious things about about
women and yet you recognize that it was

but that's but that's not all I'm saying
 

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.030
but that's but that's not all I'm saying
I'm also saying if I'm trying to write

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040
I'm also saying if I'm trying to write
 

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:35.310
I'm also saying if I'm trying to write
about Isaac Newton and what he was

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:35.320
about Isaac Newton and what he was

about Isaac Newton and what he was
thinking about gravity can I subtract

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:38.910
thinking about gravity can I subtract
 

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.060
thinking about gravity can I subtract
from the picture everything that we know

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.070
from the picture everything that we know
 

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.210
from the picture everything that we know
about gravity I mean we have a kind of

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:45.220
about gravity I mean we have a kind of
 

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.980
about gravity I mean we have a kind of
intuition about gravity we can feel it

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:46.990
intuition about gravity we can feel it
 

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.470
intuition about gravity we can feel it
all around us hold out your arm and and

all around us hold out your arm and and

all around us hold out your arm and and
it's then there's this invisible force

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:51.790
it's then there's this invisible force
 

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.110
it's then there's this invisible force
that's pulling it downward and how can

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120
that's pulling it downward and how can
 

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.010
that's pulling it downward and how can
we imagine a mental picture of the world

00:13:59.010 --> 00:13:59.020
we imagine a mental picture of the world
 

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.310
we imagine a mental picture of the world
from which that is subtracted because

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320
from which that is subtracted because

from which that is subtracted because
that's what Newton have Newton you look

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440
that's what Newton have Newton you look
 

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.380
that's what Newton have Newton you look
up the word gravity and historical

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:07.390
up the word gravity and historical
 

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.850
up the word gravity and historical
dictionaries and you realize that before

dictionaries and you realize that before
 

00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:11.790
dictionaries and you realize that before
Newton started calling it using the word

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800
Newton started calling it using the word
 

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.830
Newton started calling it using the word
for the thing we're talking about it

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:13.840
for the thing we're talking about it
 

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.690
for the thing we're talking about it
meant it was a state of mind you know

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:15.700
meant it was a state of mind you know
 

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.340
meant it was a state of mind you know
gravity was the opposite of levity and

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:17.350
gravity was the opposite of levity and
 

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.440
gravity was the opposite of levity and
it just meant taking things seriously

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:19.450
it just meant taking things seriously
 

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.570
it just meant taking things seriously
right but if you want to write about the

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:21.580
right but if you want to write about the
 

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.490
right but if you want to write about the
history of science as I've tried to do

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:23.500
history of science as I've tried to do
 

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.250

you really need to be able to put

to go back to time travel for a second

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:37.750
to go back to time travel for a second
 

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.040
to go back to time travel for a second
this was the surprise conversation well

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:41.050
this was the surprise conversation well

look honest but the last thing I want to

there is my problem with time travel my

00:14:59.730 --> 00:14:59.740
there is my problem with time travel my
 

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.430
there is my problem with time travel my
personal problem with travel is that it

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440
personal problem with travel is that it
 

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.540
personal problem with travel is that it

some way still right now like that's the

these things are some when right yeah

these things are some when right yeah
and you want me to help you with that

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:22.270
and you want me to help you with that
 

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.980
and you want me to help you with that
well no but I guess I guess like why

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:25.990
well no but I guess I guess like why
 

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.120
well no but I guess I guess like why
isn't that a bigger problem in the disk

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:28.130
isn't that a bigger problem in the disk

um I almost hate to reveal this the

um I almost hate to reveal this the
spoiler about this I guess there's a

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.170
spoiler about this I guess there's a
 

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.080

sort of spoiler but I'm just gonna say I

mean I think you're completely right

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:43.250
mean I think you're completely right
 

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.760
mean I think you're completely right
you're obviously right and time travel

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:45.770
you're obviously right and time travel
 

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:48.250
you're obviously right and time travel
is impossible and that's essentially why

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:48.260
is impossible and that's essentially why
 

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.330
is impossible and that's essentially why
but that's okay I mean that's now I want

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:52.340
but that's okay I mean that's now I want
 

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:54.610
but that's okay I mean that's now I want
to say that's alright because we we know

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:54.620
to say that's alright because we we know

you're exactly right

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120
you're exactly right
 

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.160
you're exactly right
time travel presupposes that the past is

time travel presupposes that the past is
still somehow there as opposed to gone

still somehow there as opposed to gone

oh it's for so long as we accept yeah

oh it's for so long as we accept yeah
 

00:18:23.919 --> 00:18:26.669
oh it's for so long as we accept yeah

right and both scientists and people of
religion do that and they do it

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:09.610
religion do that and they do it
 

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.490
religion do that and they do it

realms who I think do it less honorably
 

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.450

on that deflating note yeah let's see
what the next let's see what the next

neuroscientist and it's called your

00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:08.919
neuroscientist and it's called your
 

00:28:08.919 --> 00:28:14.820
neuroscientist and it's called your
time-bending brain so this is a area of

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:14.830
time-bending brain so this is a area of
 

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.649
time-bending brain so this is a area of
interest to me and my labs been studying

00:28:16.649 --> 00:28:16.659
interest to me and my labs been studying
 

00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:19.139
interest to me and my labs been studying
this for a while is this is why time is

00:28:19.139 --> 00:28:19.149
this for a while is this is why time is
 

00:28:19.149 --> 00:28:21.659
this for a while is this is why time is
rubbery and can speed up or slow down

00:28:21.659 --> 00:28:21.669
rubbery and can speed up or slow down
 

00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:24.930
rubbery and can speed up or slow down
and the experiment had never been done

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:24.940
and the experiment had never been done
 

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.289
and the experiment had never been done
about why time seems to move in slow

00:28:28.289 --> 00:28:28.299
about why time seems to move in slow
 

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:30.509
about why time seems to move in slow
motion when you're in a life-threatening

motion when you're in a life-threatening
 

00:28:30.519 --> 00:28:32.969

situation but I talked to so many people

00:28:32.969 --> 00:28:32.979
situation but I talked to so many people
 

00:28:32.979 --> 00:28:36.029
situation but I talked to so many people
and I'd experienced it myself that I

00:28:36.029 --> 00:28:36.039
and I'd experienced it myself that I
 

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:38.639
and I'd experienced it myself that I
wanted to study that so I found a way to

00:28:38.639 --> 00:28:38.649
wanted to study that so I found a way to
 

00:28:38.649 --> 00:28:41.519
wanted to study that so I found a way to
study it by by dropping people from 150

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:41.529
study it by by dropping people from 150
 

00:28:41.529 --> 00:28:43.919
study it by by dropping people from 150

several other experiments we did in my

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:48.340
several other experiments we did in my
 

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.479
several other experiments we did in my
lab led me to understand that people

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:51.489
lab led me to understand that people
 

00:28:51.489 --> 00:28:53.669
lab led me to understand that people
don't actually see time in slow motion

00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679
don't actually see time in slow motion
 

00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:55.739

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:41.620
interested in the perception of time
 

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.930
interested in the perception of time
because that part of it seemed a little

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:43.940
because that part of it seemed a little

obvious to me I mean another thing that

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:46.280
obvious to me I mean another thing that
 

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.330
obvious to me I mean another thing that
that that we all know is that that the

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:49.340
that that we all know is that that the
 

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.299
that that we all know is that that the
years seem to pass a lot more quickly as

00:30:52.299 --> 00:30:52.309
years seem to pass a lot more quickly as
 

00:30:52.309 --> 00:30:54.610
years seem to pass a lot more quickly as
we get older sure you know when you're

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:54.620
we get older sure you know when you're
 

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:57.490
we get older sure you know when you're
six years old a month is a lifetime and

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:57.500
six years old a month is a lifetime and
 

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.330
six years old a month is a lifetime and
when you're 70 years old a month can go

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:01.340
when you're 70 years old a month can go
 

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.419
when you're 70 years old a month can go
spike really tragically quickly

00:31:03.419 --> 00:31:03.429
spike really tragically quickly
 

00:31:03.429 --> 00:31:07.360
spike really tragically quickly
interestingly also it seems like that

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:07.370
interestingly also it seems like that
 

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:10.930
interestingly also it seems like that
time passes more quickly in retrospect I

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:10.940
time passes more quickly in retrospect I
 

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:13.210
time passes more quickly in retrospect I
remember when we first had our son

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:13.220
remember when we first had our son
 

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.190
remember when we first had our son
everyone coming along to us and saying

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200
everyone coming along to us and saying
 

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:18.580
everyone coming along to us and saying
oh it goes so fast you know he's gonna

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:18.590
oh it goes so fast you know he's gonna
 

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.100
oh it goes so fast you know he's gonna
grow up with an exact accent it kind of

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:21.110
grow up with an exact accent it kind of

and then they were met you know year

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:23.450
and then they were met you know year
 

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:25.240
and then they were met you know year
months and years where we were like

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:25.250
months and years where we were like
 

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.760
months and years where we were like
that's not going so fast doesn't feel

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:27.770
that's not going so fast doesn't feel
 

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:29.380
that's not going so fast doesn't feel
like it's going all that fat you know I

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:29.390
like it's going all that fat you know I
 

00:31:29.390 --> 00:31:30.880
like it's going all that fat you know I
mean but they're looking back on it you

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:30.890
mean but they're looking back on it you
 

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.280
mean but they're looking back on it you
know at a vantage point of 25 years

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:33.290
know at a vantage point of 25 years
 

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:35.680
know at a vantage point of 25 years
later or whatever yeah and all of this

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:35.690
later or whatever yeah and all of this
 

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.600
later or whatever yeah and all of this
so so so there are a lot of things like

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:37.610
so so so there are a lot of things like
 

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:39.810
so so so there are a lot of things like
that but not that interesting

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:39.820
that but not that interesting
 

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:41.310
that but not that interesting
that are I'm not saying they're not

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320
that are I'm not saying they're not
 

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:44.400
that are I'm not saying they're not
interesting that we kind of know and I

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:44.410
interesting that we kind of know and I
 

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:46.170
interesting that we kind of know and I
think it's it's it's good that there are

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:46.180
think it's it's it's good that there are
 

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.640
think it's it's it's good that there are
people who explore these things and try

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:47.650
people who explore these things and try
 

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.710
people who explore these things and try
to understand them better right but but

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:49.720
to understand them better right but but
 

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.140
to understand them better right but but
felt like a kind of side issue for me

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:52.150
felt like a kind of side issue for me
 

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:56.070
felt like a kind of side issue for me
yet obviously related because what my

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080
yet obviously related because what my
 

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.280
yet obviously related because what my
book is is most fundamentally about is

00:31:59.280 --> 00:31:59.290
book is is most fundamentally about is
 

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.710
book is is most fundamentally about is
our understanding of time and that's a

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:01.720
our understanding of time and that's a
 

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.500
our understanding of time and that's a
complicated thing very complicated thing

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:04.510
complicated thing very complicated thing
 

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.340
complicated thing very complicated thing
and that has has changed dramatically

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:08.350
and that has has changed dramatically
 

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.770
and that has has changed dramatically
during the last century and I guess my

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:10.780
during the last century and I guess my
 

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.280
during the last century and I guess my
point is that this all does feed into

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:13.290
point is that this all does feed into
 

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:17.490
point is that this all does feed into
time travel storytelling because we're

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:17.500
time travel storytelling because we're
 

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.140
time travel storytelling because we're
learning new things all the time about

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:19.150
learning new things all the time about
 

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.750
learning new things all the time about
the way time passes and the way kind of

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760
the way time passes and the way kind of
 

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.270
the way time passes and the way kind of
flows and and we were therefore forced

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:24.280
flows and and we were therefore forced
 

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.240
flows and and we were therefore forced
to think about what that sentence I just

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:27.250
to think about what that sentence I just
 

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.730
to think about what that sentence I just
said means does time pass

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:29.740
said means does time pass
 

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.870
said means does time pass
does time flow I mean we're not even

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880
does time flow I mean we're not even
 

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.850
does time flow I mean we're not even
getting into them much more complicated

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:35.860
getting into them much more complicated
 

00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.010
getting into them much more complicated
question which obviously this

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:38.020
question which obviously this
 

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.980
question which obviously this
underscores of like what is time at all

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:40.990
underscores of like what is time at all
 

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:44.430
underscores of like what is time at all
and how slippery that concept is and how

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440
and how slippery that concept is and how
 

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.010
and how slippery that concept is and how
aware of that we all are on some level I

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:47.020
aware of that we all are on some level I
 

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.780
aware of that we all are on some level I
actually knew that I was going to have

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:48.790
actually knew that I was going to have
 

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:50.220
actually knew that I was going to have
to deal with that question in the book

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:50.230
to deal with that question in the book
 

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.830
to deal with that question in the book
and I won't pretend that I actually

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:52.840
and I won't pretend that I actually
 

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.080
and I won't pretend that I actually
answered the question but I hope I shed

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:55.090
answered the question but I hope I shed
 

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.660
answered the question but I hope I shed
some light because I felt that that was

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:57.670
some light because I felt that that was
 

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:59.940
some light because I felt that that was
the time travel story trying to shed

00:32:59.940 --> 00:32:59.950
the time travel story trying to shed
 

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.150
the time travel story trying to shed
light on that question yeah yeah indeed

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:03.160
light on that question yeah yeah indeed
 

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.580
light on that question yeah yeah indeed
I mean we have a concept of moving

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:05.590
I mean we have a concept of moving
 

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.370
I mean we have a concept of moving
across something that we don't even have

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:08.380
across something that we don't even have
 

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.220
across something that we don't even have
really the faintest real idea of what it

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:11.230
really the faintest real idea of what it
 

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.800
really the faintest real idea of what it
is that's pretty good whatever you say

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:13.810
is that's pretty good whatever you say
 

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:15.600
is that's pretty good whatever you say
you immediately know it's wrong if we're

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:15.610
you immediately know it's wrong if we're
 

00:33:15.610 --> 00:33:18.270
you immediately know it's wrong if we're
moving we were moving across it or is it

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:18.280
moving we were moving across it or is it
 

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.040
moving we were moving across it or is it
moving through us or is it moving with

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:20.050
moving through us or is it moving with
 

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.380
moving through us or is it moving with
us are we floating in is time or River

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:22.390
us are we floating in is time or River
 

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:24.660
us are we floating in is time or River
it would be I would actually be really

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:24.670
it would be I would actually be really
