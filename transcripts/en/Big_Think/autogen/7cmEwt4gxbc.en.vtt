00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.480
We choose not to talk a lot about diversity
and inclusion.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.700
We’re not running from the topic.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.650
We actually feel like we’re addressing it
head on using analytics and revenue and profit

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.610
to drive the conversation versus some moral
imperative.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.860
And what that means is that it’s not about
fairness and equality alone, it’s about

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:36.250
equity, which is about people getting – if
you treat someone as a person they need a

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.610
little more of something than perhaps someone
else.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.750
And actually if you treat everyone the same
you are not going to get the best out of everyone.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.280
So equality can be used, in fact, to exclude
people and to make the environment a place

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.110
that certain groups of people don’t want
to be in because you’re treating everyone

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.110
the same.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.720
That’s just not the way humans work.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.110
You know, I have two kids.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.149
One of them might need (when they were young)
violin lessons.

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.729
Another one might need dental care.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.990
Well the dental care costs a lot more than
the violin lessons, but they both got something

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.530
that they needed but it wasn’t necessarily
ever equal.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.279
But it’s addressing people where they are.

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:28.229
We also find that diversity and inclusion,
once you bring up those words tension goes

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.369
up in the room, because what happens is when
you say that what people think is race but

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.249
they don’t want to talk about it because
they don’t know how to talk about that.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:44.950
So they awkwardly talk about diversity and
inclusion and the problem that needs to be

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.439
addressed gets diluted.

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.659
We begin to talk about – we can’t talk
about race so then we just say “people of

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.990
color” and “people majority” because
we can’t say “race”.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.070
And then we talk about men and women because
that’s easier than race.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.070
And then what about the disabled?

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.919
“Oh well we can’t really bring that up.”

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:11.700
And all these buttons go off that stops the
conversation.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.510
What we pursue is called a Great Place to
Work For All.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.420
That’s the way we do it.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.060
So we think every employee regardless of who
they are, what they are, or what they do for

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.090
the organization should have a great experience
at work.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.340
So that includes everyone.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.970
It does not separate anyone to say, “One
group should have a really great experience

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.150
and one can have a less great experience.”

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.430
It means all.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.351
It turns into something positive, and people
then get engaged and they go, “Yeah, it

00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:44.650
should be a great place to work for me too.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.650
Absolutely.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.880
For everybody here, so let’s talk about
how to do that.”

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.720
And you find the whole room starts to lean
forward.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.770
Rather than “the other topic”, people
can’t wait to get out of the room.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.250
And talking about the other topic for, you
know, I heard that conversation for about

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.850
40 years.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.070
It hasn’t gotten us very far at all.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.240
What we should want is for everybody to be
like it is at the top of an organization.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.250
Excited about coming to work and doing something
that you really, really care about.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.511
You’re paying for it.

00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.420
It doesn’t cost you any more money, so you’re
just getting more for what you’re paying

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.420
for.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.140
Most businesspeople get that.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.360
They get it and they go okay, what’s getting
in the way?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.270
And we have the analytics to help them know
what’s getting in the way.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.510
It’s the way they’re being spoken to gets
in the way.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.920
It’s if you’re listening to them or not,
you know.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.750
Are you sincerely caring about what they’re
saying and using it to innovate and to make

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.880
business decisions?

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.510
We asked, “Does management involve you in
their decision making?

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.910
Do you feel informed about how management
makes decisions?”

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.630
The reason we ask these is so we can understand
what a person is experiencing, and we know

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.460
a certain type of experience that makes people
say, “I love it here,” because we asked

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:09.490
“Do you plan to work here for a long long
time?” and people will say yes.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.650
And you can predict it based on whether people
are listening to them, whether people are

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.600
welcoming them, whether people are rewarding
them, whether people are recognizing them,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.860
whether people address them personally rather
than an employee in mass communications.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.050
You can actually predict these two things,
and then you see it in the result of the company

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:36.539
in terms of the employee experience the number
is very high, and we’ve proven that the

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:41.060
revenue growth of the company, we have a hunch
it’s going to be higher than others, and

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.659
we look at the data and, in fact, that is
true.
