00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.180
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.380
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: If you search
David Baldacci, like I did,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.460
in the Library of Congress's
online catalog, you get 89 results.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.390
Not only are his novels in
the library's collections,

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.440
but movies inspired by his novels
are also included as well as books

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.080
that he contributed to
and versions of his books

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.020
in languages other than English.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.010
Anybody want to guess how many
different languages his books have

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.750
been translated into?

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.060
&gt;&gt; Forty-five.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.960
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter:
Hey, who said that?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.900 position:56%
Forty-five is right, that's awesome.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.200
Are you related?

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.500
[laughter].

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.020 position:56%
So he's a prolific writer, but David
is also a devoted philanthropist

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.180
and his greatest efforts
are dedicated

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.260
to his family's Wish
You Well Foundation.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.400
Established by David
and his wife Michelle,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.070
the Wish You Well Foundation
supports family

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.990
and adult literacy
in the United States.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.960
Today, David is here to talk with
us about "The Width of the World,"

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.370
book three in his instant
best-selling Vega Jane series.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.510 position:56%
Please join me in welcoming
best-selling author, David Baldacci.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:30.410
[ Applause ]

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.970
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Hey, everybody.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.210
Are we having a great
time at the festival?

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [applause].

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.430
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: I know.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.020
Somebody asked me, what's the
great thing about book festivals?

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.530
And I said the great thing
about book festivals is

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.790 position:56%
that it brings people together who
may not have read a book for a while

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.120
or people who love books
and read lots of them

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.730
and everybody in between.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.870
The worst thing about
book festivals --

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.590
they're too rare, there aren't
enough of them, I don't think.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.570
And I always talk about this
and make this point when I come

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.170
to a book festival, if you have
a book festival in your town,

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.650
never take it for granted.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.990
Because once you start taking
it for granted, it will go away

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.310
and you won't have it anymore
because people won't come

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.310
and it'll just sort of slide away.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.780
I've seen it happen
to other festivals.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.660
This is the National Book
Festival, we have got this.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.620 position:56%
We're going to come every year and
it's going to get bigger and better.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.880
[applause].

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.580
I've written lots of books,
mostly adult stuff, thrillers,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.220
that my own kids couldn't read
until they were a little bit older.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.950
I remember the first time
my daughter, who's now grown

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.370
and moved on, read one of my books.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.440
Her mom said it was okay
to read one of my thrillers

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.420
and it was Split Second in
the King and Maxwell Series,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.790
sort of a pretty intense book
and my wife and I came home

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.010
from dinner one night and every
light in the house was on.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.310
[laughter].

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.610
Her bedroom door was locked.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.250
I think she had the bureau
shoved against the door.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.550
We have two big dogs.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.140
Both of them were in bed with
her -- once we get the door open.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.080
And she told her mom later,
she goes, Mom, I get it.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.490
I understand why Dad's so popular.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.570
He's really good but
he's also like a freak.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.870
[laughter].

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.420
When she was in kindergarten,
you know, you'd have Parents Come

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.090 position:56%
to School Day and, you know, what
do your mom and dad do for a living?

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.940
My daughter never invited me.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.700
And I asked her that, you
know, she got older and I said,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.000
why didn't you invite me?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.300
And she goes, well, what
are you going to do, Dad?

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.450
Come in and like write in a book?

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.830
You know? Sign your name?

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.130
How exciting is that?

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.400
We've got cops, we've
got firemen, you know?

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.650
I didn't want to be
embarrassed, I'm sorry.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.060
I am a writer today because
I was a reader as a kid.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.660
I was a library rat, you know?

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.230
Instead of a gym rat,
I was a library rat.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.070 position:56%
And I would go to my school library,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.060
I would go to the county
public library in Richmond,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.600
Virginia every weekend
with my brother and sister.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.140
And I had secret deals
with the librarians.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.360
They'd let me check out more
books than they were supposed

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.450
to let me check out because I
knew I would read all of them

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.150
and come back for more
the next week.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.990
And I saw the world
through books, you know?

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.150
I never really left Richmond as a
kid, didn't have the opportunity,

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.060 position:56%
but I saw a much broader spectrum
of life -- an existence perspective,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.340
opinion, ideas and
wisdom and knowledge

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.640
from the books that I would open.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.240 position:56%
I went into the author's room, where
there's sort of a break room for all

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.740
of the authors here today, and
it was such a wonderful thing

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.900
because there were so many
young authors in there.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.960
I mean, that's the new
voices of the future,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.530
that's the fresh blood
of an industry.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.040
They're going to write books that,
today, do not exist and won't exist

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.340
until they sit down and
create them and that's

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.690
such a wonderful, wonderful thing.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.350
I've been doing this
a long time now.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.040
Twenty years ago, I was
the new kid on the block.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.450
I think that's a band -- or used
to be anyway -- showing my age.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.450
But it really all began for me as
a writer because I was a reader.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.130 position:56%
Now, I was one of those kids growing
up who never shut up, you know?

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.340
That's why I went on later
to become a trial lawyer --

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.000
very similar skill
set there, you know --

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.770
never shutting up,
being a trial lawyer.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.680
So and I would always tell
these tall tales, you know,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.350
usually to get myself out
of trouble with parents,

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.470
assorted school officials,
people like that.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.380 position:56%
And one day my mom came to me and
she said, I bought you this journal.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.320
I went to the bookstore,
I bought you this journal,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.620
it's a blank page journal.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.920
Why don't you write down some

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.530
of the stuff you've been
talking about all these years?

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.830
And I said, okay.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.890
So I put my pen to paper and
it was like this epiphany,

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.340
it was like this ah-ha moment.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.010
Oh my gosh, I can take what's
up here and I can put it

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.480
down on this and, eventually,
other people can read it,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.080
just like the books that I love
to read, that I'm enthralled by.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.050
I can have that same sort
of effect over other people.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.440
And from that moment on -- I
was eight or nine years old --

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.020
I really never looked
back from that.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.320
I just kept writing.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.160
And years later, I went back to
my mom and I said, my God, Mom.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.460
Thank you.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.050
What a gift you gave me that day.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.100
And my mom, you know, looked
at me and said, honey,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.810
I'm so glad it's worked out
for you but, quite frankly,

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.200
I just wanted to shut you up.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.070
[laughter].

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.160
You know, I'm your mom, I love you.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.960
I will always love you.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.260
But even moms need a little
peace and quiet, you know?

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.300
So that journal did it for her.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.680
Now when I tour around, I get a lot
of questions from people, usually,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.630
you know, the question I
get more than any other is,

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.070 position:56%
what is it like to be this number
one worldwide best-selling novelist?

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.120 position:56%
You know, I know the way they ask
the question they want some sort of,

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.070
you know, Entertainment Weekly
kind of answer, you know?

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.450
Yes, I have a life just
like the Kardashians do.

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.060
My life is nothing
like the Kardashians.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.710
You know, I go to these
cool events sometimes.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.760
I come home and I start
telling my wife about them

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.060
and she's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.770
It's trash night, get on it.

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.070
[laughter].

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:01.910 position:56%
People will always ask me, you know,
in every book you've ever written,

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.510
there are strong, independent
women, why is that?

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.430
Well, I was raised by one, I'm
married to one, and we raised one

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.520
and that's all I've ever
known in my whole life.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.960
I don't write about damsels
in distress for one reason --

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.090
I've never met any, you know?

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.390
Just never have.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.360
A lot of my guy friends need
an awful lot of help, you know?

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.010
Which we will freely
admit, you know?

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.380
But not so much the women.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.600
But in answer to that question,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.080
what is it like to be a
best-selling novelist?

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.390
I tell a story about my
kids when they were little,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.690
my kids are both grown now.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.460
But my daughter was five or
six, I took her to a bookstore

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.320
for the first time for a
book signing I was doing.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.200
We walked into the store and she,
you know, all the people were there

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.070
and the lady who ran the store
came over and introduced herself

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:52.600
and asked my daughter, do you know
why all these people are here?

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.110
And my daughter said,
yes, I do know.

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.010
And she goes, why are they here?

00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:59.270 position:56%
They want my dad to sign their book.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.050
And why do they want your
dad to sign their book?

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:05.660
Because my dad has the
nicest handwriting.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.180
[laughter].

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.830
She's been out of college
a few years now,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.880
I think she still believes
that, actually.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.700
When my son was maybe three,
I took him to a bookstore

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.990
for the first time -- not
for an event, I just took him

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.750
to a bookstore so, you
know, to buy some books.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.490
And my son has always been kind of
like my entrepreneur guy, you know?

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.470
Always looking, what's the
next thing, the next big thing?

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.110
So we walked into the bookstore
and he saw all of the books and all

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.310
of the people reading and his eyes
got huge and, all of a sudden,

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.080
my kid started running across the
bookstore at the top of his speed,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.430
screaming at the top of his lungs,

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:43.450
my daddy will sign any book
you've got for two dollars.

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:44.750
[laughter].

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:53.540
So that's what it's like to
be a best-selling novelist.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.950
My handwriting is beautiful

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.460
and I charge two dollars
to sign your book.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.180
Because I love this
festival so much,

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.320
I have waived my book
signing fee today

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.870
and we'll sign your
book free of charge.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.220
Now it's one thing to be a
writer, want to be a writer,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.240
and another thing actually being
a writer who can support yourself.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.810
So back then, I was
writing short stories.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.870
Short stories are great
for young, aspiring writers

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:22.070
because they're short and
you can finish one and sort

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.410
of feel good about yourself.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.010 position:56%
So I did that for about 15 years
and I had to earn a living so I went

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.010
on to college and went on to law
school at UVA in Charlottesville

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.640
and then spent time
practicing law in DC in the city

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:39.610
for about 10 years -- but writing
the whole time in my off hours,

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.990
you know, middle of the
night, early in the morning,

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:43.110
wherever I could find some time.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:46.090
And people ask, you know, was
it a hard transition moving

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.500
from being a lawyer to being
a writer, a fiction writer?

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.800
And I said, no, you know,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.380
being a lawyer actually is a great
background for writing fiction.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.680
[laughter].

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.340
Because, as a lawyer, you know,
it was like the more I made up,

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.050
the more I won, which
is awesome, you know?

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.360
So it's actually a way
to write effectively

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.440
and to argue persuasively.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:11.320
When you're a lawyer, you
have the same set of facts.

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.630
It's called a trial record,
so it's not like you can --

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:15.590
you're entitled to your own opinion

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.930
but not your own facts,
in other words.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.010
That doesn't seem to be the
case these days, actually.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.970
But I'm not going to
talk about that.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.500
But you write in a way that's
persuasive before a judge or a jury

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.470
and that's telling a story.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.490
So the transition actually
wasn't all that difficult going

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:35.300
from being a lawyer
to being a writer.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.990
I wrote short stories, screenplays,
eventually moved on to novels.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.580
I saw a statistic the other
day that was astounding to me,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:48.570
that 70% of Americans don't
really enjoy their work --

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.390
and so almost three-quarters
the population.

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.730
And the reason, you
know, I hate that is

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.080
because we spend so
much time at work.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.970
But people find their
joy and interest

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.080
in positive things outside of work.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.170
It could be, you know, a sport
that you like, friends, family,

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:09.010
your church, whatever, we find,
you know, lots of ways to be happy.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.420
But we do spend a lot
of time working

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.550
and we should be happy doing that.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.790
And I tell people, you know,
it sounds like a cliche

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.720
to follow your dream but it's
actually maybe more complicated

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.020
than that.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.390
You have to work hard at
whatever you want to do

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.980
but it's worthwhile
taking some time early on,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.750
trying to decide what it is
really that interests you.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.720
And if you take months,
weeks, years,

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.810 position:56%
decades to actually finally find out
what it is and because you're going

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.240
to be sending your whole life doing
it, which is a really, really,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.790
really long time, it's
worthwhile taking the time to try

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.320
to figure out, what
would bring me joy.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.920
Because look, if you love what
you do -- another cliche --

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.290
you never work a day in your life.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:51.000
Writing is hard.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.170
Any creative endeavor is hard
because you're creating something

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.910
that did not exist
before you thought of it.

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:00.570
It's not like really any other job.

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.750 position:56%
You know, you get good at other jobs
by sort of doing the same thing over

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:05.890
and over again and working
out all of the bugs,

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:07.190
working out all of the kinks.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.490
I mean, I wouldn't -- I fly a lot.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.200
I wouldn't want to be on
a plane when the pilot

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.500
that day says, you know what?

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.620
I've never tried this before,
but today I'm going to go for it.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:18.390
Or a surgeon on an
operating table --

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.190
you know, I've done this procedure
for 30 years with my right hand,

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.210
let's see what it feels
like with my left.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.480
But as a writer, every
day is different.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.820
There is no formula.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.040
There is no template for
what you're supposed to do.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.980
You just sit down and
try to think of something

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.790
that might be interesting to you.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:42.630
But if you find a passion in
life, particularly with your work,

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:47.120
treat it as the special moment that
it is because, all of a sudden,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.520
you have this eureka moment of,
this is how I can spend my life.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.400 position:56%
Passion rarely comes around in life,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.370
particularly with what
you do for a living.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:13:00.630
So don't let it pass by -- seize
it, you know, and use it and move

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.050
on with your life and
do that sort of thing.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.790
You don't want to look back 50 or
60 years from now and wondering,

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.730
you know, maybe I should've decided
and gone down that other path.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:13.940
It's worthwhile, I think,
to think about these things.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.490
My first novel was Absolute Power.

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.040
It was about the president,
a burglar, a cover-up,

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.940
the truth coming out
and people said, well,

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.710
you were an overnight success.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:30.640
And I said, yes, I was, it only
took me 6000 nights to get there.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.170
I just wanted to tell a good story.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.530
I had no idea that this book
was going to be successful.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:38.580
I'd had very little success with my
short stories and my screenplays,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:42.180
but I've always thought that
if you write with passion,

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.890
that passion will kiss the
words that you're writing about

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.710
and will lift it up out of the
sludge piles that are sitting

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.290
on editors' desks in New York City.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:52.780
You don't want to write
a trend book.

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.290
A trend book is like what's hot,
what's really hot out there.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:14:01.190
I can guarantee you, you know,
when Jurassic Park first came out,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:06.100
every script in every book
pitched to anybody had dinosaurs.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.000
I don't care if it was a romantic
comedy, there was gonna be a,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.700
you know, a Tyrannosaurus
rex right in the middle

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.010
of this little tryst going on.

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.390
Or when the Da Vinci Code
came out, everybody wanted

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:20.770 position:56%
to write the code book because that
was hot, or the Harry Potter Series,

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.160
everybody wanted to do wizards
and witches and stuff like that.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.430
But if you're not interested in
actually that subject matter,

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.730
guess what's going to happen?

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.260
You're going to run out of gas.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:31.260
It could be a quarter of the way
through, half the way through,

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.560
and the book's not
going to be that good

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.290
because you weren't really
interested in writing it anyway.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.150
You just thought it might sell and
you could sell the movie rights

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.650
and then you could, you
know, fax in your resignation

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.580
from the job you didn't like --

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.490
not a really great
motivation to write a book.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.290
The old adage is, "write
what you know."

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.970
I would modify that
a little bit to say,

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.170
"write what you would
like to know about."

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.750
Then you sort of immerse
yourself in a world

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:58.460
that you really didn't know
before but have been fascinated

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:00.860
by for a long time and
guess what happens?

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:02.240
You spend a lot of
time thinking about it.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.420
You spend a lot of time working
on it and, all of a sudden,

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.260
the sentences become better,
the paragraphs become better,

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:08.940
the chapters become
more enthralling,

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.240
the story becomes more powerful.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.300
It really does work that way.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.650
It's almost like you're putting
the right fuel inside your car.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:20.350
Otherwise, if it's just
tracing a trend, you're putting

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.670
in stuff that's just not
going to ignite into anything.

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:28.060
Now with the Vega Jane
series, I love fantasy.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.090
How many people love
reading fantasy?

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.260
Yeah, it's awesome stuff.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.540
There's a lot of fantasy
going on in DC right now.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:37.730
[laughter].

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:40.130
But I will not speak of that.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:44.480
But I hear people say it
a lot, so it must be true.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.040
So about, I guess, seven
or eight years ago, my --

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.480
like my mother did years before,

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.890
my wife gave me a blank
page book for Christmas.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:59.240
Do not ever give a writer a
blank paper on a major holiday

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.040
because I immediately ran away

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.530
to my little cubbyhole
and started writing.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.320
And I wrote this name down on
the first page -- Vega Jane.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.520
I have no idea where
the name came from,

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:09.190
it just sounded really
great and it was in my mind.

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:13.570
And I wanted to write a
fantasy about Vega Jane and,

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.920
five years later, it was done.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.760
And it took me about
four-and-a-quarter years

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.210
to understand what I wanted to
write about with this person,

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.730
what the story was
going to even be about.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.070
But after four-and-a-quarter
years of really thinking about it,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.350
obsessing about it, then I
wrote the entire first book

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.490
in about seven or eight months.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.590
And nobody knew I was writing it --
none of my friends, my publisher,

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:40.820
my agent -- no one,
other than my wife.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.190
She read it and really enjoyed
it and she is a tough critic.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.090
I know she's here somewhere.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:49.470
You know, I won't ask her to stand
up but I can sense your presence.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:54.650
And when we sent the
book out to publishers,

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.120
I was adamant about this point.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.060
I sent the book out under
a pseudonym, a fake name,

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.030
because I wanted the book to
be accepted on its merits not

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:05.340
because my name was attached to it.

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:09.320
So I used the name Janus Pope --
Janus is the Roman two-faced god.

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.050
I was being very deceitful.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.550
And Pope was just that
Catholic thing, you know?

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.650
You never know where names
are going to come from.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.880
So when Scholastic ended up buying
the first book in the series,

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:23.420
The Finisher, the way
the book is written --

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.660
the terms, colloquialisms
and all that --

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:27.960
they thought I was from England.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.590
So when I went to Scholastic in
New York and introduced myself

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.590
as the author of The Finisher,
they were quite shocked, you know?

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.720
Clifford, you know, the Big
Red Dog, he like fainted.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.170
[laughter].

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.690
He's in lobby up there.

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:45.990
It's like [thud].

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.780
For me, writing that book
was an enormous challenge.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.940
I'd never written that genre
before but it's great in life,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:56.260
no matter what you do, to
get out of your comfort zone,

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.080
you know, to scare yourself.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.900
People say, you know, what
really drives you as a writer?

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.380
And I say fear.

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.340
Fear drives me as a
writer, you know?

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.990
Can I tell another
good story or not?

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.550
You know, you have this recurring
nightmare that people are going

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.240
to wake up one day
and realize, you know,

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.970
you have no idea what
you're doing, you know?

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.920
You ever have that recurring
dream when you're in school

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.600
and you're back in school and
you showed up naked for a test?

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.820
Or you haven't been to class
all year and now you have

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.210
to take the exam and
you know nothing

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.330
of what's on there, you know?

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.910
Psychologically, you know,
there's a lot of stuff that goes

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.330
into the interpretive dreams and
they show anxiety in your life,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:38.580
loss in your life, some type of
nervous situation you're addressing

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.610
so you dream about it in that
symbolic way and that's why you --

00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:46.340
we all share those dreams because
we share those types of anxieties.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.690
But for me to get out
of my comfort zone

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.250
and write this book was
really important as a writer.

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:53.000
I think it made me a
better thriller writer

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.230
for having written
this fantasy series.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.690
So the book came out,
hit number one and,

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.030
you know, was very well-received.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.560
I used my name when
the book came out --

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.170
Scholastic insisted upon that -- I
think it probably did help sales.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.060 position:56%
But Vega Jane is the lead character.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.530
She's a young girl and, as
I just mentioned before,

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.530
she's a very strong,
independent female.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.210
And she lives in a little village
called Wormwood in the middle

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.290
of nowhere and you have no idea
in what time period this is set.

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:25.790
And in Wormwood, there's
this place called the Quag

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.210 position:56%
and there's nothing beyond the Quag.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.390
There's no reason to leave
Wormwood and the Quag is filled

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.070
with dangerous beasts so you stay
in Wormwood, the little village,

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:35.460
and you'll be fine, perfectly safe.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.860
You don't have to take a chance or
a risk, which is sort of symbolic

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.600
of what I was trying to say about
getting out of your comfort zone.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.570
It's almost like in the
universe saying, you know,

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:48.720
we're the only planet out of 87
hundred thousand trillion planets

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.050
that might have life on it so
we should just stay where we are

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.270
because it will be safe here.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.640
Vega Jane realizes everything
she's been told in life is a lie --

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.100
everything -- about Wormwood,
the people that live there,

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.400
their history, everything.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.980
So she breaks out of Wormwood and
goes to the Quag, fights her way

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.300
through the Quag in the second
novel, The Keeper, and then we come

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:09.930
to The Width of the World.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.870
The Width of the World
title comes from one line

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.420
in the epic poem, Beowulf.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.220
I love just the alliterative,

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.370
how that rolls off the
tongue, The Width of the World.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:25.510
And it really talks about the
world as they knew it back then.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:29.310
This is the breadth and spectrum
of the world in this epic poem.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:34.030
And in this book, The Width of the
World, that came out in the spring,

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:35.730
she's in a brand-new world.

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.660
Unlike a lot of fantasies,
for every book that I wrote,

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.250
I had to create a brand-new world

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:43.080
because Vega kept escaping
from places.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.440
So The Finisher was Wormwood.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:47.210
The Keeper was the Quag.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:49.030
And now in, The Width
of the World, it was --

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.430
she had broken free from the Quag,

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.360
was now in this place
that looked more modern.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.660
It would have things that
we would recognize --

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.430
buildings and the clothing
people wore

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.050
and automobiles and
things like that.

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:01.020
And it seems like a safe place,

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.850
it seemed like the
people are very happy.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:08.690
But Vega Jane soon realizes
that people there are sort

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.860
of suffering the worst
form of enslavement

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.230
because they don't even know
they're actually enslaved.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:17.740
So there's no opportunity or
chance of any type of insurrection

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.070
because they just feel
so good about everything,

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.070
not even knowing the fact
that they're not free.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:32.380
Now I wrote this series as sort
of -- not for young readers,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.480
not for old readers, not
for in-between readers.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.620
I only know one way to
tell a story, you know?

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.430
I bring my A-game.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:41.970
And just because I was writing
for middle grade readers,

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:45.360
that was a category that sort of
the industry puts on this book,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.190
that meant nothing to me.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:51.700
All I know is that I was going
to be writing for myself but also

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:56.410
for really smart people out
there who probably read a lot

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:01.070 position:56%
of fantasy regardless of whether
they're 10 or 110 and were going to,

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.820
you know, judge this book
on how good the story was

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.280
and how good the writing was
and what it was really about.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.850
So when people say, is it easier
to write for young readers?

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:13.530
I said, it's not easy
to write for any reader.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:17.310
And so you really have
to bring you're A-game.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:21.780
And as plot, character,
action, twists and turns --

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:25.060
only really conscious choice
I made was maybe, you know,

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:27.120
word selection here and there.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.420
You know, certain words
that I might use

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.080
in an adult book I wouldn't
use in a book like this.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.520 position:56%
So I'm working on the fourth novel
here and we just got a title for it.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.220 position:56%
Scholastic said the legal department
said I can't reveal that title --

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.990
I hate lawyers, don't you?

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:43.690
I mean -- where do they
get off doing that?

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:46.650
I've got some stuff going on.

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:49.700
They're filming the Christmas
Train movie right now in Vancouver

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.940
that will be out over Thanksgiving
weekend on the Hallmark Channel

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.090
and they've been sending
me the dailies every day.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.910
Used to -- when you filmed the
old way on just regular film,

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:01.720
you'd have to wait like a
week to see the dailies.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.730
Now it's all on video so they
email me the video so I get

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.620 position:56%
to see all the dailies on my laptop.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:08.920
It looks really cool, you know?

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.850 position:56%
They're making Vancouver in August
look very Christmasy, which is nice.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:17.010
And I read an article
the other day that said,

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:20.780
the Hallmark Channel
ratings are through the roof.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.270
They have like tripled
since January.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:29.650 position:56%
And the reason being that, you
know, people just want to feel happy

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.450
about something and, you know, have
a good ending and just feel good

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:36.210
about themselves -- since January.

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:40.140
[laughter].

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.990
I thought about that a lot,
I can't build a connection.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.290
[laughter].

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.050
A and B -- it just.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:51.190
So I would say again,
any writers in this room?

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:55.060
Any aspiring writers in this room?

00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:59.930
You know, follow your dream, follow
your passion, follow, you know --

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.700
just sit down every day and
realize that what you're working

00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:06.810
on would not exist but for you.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.410
It's a very special feeling, a
very important responsibility but,

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.820
at the end of the day,
have fun doing it.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.020
Don't make it so serious that
you take all of the joy out of it

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:23.420
because joy, much like pain, can
result in a lot of great stories

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:27.090
that all of us in this room can
enjoy for a long, long time.

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.510
Thank you very much, and
I'll take some questions.

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:35.500
[ Applause ]

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:49.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I wanted to ask about the process
of getting a literary agent and how

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.030
that worked out for you, David.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.330
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci:
Getting a literary agent --

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:57.770
I knew I needed an agent
so my way of getting lists

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:00.510
of agents was a little unorthodox.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.030
I would go out to -- when I
had heard about a first novel

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:06.960
and hitting really big, I would
go to the bookstore and I'd look

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:12.650
in the acknowledgments and
they always thank their agent.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.930
You know? First, it's the
spouse and then it's the agent.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.490 position:56%
If it's the agent before the spouse,

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.570
I don't think that
marriage is going to last.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:22.930
But I got a list of agent that way

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.300
and I probably committed
all the cardinal sins

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.780
of what you're supposed
to do with a query letter

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.850
but I wrote a very short query
letter and I had seven agents

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:34.880
and I made copies of my
manuscript, complete manuscript,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.180
and I sent it up to seven different
agents, simultaneous submissions,

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.440
they all knew that other
agents were reading it.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.800
And the query letter said, you
know, my name is David Baldacci,

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.130
you have no idea who I am.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:45.640
I'm a lawyer in Washington, DC.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:50.930 position:56%
This book is about the president, a
mistress, a cover-up, and a burglar.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:54.260
And I can guarantee that, if you
read the first page, you won't stop

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.560
until you read the last page.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.860
Sincerely, me.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.420 position:56%
And I did that for a couple reasons.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.360
One, I felt, if I couldn't
be confident

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.450
about my material, how could they?

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:05.630
And secondly, I knew most
of them would read it just

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.260
to prove me wrong -- so they could
write back and say, you know what?

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.990
No. You actually suck.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.690
So I was hoping that one of
them would write back and say,

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.230
you know, this has some potential.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:20.290
Why don't you write something
else, let me see how it goes.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.690
What happened instead was that
all seven agent contacted me back,

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:25.620
all seven wanted to be my agent --

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:29.460
which, trust me, after 15 years of
like no success was astonishing.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:31.950
So I went up to New York
and interviewed all of them

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.780
and picked the agent
that I have still today.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.770
So it was an unorthodox way to
do it but I think, you know,

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:39.890
if you're looking for an
agent, it's an important thing.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:41.620
It's not just an agent
trying to make you money,

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:46.280
it's a person who can be a counsel
to you, who can be a mentor to you,

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.750
who can be an advocate for you
and advise you over your career.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:53.230
And the one thing my agent told
me, he said, look, this book,

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.910 position:56%
Absolute Power, I can sell it,
probably sell it for a lot of money.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:00.090
If this is the only book
you have inside of you,

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.630
I have no interest
in representing you.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:05.020
I don't represent writers,
I represent careers.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:07.490
So that's really what
cemented it for me.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:08.970
He was the only one
that ever told me that.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:11.580
And that's why he's
probably my agent still for,

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.490
you know, the last 23 years.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.800
&gt;&gt; Hi. So I was wondering,
I'm sure as a writer you have

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.130
so many ideas swirling around
in your head constantly.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:27.660
And I was wondering how you
decide which ones you want

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.270
to turn into an actual book?

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.570
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Great question.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.550
You know, with all the
ideas swirling in your head,

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.800 position:56%
how do you pick the ones you're
actually going to sit down to write?

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.680
Again, there's no rhyme or reason.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.980
It really just speaks
to the interest level.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.890
Sometimes I've read an article that
piqued my interest in something,

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:47.900
then I went out and did some
research, talked to some people,

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.280
thought about it, and then decided
ultimately I didn't want to do it

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:55.090
because I just wasn't
jazzed enough about it.

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.960
If it's a recurring character,
it's sometimes, like, well,

00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.940
I've got this character
developed, like an Amos Decker

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.910
with perfect recall, what
would be a great story for him

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.040
that not only would be
an entertaining story

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:07.980
as a stand-alone novel,
but how can I deepen

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.350
and enrich his character even more.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:15.000
It's got to grab your
interest as the writer.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.240
You may be working on this thing
for years, so you don't want to run

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.850
out of gas halfway through.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.320
So it's got to be something that
you're really interested in.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:25.210
Not just interested in, but
you're willing to say, okay,

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:29.060
I'm going to spend the next few
months finding out more about this.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.360
Talking to people.

00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:31.800
Going to some of these places.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.780
And I have the energy and
interest level to do that.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.530
And if you carry it
through that far,

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.760
then I think that your decision
is probably going to be,

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.520
I've got this one, I'm going
to go with it the whole way.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.910
But don't be afraid to
just also cut and say no,

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.520
I don't have the fire for it.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.030
And what you don't want to do
is write 200 pages and then,

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.250
all of a sudden, I'm done.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:57.700
It's happened to me.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.590
It's happened to every writer.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.350
You make those mistakes sometimes.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.330
But really is almost
a gut sort of thing.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:07.190
Am I interested enough in this to
be friends with it for two years.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.790
It's like a relationship.

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:13.300
Are you going to be
there for it or not.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:17.960
&gt;&gt; Hi. So you said that you
have a background as a lawyer.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.620
I wanted to ask -- you said
specifically being a lawyer is a

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:23.040
great background for
being an author.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.700
I wanted to ask if there are like
specific things in your books

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:31.070 position:56%
that are inspired by your experience
as a lawyer or like techniques

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.060
that come from being a lawyer that
crossover into being an author?

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:38.430
And is it as fun and exciting being
a lawyer as it is being an author?

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Absolutely, yeah.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.880
The last question first.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.820
It's a lot more exciting
being a writer than a lawyer.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.130
That's just me.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.620
I appreciated practicing
law for as long as I did.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:50.820
It made me be a better
person, a better writer,

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.490
a better business person.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:55.550
My publisher, my old publisher,
used to lament the fact, he goes,

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.880
you're the only one of my writers

00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.950
who actually reads the damn
contracts, understands them,

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.490
and have changed them, you
know, to benefit writers more.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.790
Which I have done that.

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:09.920
There was a book I wrote
called The Simple Truth.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:15.360
And that was about a soldier who
had unwittingly been exposed part

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.200
of an experiment to build a super
soldier through chemical process.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.190
Didn't know that he'd even been
part of this, it was involuntary.

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:26.280
And during one of these episodes,
he'd actually killed someone.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:31.970
And he'd been imprisoned for life
for it because no one told anybody

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:33.300
that that's actually what happened.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.970
And the military -- which, you
know, nothing against the military.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:41.900 position:56%
My dad was in the military, and I've
written a lot about the military.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.600
But the military sometimes
makes mistakes.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.130
And this was based on an actual
program that actually they had,

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:49.430
the Super Soldier Program,
using PCP to try

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:52.900
to make soldiers super
during the Vietnam War.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:58.060
And the Army sent him a
letter when he was in prison

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.380
like 20 years later apologizing.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:03.080
Oops, you know, we
kind of messed up.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.880
And that was the first he knew
about it, and the guy went crazy

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.290
and escaped from prison and, you
know, he didn't know what to do.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:11.910
And I had represented,
my firm had represented,

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:16.020
a soldier in circumstances
similar to that.

00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.430
And after having read, you know,
on the subject, that was something

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.300
that really piqued my
interest and I wanted to do it.

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.870
As far as sort of attributes
of lawyers and writers,

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.800
we share a lot of commonality.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:30.540
As a lawyer I would work on
big projects, either trials

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:33.380
or acquisitions, corporate
deals, for years.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.980
So I was not daunted by the fact

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.520
that it might take me
years to write a book.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.330
That's all I was used
to as a lawyer,

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.630
working on projects for years.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.970
So every day -- you
pace yourself every day.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.030
You know, you're not to
get it all done in one day.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.650
And for a lot of aspiring writers,
you get, oh my god, you know,

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.560
it's been two months, I
don't have the book done yet

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:53.050
and don't have the movie
sold, and you get frustrated

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.610
and impatient and you quit.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:56.910
Pace yourself.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:00.250
It's not going to be done in a
day or a month or even a year.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.400
And it's about putting
little pieces together.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.360
You know, with a trial,
it's a big puzzle

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.980
and you're putting pieces together.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.230
The sorts of books that I
write, thrillers and mysteries,

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.360
it's the same sort of
thing, it is a puzzle

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.260 position:56%
and I'm putting every piece together
and I have to fit them perfectly.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:16.760
Because if one doesn't
fit perfectly,

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.260
the whole puzzle falls
apart, and you're going

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.110
to go like, what was that about.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:23.080
You know, that makes no
sense at all, you know.

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.690
So for me, you know, part of
it was cases that I worked on,

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.250
cases that I knew about,
but also just the attributes

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.870
of what I did every day as
a lawyer made the transition

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:34.020
to being a full-time writer easier.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:37.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.290
&gt;&gt; Hi. I first heard you speak when
you came six or seven years ago.

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:41.690
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Did
I tell the same stories?

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:42.990
I'm sorry if I did.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.290
&gt;&gt; No, it's a different story.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:46.670
At the Carlisle, Pennsylvania,
Celebrate the Book Festival.

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:47.970
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:49.270
&gt;&gt; Thank you for that.

00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:51.970
That started me volunteering
with the library more and more.

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:55.620 position:56%
And the question I have, with your
Vega Jane series, which is different

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.570
from your other books --
it's very interesting.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.940
My daughter is very upset
that I'm reading her books.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.890
The lexicon that you use in that,
the made-up words, how do you know

00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:09.650
when too much is too much
and too little is too little

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:11.700
and enough is just enough?

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:13.290
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci:
That's a great question.

00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:17.200
That can speak to the
whole writing a book.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:18.860
What is too much, what
is too little.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:22.830
You have to immerse
yourself in that world.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.240
And you have to look
at both as a writer

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.110
and as a potential
reader of the book too.

00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:28.590
I'm a big reader.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.070
Lots of writers read voraciously.

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:35.930
So you sort of have to be the
creator and also the consumer.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:41.490
And how would I perceive that
chapter, that set of words,

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.860
that character development,
is it too much, too little.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.710
If I were a reader of this book
and somebody else had written it,

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.930
would I be satisfied with it.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:52.450
So for me, I've been
doing this a long time.

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:56.850
And one thing you do learn
over time is that less is best.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:59.480
And I'm sort of like
Hitchcock, I leave something

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.160
to the imagination, you know.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.460
I don't want to write
everything out in

00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:06.540
such great detail you have nothing
else to think about as the reader.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.050
When you go to see the movie, you
know, you see a two-hour version

00:34:09.050 --> 00:34:12.270
of what a director thinks the story
should be, and you have your soda

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.740
and your big popcorn and
all that, and you go away.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.300
You don't really contribute
to the process.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.960
As a reader, you contribute
to the process.

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.530
A book is never finished really
until a reader finishes it for him

00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.530
or herself, then it's
finished for them.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.640
And they can come away with a
complete different interpretation.

00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.010
We were talking about
this out in the hall.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.260
A completely different
interpretation

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:32.560
of what the writer
actually intended.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.050
So for the language, it was really,
you know 20 years of having --

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:38.080
or 30 years of having done this,

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.430
of knowing that you've
got to pull back.

00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:44.140
You know, too much is always
worse than too little.

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:48.880
And if you have too many
words, it dilutes the power

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.620
of what you're trying to do.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:52.140
So for me, I always pull back.

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:53.650
I also pull back with the research.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:55.210
I know that 90% of the researcher

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.720
that I use is never going
to end up in the book.

00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:59.020
I'm not writing a treatise.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.330
I'm not writing, you know, a
nonfiction work or textbook.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:03.640
I'm writing a novel.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:07.650
So you can integrate -- you know, I
might have done three months' worth

00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:10.390
of research for a book
for a sentence here,

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:14.190 position:56%
a little bit of a paragraph over
here, a line of dialogue over there.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.410
You never want to turn you
research into a flipbook

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:17.730
where you just you have no idea

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:19.230
where to put all this
research you're so proud of,

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.530
but you don't want to leave it out.

00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:22.080
And you're just like [makes
sound] and you slap it

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.380
in the middle of the book.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.680
I called it a flipbook,
because you're the reader

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.220
and you're reading it like,
oh my god, what is this?

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.130
And you're like flip,
flip, flip, flip, flip.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:32.210
And you get past all the crappy
research that he just stuck there

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:33.510
and you get back to the story.

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:37.180
So for me, take the
foot off the gas.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:42.400
One more question.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.440
&gt;&gt; Hi. I would like to ask
what techniques do you use

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.730
to develop language,
vocabulary, dialogue,

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.590
and terminology in
speculative fiction?

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:54.360
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: What
kind of what I use?

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.810
&gt;&gt; Language, dialogue.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:57.970
&gt;&gt; David Baldacci: Oh, okay.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:02.510
It depends on locality, what
part of the world or the country

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:06.620
that I'm in, what sort of
people that I'm talking about.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.550
And if you look at a book
like Wishing You Well,

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.590
it was set in the top of a mountain
in 1940 in Southwest Virginia.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:19.430
I wasn't alive in 1940, but I know
that part of the country really,

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:22.420
really well and the people who
live there really, really well.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.720
I know how they speak.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.020
I know how they act.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.210
I know how they would
respond to certain things.

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.670 position:56%
And that's why it's really important
when you're writing a book,

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.350
you can't sit behind your
desk and Wikipedia everything.

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:34.940
Anybody can do that.

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.180
You got to get out and go to
the places, talk to people.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:42.080
Being a great writer equates
to being a great listener.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.590
And listening is a
lost art these days.

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.810
I know I'm up here
speaking to all of you.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.620
I would much prefer to
be in the back watching

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:51.630
and listening to all of you.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:55.140 position:56%
Because I think being a great
storyteller means that you just have

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.390
to be -- have this insatiable
desire to know things.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.030
You want to know things
and more things.

00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:01.660
You want to know what
makes people tick.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.970
So really it's just experience.

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.970
Every writer writes some
stuff based on experience.

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:08.550
But at the same time,
you have to go out --

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.050
if you want to write about a world,
you have to go out and experience

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:15.770
that world as best as you can
and talk and sit and listen

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:19.510
and eavesdrop and overhear the
sorts of people that you're going

00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:21.490
to be writing about,
to make it authentic,

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.800
make it plausible,
and make it realistic.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.380
Because otherwise, you're just
typing instead of writing.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:28.710
Thank you very much.

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:30.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:37.900
[ Applause ]

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.550

of the Library of Congress.
