on this earth if you breathe this air
then you're an environmentalist and so I

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570
then you're an environmentalist and so I
 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.690
then you're an environmentalist and so I
come from that tactic in that that

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700
come from that tactic in that that
 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.179
come from that tactic in that that
school of thought where everything that

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189
school of thought where everything that

you do has is connected to the
environment in some capacity so one of

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090
environment in some capacity so one of
 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.549
environment in some capacity so one of
the trainings that I like to do the most

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559
the trainings that I like to do the most
 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.510
the trainings that I like to do the most
is that i will ask people what they're

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520
is that i will ask people what they're
 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.640
is that i will ask people what they're
interested in already and then give them

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650
interested in already and then give them
 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.400
interested in already and then give them
case studies directly connected to what

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410
case studies directly connected to what
 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.260
case studies directly connected to what
they're interested in and show how

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270
they're interested in and show how
 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.210
they're interested in and show how
environmental justice impacts that

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220
environmental justice impacts that
 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.790
environmental justice impacts that
specific situation and most the time

specific situation and most the time
 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.830
specific situation and most the time
unfortunately i can use real life

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840
unfortunately i can use real life
 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.250
unfortunately i can use real life
situations so for instance it might say

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260
situations so for instance it might say
 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.620
situations so for instance it might say
like what does we you know you might be

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630
like what does we you know you might be
 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.109
like what does we you know you might be
interested in gentrification that's your

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119
interested in gentrification that's your
 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.789
interested in gentrification that's your
issue that you're important in so i'm

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799
issue that you're important in so i'm
 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.410
issue that you're important in so i'm
going to give you a case study directly

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420
going to give you a case study directly
 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.940
going to give you a case study directly
connecting gentrification to

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950
connecting gentrification to
 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.920
connecting gentrification to
environmental justice and urban sprawl

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930
environmental justice and urban sprawl
 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.879
environmental justice and urban sprawl
and acts access to resources like

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:14.889
and acts access to resources like
 

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:16.889
and acts access to resources like
transportation and jobs because those

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899
transportation and jobs because those
 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.599
transportation and jobs because those
are environmental justice issues the

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:18.609
are environmental justice issues the
 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:21.499
are environmental justice issues the
ability to get from point A to point B

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
ability to get from point A to point B
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.849
ability to get from point A to point B
in your environment that's an

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859
in your environment that's an
 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.709
in your environment that's an
environmental justice issue or where

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719
environmental justice issue or where
 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.629
environmental justice issue or where
you're placing people when you deal with

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:27.639
you're placing people when you deal with
 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:30.389
you're placing people when you deal with
gentrification oftentimes people go from

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399
gentrification oftentimes people go from
 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.639
gentrification oftentimes people go from
one environmental justice hazard in a

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649
one environmental justice hazard in a
 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.649
one environmental justice hazard in a
city to another environmental justice

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659
city to another environmental justice
 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:37.410
city to another environmental justice
hazard where it's a suburban area that

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420
hazard where it's a suburban area that
 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.249
hazard where it's a suburban area that
was built for new homeowners or

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259
was built for new homeowners or
 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.719
was built for new homeowners or
low-income residents and it's built on

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729
low-income residents and it's built on
 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.969
low-income residents and it's built on
top of a landfill or on top of another

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979
top of a landfill or on top of another
 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.919
top of a landfill or on top of another
environmental hazard so that happens a

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929
environmental hazard so that happens a
 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.349
environmental hazard so that happens a
lot and we just try and connect it

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359
lot and we just try and connect it
 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.629
lot and we just try and connect it
directly to what they're interested in

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:51.639
directly to what they're interested in
 

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:53.249
directly to what they're interested in
it doesn't even have to be a cause it

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259
it doesn't even have to be a cause it
 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.649
it doesn't even have to be a cause it
can just be like you like riding around

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659

in your car bumping your music so let me
 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.999
in your car bumping your music so let me
connect this to the environment and when

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009
connect this to the environment and when
 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.569
connect this to the environment and when
we do that that training I really like

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579
we do that that training I really like
 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.309
we do that that training I really like
doing it because even the people who

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319
doing it because even the people who
 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:08.190
doing it because even the people who
would not be engaged are engaged when

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200
would not be engaged are engaged when
