00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.230
Now we've heard from Ashok,
from Sebastian and

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.490
from myself about what
artificial intelligence is.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.415
Notice especially though what
Sebastian said about Bayes' rule and

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:09.460
Bayes' networking.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.630
AI is partially about discerning
the unseen cause of the data

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.290
that we can see.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.850
There's another place where we do
that a lot though, data science.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.710
A large part of data science is
looking at patterns in data and

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.690
hypothesizing a cause.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.460
So let's briefly hear from Dave Holtz
and you'd ask if he's data science

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.250
course about their perspective
on these kinds of problems.
