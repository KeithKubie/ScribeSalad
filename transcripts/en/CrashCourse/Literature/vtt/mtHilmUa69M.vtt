Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course Literature,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.040
and today we're letting Virginia Woolf take us to the lighthouse.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.160
Well, assuming the weather holds and we don't get lost in our

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.200
endless spiraling contemplation of the ephemerality of all human life.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.700
We're gonna explore 'To the Lighthouse' as a modernist novel, examine its form

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.940
and style, and discuss its philosophy

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.660
and also its thrilling plot, so get that rowboat ready!

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:31.500
[intro sequence]

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.700
So Virginia Stephen was born in 1882 to Julia Jackson Duckworth - a member of a publishing family,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.080
and Leslie Stephen - a literary critic and the founder of the Dictionary of National Biography.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.440
They were English, if you can't tell from their names and the idea of a Dictionary of National Biography.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.820
Both of her parents had been married before, Virginia had three full siblings and four half siblings

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.140
and her most treasured childhood memories were of holidays spent in Cornwall.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.300
Conveniently, near a lighthouse.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.880
In 1904, she and her sister Vanessa moved into a house in Bloomsbury, London

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.540
and became the center of a social circle of artists and writers and thinkers known as The Bloomsbury Groups

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.200
Stephen began to write for the Times' literary supplement and in 1912,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.100
she married the political theorist Leonard Woolf. In 1915, Virginia Woolf published her first novel.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.860
She also struggled with mental illness throughout most of her life, even as she became an acclaimed writer

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.140
of fiction and nonfiction and during the Second World War,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.440
she loaded her pockets with stones and walked into a river, drowning herself.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.800
Okay, so that's a bit about the author.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.560
Before we explore the form and themes of To the Lighthouse,

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.000
let's review the plot.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.840
The Ramsay family and a few friends spend a day at their vacation home. They talk about going to the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.420
lighthouse, but don't. Ten years pass, and then they do go to the lighthouse.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.720
Then the book is over.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.660
No need to go to the the Thought Bubble for that plot. But even though not much happens,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.240
a lot is happening in To the Lighthouse.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.760
So this is a modernist novel

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.460
Broadly speaking, modernism was a philosophical and cultural movement

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.300
That got going in the late nineteenth century and reached its apex just after World War I

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.000
With forty one million people dead on the WWI battlefield

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.980
It was hard to go back to the same old

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.400
pictures and tunes.
