00:00:00.514 --> 00:00:01.714
- [Voiceover] What we
want to do is find the

00:00:01.714 --> 00:00:03.103
derivative of this G of X

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:04.518
and at first it can look intimidating.

00:00:04.518 --> 00:00:05.584
We have a sine of X here.

00:00:05.584 --> 00:00:06.754
We have a cosine of X.

00:00:06.754 --> 00:00:09.102
We have this crazy expression here

00:00:09.102 --> 00:00:10.892
with a pi over cube root of X

00:00:10.892 --> 00:00:12.022
we're squaring the whole thing

00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:13.558
and at first it might seem intimidating.

00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:14.945
But as we'll see in this video, we can

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:17.717
actually do this with the
tools already in our tool kit.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:20.007
Using our existing derivative properties

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:21.953
using what we know about the power rule

00:00:21.953 --> 00:00:25.184
which tells us the
derivative with respect to X.

00:00:25.184 --> 00:00:26.267
Of X to the N

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.166
is equal to N

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:30.953
times X to the N minus one,

00:00:30.953 --> 00:00:32.558
we've see that multiple times.

00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:34.957
We also need to use the fact

00:00:34.957 --> 00:00:37.767
that the derivative of cosine of X

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:40.035
is equal to negative the sine of X.

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:41.449
And the other way around

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.116
the derivative with respect to X

00:00:45.573 --> 00:00:47.035
of sine of X

00:00:47.035 --> 00:00:49.293
is equal to positive

00:00:49.293 --> 00:00:50.572
cosine of X.

00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:53.144
So using just that we can
actually evaluate this.

00:00:53.144 --> 00:00:55.291
Or evaluate G prime of X.

00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:57.880
So, pause the video and
see if you can do it.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.057
So probably the most
intimidating part of this

00:01:00.057 --> 00:01:01.643
because we know the derivative's a sine

00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:03.916
of X and cosine of X is
this expression here.

00:01:03.916 --> 00:01:05.844
And we can just rewrite this

00:01:05.844 --> 00:01:07.791
or simplify it a little
bit so it takes a form

00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:10.074
that you might be a little
bit more familiar with.

00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:12.225
So, so let me just do this

00:01:12.225 --> 00:01:13.713
on the side here.

00:01:13.713 --> 00:01:14.546
So, pi

00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:16.517
pi over

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.010
the cube root of X

00:01:20.274 --> 00:01:21.506
squared.

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:23.025
Well that's the same thing.

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:25.275
This is equal to pi squared

00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:28.841
over the cube root of X squared.

00:01:30.342 --> 00:01:31.755
This is just exponent properties

00:01:31.755 --> 00:01:33.260
that we're dealing with.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.264
And so this is the same thing.

00:01:35.264 --> 00:01:37.470
We're gonna take X to the one third power

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.949
and then raise that to the second power.

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:42.780
So this is equal to pi squared

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.166
over.

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:44.999
Let me write it this way,

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.981
I'm not gonna skip any steps

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:48.387
because this is a good
review of exponent property.

00:01:48.387 --> 00:01:50.285
X to the one third squared.

00:01:50.285 --> 00:01:53.399
Which is the same thing as pi squared

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.684
over X to the two thirds power.

00:01:56.684 --> 00:02:00.548
Which is the same thing as pi squared

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:04.069
times X to the negative two thirds power.

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.151
So when you write it like this

00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:06.681
it starts to get into a formula,

00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:08.448
you're like, oh, I can
see how the power rule

00:02:08.448 --> 00:02:09.366
could apply there.

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:11.764
So this thing is just pi squared

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:14.681
times X to the negative two thirds power.

00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:17.167
So actually let me delete this.

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:18.330
So,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.163
this thing

00:02:20.746 --> 00:02:22.163
can be rewritten.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.831
This thing can be rewritten

00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:25.914
as pi squared

00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:29.178
times X to the negative

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:32.992
to the negative two thirds power.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.022
So now let's take the derivative

00:02:35.022 --> 00:02:38.944
of each of these pieces
of this expression.

00:02:38.944 --> 00:02:40.505
So, we're gonna take

00:02:40.505 --> 00:02:43.585
we want to evaluate what
the G prime of X is.

00:02:43.585 --> 00:02:44.835
So G prime of X

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.353
is going to be equal to.

00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:48.785
You could view it as a
derivative with respect

00:02:48.785 --> 00:02:51.570
to X of seven sine of X.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.562
So

00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:54.930
we can take do the derivative operator

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.569
on both sides here just to make it clear

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.977
what we're doing.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:02:59.490
So we're gonna apply it there.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.173
We're gonna apply it there.

00:03:02.173 --> 00:03:04.037
And we're going to apply it

00:03:04.037 --> 00:03:05.614
there.

00:03:05.614 --> 00:03:07.099
So this derivative

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.347
this is the same thing as

00:03:09.347 --> 00:03:12.369
this is going to be seven
times the derivative

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:13.878
of sine of X.

00:03:13.878 --> 00:03:16.215
So this is just gonna be seven times

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:17.215
cosine of X.

00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:21.342
This one, over here,

00:03:21.342 --> 00:03:23.689
this is gonna be three,
or we're subtracting,

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.402
so it's gonna be this subtract

00:03:25.402 --> 00:03:26.235
this minus.

00:03:26.235 --> 00:03:28.591
We can bring the constant out

00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:30.802
that we're multiplying the expression by.

00:03:30.802 --> 00:03:33.202
And the derivative of cosine of X

00:03:33.202 --> 00:03:35.255
so it's minus three times

00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:37.035
the derivative of cosine of X

00:03:37.035 --> 00:03:39.311
is negative sine of X.

00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:40.894
Negative sine of X.

00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:44.165
And then finally

00:03:44.165 --> 00:03:46.852
here in the yellow we
just apply the power rule.

00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:49.230
So, we have the negative two thirds,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.666
actually, let's not forget this minus sign

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:52.108
I'm gonna write it out here.

00:03:52.108 --> 00:03:53.264
So you have the negative two thirds.

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:55.566
You multiply the exponent
times the coefficient.

00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:56.876
It might look confusing, pi squared,

00:03:56.876 --> 00:03:58.054
but that's just a number.

00:03:58.054 --> 00:03:59.265
So it's gonna be

00:03:59.265 --> 00:04:00.136
negative

00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:02.410
and then you have negative two thirds

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.827
times pi squared.

00:04:04.673 --> 00:04:06.090
Times pi squared.

00:04:07.023 --> 00:04:09.591
Times X to the negative two thirds

00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:11.017
minus one power.

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:12.591
Negative two thirds

00:04:12.591 --> 00:04:13.922
minus one power.

00:04:13.922 --> 00:04:15.634
So what is this going to be?

00:04:15.634 --> 00:04:17.467
So we get G prime of X

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:19.709
is equal to

00:04:20.762 --> 00:04:21.906
is equal to

00:04:21.906 --> 00:04:23.406
seven cosine of X.

00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:26.344
And let's see, we have a negative three

00:04:26.344 --> 00:04:27.829
times a negative sine of X.

00:04:27.829 --> 00:04:30.912
So that's a positive three sine of X.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.061
And then

00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:35.477
we have, we're subtracting

00:04:35.477 --> 00:04:36.771
but then this is going to be a negative,

00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:38.376
so that's going to be a positive.

00:04:38.376 --> 00:04:39.679
So we can say

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:42.262
plus two pi squared over three.

00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:46.223
Two pi squared over three.

00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:47.744
That's that part there.

00:04:47.744 --> 00:04:48.577
Times X

00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:51.392
to the.

00:04:51.392 --> 00:04:52.747
So negative two thirds

00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:53.580
minus one,

00:04:54.723 --> 00:04:56.126
we could say negative one and two thirds,

00:04:56.126 --> 00:04:59.261
or we could say negative
five thirds by power.

00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:02.090
Negative five thirds power.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.923
And there you have it.

00:05:02.923 --> 00:05:04.006
We were able to tackle this thing that

00:05:04.006 --> 00:05:04.941
looked a little bit hairy

00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:07.158
but all we had to use was the power rule

00:05:07.158 --> 00:05:09.445
and what we knew to be the derivatives

00:05:09.445 --> 00:05:11.028
of sine and cosine.
