Okay, only the Y on the mitochondrial chromosomes don't

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.550
undergo significant recombination of over many generations. Obviously you

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.280
know that chromosomes 1 through 22 do the autosomes.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.530
And even the X chromosome does. Remember when you

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.400
have two X's in an individual, plenty of crossing

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.890
over goes on between those X's. In the X

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.950
and Y combination, they largely don't have a lot

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.170
of recombination. There are a couple of regions that can,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.110
but very few. So over many generations, the Y chromosome

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.130
is left largely intact, whereas the X has plenty recombination that

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.780
goes on when it finds itself in combination with another X.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.980
And of course the mitochondrial chromosome doesn't undergo recombination at all.
