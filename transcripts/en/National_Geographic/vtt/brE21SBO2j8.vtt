00:00:00.967 --> 00:00:02.133
T minus 20 seconds.

00:00:02.133 --> 00:00:03.433
Stage two tanks
pressing for flight.

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:04.900
Flight computer has
control of the vehicle.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.166
Do we see anything on the
sensors that's a problem?

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:08.533
- Anything right now?
- Nothing.

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.834
Well, I'll say go for launch.

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:13.500
T minus 10.

1.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:36.633
[cheering]

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:39.934
It's going, baby.

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:41.834
Come on, baby.

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:42.667
Let's go. [inaudible].

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:43.533
Check it out.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.467
Speed bumped by two kilometers
per second [inaudible]

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:07.033
Shortly after
main engine cutoff,

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.633
we're going to
separate the stages

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:10.533
and begin the second
stage ignition.

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:15.266
Come on!

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:27.233
[cheering]

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.633
The first stage
is returning to land

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:33.834
as the second stage
powers the [inaudible]

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:35.633
satellites to low-Earth orbit.

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:38.300
The [inaudible] have
successfully deployed.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.567
The first stage will soon
begin its series of three burns

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:52.166
to head back towards
Cape Canaveral.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.200
Where's the-- OK, this is bad.

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:18.700
[cheering]

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.867
That is that first
stage coming back down.

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:24.767
History in the making, guys.

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.834
It's standing up.

00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:53.500
It sounded like an explosion.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.567
Yeah, man!

00:02:54.567 --> 00:02:57.533
Oh my god.

00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:58.467
Look at this.

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:00.767
Look it, it's just
sitting there.

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:02.400
Look at that!

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.934
What!

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.600
Holy smokes, man!

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:13.934
It's kind of amazing that
this window of opportunity

00:03:13.934 --> 00:03:17.266
is open for life
to go beyond Earth.

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:18.834
And we just don't know
how long that window

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:21.567
is going to be open.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:23.600
But the thing that
gets me most fired up

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.367
is that creating a
self-sustaining civilization

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:30.066
on Mars, it would be the
greatest adventure ever,

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:31.767
ever in human history.

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:35.066
It would be so exciting
to wake up in the morning

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:38.433
and think that that's
what's happening.
