00:00:01.368 --> 00:00:03.270
I ALWAYS HAD ALICE PEGGED
AS A SIZE QUEEN.

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:04.938
- THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
SHE'S ALWAYS

00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:07.107
THROWIN' FACES
AT ME LIKE...

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.442
- MM-MM, WHAT?

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.776
- THE SIZE QUEENS,
THEY CAN SMELL

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.512
MY HOG
A MILE AWAY, BABY.

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:12.980
- YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO BE ABLE TO SMELL YOUR PENIS.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:14.581
- YEAH, ESPECIALLY
IF THEY'RE MILES AWAY.

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:15.616
- NO, IT DOESN'T STINK.
THAT'S JUST LIKE--

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:16.750
IT'S A EUPHEMISM.

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:18.285
- REGARDLESS OF WHAT
YOU THINK,

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.053
SHE'S NOT GONNA LET US
HAVE THIS FISH FRY

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:22.055
'CAUSE SHE'S ALL TWISTED UP
DOWN THERE, YOU KNOW?

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.091
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHY ALICE
IS SO PEEVED, RIGHT?

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.827
'CAUSE THE WATER BOY TOOK AWAY
HER DEEP [bleep].

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.230
SO ALL I'VE GOTTA DO IS
GIVE HER MY [bleep] DEEP,

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:31.698
AND SHE'LL STOP BEING
SUCH A K-WORD.

00:00:31.732 --> 00:00:33.534
- I THINK
YOU MEAN C-WORD.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:36.203
- ALICE HAS CANCER?
- [bleep].

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.971
- ALICE HAS [bleep] CANCER?

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.940
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL STILL DO IT.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.475
I DON'T CARE IF I CATCH IT.
- OKAY.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.110
- HEALING POWER
OF LOVE, BABY.

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.612
- HE IS RIGHT, THOUGH.
THAT COULD WORK.

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:47.781
YEAH, WHAT IF WE HIRE
A GIGOLO

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:50.384
TO WOMP HER ASS
GANGNAM STYLE, RIGHT?

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.119
THEN, WE'LL BE FRYIN' FISH
IN NO TIME.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.922
- OH, DUDE, NICE.
WE KNOW CHICKS.

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.990
[laughter]
- YEAH, WELL, WE DO KNOW CHICKS.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:58.926
BUT I DON'T THINK WE NEED
TO HIRE ANYONE...

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.562
- NO, WE DO.
- BECAUSE I AM PACKIN' MEAT.

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.830
SERIOUS MEAT DOWN HERE.
IT'S LIKE A WHOLE DELI PLATTER.

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:05.132
IT'S LIKE RARE
COOL MEAT.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:07.701
IT'S LIKE THAT ONE
REALLY LONG MEAT

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:08.869
WITH LIKE OLIVES
IN IT.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.103
HEY, WHAT IS THAT CALLED?
- DUDE.

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:11.238
YOU DON'T WANNA DO
THAT, MAN.

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.639
YOU CAN'T DIP
YOUR PEN

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.241
IN COMPANY STINK,
MY BROTHER.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:15.342
- PIMENTO LOAF.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:16.743
- CAN WE JUST ALL
KEEP IT REAL

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:17.845
AT THE EXACT
SAME MOMENT HERE?

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.179
YOU DON'T HAVE
A LOAF,

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:20.347
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT SHE NEEDS.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.949
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU WANNA SEE IT?

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:23.217
YOU KEEP TALKIN' ABOUT IT.
YOU WANNA SEE IT?

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.418
- I DON'T WANNA
SEE IT.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.353
BUT SURE, WHAT'S UP?

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:27.454
- YOU'RE WARMIN' IT UP
TOO MUCH.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.655
I DON'T WANNA SEE
IT HARD.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.858
I WANNA SEE IT SOFT.

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.093
- COME ON.
OH.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:36.730
