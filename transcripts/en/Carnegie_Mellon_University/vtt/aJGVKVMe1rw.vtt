00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.761
Smart Cities is basically information
and communications technology

00:00:09.087 --> 00:00:13.595
applied to traffic or public
safety or water and sewer.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.015
Technology can bring a lot of solutions
to the challenges that cities face.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.513
And that gets us smart.

00:00:20.624 --> 00:00:22.999
But you gotta take
it another step.

00:00:23.584 --> 00:00:26.439
When you define traffic
as automobiles,

00:00:26.576 --> 00:00:29.036
buses, bikes, pedestrians,

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.512
folks who have to use a wheelchair
to get around their city.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.839
Project by project it's improving
the quality of life for everybody.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.739
By making traffic
lights smarter,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.835
that actually monitor the traffic build
up in each direction in real time

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.295
and then turn green the direction where
the traffic build up is very high,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.339
and then also communicate with
subsequent traffic lights

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.919
saying that I am sending
traffic your way

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.909
so we can actually coordinate the traffic
flow across the city dynamically,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.979
making decisions every
couple of seconds.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.733
You can actually
monitor air pollution

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.659
and basically bring in policies and
solutions to actually reduce pollution.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.639
There'll be fewer automotive
accidents, injuries and fatalities.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.338
Traffic will flow smoother.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.632
So a mother taking her child to school
will actually get there on time.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.869
So we at CMU as academics want to
basically create this body of knowledge,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.829
technologies,
policies and solutions

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.019
which get deployed
in real cities,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.719
in real metropolitan regions

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.959
that over time basically
becomes bedrock

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.459
on which other cities
and societies can build up on.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.830
By being a university that wrestles
with the real world problems,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.249
brings its research and development
capabilities to bear on those problems

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.519
and partners with, whether it's cities
or corporations, other countries,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.020
we multiple the total impact
on a global population.
