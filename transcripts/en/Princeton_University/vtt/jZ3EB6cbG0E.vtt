DANIEL CLARO: What
we try to do is

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.540
try to figure out what's
the best approach.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.440
Taking a flexible
perspective and understanding

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.270
that people learn
differently I think

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.544
is a really important
part of what

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.710
we're trying to do here in
the Digital Learning Lab.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.750
And technology is an
integral part of that

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.750
because technology offers
possibilities to suit

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.926
different kinds of learning.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.450
These days, students
who arrive at Princeton

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.660
will have been using
computers through most

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.040
of their academic life already.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.230
These are digital natives.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.480
And the group that the Digital
Learning Lab is part of

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.420
is the Educational and
Classroom Technologies Group

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.920
within the McGraw Center.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.940
And the Educational
Technologies Group

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.360
helps faculty teach
with technology.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.760
I t helps students
learn with technology.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.240
But what we bring to the
table is a commitment

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.730
to making what happens
in the classroom more

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.640
interesting, more
inspiring, more engaging

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.794
for a diverse audience.

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.960
REBECCA GRAVES-BAYAZITOGLU:
The Digital Learning Lab

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.220
is a teaching lab.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.310
And it's a space where
faculty, who more and more

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.970
are asking students to produce
not your traditional term

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.719
paper, but a video or a blog,
and have a space where they can

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.510
either send their
students or come and work

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.760
with their students to do that.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.870
One of the real privileges
of a Princeton education

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.010
is not only to have
access to that,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.520
but have the access to the
support and the training.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.530
My colleagues engage
in a real dialogue

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.470
with the faculty who are
employing these technologies

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.170
to make sure that they're
being used not simply as bells

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.490
and whistles, but as a really
integral part of conveying

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.100
the information to the students
and helping the students gain

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.220
the capacity to use
it in important ways.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.960
DANIEL CLARO: What faculty
who have used the space know

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.690
and what faculty
who inquire find out

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.160
is that it's not just a space
with a bunch of computers.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.700
But rather it's a space with
a bunch of computers and staff

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.310
who are actively engaged
with the projects that

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.105
are happening here.

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:03.730
MARTHA SANDWEISS: I'm teaching
a freshman seminar this semester

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.310
that is connected to a larger
project I've been running

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.380
for the past few
years that explores

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.270
the question of
Princeton and slavery.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.600
Each of the students in my
class has the assignment

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.930
of finding another Princeton
student, or an alum,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.570
or a faculty member,
or a staff member,

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.590
and talking to them about
their own family's engagement

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.430
at the institution of slavery.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.200
And as I began
asking around trying

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.840
to understand what
resources here at Princeton

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.440
would help me help my students,
I learned about the DLL.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.630
And what we'll be doing at
the Digital Learning Lab

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.300
is editing these
audio interviews

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.580
and then they'll be
learning how to overlay

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.150
those audio interviews with
music, with visual images,

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.600
with documents.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.930
So that each student
will be producing

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.810
about a five-minute
audio-visual piece

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.769
that will be mounted on the
Princeton and Slavery website.

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.060
ALEXA FISHMAN: I did a lot
of journalism in high school

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.520
so I did a lot of
interviews in the past.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.120
And I think this is actually
a much more interesting way

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.110
to present information because
hearing the actual subject talk

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.040
and the emotion when she
discusses her family, pairing

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.110
that with the images,
it just brings

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.714
her audio pieces to life.

00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:14.380
TANIA BORE: They may
be familiar with it

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.546
but they're not familiar
with using things like this

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:18.130
for like a classroom setting.

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.920
I think it can bring a lot
of excitement to projects.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.706
Also learn a new skill
that they probably

00:03:22.706 --> 00:03:24.830
will end up using at some
point, because technology

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.805
has become such an integral
part of our everyday lives.

00:03:27.805 --> 00:03:30.430
DANIEL CLARO: One of the things
that we pride ourselves on here

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.070
is the peer-to-peer
training that we offer.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.220
We have students here who
have done many, many video

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.060
projects who are really good
at using MATLAB, for example.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.912
So if a student
comes in here saying,

00:03:41.912 --> 00:03:43.870
I have a project in
MATLAB, I'm having trouble,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.340
I don't know how
to do it, then we

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.840
can connect that
student who needs

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.820
help to one of our
student staff members

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.500
who are a specialist
in that area.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.750
JESSICA COLANGELO: When
you're going after school

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.570
and working in the industry,
an architecture student

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.960
or if you're a science major,
we have to communicate our work

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.810
and Digital Learning Lab is a
great resource for the students

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.830
to get a jump start into like
a primer on the software.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.110
JORDAN ANTEBI: I had
never heard of the DLL.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.080
I didn't even know
that this room existed.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.850
Before I came to this class,
I had no experience at all

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.019
with filmmaking, with film
editing, with audio editing.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.360
So the staff at the
Digital Learning Lab

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.420
have been very, very, very, very
helpful throughout the process.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.580
MARTHA SANDWEISS: By
producing these short videos

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.010
for publication on
a website, we're

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.950
showing students
that history matters,

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.260
that their work can
find an audience,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.870
and it's really exciting.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.620
REBECCA GRAVES-BAYAZITOGLU:
The technology

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.310
allows us to think about new
ways of conveying information

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.650
but in no way
eclipses the question

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.740
of how do we do that well,
how do we reach our students,

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.810
and help them
understand the material

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.150
and understand the
concepts in such a way

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.800
that they're able to apply
them beyond whatever problem

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.290
we give them in the classroom.
