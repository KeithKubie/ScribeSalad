00:00:00.564 --> 00:00:01.714
- [Voiceover] Hello hello again.

00:00:01.714 --> 00:00:02.643
So, in the last video,

00:00:02.643 --> 00:00:04.756
I started talking about how you interpret

00:00:04.756 --> 00:00:08.123
the partial derivative of a
parametric surface function,

00:00:08.123 --> 00:00:10.514
of a function that has
a two variable input,

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:13.440
and a three variable vector-valued output.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.495
And we typically visualize
those as a surface

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:16.958
in three dimensional space,

00:00:16.958 --> 00:00:19.965
and the whole process,
I was saying, you think

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.965
about how a portion of the t-s plane

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:25.811
moves to that corresponding output.

00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:27.762
And again, I'm kind of
cheating with this animation,

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.488
where, really, this isn't
the t-s plane, right?

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:30.855
This is on the x-y plane.

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:33.875
t-s plane should just be some
separate space over here,

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:35.373
and we're imagining
moving that separate space

00:00:35.373 --> 00:00:37.149
over into three dimensions.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.597
But that's harder to animate,
so I'm just not gonna do it,

00:00:40.597 --> 00:00:44.764
and I'm gonna instead keep
things inside the x-y plane here.

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:46.648
We're thinking about the squares

00:00:46.648 --> 00:00:50.165
being t and s ranging each from 0 to 3.

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:53.183
And, what I said, for partial
derivative with respect to t,

00:00:53.183 --> 00:00:54.657
is you imagine the line

00:00:54.657 --> 00:00:57.432
that represents movement
in the t direction.

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:59.661
You see how that line gets mapped

00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:02.401
as all of the points move to
their corresponding output.

00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:05.617
And the partial derivative vector

00:01:05.617 --> 00:01:07.918
gives you a certain tangent vector

00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:10.298
to the curve representing that line,

00:01:10.298 --> 00:01:13.003
which corresponds to
movement in the t direction.

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.337
And the longer that is,
the faster the movement,

00:01:15.337 --> 00:01:19.087
The more sensitive it is to
nudges in the t direction.

00:01:19.087 --> 00:01:20.747
In the s direction,
let's say we were to take

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.872
the partial derivative with respect to s.

00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:25.789
So I'll kind of clear this up here.

00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:28.793
Also clear up this guy.

00:01:28.793 --> 00:01:30.012
And if you said instead,

00:01:30.012 --> 00:01:32.694
"what if we were doing it
with respect to s," right?

00:01:32.694 --> 00:01:34.273
Partial derivative of v,

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:36.676
the vector-valued function,
with respect to s.

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:38.393
Well, you do something very similar.

00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:40.972
You would say "OK, What is
the line that corresponds

00:01:40.972 --> 00:01:43.468
"to movement in the s direction?"

00:01:43.468 --> 00:01:44.301
And the way I've drawn it,

00:01:44.301 --> 00:01:45.825
it's always going to be perpendicular,

00:01:45.825 --> 00:01:47.503
because we're in the t-s plane,

00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:50.557
the t axis is perpendicular
to the s plane.

00:01:50.557 --> 00:01:53.982
And in this case, this line
represents t = 1, right?

00:01:53.982 --> 00:01:55.584
You're saying t constantly equals 1,

00:01:55.584 --> 00:01:57.500
but you're letting s vary.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.555
And if you see how that line maps,

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:01.865
as you move everything
from the input space

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:05.325
over to the corresponding
points in the output space,

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.821
that line tells you what happens

00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.861
as you're varying the
s value of the input.

00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:13.638
It kind of starts curving this way,

00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:15.820
and then it curves very much up and

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.282
kind of goes off into the distance there.

00:02:18.282 --> 00:02:19.942
And again, the grid
lines here really help,

00:02:19.942 --> 00:02:22.461
because every time that you
see the grid lines intersect,

00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:25.120
one of the lines represents
movement in the t direction,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.046
and the other represents
movement in the s direction.

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:30.995
And for partial derivatives,
we think very similarly.

00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:34.661
You think of that partial
s as representing-

00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:35.923
(voiced zooming sounds)

00:02:35.923 --> 00:02:38.033
Zoom on back here.

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:40.158
That partial s you
think of as representing

00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:42.654
a tiny movement in the s direction,

00:02:42.654 --> 00:02:45.278
just a little smidge and nudge,

00:02:45.278 --> 00:02:47.542
somehow nudging that guy along.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.423
And then the corresponding nudge

00:02:49.423 --> 00:02:51.280
you look for in the output space,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.614
you say okay, if we nudge
the input that much,

00:02:53.614 --> 00:02:56.614
and we go over to the output, and...

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:00.001
and maybe that tiny nudge

00:03:00.001 --> 00:03:02.638
corresponded with one
that's three times bigger.

00:03:02.638 --> 00:03:04.974
I don't know, but it looked
like it stretched things out.

00:03:04.974 --> 00:03:06.266
So that tiny nudge might
turn into something

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:07.624
that's still quite small,

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:10.062
but maybe three times bigger.

00:03:10.062 --> 00:03:11.363
But it's a vector.

00:03:11.363 --> 00:03:13.046
What you do is, you think of that vector

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:15.647
as being your partial v,

00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:18.004
and you scale it by whatever the size

00:03:18.004 --> 00:03:19.943
of that partial s was, right?

00:03:19.943 --> 00:03:22.613
So the result that you get

00:03:22.613 --> 00:03:26.398
is a tangent vector that's
not puny, not a tiny nudge,

00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:30.538
but is actually a sizable tangent vector.

00:03:30.538 --> 00:03:32.801
And it's going to correspond to the rate

00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:35.739
at which changes, not just tiny changes,

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.881
but the rate at which changes in s

00:03:37.881 --> 00:03:40.146
cause movement in the output space.

00:03:40.146 --> 00:03:42.143
So, let's actually
compute it for this case,

00:03:42.143 --> 00:03:46.659
just get some good
practice computing things.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.016
And if we look up here, the t value

00:03:49.016 --> 00:03:50.653
which used to be considered a variable

00:03:50.653 --> 00:03:52.069
when we were doing it with respect to t.

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.915
But now that t value
looks like a constant,

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:55.517
so its derivative is zero.

00:03:55.517 --> 00:03:58.037
Then -s², with respect to s,

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:00.037
has a derivative of -2s.

00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:05.514
st: s looks like a variable,
t looks like a constant,

00:04:05.514 --> 00:04:08.370
the derivative is just that constant, t.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.168
Down here, ts²: t looks like a constant,

00:04:11.168 --> 00:04:13.301
s looks like a variable, so...

00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:14.801
2 times t times s.

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:18.622
And then over here, we're subtracting off,

00:04:18.622 --> 00:04:21.081
s is the variable, t²
looks like a constant,

00:04:21.081 --> 00:04:22.498
so that constant.

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:27.873
And let's say we plug in the value (1,1).

00:04:27.873 --> 00:04:30.532
This red dot corresponds to (1,1),

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:32.946
so what we would get here,

00:04:32.946 --> 00:04:35.071
s is equal to 1, so that's -2,

00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:36.952
t is equal to 1, so that's 1,

00:04:36.952 --> 00:04:39.564
then 2 times 1 times 1, I'll write it.

00:04:39.564 --> 00:04:40.397
2*1*1

00:04:40.397 --> 00:04:41.230
minus 1²

00:04:43.397 --> 00:04:47.078
is gonna correspond to 1, that's 2-1.

00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:49.818
So what we would expect
for the tangent vector,

00:04:49.818 --> 00:04:51.478
the partial derivative vector,

00:04:51.478 --> 00:04:53.243
is the x-component should be negative,

00:04:53.243 --> 00:04:55.994
and then the y and z-components
should each be positive.

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:57.597
And if we go over, and we take a look

00:04:57.597 --> 00:05:01.300
at what the movement along
the curve actually is,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.257
that lines up, right?

00:05:02.257 --> 00:05:05.782
Because, as you kind of
zip along this curve,

00:05:05.782 --> 00:05:10.124
you're moving to the
left, so the x-component

00:05:10.124 --> 00:05:12.155
of the partial derivative
should be negative.

00:05:12.155 --> 00:05:15.337
But you're moving upwards
as far as y is concerned,

00:05:15.337 --> 00:05:17.241
and you can also kinda see
that the leftward movement

00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:19.291
is kind of twice as fast
as the upward motion.

00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:21.836
The slope favors the x direction.

00:05:21.836 --> 00:05:23.940
And then as far as the z
component is concerned,

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.739
you are, in fact, moving up.

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:26.700
And maybe you could say,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.032
"Well, how do you know
which way you're moving,

00:05:28.032 --> 00:05:30.263
"are you moving that way, or is everything

00:05:30.263 --> 00:05:31.878
"switched the other way around?"

00:05:31.878 --> 00:05:35.477
And the benefit of animation here is,

00:05:35.477 --> 00:05:38.833
we can say, "Ah, as s is ranging from zero

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:41.898
"up to three, this is the
increasing direction."

00:05:41.898 --> 00:05:44.463
And you just keep your eye
on what that direction is

00:05:44.463 --> 00:05:47.052
as we move things about.

00:05:47.052 --> 00:05:49.014
And that increasing direction
does kind of correspond

00:05:49.014 --> 00:05:51.197
with moving along the curve this way.

00:05:51.197 --> 00:05:54.959
So, you get a tangent
vector in the other way.

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:56.898
And one kinda nice thing
about this, then, is

00:05:56.898 --> 00:06:00.775
the two different partial
derivative vectors that we found

00:06:00.775 --> 00:06:02.134
Each one of them, you could say,

00:06:02.134 --> 00:06:04.246
is a tangent vector to the surface, right?

00:06:04.246 --> 00:06:05.554
So the one that was a partial derivative

00:06:05.554 --> 00:06:07.923
with respect to t, over here,

00:06:07.923 --> 00:06:09.281
kinda goes in one direction,

00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:11.092
and the other one kinda
gives you a different notion

00:06:11.092 --> 00:06:15.458
of what a tangent vector
on the surface could be.

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.836
And you could have a notion
of directional derivative too,

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:21.065
that kind of combines
these in various ways,

00:06:21.065 --> 00:06:22.520
and that will get you
all the different ways

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.069
that you can have a vector
tangent to the surface.

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.693
And later on, I'll talk about
things like tangent planes,

00:06:28.693 --> 00:06:31.874
if you want to express
what a tangent plane is.

00:06:31.874 --> 00:06:34.475
And you kind of think
of that as being defined

00:06:34.475 --> 00:06:36.437
in terms of two different vectors.

00:06:36.437 --> 00:06:38.492
But for now, that's really
all you need to know

00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:42.915
about partial derivatives
of parametric surfaces.

00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:44.599
And the next couple
videos, I'll talk about

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:47.072
what partial derivatives
of vector-valued functions

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:48.468
can mean in other contexts,

00:06:48.468 --> 00:06:50.601
because it's not always
a parametric surface,

00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:52.134
and maybe you're not always thinking

00:06:52.134 --> 00:06:54.119
about a curve that could be moved along,

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:56.418
but you still want to think,
"How does this input nudge

00:06:56.418 --> 00:06:57.834
"correspond to an output nudge,

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.110
"and what's the ratio between them."

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.903
So with that, I'll see you next video.
