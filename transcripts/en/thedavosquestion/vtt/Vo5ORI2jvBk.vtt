00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.069
&gt;&gt; The global financial crisis that we're
experiencing requires that

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.719
political leaders and business leaders get
together and work out

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.010
solutions that are global, work out solutions
that will bring about

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:22.380
sustainable solutions to the crisis.
This framework is not enough.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.320
This framework is not sufficient.
Citizens, ordinary citizens, must do a lot.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.250
In fact, we say, we go back to Kennedy and
paraphrase Kennedy.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.570
Ask not what leaders can do to bring about
an end to the global

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.870
economic crisis, but rather what you can do
as a citizen to bring about

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.790
change?
To bring about solutions to the crisis we're

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.040
facing as a globe?
What does this require?

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.149
It requires us to revisit the our values.
It requires us to say, what am I doing in

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.530
my business that will
contribute to the solution of the crisis as

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.139
opposed to increase and
enhance the crisis?

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:11.399
In particular, we must redefine what success
means.

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.069
What is success for a company?
What is success for a community? For a family?

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.909
And let's move away from the profit-driven
strategy but go to a triple

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.920
bottom line approach that says the impact
on society is important.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.359
The impact on the environment is important.
As an individual consumer, what is the impact

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.649
I'm having on society?
As an individual citizen, what is the impact

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.549
I'm having on the
environment?

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.789
In other words, we must judge each other.
We must judge ourselves using a framework

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.499
and value system that says
society, environment, and profits.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.579
If this can be done at a personal level, this
can be done by

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.289
individuals.
Individuals must reduce their levels of consumption.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.669
What is your carbon consumption as an individual?
What kind of car do you drive?

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:11.510
In terms of consumption of fuel, in terms
of pollution, how energy

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.570
efficient is your system that you're using
in the house?

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.630
What kind of lighting system are you employing?
What kind of batteries are you using?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.430
Are you recycling as an individual?
What have you done in the community to make

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.110
a difference as a person,
as a individual?

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.080
What are you doing in the school system to
promote education?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.910
In other words, we are encouraging the individual
to become a change

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.760
agent.
We're encouraging the individual to understand

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.230
the nature of the global
financial crisis and then encouraging them

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.170
to respond at a personal
level and offer solutions.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.700
And as we do this, we don't want the African
citizen to be a

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.670
second-class citizen.
We want the African citizen or a citizen from

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.630
the poor countries to do
the same by also becoming part of the solutions

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.290
to the issues around
the global financial crisis.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:14.150
In particular, we want to drive entrepreneurship.
We want to move away from ever being a worker.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.780
In other words as individuals ask ourselves
how many jobs have I

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.030
created as an individual?
How many companies have I created?

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.250
So we are saying it is incumbent upon every
citizen to become a player

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.650
in terms of driving the economy.
In terms of growing the economy and the growth

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.370
the economy itself is
not enough, it must be a shared economic growth

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.380
strategy.
And this is what is required of the individual.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.100
This is what required of the citizen in every
country.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:56.150
And also in doing this, we must encourage
more people to take positions

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.430
in public leadership, to take positions in
political leadership.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.459
Most of our best minds are in the private
sector; most of our best

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.709
minds are academia; most of our best minds
are in journalism; most of

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.889
our best minds are the in NGO communities
and mediocre politics if we

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.120
do this, we are winning the future of our
globe.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.430
We must find a way to encourage our superstars,
our high performers to

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.120
move into the public sector.
We must encourage more young global leaders,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.900
more people come to Davos
to get into the public sector and become political

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.349
leaders.
This is a calling and it must be understood

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:49.229
at a personal level.
In addition to this, individual citizens must

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.159
move away from the
Maslow's hierarchy of needs as defined as

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.090
Maslow.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs starts with shelter,

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.499
food and ends up with
self-actualization.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.939
That is the highest stage, where seeing that
is [INAUDIBLE]model.

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.300
We must modify it and say how can I go beyond
self?

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.999
How can I self-transcend and leave a legacy,
make a difference in the

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:17.199
lives of the people around me.
This is the challenge to the citizen; this

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.590
is the challenge to the
individual, to be able to say I have self-transcended,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.479
I have gone
beyond self; I have left a legacy in my community,

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.710
have left a legacy
in the world.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.759
I've made a dent to the universe.
This can be done.

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:38.000
We shall overcome if as individuals we step
up to the plate and be

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.489
counted.
