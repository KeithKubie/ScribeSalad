00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.050
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C..

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.450
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb:
Your Excellency,

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.230
Ambassador Hunaina
Sultan Al Mughairy.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.620
Dr. Said bin Nasser Alsalmi,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.060
Ladies and Gentlemen:
good morning.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.650
And thank you all for coming
today despite the gray weather.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.620
I'm Mary Jane Deeb, Chief of
the African Mid-East Division

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.470
of the Library of Congress
that's co-sponsoring this

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.500
conference with the Sultan
Qaboos Cultural Center.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.540
And I will be your host today.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.350
Unfortunately, Mark Sweeney,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.200
the acting Deputy Librarian,
could not be with us.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.810
As he had to travel to Egypt
to visit our Cairo office.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.440
But first, I would like to
thank the Executive Director

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.700
of the Sultan Qaboos
Center, Kathleen Ridolfo,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.400
whom I have known for
more than two decades.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.710
And without whom this conference
would not have been possible.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.110
I also want to recognize
Harrison [inaudible],

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.740
the Senior Program
Officer at the Center

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.010
for coordinating this
event and ensuring

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.680
that the wonderful
scholars you will hear

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.800
from today made it
to Washington.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.180
I want to recognize the
work of my own team,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.760
especially Joan Weeks, the
head of the [inaudible]

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.540
who among the many
other things she's done.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.740
She has organized a
wonderful book display

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.880
in our conference room
that you'll be able

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.300
to see during the break.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.140
I want to thank Wanda Cartwright
from Special Events who is

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.590
in charge of logistics.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.720
And coordinating the
arrangements in the room,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080
the sound system,
the webcasting,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.750
the videotaping, the catering.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.680
An event like this
takes a village,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.300
as the saying goes,
to put together.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.590
So a word about why we are
holding this conference.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.560
First, this is the first major
conference on Oman archeology.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.270
Ever held at the
Library of Congress.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.570
So it's a first.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.870
We like firsts.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.140
Library always likes to be
first in doing something.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.310
At this point of
an annual series

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.620
that I started many years ago
on the ancient civilizations

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.550
of the Middle East that
included the ancient [inaudible]

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.850
of Persia.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.790
The Phoenicians and the
ancient city of Tyre.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.880
The ancient Assyrians.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.930
The [inaudible] and many others.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.130
And in June, we'll be
holding a conference

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.040
on the history of the Armenians.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.690
The purpose is to
give depth and breadth

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.490
to the region of
the Middle East.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.890
And to highlight the creativity,
richness, and complexity

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.420
of a part of the world
that was for millennia,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.180
the cradle of world
civilizations.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.740
It is also to entice you all
to come back to the Library

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.450
to our division among others
to explore our collections

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.120
and discover on your own more
about these great civilizations.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.750
The top scholars
we invite to share

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.740
with us the research
are the ones

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.130
who will cast a spell on you.

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.900
And bring you back to
read their books and those

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.360
of others here at the Library.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.100
And now I would like to
introduce Her Excellency Hunaina

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.770

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.720
The Ambassador of Oman who has
been such a staunch supporter

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.200
of this project and many
others from the get go.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.450
And will say a few words and
introduce the keynote speaker.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.280
Her Excellency was appointed
as Ambassador Extraordinary

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.290

She also serves as chair

of the Sultan Qaboos Culture

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.490
Ambassador Mughairy
is an economist

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.420
with an extensive
business background.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.430
She's a strong advocate for the
U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.910
And has focused much of her
energy on improving relations

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.940
between the US and Oman.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.460
Prior to her work in
diplomacy, she served many roles

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.070

&gt;&gt; Ambassador Hunaina
Sultan Al Mughairy:

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.800
[Foreign language]
Dr. Deeb, Dr. Alsalmi,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.570
distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.510
As Chair of the Sultan
Qaboos Cultural Center,

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.600
it gives me great pleasure
to welcome you this morning

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.960
for this very special event
on archeological discoveries

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.010
in the Sultanate of Oman.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.790
Today we will travel from
the northern [inaudible]

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.310
to [inaudible] and
[inaudible] and examine the ways

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.300
in which ancient Oman
served as a crossroads

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.270
for culture and exchange.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.040
As you listen to our
distinguished guests

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.020
and panelists discuss
their research.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.190
I hope you'll come to see
the Sultanate as we do.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.510
A rich and vibrant cultural
hub that welcomes exchange

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.850
and interaction with
its neighbors.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.050
And indeed the global world.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.510
For, as we will see,
even in ancient times,

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.990
Oman was at the forefront of
the exchange and innovation.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.530
Our last panel of the day will
transport us to the present

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.680
where we will hear about the
Sultanate's efforts towards the

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.760
conscientious preservation of
the cultural sites in Oman.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.290
Such efforts enable us

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.080
to maintain these treasures
while sharing them with visitors

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.900
from around the world.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.770
The Sultanate is home to four
UNESCO World Heritage Sites,

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.910
including the Land
of Frankincense,

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.680
which includes the ancient
ports of Khawr Ruri, Al Baleed

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.130
and the inland trading
post of Shisur.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.660
And also Wadi Dukah.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.480
Together, these sites and
others serve as a statement

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.580
to Oman's early settlement
and exchange with the world.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.230
Including the far
reaches of Asia.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:21.910
We know, for example that from
Bat, Oman was a major exporter

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.260
of copper to Mesopotamia
and the Indus Valley.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.550
Artifacts from Al
Baleed including pottery

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.680
from China demonstrates
the reach

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.280
of ancient traders along
the Silk Route to the sea.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.520
I would like to thank our
panelists for traveling

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.700
from near and far to share
their experience with us today.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.960
The panelists have spent a large
part of their careers in Oman.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.950
Their work is at the forefront

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:53.290
of the archeological
research in the Sultanate.

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:57.840
A special thanks go to, goes to
Dr. Said Alsalmi who joins us

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.230

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.770

The Sultan Qaboos Cultural
Center was established in 2005.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.240
Our mission is a simple one.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.890
To educate Americans and
Omanis on each other's culture.

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.410
Through programs such as this,

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.550
we hope to share not
only our history,

00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.850
but our future with you.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.350
And last but not least, I
would like to thank my team

And now for our keynote speaker,

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.410

the Land of Frankincense.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:56.410
He's an expert, is an

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:00.470
Dr. Alsalmi obtained his

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.990
And now I know that you

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.030
and he has promised a very
exciting presentation.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:25.060
[Laughter]

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.840
&gt;&gt; Dr. Said bin Nasser
Alsalmi: Good morning.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.710
Madame Ambassador, Madame,

thank you very much
for the invitation.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.080
Ladies and gentlemen,
colleagues and friends.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.500
Some of them who work
actually in Oman.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.500
My lecture is going to be a
little bit different, actually.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.700
And I managed to do that because
I don't want you to get bored

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.670
from the keynote
speaker immediately.

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.970
You have a lot of
[inaudible] coming.

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:03.590
This is a floor map of the
ancient Near East civilization.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.010
This is from Museum
of Fine Art in Boston.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.990
What you can see there is the
most important civilization

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.130
in the Middle East.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:22.200
What you can see in the Arabian
Peninsula there is only one

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.990
name exists.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:28.390
Oman always been a focal point
in the international trade.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.590
You have it from the
Frankincense Trail

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:37.460
down from Dhofar all the
way to the Red Sea to Europe

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.970
or with [inaudible], with Magan
from the third millennium BC.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.520
All the way to Mesopotamia
or the Indus Valley.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:52.860
And by margin, both of
those trades, you have one

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.760
of the oldest evidence
of a human being

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:03.230
or human existence in Arabia.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.580
This is how Oman today
with its boundaries.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.890
Oman was in a political
it was bigger than that,

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.950
getting bigger, getting smaller.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.190
But this is how is Oman today.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:21.260
It's still a focal point in the
trade, in international trade.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.330
And it's still a focal
point in history.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.610
This is our masterpiece.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:35.160
This is an axe dated to two
million years ago was found

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.790
in a [inaudible] in Dhofar.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:41.130
If we go back, I'm sorry.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:46.570
The [inaudible] I don't
have a pointer here.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.210
[Inaudible] the [inaudible] of
Dhofar is between the Mountain

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:54.640
of Dhofar, all the way to
Al Wusta, so all that desert

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.160
in the middle of Oman, this
is the [inaudible] plateau.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:03.020
Hundreds of archeological
sites been discovered there.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.200
Goes back from two millions
years ago until the first vic--

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.380
settlement, goes to the tenth
millennium BC [inaudible]

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.680
or in [inaudible].

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.410
Between them, you
have [inaudible] goes

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:24.900
to 450,000 years ago,
120,000 years ago.

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:29.420
And it's a long list
of archeology.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:32.880
I'm going to give you actually
the-- we have two sites.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:39.230
Came up with very
interesting results.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:47.330
It's not been published
yet, so I'm going

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:48.630
to focus on those two sites.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.220
[inaudible] it's about
[inaudible] and Khawr Ruri.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.210
Khawr Ruri is World Heritage
Site of the Land of Frankincense

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.800
as Her Ex, Her Excellency the
Ambassador mentioned the Land

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.460
of Frankincense sites.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.340
One of them is Khawr Ruri.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.790
Two years ago, we did
a kind of investigation

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.930
with an Italian Mission to
Oman from Pisa University

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.920
and the discovery was amazing.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.300
This is a [inaudible].

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:29.770
You have a fortified site.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:35.550
Give you an evidence
from 60,000 BC.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:36.850
This is the first evidence.

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.380
We have it in [inaudible] on
the coastline that it goes back

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:43.120
to the 60,000 years ago.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.900
Normally we have much of the
site are on the [inaudible].

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.950
Here you can see
the differentiate

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:56.480
between political
site [inaudible].

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.830
You have from the 60,000.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:05.440
You have from [inaudible]
6000, and you have Bronze Age.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:07.100
Then you have-- we
call it [inaudible].

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:11.940
We don't call it
Islamic Period, actually.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.040
This is the site.

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.270
This is the main gate.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.860
It's 100 meter above sea.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.660
So you have to climb
up, I think.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.050
Some of you [inaudible]
she was there already.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.350
She knows that area.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:35.730
This is the site
of the Bronze Age.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:47.370
This one here is the most
[inaudible] Bronze sites.

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:49.320
We find it in Dhofar.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.690
Little bit different that
we find it on the top

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:55.630
of [inaudible] because
it's above the sea.

00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:58.960
This is oldest [inaudible]
that we have it in Khawr Ruri.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.850
From there we believe
that they moved down to,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.720
and they built somehow around,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.480
somehow around the five
century BC all the way

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.100
to the fourth century BC.

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.920
No, the fourth century
AD actually.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.670
This is the most
interesting artifact

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:27.860
that for the first time we
find them on the coastline

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.410
of Dhofar, 60,000 years ago.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:34.780
Some of similar object
you will find them

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:37.190
in the [inaudible]
plateau in the desert.

00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.540
But to have it on the coastline,

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:43.710
we have one of the earliest
evidence of human presence

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.390
and occupation in Dhofar.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:58.780
And this is from the Neolithic
Period, 6000 years ago.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:02.090
[Inaudible] is little bit,
we actually I have this

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:06.490
in a conversation with Professor
Jeffery [inaudible] three weeks,

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.770
four weeks ago before
I came back to Oman.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.930
No, before I come, before
I came to Washington.

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:18.440
For him, he was looking
to this site.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.770
And the site is in
a small valley.

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.970
It's that, it's that thick.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:33.560
He waited for the analysis to
come back and he was shocked

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.240
because he believed this was
not more than 12,000 years ago.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.930
Analysis give it, this is one
of the oldest occupation coming

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:49.040
in this area [inaudible]
which is 30,000 years ago.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.980
Why is [inaudible]
important for us?

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.220
It's connected what we believe
in our, in our literature

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.520
with [inaudible] people.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:02.490
That [inaudible] people
occupied this area

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:08.360
and it's been destroyed by a
wind, et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.240
At the end of this
lecture actually,

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:13.260
I have eight minutes [inaudible]

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.750
that will give you the
idea how wide this area

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:20.140
and how it became as a desert.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.610
So this is one of
the most interesting.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.510
This is only one month ago
discovery and analysis.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.080
This is the whole plateau.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.390
You can see the [inaudible]
complicated,

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.880
but you can see the wadis there.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:41.130
This is the artifact
that we find in there.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.960
Very small artifacts.

00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:53.390
The [inaudible] plateau is one
of the most interesting part

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:57.060
of Oman which has a lot
of archeological site.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:19:00.610
Coming from early
Neolithic Period.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.730
And of course is goes inside
[inaudible] which is part

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:07.490
of [inaudible] in
this, in this area.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.610
This is the area what we believe

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:12.710
that [inaudible]
people used to live in.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.010
And this is the site.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.430
After the banishment,
they just distributed

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.180
in small groups around 20, 25's.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.900
And they start to build,
not to build actually.

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:31.780
They start to establish their
own small settlements around it.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.070
And it's continue
all the way to Sur.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.970
So we have the [inaudible]
area from Sur.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.030
From [inaudible]
in Sur all the way

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.020
down to [inaudible] in Yemen.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:52.050
The most site that I
really been working

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.880
in was Salut in the north.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.900
Salut for us is important
of two reason.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.050
It's connected to the
legendary of [inaudible]

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.800
when he was traveling from
[inaudible] he arrived to Salut.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.180
And he found a palace
and it was uninhabited.

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:15.160
[Inaudible] what's
happened to the people?

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.460
And he ask the [inaudible]
to construct the palace.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.950
So according to the legend,

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.360
in three days he
constructed something

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.940
like 30,000 [inaudible] in Oman.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.240
Of course that's the legend.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:31.550
That's why Salut
for us important.

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:32.850
We inscribe the word,

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:35.710
the [inaudible] World
Heritage Site according

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.410
to our discovery actually in
Salut would give us evidence,

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:44.200
the earliest irrigation channel
system in Oman goes back--

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.110
or in the area, actually,
to the third millennium BC.

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:54.850
This is Salut in 2004.

00:20:54.850 --> 00:21:00.060
And this is Salut 2017.

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:11.580
This is the-- we, we, you,

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:13.890
we start to [inaudible]
at the village.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.480
But later on archeologists told
us this is not a [inaudible]

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.350
this is well-advanced system.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.530
Well organized.

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.890
And it's [inaudible] in Salut.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:29.000
The site is huge.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.410
The site is on the tentative
list for World Heritage Sites.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.780
We started now to establish
as an archeological park.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.010
We have already done
two archeological parks

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.310
down in [inaudible].

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.260
One in [inaudible]
and one in Khawr Ruri.

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.560
Reason last year [inaudible],

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:51.330
last year again we
added [inaudible]

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:56.800
as an archeological
park as well.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:02.620
So this is give you an idea
of the importance of Salut.

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:12.360
In Salut, we have something
like more than 3000 tombs

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.940
on the top of the mountains.

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.070
It's a long process.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:20.910
We believe it's the
heart of Oman.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:26.970
This is lead me to the second
point why is Salut important?

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.200
In the Omani literature as well.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.200
It's where [inaudible]
defeated [inaudible]

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.530
around first century AD.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:42.340
And we started with what we
call it [inaudible] of Oman

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:48.540
and Oman become more
part of Arabic identity.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.640
Two months ago, we had an
Italian mission work in Oman

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.580
and we discovered
a large cemetery.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:06.810
And we within a lot of
weapons, lot of swords.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:10.960
The, the primary analysis
give us this is coming

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:14.740
to the first century AD
which is close to the battle

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.590
that took place with
the [inaudible].

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:24.110
So we might discover what
they call it the, the,

00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:25.710
the tomb of [inaudible].

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.520
Are they soldiers?

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.840
We don't know.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:35.140
But this is the [inaudible]
Salut.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:39.000
Until two, three years
ago we didn't thought

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.980
that there is anything
underneath.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:48.490
It just a small wall
need to be restored.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.230
Need to be conserved.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.200
And to be drawing [inaudible].

00:23:53.200 --> 00:24:00.810
Later on we discovered that
we had a complete close

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:09.320
to [inaudible] goes back
to the third millennium BC.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:16.570
We, a city has all the
elements as an administrative

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.940
and ruling area for [inaudible].

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:25.830
We believe, I'm not sure
about it, but we believe

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.540
that it might be the capital of
[inaudible] but we are not sure.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:35.500
We are still with analysis
and we'll see how it goes.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.800
This is one of the tombs.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:43.150
Part of our work is
actually to make a kind

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.520
of a presentation to the public.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.720
Public awareness is
very important for us.

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.930
It is very important
that they, they know

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:55.930
and understand what
we have been doing.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.670
Because we have always the
argument what the benefit

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:00.820
of archeology?

00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.880
We are spending money,
so what the benefit?

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:08.030
The example we have it in
Khawr Ruri and in Al Baleed

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.460
with a visitors close to
200,000 visitors a year.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.060
I think that justify why
we have to concentrate

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:16.360
on archeological past.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.690
Why we have to set
up this example

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.450
as an archeological
park in Oman.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.900
And actually recently we
manage with US [inaudible]

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:28.270
and income to, to
pass a recommendation

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.880
about archeological park.

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.390
We call it [inaudible]
recommendation

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.470
on archeological park.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:39.230
For the first time with
[inaudible] to approve the term

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.730
and the concepts, the
principle of archeological park.

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.030
This is one of the tomb.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.370
This is the third
millennium BC tomb.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:49.180
This is actually on the
top of the mountains.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.750
Restoration process continue.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:58.310
And this is how it look
after it has been restored.

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:03.540
This is, it would be amazing
to see that people they go

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:07.830
and climb the mountain
just to see it, you know.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.010
It's not easy to reach
the top of the mountain.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.260
But people, they love to see it.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.760
Especially the local community.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.780
It's been, they've been
there for hundred of years.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.740
They never give any
attention what's going on.

00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.530
As soon we made few examples

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:27.420
of restoration excavation
in the area.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:29.360
We have a lot of demand
of people that are coming

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.600
and asking, "What does it mean?

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.540
How old is this site?

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:40.730
What kind of discovery
you find there?"

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:48.860
The area as one hand, what we
call them is a third millennium

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.160
BC towers.

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.180
This is, you'll find
them a lot in the north

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.900
of Oman what we call it Omani
Peninsula which is now Oman

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:58.220
and United Arab Emirates.

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.260
You'll find them in [inaudible],
you find them in Bat.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.030
We believe they are a kind

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:10.780
of protection towers been
distributed in certain area

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.840
of Oman and in certain
area of valleys.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.240
And most of them, they
have a wadi inside

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.180
so they are more independent
and they can collect water.

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:31.510
Salut is 150-- no, it's
200 kilometer inside Oman.

00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:35.180
So it's on the close to
[inaudible] mountain.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.650
However, this is a scene
from the Indus Valley

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:46.550
to show you the trade between
Oman and the Indus Valley.

00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.700
It's not on the coastline
and you are talking

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.170
about the third millennium city.

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.700
You are talking about
5000 years ago

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:55.200
that there was a trade
established between Salut

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.140
in the heart of Oman
and Indus Valley.

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:00.680
We know in those days

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.740
that already Oman
maritime history started

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.460
with the [inaudible] from
[inaudible] all the way to,

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.620
to Indus Valley, all the,
all the way to India.

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:18.880
But to have those kind
of [inaudible] give you

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.030
that Salut is very important.

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:25.320
There was an administrative
structure.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.010
Because [inaudible]
mean it's a stamp.

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.590
Something is a property.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.340
You are trying to prove
that this is yours.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.330
You're trying to, to establish

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:38.580
or to accomplish a
deal with someone.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.600
So you have a structure

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:44.880
of administrative system
already exist in Salut.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:55.140
Snakes. We believe
that the people

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:58.230
of Salut worshipped snakes.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:00.750
And it's a sign of protection.

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.680
Recently with the Ministry
of Culture and Heritage close

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.120
to [inaudible] which another
100 kilometer from Salut.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.520
They discover another
site, and they have snakes.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.460
You have it in bronze,
you have it in pottery.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:20.750
You have it as the, as what they
call it, in what you call it,

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:25.570
impressed on the pottery itself.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:28.040
According to the
legend of Frankincense,

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.240
the frankincense trees been
protected by flying snakes.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.700
We are talking about [inaudible]
in the south which is something

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:39.590
like 1000 kilometer away.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:49.780
This is little bit-- we had
a big argument about it.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.370
We discover five, six actually.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:30:00.780
No, five completed
base for, for columns.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:05.230
We reconstructed according
to UNESCO standards.

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:13.280
We try to, to adapt the
Omani traditional architect.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:14.580
Because we have [inaudible].

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:20.040
We have the columns with the,
with the base on the top.

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:21.340
And we have the roofs.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.530
Close by to, to Salut
you have Bahla.

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.450
Bahla it goes-- the
area's occupation of Bahla

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:35.420
of the Bahla fort is
going to the [inaudible]

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:42.590
which is we are talking
about around 100 BC.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:46.170
The same technique until
now has been used in Oman

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:49.260
with mosques, with forts.

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:50.730
And this is the first time

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.930
that we discovered
in Arabian Peninsula.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:59.460
It has a kind of
[inaudible] influence.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.920
This is again, on
the top of Salut.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.680
That mean you have to climb

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:10.010
for half an hour just
to get [inaudible].

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:13.470
I'm, I'm going to close
my, my presentation

00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.940
with archeological parks
because we work hard,

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.630
we work very long,
very intensive.

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:22.430
We started with US
archeological park.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:27.720
And they made wonderful
study for us in the nineties.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.020
This is [inaudible].

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.120
It was discovered in 1989 then

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.920
with Trans Arabia,
with Professor-- .

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.370
Participated in the
excavation in those days.

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:46.170
And the Lost City of
Ubar as some people there

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.760
like to say, to call it.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:51.610
We call it one of the
station for the Land

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.270
of Frankincense Trade
because Land

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.960
of Frankincense Trade,
you have two routes.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.520
The sea routes come from Khawr
Ruri to [inaudible] and goes

00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.050
to the Red Sea all
the way to, to Greece.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:06.150
Or by road, I'm sorry,
by land, land routes goes

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.370
to [inaudible] to Shisur.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.770
And from Shisur go
to [inaudible]

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.920
in inside [inaudible] in
the [inaudible] quarter

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.100
and from there to the north.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.650
What's the important
of this site is water.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:24.790
Because [inaudible] trade
with, with the local for water.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.820
I will summarize
everything I said

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.260
in this eight film animation.

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.260
I hope you will like
it because this is part

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.240
of our interpretation in
the archeological park.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.680
We establish information
center, people can go.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:50.010
People can be informative,
not educated but informative.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:54.940
They can see what the sites
looks like, how it was,

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.130
and the long history
of the site.

00:32:57.130 --> 00:32:59.680
The long process.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:06.880
We spent something like more
than 25 years working in Shisur

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.140
from during the time
period from excavation,

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.870
analysis, restoration.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:17.440
And sometimes we have to get a
very professional company just

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.610
to-- we go back.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:22.960
Just to stabilize the cave.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.920
Because the cave was collapsing.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.250
The water level went down.

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:33.410
There was a-- and all
this area was collapsed.

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:36.490
So we have to stab--
to stabilize the cave,

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:38.930
otherwise we are going
to lose the site.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:41.560
This is the advantage to
be a World Heritage Site,

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:44.460
that you have to spend
a lot of money in size.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:48.130
And then later on you don't
know what to do with is.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:49.510
Can I have the light off?

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.030
Is possible?

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.530
Is not? Okay.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:34:00.060
I hope-- this is a film
summarize how wide the

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.530
[inaudible] plateau.

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.570
It's eight minutes.

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:07.240
I hope you have patience
for that.

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.870
&gt;&gt; Listen.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.530
Can't you hear it?

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:14.000
&gt;&gt; What should we hear, Grandpa?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.400
&gt;&gt; I cannot hear anything.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.380
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:23.030
Great stories are
born from silence.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.530
The fire makes us tell them,

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:28.990
and the stars turn
them into legends.

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:31.180
I have a story to tell you.

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.680
The story of how a garden
became sand and was split.

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:38.710
And how then after many
centuries has returned

00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:40.190
to unite and flourish.

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:41.490
&gt;&gt; Listen.

00:34:41.490 --> 00:34:42.790
It's [inaudible].

00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:46.830
&gt;&gt; A long time ago, Ubar
was a garden rich in water,

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:48.130
trees and [inaudible].

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:52.810
Travelers that saw it tell of
beautiful horses and gazelles.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:57.520
And big palm trees
with golden dates,

00:34:57.520 --> 00:35:00.800
where singing birds
chased each other.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.140
Water flew in great falls.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.290
And vast lakes extended

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:09.490
where now there is only
an expanse of desert.

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:12.260
Our ancestors lived
a simple life.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.550
Hunting and cultivating animals,

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.760
working with tools
made of stone.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.420
&gt;&gt; And then what happened?

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.530
&gt;&gt; Water began to run out.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.710
The rivers and the
lakes dried up.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:30.180
Our tradition speaks of a reason
for such dramatic climate change

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.380
in all of the Arabian Peninsula.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.790
It was the time of the of
[inaudible] to build landmarks

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:39.670
to indicate the right way

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.300
to the fresh water
springs of their people.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.450
They put up three upright stones
and a force to cover them.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:51.830
The cover was the sky,
and the upright stones,

00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:55.730
the pillars of the
earth, helping it stay up.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:36:00.040
The people of [inaudible] were
rich but refused to listen

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.380
to the message of the
righteous prophet [inaudible].

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:09.240
Instead of protecting the water,
the animals and the plants,

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.790
they became wicked, conceited,
tyrannical, and arrogant.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.740
The people of [inaudible]
became ungrateful

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:18.850
and misused the Almighty's
blessing.

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:22.060
The punishment came.

00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:26.590
Changing weather
stopped the cool rain.

00:36:26.590 --> 00:36:28.340
The green land became dry.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:32.420
The Almighty sent a
wind from the desert,

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.940
and nature was transformed.

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:37.250
For seven nights and eight days,

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.990
the wind blew hard
and relentlessly.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.910
Mountains were destroyed,
trees uprooted

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:48.710
as if they were grains of sand.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.510
And the people fell as if
they were the hollow trunks

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:55.140
of palm trees.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.330
Except for those who
believed in Prophet Hud.

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.330
Peace be upon him.

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.120
His tomb is located in
the Dhofar mountains.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.910
&gt;&gt; A sad end for them, and
a beginning for the desert.

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.660
&gt;&gt; Did everybody die?

00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:14.720
&gt;&gt; No, those faithful to Hud's
teachings were saved and moved

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.520
to the west, south, and north.

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.000
From Oman until [inaudible].

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.470
Do you recognize this?

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.040
We still use it.

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.970
&gt;&gt; A line in the sand.

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:27.270
A road.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:31.010
&gt;&gt; This is the road that linked
the south and north of Oman.

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:34.320
In the north of Oman,
there were other cities.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.320
Six thousand years ago, people
learned to live together,

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.450
to write, and to build.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:45.730
In Mesopotamia, Syria,
and Egypt, great realms

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.940
and empires were formed.

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:53.090
So Oman had a part to play
at the beginning of history.

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:54.730
&gt;&gt; And the water?

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:58.310
&gt;&gt; Our ancestors had to
face a dramatic situation.

00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:01.330
And search for water
where it was hiding.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.090
Underground.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.330
They dug wells and built canals.

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:08.230
&gt;&gt; The Aflaj?

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:10.730
&gt;&gt; The Aflaj.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.970
One of the most daring
engineering feats

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:15.290
of the ancient world.

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:19.130
The plain of Salut near
[inaudible] was irrigated

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:20.430
and rich.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.310
And then came the
time to defend it.

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:25.820
The Persians of [inaudible]
arrived

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:30.050
with a great army
accompanied by elephants.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:34.050
They stopped in front of
the small group of Arabs

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:37.880
at the [inaudible] led
by Prince [inaudible].

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:44.600
The prince tried to persuade
the Persians to live together,

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.830
to share water and pastures.

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:52.270
He said, "If you are willing
to give me a part of Oman,

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:58.290
I will settle in one area of the
country and be grateful to you.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:02.230
If you're not willing to accept,
I will stay against your will

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.480
and if you attack me,
I will attack you.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.660
And if I win, I will
kill your troops."

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:13.000
Al-Marzuban refused
[inaudible] proposal.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.330
&gt;&gt; Oh no!

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.910
&gt;&gt; And the Battle of
Salut was terrible.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.210
There was nothing to be heard

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:22.000
but arms clashing
and swords crossing.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.420
[Inaudible] was splendid
in his brownish-red tunic

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:28.420
and a yellow turban on his head.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.420
That day nothing could stop him.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:34.000
He killed Al-Marzuban.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.290
And the Persians turned back.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.770
&gt;&gt; Yes! Great [inaudible].

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:41.450
&gt;&gt; Now, in this peaceful
evening,

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:46.330
we are on the other side of the
ridge between Salut and Wubar.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.930
&gt;&gt; Wubar, the door
to the desert.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:50.970
The city of scent.

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.590
The [inaudible] of
all delicacies.

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:56.080
Wubar, wealthy Wubar.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.570
&gt;&gt; Why wealthy, Grandpa?

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:01.400
&gt;&gt; Because of the resin
of the frankincense tree

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.260
that was worth its
weight in gold.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.810
It came from Wadi [inaudible]
from the [inaudible].

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:11.650
From Wadi [inaudible] and
had to pass through Wubar.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:16.440
Here the caravans stopped
in search of rest and water.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.730
Wubar's walls were erected
above an immense cavern.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:24.520
And among those empty
walls resounded the echo

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.600
of a thousand idioms, music,

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.530
and stories from the
edges of the world.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:37.970
Traders from India and the
coast, traders from the desert.

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:42.400
Until the desert
swallowed the city,

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.350
making it the lost
city of Wubar.

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:48.000
&gt;&gt; And this is the
end of the story?

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.180
&gt;&gt; Stories admonish and
teach, but they never end.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:57.890
They flow like the past towards
the future and feed the present.

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:01.100
You are too young to
remember Oman before the time

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.480
of Sultan Qaboos bin Said.

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.420
There were no streets,
no schools,

00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:08.100
no electricity, and
no hospitals.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.790
Then he came, a young man
full of new ideas and hope

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:14.260
who had traveled
around the world.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.880
A man of great credibility,
perseverance.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:23.830
A great leader listens and
does not just instruct.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:25.750
And this is just what he did.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.560
He listened to everyone.

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.560
To those who believed
in tradition,

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:33.020
and those who believed
in change.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:37.720
In doing so, he led us on a
path that both honest tradition

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.530
and our people's legacy
but also forges ahead

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.000
with Oman's renaissance
and progress.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.980
Thanks to him, and ordinary
Omani men and women,

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:49.730
our country is now
prosperous and advanced.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:52.050
And our lives became easier.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:56.180
During his reign, many lost
cities hidden under the ground,

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.480
[inaudible], Salut, [inaudible]

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:01.370
and others were discovered
and excavated.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:05.730
Bringing us full circle
with our ancient past.

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:09.240
&gt;&gt; It's the ancient garden.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.540
&gt;&gt; Better.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.620
&gt;&gt; A new garden within
the desert.

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:16.540
&gt;&gt; Remember this hand of stories
and let them be your strength.

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.790
Be always united
and understanding

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:21.230
and you will maintain, with
the help of the Almighty,

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:25.510
a country safe in your future.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:35.510
[ Music ]

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.900
[ Applause ]

00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.350
&gt;&gt; Dr. Said bin Nasser Alsalmi:
Actually, I have two option.

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:44.080
Either to put this in at the
beginning and [inaudible] all

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.510
of you just to listen to me.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.870
Or to leave it at the end.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:50.670
Thank you very much.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:58.230
[ Applause ]

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:05.230
&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: If there are
questions, please ask them and,

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:09.250
and if not, we'll
take a little break.

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:13.370
Just for a few minutes.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.290
Refill your cups,
take some food.

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.770
And then we start
with the first panel.

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.070
So thank you, Dr. Said.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.590
That was very exciting,
thrilling,

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.520
and thank you so much.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:30.100
I will begin now by introducing
Dr. Kimberly Williams,

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.680
an Associate Professor

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:36.650
of Anthropology at
Temple University.

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:40.600
Dr. Williams is a
mortuary archeologist,

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.360
archeologist, bio archaeologist.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:47.680
Whose current research is
focused on the mortuary

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:52.290
and landscape archeology
of Southeastern Arabia.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:54.380
Her work focuses on questions

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.680
about prehistoric
mortuary ritual,

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.130
funeral landscape
information [inaudible],

00:44:00.130 --> 00:44:03.190
interred material culture,

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:07.870
and archeological
human skeletal remains.

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:11.920
All recovered through
survey and excavation.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.550
Dr. Kimberly leads ongoing
work in [inaudible] Oman.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.380
And she collaborates
with archeologists

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.390
from Sultan Qaboos University
at the Bronze Age site

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:26.270
of Dahwa in northern Oman.

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:28.450
Which is located
close to the coast

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.410
and sea ports at
Saham and Sohar.

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:33.920
North of the [inaudible]
Mountains.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.260
Dr. Williams holds a
PhD in anthropology

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:40.990
from the Ohio State University.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.510
So Dr. Williams?

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:50.450
[ Applause ]

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Kimberly D
Williams: Good morning.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.690
Thank you for the [inaudible].

00:44:55.690 --> 00:45:00.230
Closer? So this morning,
I'm going to be talking

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:01.790
about the site of Dahwa located

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:03.960
on the Batinah coast,
northern Oman.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.850
I first want to thank,
of course, my colleagues

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:10.670
who are not here but who
I rely on very heavily

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:14.220
and who I collaborate
with on this project.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:19.800
First, Dr. [inaudible] who is
the director of this project.

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.250
And Dr. Khaled Douglas
who's the head of archeology

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:25.980
at Sultan Qaboos University.

00:45:27.070 --> 00:45:32.790
So Dahwa is located
approximately 24 kilometers

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:35.600
from the coast, on
the Batinah Coast.

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:38.920
It's close to the seaports
of Saham and Sohar.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.780
You can see here, I
think that this is-- .

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:47.040
[Inaudible] It doesn't
do that, okay.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.540
So you can see Dahwa
here, thank you.

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:54.440
You can see Dahwa
here in the red box.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:59.590
I want to start by showing you
a few slides from a presentation

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:00.890
that we gave two weeks ago.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:05.630
We were lucky to present two
papers in Munich two weeks ago.

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:07.060
My colleagues and I.

00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.030
The first paper was on
the settlement itself.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:13.830
And so I can't really speak
about the mortuary rituals

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:16.260
until I give you a little
background on the, on the site.

00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.720
So I borrowed some slides

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:23.290
from my colleague's
presentation to show you here.

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:27.710
So the Dahwa sites are
divided for convenience sake

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:31.620
into five sites, as
you can see here.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.760
DH1, DH5, DH6, DH7, and DH8.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.230
We've divided it this
way out of convenience.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.840
There is a modern road that
comes through the site.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:45.810
There are farms, and there's a
wadi system that runs through.

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.880
For the purposes of
this talk though,

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:52.150
the mortuary rituals
apply to the entire site.

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:59.500
My colleagues two weeks ago
focused on the remains at DH1,

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.250
so you can see that here.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:05.440
This is the first part of the
site that we've excavated.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.660
Overall there's about
65 [inaudible] buildings

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:09.960
at the site.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.610
At DH1 there are 17.

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:16.330
Importantly at all of the Dahwa
sites, there are no towers,

00:47:16.330 --> 00:47:19.210
and this makes the Dahwa
sites very interesting

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.540
because that's not typical.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:27.680
All of the buildings are made
of rough-hewn local stone.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.200
So just to give you a quick
view of the excavation

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.500
of one of the buildings.

00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:37.820
The plan, and the-- to give
you an idea of what it looks

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.810
like afterwards, this is
the largest building at DH1.

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:47.460
This is a building called S-10.

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:54.030
We've come up with a preliminary
chronology of use of the site.

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:57.270
And so today we'll focus
on the [inaudible] Period

00:47:57.270 --> 00:48:00.860
which runs roughly
2700 or 2500 BC.

00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:05.540
To about 2000 BC.

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:09.190
The site is clearly used
for copper smelting.

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.950
And there's an agricultural
component as well.

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.020
We have lots of good evidence.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:18.840
We have these burned
palm date stones.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.160
This is pretty typical
of inland sites.

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.270
We've used these for C14 dating
and also to infer aspects

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:27.160
of the agricultural
nature of the site.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:32.710
To remind you of how close
the site is to the coast,

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.680
this diagram I think
does a nice job

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:37.340
to show you how close it
is to the, to the sea.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.450
So you would imagine that we
would have a lot of interaction

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:43.960
with other cultures and
with the coast itself.

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.810
We can see this by the
many different types

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:49.320
of shells from the site.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.900
We have large amount of
evidence on the surface

00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.080
of slag crushing mortars
from copper processing.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.470
And fragments of
furnace wall lining.

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:03.020
Now, we've picked up hundreds
of these from the surface.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.930
They're-- if you visit the site,
there's still hundreds more.

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:10.610
This is a very intensively used
site for copper production.

00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:13.680
And of course the mortars.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.250
Many pieces of copper
by-products on the surface.

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:21.960
It's essentially carpeted by
evidence of copper smelting.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.670
And some more here.

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.770
So many Archeologists argue
that copper production

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:30.980
in [inaudible] was
exported outside the region

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:34.950
and not used as much locally.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:37.870
At the site of DH1,
and the other sites

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:41.710
which we have not published or
presented on extensively yet.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.470
There's very little copper.

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.420
Some archeologists also argue

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:48.550
that copper objects
were precious

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.090
and so people may have been
taking them and melting them

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:52.730
down and reusing them.

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.090
However, you would still expect

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:58.360
to see some copper
objects at any given site.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.660
We see very few.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:03.660
This hook you see is the single
bronze object that we've seen

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:06.960
in all the Dahwa sites
which are quite large.

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.780
Also in the tombs which
I will now talk about,

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:12.590
we see very few copper objects.

00:50:12.590 --> 00:50:15.210
So our big question as a team is

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:18.380
where did the top--
the copper go?

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.390
Quickly I want to
also show you evidence

00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:21.730
of inter-regional trade.

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:25.360
There's a large amount of Indus
ceramics found on the surface

00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:28.580
and in excavation at Dahwa.

00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.150
In particular, there's
an extremely large number

00:50:31.150 --> 00:50:33.300
of black-slipped jars.

00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:35.760
We're not sure what was
transported in these jars

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.770
but there's a very large number.

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:41.160
And so we can see there
was intensive trade.

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.900
More than 85% of
the Indus ceramics

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.630
at DH1 were black-slipped jars.

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:51.680
Here's a photograph
of a restorable jar.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:55.160
And this graphic that my
colleague Khaled put together

00:50:55.160 --> 00:51:00.260
showing the building of S.10 and
showing all of the jars in the--

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:04.280
Indus black-slipped jars that
we found inside the building.

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.860
Of course they're
not whole any longer.

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.970
They're broken, but
they're restorable and all

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:09.690
of the pieces were there.

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:12.630
We're, we're looking at this
as potentially some evidence

00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:15.850
that they were storing
items there.

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:17.360
So onto the tombs.

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.110
First I want to give a
very brief introduction

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:24.260
to the period preceding the Umm
an-Nar Period, the Hafit Period.

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.450
Early Bronze Age.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:32.600
During this time, it is, on
the hills all throughout Oman,

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.450
you see stone cairn
tombs, tower tombs.

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:38.750
They're on high places.

00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:40.550
There's hundreds of thousands

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:43.110
of them all throughout
the Omani landscape.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:46.580
And here you can see evidence
in one of the sites where I work

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.380
of the many, many
tombs on the hills.

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.090
You might find one
person inside.

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:52.670
You might find a
few people inside.

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:57.250
But primarily they're
small-scale use.

00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:00.650
Another image of a site I work
at, Al-[inaudible] near Dhank.

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:05.540
And of course the very
famous [inaudible] tombs

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.350
which are of the same type.

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:11.900
My work has primarily focused
on trying to find evidence

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:14.840
of a transition between
Hafit type cairns

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.230
and Umm an-Nar tombs.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:21.430
The Umm an-Nar Period is known
for its beautiful communal,

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:24.800
finely-built tombs that
are located in settlements

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.150
or adjacent to settlements
rather than on the hills.

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:34.630
So today, I will tell you about
one of the tombs at Dahwa.

00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:38.040
We have two Umm an-Nar
tombs at Dahwa.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:40.600
One is small and heavily robbed.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.730
And the other is large and
completely undisturbed.

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:50.500
To give you another view of the
site, you can see here this,

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:57.450
right here is the tomb that
I will be talking about.

00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:00.400
This is the site
of the other tomb.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.700
And this is DH1.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:06.500
All of this area also in the
wadi was used by the site,

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.800
by the inhabitants of the site.

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:13.340
So this is tomb one
at Dahwa seven.

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.130
This is after the clearance
of debris over the tomb

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:18.150
and prior to excavation.

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:21.450
You can see a large
number of wadi cobbles

00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:24.380
that were on top of the tomb.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:27.720
After one year, we
excavated the first chamber

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:31.100
that you can see
here on the left.

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.880
I think that's your left.

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:36.370
And most of the white
ashlar stones

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:38.850
that would face these
tombs that you would see

00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:41.690
from a distance were,
were robbed.

00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:43.340
And this is very, very common.

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.900
But there are some
examples of lines of tombs,

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:51.090
of stones that are still in C.2
in the sense that they're still

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:52.830
in alignment, but
they're pushed forward.

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:56.420
And this is one of
those lines of stones.

00:53:56.420 --> 00:54:00.360
Another exciting find for this
tomb is this carved relief.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.150
These are known in
other Umm an-Nar tombs,

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:03.450
but they're not very common.

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:05.340
We don't understand
what it means.

00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:06.790
We don't know if this
person is walking

00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:08.490
from us, walking towards us.

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:12.670
We don't understand
what it symbolizes.

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:16.920
So continuing with
the excavation,

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.400
the end of the first year,
we're approximately here.

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:24.390
And we know that the
tomb has six chambers.

00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:26.670
It has a central corridor

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:28.830
that allows communication
between the chambers.

00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:30.590
And this is extremely important.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.770
I will discuss the importance
of this in a min, in a moment.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:37.230
I won't bore you with
all of these dimensions.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:40.510
Move on. The, the
chambers are subterranean

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:44.170
as most Umm an-Nar tombs are.

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:45.990
There is a good parallel

00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:49.050
with [inaudible]
however the difference is

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:52.410
that [inaudible] we
have six chambers.

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:56.470
And here we, we assume
we have eight chambers.

00:54:56.470 --> 00:55:01.770
This of course is a trench that
disturbed part of the tomb.

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:04.000
Very preliminary
analysis of tomb one

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.940
because analysis will
be ongoing this summer.

00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:12.170
There are hundreds of skeletal
fragments inside just the single

00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:14.950
chamber that has
been excavated fully.

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:17.670
Everything is comingled
and fragmented.

00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:21.850
So this means it's mixed up
and broken into many pieces.

00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:24.300
It's in poor condition,
and in some cases,

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.310
in excellent conditions,
so a real mix.

00:55:27.310 --> 00:55:29.860
I can see evidence of
burning of the bone

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:31.160
and cutting of the bone.

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.740
And again, this will
be important

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:34.130
in a, in a few moments.

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:38.020
A large number of
archeologically complete ceramic

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:39.990
and soft stone vessels
were recovered.

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:45.800
And I want to highlight
the material culture here.

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:50.630
We found only this much
bronze so far in the tomb.

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:53.720
So like the settlement, we're
finding extremely small amounts.

00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:56.630
And these are not large objects.

00:55:56.630 --> 00:56:00.860
These are very small,
probably related to clothing

00:56:00.860 --> 00:56:03.180
or some sort of fastener.

00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.530
Moving on, I wanted to show
you this soft stone vessel

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.670
that we found which is unique.

00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:13.590
This type of soft stone
vessel itself is not unique.

00:56:13.590 --> 00:56:15.130
The lines, the circle dot.

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:17.220
That's very typical
of the an-Nar Period.

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:19.440
What is interesting
is the carving

00:56:19.440 --> 00:56:22.080
of this animal right here.

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.380
I have two views of it.

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:26.670
I can't tell you more about it
because I don't know what it is,

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:28.790
where it's from, why it's here.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:30.270
But I'd like to show
that to people

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:32.580
in case someone might
have an opinion.

00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:36.070
Might see something I can't see.

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:38.490
Moving on, at the end
of the first season,

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:39.990
clearing the outside
of the tomb.

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:45.490
I noticed a bone pit that had
been ex-- dug next to the tomb.

00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:47.920
These are known throughout
the Oman peninsula,

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.670
but not well understood.

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:52.910
Only maybe three or four
have been published.

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:57.930
So finding this was
very exciting.

00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:00.920
Here's an up-close view
of what the bone pit looks

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:02.220
like on the surface.

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:05.370
Lots of broken, burned
fragmented bones,

00:57:05.370 --> 00:57:08.940
ceramic soft stone, et cetera.

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.240
A close-up.

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.540
You can see here.

00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:16.290
I'm going to stand up
again, burned bone here

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:19.860
and here and here and here.

00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:23.270
So we can see evidence
of some type

00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:24.740
of burning event that happened.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:29.650
This is just what we saw when
we first uncovered the bone pit.

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:32.750
At the end of the season, I
was faced with a big problem.

00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:37.760
In maybe March, April, there was
going to be pretty heavy rains.

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.750
And this tomb is located at
a unique position on a hill.

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:44.780
It's not the only Umm an-Nar
tomb that's known to be

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:47.710
on a slope, but it's rare.

00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:51.760
And I was very concerned that
the tomb would slide off.

00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:55.150
Or the bone pit material
would slide off of the hill.

00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:58.870
So what we decided to do
was to dig a drainage ditch

00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:01.140
around the tomb to protect it.

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:02.670
Or to try to protect it.

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:05.620
So this is a photograph of that.

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:11.070
We also dug a profile of the
southernmost part of the trench.

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:16.700
You can see here that the bone
pit it cut into the bedrock.

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:18.100
It's not a stone structure.

00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:20.040
It was cut into the ground.

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:24.270
And here is a picture
of the profile,

00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:26.180
a close-up picture
of the profile.

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.960
And from this, I can tell that
there were several periods

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:31.250
of use of this bone pit.

00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:32.900
And this is a unique finding

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:37.100
because while many people have
supposed this has happened.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:41.580
And there's evidence of much
later reuse of bone pits,

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.880
it's been very challenging

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:46.140
to document how many
times these pits are used.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:53.730
And why. So I was able to
identify five [inaudible].

00:58:53.730 --> 00:58:56.460
And so the next year
we came back out

00:58:56.460 --> 00:58:58.600
and laid a grid overtop
of the bone pit.

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.530
And excavated the
entire thing with brushes

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:03.760
so that we wouldn't
break anything.

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.280
And so we could observe all
the potential articulations

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.810
of human bone.

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:12.680
This is the final product.

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:14.680
The final product.

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.600
And what I can tell you from
a preliminary reconstruction

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:20.010
of the, of the cremation events.

00:59:20.010 --> 00:59:22.900
This was not a funeral pyre.

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:26.130
We know that there were at
least two centers of burning.

00:59:26.130 --> 00:59:30.060
And at least two
different depths.

00:59:30.060 --> 00:59:38.870
So quickly, remember
Locus 002 and Locus 004.

00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:40.240
So at two different depths,

00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.920
we know there were
multiple periods of burning.

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.370
We know there were
multiple burning events.

00:59:45.370 --> 00:59:48.590
And what we can say is the
burning events were very hot

00:59:48.590 --> 00:59:50.070
in the center.

00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:52.440
But that these were not
events that were meant

00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:55.570
to destroy the bone,
to reduce it to ashes.

00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:59.860
But rather my interpretation is
that it was symbolic burning.

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:03.100
The flames would reach out
and touch the other bones.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.560
Smoke, some of the bone,
other bone, if you will.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.150
But it did not destroy the bone.

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:11.870
So this is evidence of
small-scale ritual burning

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:14.880
at multiple times
in, in the bone pit.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.340
This is important because many
people interpret these bone pits

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.020
as a, a maintenance
of the Umm an-Nar tomb

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:24.610
where the Umm an-Nar tomb
is used until it is full.

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:28.440
A pit is dug, people are
emptied out to clean the tomb.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.520
And this is just a, a
garbage, essentially.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:34.150
But my interpretation of this is

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:39.870
that this is actually the final
portion of the burial ritual.

01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:44.230
So a very quick preliminary
inventory of the bone pit.

01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:47.840
Important points are
that there's no evidence

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.680
of primary interments
which is different

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.010
from for example sites
at like [inaudible].

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:55.890
There's no evidence
or any articulations.

01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:59.360
So no one was put into
this pit until well

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.680
after the mortuary
ritual had been finished.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.580
The same type of archeological
assemblage with regard

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:11.250
to ceramics and soft stone
is witnessed as you would see

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.890
in any other Umm an-Nar site.

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.580
Very important though.

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:18.720
Only six beads were
recovered from this bone pit.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:22.770
And by comparison, every other
bone pit and Umm an-Nar tomb

01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:26.110
that is knowns has
thousands of beads.

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:30.650
So six beads is extremely
unusual.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:34.270
We also have only these
two pieces of bronze.

01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:38.830
So again, no bronze or
copper fragments at all.

01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:43.260
We did have one unknown metal
ring and three bronze rings.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:48.550
Which is of extremely
large-- small number as well.

01:01:48.550 --> 01:01:52.380
These soft stone
as evidenced here.

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.380
The ceramic.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.260
These are all typical,
locally produced,

01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.970
and some imported materials.

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:05.200
So quickly, we know
from the settlement

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:08.450
that regional international
trade relationships between Oman

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:12.640
and the Indus were
happening at this site.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.820
This intense-- this
exchange intensified

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:21.520
and we have dated the peak of
this exchange to the first half

01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.020
of the Umm an-Nar Period
through radiocarbon dating

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.380
and the quantity of Indus
ceramics on the ground.

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:32.000
But is this visible in the
mortuary archeology record?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.080
Quickly I want to show you
some preliminary analyses

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.410
of the ceramics found.

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:41.910
We have evidence of imported
or imported-like ceramics

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:44.790
from both the bone
pit and the tomb.

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:46.990
Some scholars suggest
that some of these types

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:50.300
of ceramics were
produced for the ex--

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:54.260
for export to the Oman
peninsula and maybe elsewhere.

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:57.710
These may be examples of that.

01:02:57.710 --> 01:03:00.760
We have other evidence
of imported

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.220
or imported-like ceramics.

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:06.020
Perhaps that are, have a
stronger, stronger evidence

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:09.520
for imports that are
not specifically made

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.940
for the exporting process.

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.970
And we're very excited.

01:03:14.970 --> 01:03:20.010
We have also found this
inscribed ceramic sherd

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:22.310
from inside the bone
pit in a secure context,

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:24.660
about 30 centimeters down.

01:03:24.660 --> 01:03:27.070
So it's not surface debris.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:31.410
And it has an Indus
inscription here.

01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:34.460
The question is, is
this an Indus ceramic?

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:37.780
Is this something that came
from Indus and was treated?

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:41.550
Or is it something that was
locally produced by people

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:43.390
who were familiar
with Indus script

01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:46.950
and so it wasn't made locally.

01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:48.380
Here is a comparison

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:52.190
with a well-known
sherd from [inaudible].

01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:55.410
So again, there's
a large quantity

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:58.220
of copper produced
at these sites.

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:00.980
But there's one bronze
hook found

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:03.130
in the entirety of
the Dahwa sites.

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:07.170
And extremely small amounts
found inside of the tomb.

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:10.490
So where did it go?

01:04:10.490 --> 01:04:12.560
We don't have the answer
to this question yet.

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.860
But I want to think about this

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:16.930
from the context
of mortuary ritual.

01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:20.980
What I can tell you is that Umm
an-Nar mortuary rituals here

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.490
demonstrate and elsewhere
demonstrate that there's a shift

01:04:24.490 --> 01:04:28.990
in how ancient people viewed the
importance of the body in death.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:30.840
No longer are people
putting people,

01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:33.780
their deceased loved ones
in tombs on high places

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.670
on mountains and
leaving them there.

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:38.180
But instead they
are putting them

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.980
into these large communal tombs

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:43.650
that are central
to the settlement.

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:46.500
It implies a reorganization
of the space where the living

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.080
and the memory of
the dead interact.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.910
I would argue that this is a
culmination of the development

01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:56.490
of ancestor reverence.

01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:59.890
Which began in the
preceding Hafit Period.

01:04:59.890 --> 01:05:04.050
There's a repeated perceptual
interaction with the dead.

01:05:04.050 --> 01:05:07.890
Whereby the body is reduced to
smaller and smaller fragments,

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:10.890
sometimes resulting in the
final placement of the dead

01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:14.170
in what we would consider
an invisible bone pit.

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:16.970
Which has no standing
structure to be seen from the,

01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:19.190
from the, from anywhere.

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:24.300
Which reinforces the importance
of a common ancestral identity.

01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:30.420
Quickly, what, what Umm an-Nar
mortuary rituals imply is

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:34.610
that you have the construction
of a monumental circular tomb.

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:37.810
You need to make a decision
about stone-crafting.

01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.160
Division of chambers.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:43.030
Will it be a single story or
will it be a two-story unit?

01:05:43.030 --> 01:05:45.110
Will you have a carved relief?

01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:47.900
Next you're inhuming
a body or bodies.

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:49.420
Where are you going
to place the body?

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.790
How are you going
to place the body?

01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:53.090
You need to make a decision

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:57.100
about the material culture
you will inter with that body.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.810
Next there's a manipulation
of the body

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:00.220
in the Umm an-Nar Period.

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:02.620
Sometimes bodies
are pushed aside.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:06.340
Sometimes skeletons are
organized by skeletal element.

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:09.120
Sometimes they're moved
into a new chamber.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.080
And at some point,
the bond is cut.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:17.120
Next inside the Umm an-Nar tomb,
occasionally or always, perhaps,

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:20.320
there's burning of the bone,
symbolic burning not meant

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.340
to cremate the bone into ashes.

01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:26.520
Next there's transferal of
the bones into a bone pit

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.990
and the deposit, I would argue,

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:32.840
of new mortuary goods
in that bone pit.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:39.460
And this process is finished
with the ritual burning on top.

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:44.540
This shows you the sort of
place of Dahwa with regard

01:06:44.540 --> 01:06:47.960
to other known Umm an-Nar
tombs and bone pits.

01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:50.390
Nothing it known about
the Batinah, so this is a,

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:54.110
a new contribution
from that regard.

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:58.070
It, just to remind you
of the interaction,

01:06:58.070 --> 01:07:01.300
the trade interaction between
Indus and Oman peninsula.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:03.780
And quickly, I'll summarize

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:07.760
by saying the preliminary
implications for Dahwa are

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.810
that despite intensive
trade and interaction

01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:12.820
with foreign goods and culture.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:16.360
There's an, a maintenance of
an important processual ritual

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.190
which perhaps could
be interpreted

01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:21.830
as the most important ritual
that a society partakes in.

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:25.040
How it's to handle their dead.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:28.540
But possibly, even
though this, this,

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:32.470
this ritual is maintained
despite very heavy interaction

01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:35.040
with Indus people.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:36.800
The, there's just one
modification to it,

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.560
and that is reduction in the
interment of material wealth

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:42.740
which is more in keeping
with the Indus practice

01:07:42.740 --> 01:07:45.430
of interment of the dead.

01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:47.890
But this speaks to the
strength of count--

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:50.740
or cultural continuity
on the Oman peninsula,

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:55.550
across the Oman peninsula
during the Umm an-Nar Period.

01:07:55.550 --> 01:08:00.610
I want to thank everybody
and, and I apologize

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:02.180
for misspelling Mark's name.

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.510
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:14.370
[ Applause ]

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:16.310
Thank you.

01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:23.960
Thank you so much for
your presentation.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.110
And I feel I'm, I've
learned a great deal.

01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:36.630
Now the second presentation is
going to be made by two people.

01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:37.930
It's Surveying [inaudible].

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:44.040
A re-examination of the Bronze
Age that occurred [inaudible].

01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.370
And-- .

01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:52.730
The two speakers will
include Dr. Zenobi Garrett

01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:54.770
who is currently
a visiting scholar

01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:58.080
in New York University's
Department of Anthropology

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.090
as a landscape archeologist
[inaudible] explores how past

01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:04.850
groups organized themselves

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:07.900
and perceived the
landscape around them.

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:12.220
She has worked in Peru,
Ireland, France, Oman,

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.940
and the US to explore
the wide variety

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:19.380
of living options
available to humans.

01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:21.400
And the unique social
environment

01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.650
and challenges involved
in the maintenance

01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:28.110
of wherever people call home.

01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:30.930
In addition to her teaching
duties, she has participated

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:36.230
in both digital and hands-on
outreach projects designed

01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:40.140
to engage the public in
a media-friendly manner.

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:43.390
Dr. Garrett obtained
her PhD in anthropology

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.130
at New York University.

01:09:45.130 --> 01:09:50.260
I will also introduce her
partner in the presentation.

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:56.760
Eli Dollarhide is a PhD
candidate in anthropology

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.940
at New York University.

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:01.400
He's doctoral research focuses

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:06.100
on mapping socioeconomic
landscapes across settlements

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:11.660
in Bronze Age Oman by
utilizing geospatial techniques

01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.140
and ceramic analysis.

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:18.020
Since 2013, he has
completed [inaudible] work

01:10:18.020 --> 01:10:21.010
at the UNESCO World
Heritage site of Bat, Oman.

01:10:21.010 --> 01:10:26.000
And the adjacent
archeological remains

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.140
at [inaudible] including
leading the recent mapping

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.440
[inaudible] survey.

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:38.810
His research has been supported
by the Digital Globe Foundation,

01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:42.730
the National Geographic
Society, the British Foundation

01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:44.650
for the Study of Arabia.

01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:49.040
And the Center for the Study
of Human Origin at NYU.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:53.040
Outside of Oman, Mr.
Dollarhide has participated

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:58.390
in archeological research
projects in Iraqi Kurdistan,

01:10:58.390 --> 01:11:01.830
Azerbaijan, England,
and Virginia.

01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:06.800
Mr. Dollarhide holds a BA from
the College of William and Mary

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.380
and an MA in that field
from New York University.

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.510
So that's welcome both speakers.

01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:19.260
[ Applause ]

01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:20.560
&gt;&gt; Eli Dollarhide: Well,
thank you very much

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.060
for that kind introduction.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:25.070
And also to the conference
organizers and our hosts.

01:11:25.070 --> 01:11:28.510
And what an inspiring room
to be speaking in today.

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:31.590
So we prepared some written
remarks, and I think we're going

01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:35.040
to try and stick to them in
an effort to keep to time.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:38.290
But we look forward to your
comments and questions I think

01:11:38.290 --> 01:11:41.350
which we'll have time for
after the panel's complete.

01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:43.080
So with that, let's dig in.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:46.850
We often think about
globalization

01:11:46.850 --> 01:11:49.830
as a phenomenon unique
to the modern world.

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:51.620
Archeological evidence, however,

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:55.190
and texts from the third
millennium BC Middle East show

01:11:55.190 --> 01:11:57.580
us that long-distance
exchange of goods

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:00.850
and ideas has a much
deeper history.

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:03.390
One of the first archeologists
to explore the role

01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:06.740
of ancient Oman and
Southeastern Arabia more broadly

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:10.000
in this interconnective world
was the British Pre-historian

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.810
Beatrice De Cardi.

01:12:11.810 --> 01:12:15.270
Much of her research focused
on the interior of Oman

01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:17.930
and the modern Ad
Dhahirah governorate.

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:20.740
As part of the larger
archeological survey project

01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:23.990
centered around the UNESCO
World Heritage Site of Bat,

01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:26.890
we revisited one of De Cardi's
most prominent archeological

01:12:26.890 --> 01:12:29.300
sites [inaudible] last year.

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:32.660
So in our time today, we'd like
to take you all on a quick visit

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:36.160
to [inaudible] and reevaluate
the site's significance in light

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:40.300
of the past 50 years of
archeological research in Oman.

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.420
First however, I think
we need a little bit

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:44.050
of background information.

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:48.090
So the mid [inaudible] BC,
also known as the Bronze Age,

01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:50.910
was a period of intensifying
regional interaction

01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:52.910
across the ancient Near East.

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.000
This map offers one
potential view

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.430
of how the region might have
looked during this time.

01:12:57.430 --> 01:13:00.220
With territories labeled either
by the names given to them

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.850
in Sumerian cuneiform
texts from Mesopotamia.

01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:05.980
Or the names used by
archeologists to refer

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:08.430
to particular material cultures.

01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:09.970
Importantly, this period is

01:13:09.970 --> 01:13:12.520
when the first cities
appear in Mesopotamia.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.090
The Indus Valley
shown here as Maluhat,

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:17.700
and Southwest Iran are Elam.

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.490
This time period also saw
the development of new types

01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:24.110
of social organization in Oman
and the United Arab Emirates.

01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:27.470
In Bahrain, shown here with
its Sumerian name, Dilmun.

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:30.070
And its settlements along
the [inaudible] River Valley

01:13:30.070 --> 01:13:33.040
in Iran shown here as Marhashi.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:36.110
These broad-sweeping changes
helped foster the movement

01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:39.540
of materials across an
increasingly broad geographic

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.840
and cultural area.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.710
So we know about Oman's role

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:47.490
in this ancient Middle
Eastern world

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:51.210
through both cuneiform texts
and archeological research.

01:13:51.210 --> 01:13:53.010
The ancient texts
written by scribes

01:13:53.010 --> 01:13:56.020
in Mesopotamia an example
of which you can see here

01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:58.220
on a tablet from
the British Museum,

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:01.960
record both trade transactions
and military exploits.

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:03.440
And referred in Northern Oman

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:06.430
and the UAE as the
Land of Magan.

01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:08.900
Two Akkadian emperors,
Manishtusu

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:12.200
and his son Naram-Sin,
also shown here,

01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.150
claimed to have launched
campaigns

01:14:14.150 --> 01:14:19.110
against Southeastern Arabia,
defeating the 32 Lords of Magan.

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:21.010
Another text references
a governor

01:14:21.010 --> 01:14:22.920
of Magan named [inaudible]

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.430
which further demonstrates
the intense interests

01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:28.080
of Mesopotamian elites
in this area.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.830
Though historical bias and a
tendency for Mesopotamian rulers

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:33.700
to stretch the limits of truth,

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:38.230
cautions us against interpreting
these records literally.

01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:41.510
Other texts and artifactual
analyses further tell us

01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:44.470
that copper was exported
from Oman to Mesopotamia

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:48.270
on a large scale at least
as early as 3100 BC.

01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:50.590
Slightly later the
dark stone, diorite,

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:54.110
was also an important export
from Oman into Mesopotamia.

01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:57.640
Where it was often shaped
into statues of rulers.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:15:00.270
Likewise, the people of
Magan were actively involved

01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:04.070
in exchanges with other groups
across the ancient gulf region.

01:15:04.070 --> 01:15:07.800
Ceramics, weights, beads,
beads and other objects

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.760
of personal ornamentation along
with a host of other goods

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:13.110
from the Indus Valley
are common artifacts

01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:15.300
at archeological
sites across Oman.

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.050
And I'm sure we'll hear
more about this shortly

01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:19.310
from Professor Kenoya.

01:15:19.310 --> 01:15:21.850
Ancient Magan also had
a close relationship

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:25.150
with southeastern Iran as
demonstrated by similarities

01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:27.840
in ceramic technology
between the two regions.

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:30.470
And the presence of
stone vessels from Iran

01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:32.830
in many Umm an-Nar Period tombs.

01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:38.810
So to zoom in a little closer,
our area of interest centers

01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:42.440
around the UNESCO World
Heritage Site of Bat and Amlah.

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.520
So what do we know
about ancient life

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.890
within this region specifically?

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:51.850
The chronology of early Bronze
Age Oman is defined mostly

01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:55.020
by ceramic typologies and
shifts in mortuary practice.

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:57.900
Like we just heard about
from Professor Kim Williams.

01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:01.470
So there are two time periods
that are culturally contiguous:

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:05.820
the Hafit and Umm an-Nar which
run from 3100 to 2800 BC,

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:11.100
and 2800 to 2000 BC via
the chronology from Bat.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.100
The settlements in the interior
of Oman were generally based

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.860
around oasis environments.

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.990
And evidence from several sites
including [inaudible] eight

01:16:18.990 --> 01:16:22.300
and Bat itself suggests
a subsistence toolkit

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.030
that included the
cultivation of dates

01:16:24.030 --> 01:16:26.890
and perhaps some grains as well.

01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:29.660
Most settlements are best
characterized as small towns

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:32.350
and villages, and they're
typically anchored by one

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:35.310
or more monumental stone
or mud brick towers.

01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:37.770
Bat itself which I know we're
looking forward to hearing more

01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:41.800
about this afternoon, is home to
at least seven of these towers.

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:44.520
The function of these
raised platforms which run

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.840
up to nearly 40 meters

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.610
in diameter remain
somewhat mysterious.

01:16:48.610 --> 01:16:50.650
Although analogies have
been drawn between them

01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:55.000
and the medieval forts common
across Oman's landscape today.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:56.480
Tombs like those
we've just heard

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:59.440
about in Dahwa form
another major context

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.290
for the region's Bronze Age.

01:17:01.290 --> 01:17:03.520
Hundreds of these
monuments from the Hafit

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.820
and the larger structures

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.830
from the Umm an-Nar Period
dot the landscape around Bat

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:11.070
and its surrounding settlements.

01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:13.050
So one of the first
archeologists

01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:14.350
to explore these tombs

01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:16.630
and settlements was
Beatrice De Cardi.

01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:19.050
In addition to being a
champion of the pre-history

01:17:19.050 --> 01:17:21.770
of the Lower Gulf, through her
work at the British Foundation

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.280
for the Study of Arabia.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.380
De Cardi was also an
active field archeologist.

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:29.360
Her expeditions to the Middle
East were largely self-funded

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:32.010
and conducted during
her own vacation time.

01:17:32.010 --> 01:17:34.480
So due to her limited
time and resources,

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:37.760
De Cadi focused largely
on archeological survey.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:40.620
Limiting excavation to
small trenches that sought

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:42.240
to answer specific questions

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:44.630
about ceramic tech,
ceramic chronologies.

01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:46.000
Excuse me.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.070
Her thorough surveys
and their timely

01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:51.590
and really fast publication
provided a vast array

01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:53.750
of information on
the nature and extent

01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:55.880
of the Bronze Age
record of the Gulf.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.930
De Cadi was a highly respected
ceramicist and we see her

01:17:58.930 --> 01:18:02.090
on this slide actually
sitting at her ceramics desk.

01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:05.370
And in the background on survey
with Oman with a colleague.

01:18:05.370 --> 01:18:07.020
And she was particularly
interested

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.600
in what these ceramics
could tell us

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.900
about different connections

01:18:09.900 --> 01:18:12.810
between the ancient
cultures of the Middle East.

01:18:12.810 --> 01:18:16.630
She was particularly concerned
with the distribution of incised

01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:18.320
and painted greyware pottery.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:21.630
Which led her to Arabia in 1968.

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:25.840
She returned to Oman again in
1974 to explore the Bronze Age

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.980
of the lesser-known
interior of the country,

01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:30.070
beyond the Hajar Mountains.

01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:32.630
So the presence of Bronze
Age archeology in Oman

01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:36.540
when De Cardi was there was
a relatively new concept.

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:39.630
At Amlah, she found a dense
cluster of Bronze Age tombs

01:18:39.630 --> 01:18:41.630
and settlements and
their potential led her

01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:44.000
to conduct small
excavations at five

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.340
of the 16 sites she recorded.

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.970
In 1976, she published
her findings

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:53.150
in the newly created
Journal of Oman Studies.

01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:55.740
So like De Cardi, our
research is interested

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:57.790
in understanding
ancient Magan's role

01:18:57.790 --> 01:18:59.950
within this larger
Bronze Age world.

01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:01.640
And particularly the effects

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:05.700
that these global interactions
had within Southeastern Arabia.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:08.120
In the winter of 2017,
under the auspices

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.210
of the Bat Archeological
Project,

01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:12.950
we conducted a systematic
survey of the region

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:16.630
of the Bronze Age region between
the settlements of Bat and Amlah

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:19.350
in order to better understand
the relationship between Bat

01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:22.690
and its surrounding
environments.

01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:26.100
Shown here in the red box.

01:19:27.730 --> 01:19:29.140
During the field season,

01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:32.880
we recorded 475 archeological
features dating

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.470
from the Neolithic, all the
way up to the modern period

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:38.310
with a majority belonging
to the Bronze Age.

01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:41.770
Around Amlah itself,
we found 148 new sites,

01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:45.310
most of them tombs which yielded
chronologically diverse pottery.

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:46.610
And in one instance,
a [inaudible].

01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:50.430
We also documented
over 80 petroglyphs

01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:51.730
like those shown here.

01:19:51.730 --> 01:19:57.110
Yes. In the immediate vicinity
of De Cardi's survey zone

01:19:57.110 --> 01:20:00.650
that likely date from the Iron
Age or late pre-Islamic Period.

01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:04.320
As part of our survey
around Amlah,

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:06.900
we revisited De Cardi's
original sites

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:09.300
that her map is shown
here on the left.

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:10.810
And collected additional
ceramics

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:12.810
from the areas she identified.

01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:14.780
Almost 50 years have passed

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:17.640
since De Cardi first
set foot in Amlah.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.240
And modern development has
impacted both the recent

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:22.480
and ancient landscapes
of the villages.

01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.940
Of the village.

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.950
To reconstruct De
Cardi's survey,

01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:28.480
we combined high-resolution
satellite imagery

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:32.330
on the ground fieldwork
and her published notes.

01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:34.990
Using geological features
such as those circled here

01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:36.740
in purple, red, and green.

01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:38.040
As well as the coordinates

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.820
of known-De Cardi sites
including 3A shown here

01:20:40.820 --> 01:20:42.120
in yellow.

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.830
We were able to overlay
her map on top

01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:46.330
of modern satellite pictures.

01:20:46.330 --> 01:20:47.940
We then extracted
the coordinates

01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:50.790
of her remaining sites
and conducted field visits

01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:55.070
to document their exact location
and level of preservation.

01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:57.500
Our goal was to document
De Cardi's sites

01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.350
with modern GPS coordinates.

01:20:59.350 --> 01:21:02.390
Re-examine her interpretations
in light of new research,

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:05.400
and assess the preservation
level of these sites.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:08.940
The next several slides offer
four case studies labeled here

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:12.900
on De Cardi's map as sites
one, three, four, and five.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.400
On how De Cardi's
interpretations can be changed

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.570
by recent research
in the region.

01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:21.450
So starting then at
site one, De Cardi

01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:23.460
and her team identified
a low mound

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:26.580
with three cairns
surrounding a central tomb.

01:21:26.580 --> 01:21:28.280
Though compared,
through comparison,

01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.070
with the excavated tombs at
Umm an-Nar Island off the coast

01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:32.920
of Abu Dhabi today
and at [inaudible],

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:36.910
De Cardi dated these remains
to the early Bronze Age.

01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:40.440
A small trench she excavated
inside the larger tomb revealed

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:42.250
inner and outer wall facings.

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:45.500
Constructed with fine white
limestone ashlars typical

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.610
of the Umm an-Nar Period.

01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:50.890
During our visit to the site, we
were able to identify the mound

01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:53.780
and the location of De
Cardi's excavations.

01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.540
An analysis of the
sherd she recovered

01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:59.030
from the initial excavation show
the tombs likely were first used

01:21:59.030 --> 01:22:00.760
during the early
Umm an-Nar Period

01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.950
which runs from 2800 to 2500 BC.

01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:05.380
And the surrounding
cairns belong

01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:08.650
to the early Iron
Age, around 1300 BC.

01:22:08.650 --> 01:22:11.290
Several Iron Age
ceramics eroding

01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:14.010
from the Umm an-Nar tombs
suggest it was also reused

01:22:14.010 --> 01:22:15.900
for burials in the
first millennium BC.

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:20.930
De Cardi's initial excavations
also recovered several incised

01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:22.320
greyware ceramics.

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.880
A type now well-known
from Bronze Age tombs

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.630
across the Omani peninsula.

01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:28.750
And from southeastern Iran.

01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:30.860
It seems likely these
pots shown here

01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:34.100
as the middle ceramic
picture were produced

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:35.880
in the Indo-Iranian borderlands,

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.000
in the area now known
as Baluchistan.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:39.950
And the reed hut
architecture depicted

01:22:39.950 --> 01:22:43.690
in their incised designs
hints at the deep integration

01:22:43.690 --> 01:22:46.770
of foreign objects and
idea across the Gulf.

01:22:46.770 --> 01:22:52.210
The third site identified by
De Cardi and excavated by her

01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:54.930
as well is considerably
more enigmatic.

01:22:54.930 --> 01:22:58.090
The publication of her survey
lists five small mounds

01:22:58.090 --> 01:23:00.380
with many pottery sherds
eroding out of them.

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.270
And a circular structure
with a six

01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:05.310
and a half meter diameter
and cobbled floor.

01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:07.890
She suggested each of the
mounds might represent a small

01:23:07.890 --> 01:23:10.750
homestead and interprets
the circular feature

01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:12.680
as the foundation
for a palm frond

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:16.680
or brushwood superstructure
that's long since decayed.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.240
A reanalysis of the ceramics
collected by De Cardi

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:22.580
at this site confirms the
domestic nature of the area.

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:24.050
Though now the mounds
have been replaced

01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:27.270
by several modern homes
and a nearby school.

01:23:27.270 --> 01:23:29.780
On our visit to the site,
we collected many sherds

01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:33.110
of black-slipped jars a
[inaudible] style ceramic vessel

01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:36.600
commonly found in Umm
an-Nar domestic contexts.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.200
Using the ceramic chronology
developed from excavations

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.780
at Bat, it's now possible

01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:43.060
to further narrow
this site's occupation

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:48.310
to the Middle Umm an-Nat
period from 2500 to 2200 BC.

01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:52.810
The function of this round
cobbled structure is still more

01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:54.670
difficult to discern.

01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:58.950
Bronze Age mesic architecture is
almost exclusively rectilinear.

01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:01.860
Though it's often
anchored by a round tower.

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:04.610
Though the Amlah structure's
at least 10 meters smaller

01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:07.660
in diameter than any known
Bronze Age tower, it's tempting

01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:10.320
to suggest that this
feature was a compact version

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.860
of this well-known
Bronze Age type.

01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:18.290
The force of archeological
features identified

01:24:18.290 --> 01:24:20.820
in De Cardi's survey
consists of a series

01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:22.340
of rectangular structures

01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:24.670
in a large stone
circle called initially

01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:26.070
by her a wall of enclosure.

01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:29.630
In 2017, it's easy
to draw parallels

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:31.980
between this associated
set of features

01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:35.210
and Bronze Age domestic
areas across Oman.

01:24:35.210 --> 01:24:38.290
We can now reclassify De
Cardi's wall of enclosure

01:24:38.290 --> 01:24:39.900
as a characteristic tower

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:43.350
and the abutting rectilinear
features bear obvious similarity

01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:46.140
to domestic structures at
the bat settlement slope

01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:48.610
and from architecture known from
the nearby settlement at Ziba.

01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:51.280
Dating these structures,
however,

01:24:51.280 --> 01:24:53.120
remains somewhat contentious.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:56.630
As De Cardi recovered only four
sherds from the entire area.

01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:58.720
Most of which were
collected on the surface.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:02.260
Rather than coming from more
secure excavated contexts.

01:25:02.260 --> 01:25:03.560
And they all appear to date

01:25:03.560 --> 01:25:06.490
to the last pre-Islamic
Period onwards.

01:25:06.490 --> 01:25:08.830
A lack of sherds though is
actually a common feature

01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:11.220
of early Bronze Age
towers across Oman.

01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:13.900
So this absence of evidence
might actually support a Bronze

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:15.580
Age date for its creation.

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:19.670
Across the wadi from
site four and its tower,

01:25:19.670 --> 01:25:22.330
De Cardi recorded a cluster
of tombs and structures.

01:25:22.330 --> 01:25:24.340
She labeled the site five.

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:28.090
De Cardi excavated an Umm an-Nar
tomb shown here as site 5A

01:25:28.090 --> 01:25:31.090
where she recovered material
including a carnelian bead

01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:32.830
and a chlorite box.

01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:34.260
She also noted the presence

01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:37.500
of rectilinear feature
called site 5B.

01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:41.230
And the stone robbers had
heavily damaged nearby tombs

01:25:41.230 --> 01:25:42.530
and cairns.

01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:44.570
In 2017, we were only able

01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:48.710
to definitively locate De Cardi
structure 5B based on her notes

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:51.810
and the preserved distinctive
outline of this feature.

01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:53.670
The remaining tombs
and cairns recorded

01:25:53.670 --> 01:25:56.980
in the 1974 survey have
been completely destroyed,

01:25:56.980 --> 01:25:58.840
including site 5A.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.410
We were only able to find this
site thanks to a large pile

01:26:01.410 --> 01:26:03.660
of white limestone
chippings and a scatter

01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:05.210
of Umm an-Nar Period pottery.

01:26:05.210 --> 01:26:07.940
In addition to its
spatial relationship to 5B

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:11.310
and other topographic
features across the landscape.

01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:15.610
Unfortunately, site five
was not the only example

01:26:15.610 --> 01:26:16.910
of the challenges

01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:18.810
to preservation we
encountered in the area.

01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:21.230
A rapid increase in
the population of Amlah

01:26:21.230 --> 01:26:24.130
over the past 50 years has
witnessed a boom in housing

01:26:24.130 --> 01:26:25.610
and commercial development.

01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:27.190
Which has at times encroached

01:26:27.190 --> 01:26:29.620
up the villages'
archeological heritage.

01:26:29.620 --> 01:26:32.970
New plots shown here as
concrete blocks highlighted

01:26:32.970 --> 01:26:36.290
in yellow have been
cleared for modern houses

01:26:36.290 --> 01:26:39.600
which in turn have erased
some archeological remains.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.190
In other cases, long-term
stone-robbing has led

01:26:42.190 --> 01:26:44.690
to the destruction of not
only the monuments themselves,

01:26:44.690 --> 01:26:47.970
but also their value as
archeological places.

01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:51.200
So although we've
stressed here the tension

01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.980
between modern growth in
Amlah and the preservation

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:56.760
of the archeological record,
this isn't to say that on a hold

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.560
on development is
necessarily the answer.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.610
The goal of archeological
preservation

01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:04.220
when done well is not
to stop modern progress

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:07.900
or deny local groups access
to new and better commodities.

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:10.600
Often archeologically
destructive forces

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.190
such as agricultural techniques

01:27:12.190 --> 01:27:15.150
and civil infrastructure
have a massive improvement

01:27:15.150 --> 01:27:19.560
and have a positive impact
on the local quality of life.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.930
In cases where modern expansion
and historic sites overlap.

01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:25.800
The key is collaboration
and continued dialogue

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.690
between the Heritage officers,
researchers, developers,

01:27:28.690 --> 01:27:31.640
and of course most
importantly local residents.

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.660
During the field season, we
were able to share several

01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:35.690
of our new finds with
the Ministry of Heritage

01:27:35.690 --> 01:27:37.720
and Culture Office at Bat.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.850
This has ensured their future
protection by including them

01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:42.690
in National Heritage zones.

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:45.460
In this slide, oops.

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:50.750
This slide shows several of the
signs now marking these areas.

01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:54.440
So taken together, this
research offers a new view

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.150
of prehistoric Amlah.

01:27:56.150 --> 01:28:00.290
The increase of efficiency of
satellites and GPS technology

01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:02.160
and our systematic
methods allowed us

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:05.530
to identify nearly 150
archeological sites in

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:09.690
and around Amlah, a significant
increase from De Cardi's 15.

01:28:09.690 --> 01:28:11.130
The location of these sites,

01:28:11.130 --> 01:28:13.070
most of which are
Hafit Period tombs,

01:28:13.070 --> 01:28:16.530
reveal a pattern increasingly
familiar across Al-Dahwa

01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:18.420
with Hafit tombs
occupying spaces

01:28:18.420 --> 01:28:21.920
on high ridgelines overlooking
early Bronze Age settlements

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.400
and areas of agricultural
potential.

01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:26.880
This corroborates earlier
work in the Bat area done

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.420
by Dr. Charlotte [inaudible]

01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:30.390
that suggests these
high-elevation tombs

01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:32.190
in effect set guard over areas

01:28:32.190 --> 01:28:34.610
of potentially valuable
territory.

01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:38.050
Our analysis of De Cardi's
excavated sherds and visits

01:28:38.050 --> 01:28:39.970
to the sites she
recorded suggests

01:28:39.970 --> 01:28:41.440
that Bronze Age Amlah was home

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:44.160
to at least two distinct
settlement areas.

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:46.640
The structures surrounding
the tower at site four

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:48.860
and the low mounds
at site three.

01:28:48.860 --> 01:28:50.910
Rather than the pioneer
homesteads

01:28:50.910 --> 01:28:53.900
that De Cardi initially
suggested, Amlah now registers

01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:56.540
as a full-on early Bronze
Age settlement complete

01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:59.290
with several Umm
an-Nar Period tombs.

01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:05.200
Perhaps of equal importance,
however, is our ability now

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:08.530
to refine the chronological
sequence of Amlah's occupation.

01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:11.690
Fifty years of archeology
in Oman and the UAE

01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:14.620
since De Cardi's initial visit
have made massive changes

01:29:14.620 --> 01:29:18.320
in our understanding of the
region's prehistoric timeline.

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.680
Amlah emerges from these
decades of research

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.890
as a chronologically
dynamic area.

01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:24.450
Occupied from at
least the beginning

01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:27.370
of the third millennium
BC or the Hafit Period.

01:29:27.370 --> 01:29:30.170
Our ceramics work confirms
that the site was occupied

01:29:30.170 --> 01:29:33.220
through the early, middle,
and late Umm an-Nar Periods.

01:29:33.220 --> 01:29:34.870
And through comparisons
with sherds

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.500
from excavated contexts at Bat.

01:29:36.500 --> 01:29:39.730
Beyond the Bronze
Age, Amlah appears

01:29:39.730 --> 01:29:41.890
to have also been an
important area of settlement

01:29:41.890 --> 01:29:44.220
and burial during
the Arabian Iron Age.

01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:47.390
A time period totally unknown
during De Cardi's years

01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:50.880
of research in the area.

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.320
Zooming out, it's possible
to form a clearer picture

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.910
of the relationship between
the large conglomeration

01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:58.950
of settlement areas and
tombs at bronze Age Bat

01:29:58.950 --> 01:30:01.280
and surrounding settlements
and cemeteries in the area.

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:04.730
Amlah's situated at the
meeting of two wadis

01:30:04.730 --> 01:30:07.470
and doubtlessly served as an
important junction of movement

01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:10.840
between Bat and places
to the south and east.

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.140
Our survey work in the rest

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.680
of the region are recorded
site search shown here

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:15.980
with yellow dots.

01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:18.780
Shows a distinct break in
the Bronze Age features

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:20.240
between Bat and Amlah.

01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:22.430
Suggesting separate
areas of territory

01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:26.790
where at least influence with
hopefully this break visible

01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:32.020
on this slide by an absence
of yellow dots in this area.

01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.070
Amlah's [inaudible]
connections, however,

01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:36.320
extends far beyond this area.

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.460
The presence of pottery
from Southeastern Iran

01:30:38.460 --> 01:30:39.800
and carnelian beads sourced

01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:42.910
from the Indus Valley both
found in tombs at Amlah.

01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:44.450
Demonstrates the integration

01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:46.900
of even Oman's smallest
ancient settlements

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.880
into the interconnected
Middle Eastern world.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:52.700
Though very much a part of
this global ancient Near East,

01:30:52.700 --> 01:30:55.590
Magan looks remarkably different
from the cities and kings

01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:57.590
that characterized
the archeology of many

01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:59.240
of its ancient neighbors.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:02.340
Instead, smaller settlements
and towns like Amlah

01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:05.630
that are surrounded and grounded
by monumental architecture

01:31:05.630 --> 01:31:08.260
such as the tombs and
towers are the norm.

01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:11.510
Across ancient Southeastern
Arabia, there's little evidence

01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:14.040
for hierarchy or
social inequality.

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:16.030
Continued research
and preservation

01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:18.740
of the region's archeological
heritage can further our

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:20.860
understanding of
Oman's unique role

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:22.890
in the history of
the Middle East.

01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:26.820
And so with that, we'd like
to say thank you very much

01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.170
to all the people listed here

01:31:28.170 --> 01:31:30.440
and of course the
funders of our project.

01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:33.420
And perhaps most
especially the Ministry

01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.790
of Heritage and Culture.

01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:37.090
And to the people of
both Bat and Amlah

01:31:37.090 --> 01:31:38.730
who were very welcoming.

01:31:38.730 --> 01:31:41.890
And tolerant of us often
walking through their backyards

01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:44.000
to record archeological sites.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.510
So thank you very much.

01:31:46.510 --> 01:32:05.320
[ Applause ]

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.150
&gt;&gt; Dr. Zenobi Garrett?

01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:08.630
Since I introduced you both,

01:32:08.630 --> 01:32:10.110
I thought you were
doing it together.

01:32:10.110 --> 01:32:12.180
Are you making presentation?

01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:14.390
&gt;&gt; No, that was, we, were
presenting that together.

01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:15.690
&gt;&gt; Oh, you were doing
it together.

01:32:15.690 --> 01:32:16.990
I am sorry.

01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:18.890
&gt;&gt; We'll take turns taking
questions if they arise.

01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:20.350
&gt;&gt; He has the better
speaking voice so.

01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:26.560
&gt;&gt; I thought you
were both presenting.

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:28.120
Okay, that's fine.

01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:34.290
Okay, so Dr. Mark, Dr. Mark
Kenoyer is the last speaker

01:32:34.290 --> 01:32:35.950
on this panel.

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:41.370
And Jonathan Mark Kenoyer is
a Professor in the Department

01:32:41.370 --> 01:32:44.200
of Anthropology at the
University of Wisconsin.

01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.880
He has been teaching archeology

01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:49.180
and ancient technology
since 1985.

01:32:49.180 --> 01:32:53.180
He has served as Field
Director and Co-Director

01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:58.010
of the Harappa Archeological
research Project since 1986.

01:32:58.010 --> 01:33:00.940
Dr. Kenoyer has worked
on excavations

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:05.570
in ethnoarchaeological studies
in both Pakistan and India.

01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:08.210
And more recently in Oman.

01:33:08.210 --> 01:33:12.100
He has a special interest
in ancient technologies

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.200
and crafts socioeconomic

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:16.710
and political organization
as well as religion.

01:33:16.710 --> 01:33:22.980
He is the recipient of the 2013
Sultan Qaboos Cultural Research

01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:25.230
Center Fellowship.

01:33:25.230 --> 01:33:28.990
He's the author of numerous
books and edited volumes

01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:30.900
on the archeology of South Asia.

01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:33.330
And the Indus Civilization.

01:33:33.330 --> 01:33:37.440
Dr. Kenoyer obtained his PhD in
anthropology at the University

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:39.250
of California-Berkeley.

01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:41.580
Dr. Kenoyer?

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:43.750
&gt;&gt; Dr. J Mark Kenoyer: Thank
you very much for the invitation

01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:46.550
to this, present at
this conference and also

01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:47.950
for your introduction.

01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:50.730
It's really an honor to be here
at the Library of Congress.

01:33:50.730 --> 01:33:54.100
It's a really phenomenal
location and I think

01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:55.720
that this is the perfect place

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:58.200
for the first conference
on Oman to be held.

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:01.710
So thank you for
making this possible.

01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:03.610
I would like to thank
the Embassy of Oman

01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:06.400
for their support, and Her
Excellency, the Ambassador,

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:09.810
for taking the time to come
for this important event.

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:13.150
Also the Office to the Advisor
to His Majesty the Sultan

01:34:13.150 --> 01:34:16.540
of Cultural Affairs, as well as
Sultan Qaboos Cultural Center.

01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:20.370
So all of these organizations
have been very supportive

01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:22.670
of my work in Oman.

01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:28.920
And I-- before I want to being,

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:32.250
I also want to especially thank
Dr. Said bin Nasser Alsalmi,

01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:35.660
because of his support
when I was in Oman working

01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:39.690
on collections in the
Ministry and also in the office

01:34:39.690 --> 01:34:43.410
of His Majesty's, the
Sultan Cultural Center.

01:34:43.410 --> 01:34:47.170
The material that
he presented already

01:34:47.170 --> 01:34:49.950
on Salut I will be
talking about a bit more.

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.750
And I was very fortunate
because the Italian Mission

01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:56.210
to Oman allowed me to study his
materials and work with them

01:34:56.210 --> 01:34:57.760
and collaborate with them.

01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:01.070
I have also working with
the Ministry of Heritage

01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:03.210
and Culture, Hassan al Lawati

01:35:03.210 --> 01:35:06.010
and Sultan al [inaudible] were
the very important colleagues

01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:08.780
who have been helping
me work in Oman.

01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:12.440
There are many other
organizations I want to thank.

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.930
Government of Pakistan,
Department of Archeology

01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:17.090
and the Archeological
Survey of India

01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:19.490
because what I am presenting
today is actually a connection

01:35:19.490 --> 01:35:23.320
of many different regions and by
working in all of these regions.

01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.840
I have been able to
amass some information

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.240
that I think is unique.

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:29.550
And I hope that it will
stimulate more collaboration

01:35:29.550 --> 01:35:32.040
across these borders.

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:35.290
Sorry. I also want to thank
all of the different projects.

01:35:35.290 --> 01:35:37.560
I'm not going to go through
them in great detail.

01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.000
Many of you are here,
so thank you

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.020
for your collaboration and help.

01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:43.530
And many more are not
here, but they're working

01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:44.900
in many parts of the world.

01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:48.350
And I think that we really need
to do more collaborative work

01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:51.220
in order to be able to
understand the complexities

01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:55.180
of the third millennium
interactions.

01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:58.770
You've already had a little
bit of introduction to Oman

01:35:58.770 --> 01:36:00.570
and the history of
the Middle East.

01:36:00.570 --> 01:36:03.520
But the Indus Valley has been
somewhat left out of this.

01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:05.680
So I'm going to kind
of reenter everything.

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:08.460
And Oman is actually in
the center of the map.

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:11.950
So the center of the map is
not Egypt or Indus Valley,

01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:13.640
it's right in the middle here

01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:17.020
where you see Oman is the
center point of interactions

01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:19.740
between three of the
major civilizations.

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:23.700
And, and some of my early maps
you'll see in my presentation,

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:27.400
I refer to this area
as Muscat and Oman.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:31.350
It dates when I started
studying, so back in 1970,

01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:32.980
that's what this place
used to be called.

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:34.560
It wasn't called the
Sultanate of Oman.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.240
It was called Muscat and Oman.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.840
So my maps show the
periods of time

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:41.840
in which I've been
working on this area.

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:47.780
This area known as Magan was,
was critical for interactions

01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:49.130
with the Indus civilization.

01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:52.210
And we've known this
actually since the '80s.

01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:53.510
But I'm going to present

01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:55.970
that this is actually
goes back much earlier.

01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:57.810
And Dr. Alsalmi mentioned

01:36:57.810 --> 01:37:01.640
that there's two million
year old stone tools in Oman.

01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:04.570
I'm not going to include the
plus two million year old stone

01:37:04.570 --> 01:37:06.630
tools in northern Pakistan.

01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:09.320
But the question is
how do you have more

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.930
than two million
year old stone tools

01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:15.450
in [inaudible] near Islamabad
and in [inaudible] and Kashmir,

01:37:15.450 --> 01:37:17.870
and in Oman, and
then also in Africa?

01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:19.910
And is it always out of Africa

01:37:19.910 --> 01:37:22.900
or is it could be other
kinds of interactions?

01:37:22.900 --> 01:37:25.340
And I like to always have
arrows going both directions.

01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:29.050
So my presentation is going
to focus on bidirectionality

01:37:29.050 --> 01:37:32.500
and not just one direction.

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:36.060
The chronologies have already
been presented, but I just want

01:37:36.060 --> 01:37:39.740
to focus on the time that I will
be talking about is the period

01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:43.980
of time when we have urban
developments in the Indus Valley

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:47.020
and very large urban
societies in Mesopotamia.

01:37:47.020 --> 01:37:49.440
The Umm an-Nar Period in Oman.

01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.850
But I'm also going to start
very much earlier to the period

01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:55.610
of time that was just briefly
talked about by Dr. Alsalmi

01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:59.000
about the lithic
periods of the Neolithic.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.300
Because that time period is

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:03.640
when the first interactions
are going back and forth.

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:05.970
And I didn't realize it as much

01:38:05.970 --> 01:38:09.950
when I did my dissertation
back in 1970s and '80s.

01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:12.820
But I did study the shells
from a site called [inaudible]

01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:14.530
which were excavated

01:38:14.530 --> 01:38:18.610
by the French Archeological
Mission in Pakistan.

01:38:18.610 --> 01:38:20.670
And [inaudible] the late
scholar who studied this.

01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:24.710
And his wife Catrine allowed
me to study their beads

01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:27.250
and the shell beads that I
was studying from [inaudible].

01:38:27.250 --> 01:38:30.070
I noted that there were
certain types of beads here

01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:34.090
that were not found on the
Makran Coast in Pakistan.

01:38:34.090 --> 01:38:36.140
And I argued that
they might have come

01:38:36.140 --> 01:38:38.660
from across the Gulf in Oman.

01:38:38.660 --> 01:38:41.410
And I've spent the last 30
years trying to find evidence

01:38:41.410 --> 01:38:44.200
for these shell beads
in the Makran area.

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:45.500
They're not present.

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:47.160
They're only found in Oman.

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:52.800
So it's very possible that
at 7000 BC, people going back

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:58.420
and forth across the coast from
the Makran Coast to Muscat area

01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:04.130
or the [inaudible] were taking
shell beads back across the Gulf

01:39:04.130 --> 01:39:06.390
to what is now Baluchistan

01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:08.810
and then trading them
all the way inland.

01:39:08.810 --> 01:39:13.100
And this type of interaction
suggests that people

01:39:13.100 --> 01:39:16.330
on both sides of the gulf were
interacting very regularly.

01:39:16.330 --> 01:39:18.300
So when we talk about
origins of pottery,

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.770
and Dr. Sofie [inaudible]
has studied the pottery

01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:24.940
in [inaudible] and
the Arabian Peninsula.

01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:27.540
She talks about traditions,
ceramic traditions coming

01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:29.710
from Baluchistan to Oman.

01:39:29.710 --> 01:39:31.640
I would argue that
these are developing

01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:33.910
at the same time on both sides.

01:39:33.910 --> 01:39:36.750
And in archeology, we
always try to be the place

01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:38.410
where everything starts
and everything spreads.

01:39:38.410 --> 01:39:41.030
And I'm going to be the
arguing that we need to look

01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:43.820
at both directions and people
are working in both sides

01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:47.090
of the gulf at the same time.

01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:52.590
We also have recent evidence
from excavations in Salut

01:39:52.590 --> 01:39:55.600
as well as studies
of the ceramics.

01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:00.240
That we have pottery from
the period of time that is

01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:03.980
at during the Hafit Period
that is coming possibly

01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:07.150
from the Indus Valley all
the way into interior Oman.

01:40:07.150 --> 01:40:09.430
Most of the focus
has been on Harappan.

01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:11.590
This is the time
of the Umm an-Nar.

01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:14.330
But now there's a, there's
a one pot sherd from Salut

01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:16.150
that we're beginning
to, that we're studying.

01:40:16.150 --> 01:40:19.690
It has the style of pottery
which we call [inaudible]

01:40:19.690 --> 01:40:23.540
which indicates that it's
possibly a much earlier phase

01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:27.270
of interaction began when people
were coming to this region.

01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:29.420
Now the question is
why did they come?

01:40:29.420 --> 01:40:32.870
And everyone focuses on
copper but there's one thing

01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:34.170
that people forget about.

01:40:34.170 --> 01:40:38.330
The Indus Valley is the place
where cotton originated.

01:40:38.330 --> 01:40:41.710
At [inaudible] at 7000
BC we have cotton.

01:40:41.710 --> 01:40:43.500
If you want to make
fishing nets,

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:46.370
if you want to make
fishing lines.

01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:51.650
Making them from date palm
fiber is not very good, okay?

01:40:51.650 --> 01:40:52.950
[Laughter] But if you want

01:40:52.950 --> 01:40:55.410
to have nice strong fishing
lines, cotton is very good.

01:40:55.410 --> 01:40:58.730
So it's possible that textiles
and fibers were being brought

01:40:58.730 --> 01:41:01.430
from the Indus Valley to
this region very early.

01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:02.740
And we're hoping
to look at that now

01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:06.250
from excavations at [inaudible].

01:41:06.250 --> 01:41:08.640
The period of time
during the Hafit Period,

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.880
we still see the continuation
of this type of shell.

01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:15.990
So this shell which is called
[inaudible] is very common

01:41:15.990 --> 01:41:17.290
in Oman.

01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:20.810
It continues to be used in
Baluchistan in the Indus Valley.

01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:22.840
And then the Indus people
develop the technique

01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:25.880
for making black and white
stones that look like this.

01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:28.700
So they develop a technique
for replicating the shell.

01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:32.290
And making certain types
of beads that are similar

01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:35.790
to the shell, but they're made
out of an artificial material.

01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:38.880
During the period
of urban development

01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:41.590
of the Indus civilization,

01:41:41.590 --> 01:41:44.090
we see the establishment
of major cities.

01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:47.800
Harakah where I work,
Mohenjodaro,

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:49.650
[inaudible] these
are huge cities

01:41:49.650 --> 01:41:52.830
and settlements in
the Indus plain.

01:41:52.830 --> 01:41:56.680
The Indus Valley is
surrounded by raw materials.

01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:00.640
They have more copper in the
Indus Mountains than you,

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:01.940
you can shake a stick at.

01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:04.900
You don't need to go to
Oman for, for copper.

01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:08.460
But if you cut all the
trees in your own area,

01:42:08.460 --> 01:42:12.160
and you have no charcoal
to smelt the copper,

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.370
then you do have to
go somewhere else.

01:42:14.370 --> 01:42:17.330
So we know that there was
intensive copper smelting

01:42:17.330 --> 01:42:22.380
in Baluchistan, [inaudible]
means the Desert of Death,

01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:24.610
and this was the desert of death

01:42:24.610 --> 01:42:26.170
because they cut
all the trees down,

01:42:26.170 --> 01:42:27.470
and there's nothing
there anymore.

01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:30.220
But it was a major
copper smelting area.

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:33.840
So my feeling is that the reason
we see during the Harappan

01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.850
Period movement of people
from this area to Oman is

01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:40.360
because there were
lots of trees in Oman.

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:43.120
There were lots of acacia,
there were lots of forests.

01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:45.550
And the people of Baluchistan
said, "We can go over there

01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:47.360
and we can get lots
of copper very easily

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:49.100
because they haven't used it."

01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:51.930
And this may have been one
of the major instigators

01:42:51.930 --> 01:42:53.530
for people coming to this area

01:42:53.530 --> 01:42:56.690
and developing copper smelting
during the Harappan Period.

01:42:56.690 --> 01:42:58.930
And stimulating copper trade.

01:42:58.930 --> 01:43:02.350
So if you go to Oman
to get copper,

01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:04.170
and you bring it back
to the Indus Valley.

01:43:04.170 --> 01:43:06.830
And everybody else has copper
from Baluchistan and [inaudible]

01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:10.000
and other places, how
are you going to sell it?

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.300
Is it going to be cheaper?

01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:13.740
And the fact is it is cheaper.

01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.340
Because if you go by
boat to Baluchistan

01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:19.490
from what is now Delta to Oman.

01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:22.110
You're going to sell
cotton and rice.

01:43:22.110 --> 01:43:25.730
Not-- wheat, and barley and
everything else that you bring

01:43:25.730 --> 01:43:27.030
from the Indus Valley.

01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:30.710
You're going to make a huge
profit, and your boat is empty.

01:43:30.710 --> 01:43:32.550
And you have to come
back with heavy material.

01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:34.960
So you're going to bring a
heavy boat filled with shell

01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:37.430
and copper back to
the Indus Valley.

01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:39.750
And you can undercut the
market of the people who came

01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:41.960
by oxcart from Baluchistan.

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:44.820
Or boat, by, by carrying
it from [inaudible].

01:43:44.820 --> 01:43:47.950
So you'll be able to use
maritime trade as a way

01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:49.770
to totally change the economy.

01:43:49.770 --> 01:43:52.990
And I think that this is one of
the most important discoveries

01:43:52.990 --> 01:43:55.640
of our interactions between
the Indus civilization

01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:58.120
and Oman is the development
of maritime trade.

01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:03.420
And global economies of, of,
of production and exchange.

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:05.660
So this is what I feel
is happening during the

01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:06.960
Indus Period.

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:09.610
And then the question is
who was stimulating this?

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:13.050
Were the people, were the
people in Oman stimulating this

01:44:13.050 --> 01:44:15.000
because they needed things
from the Indus Valley?

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:21.080
Or were there middlemen who
would be Omani or, or, or Arab

01:44:21.080 --> 01:44:23.910
and Indus traders
moving back and forth?

01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:27.050
And I was, would call them Magan
traders because we don't know

01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:28.360
where exactly they came from.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:31.990
In the Indus civilization
we have cities made

01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:33.350
with fired brick.

01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:34.650
And mud brick.

01:44:34.650 --> 01:44:38.100
We have organized
transport with oxcarts.

01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:43.300
We have beautiful beads made
of carnelian, seals, weights,

01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:45.750
and one of the features that
we see in the Indus cities is

01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:49.000
that people were wearing
bangles, ornaments.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:52.210
And every women in the Indus
Valley was wearing bangles

01:44:52.210 --> 01:44:54.460
and many of the men
were wearing bangles.

01:44:54.460 --> 01:44:56.030
And we have lots of beads.

01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:58.640
And so these types of ornaments
and things were being used

01:44:58.640 --> 01:44:59.940
and worn by the Indus people.

01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:04.420
But the Indus people were also
making a wide range of ceramics.

01:45:04.420 --> 01:45:08.420
And they made these
ceramics for special reasons.

01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:11.150
So these large vessels
have been the main focus

01:45:11.150 --> 01:45:12.450
for the trade to Oman.

01:45:12.450 --> 01:45:13.760
Which are the black-slipped
jars.

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.230
We've heard about them
again and again and again.

01:45:16.230 --> 01:45:18.120
The question is what
was put in a large jar?

01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:22.350
And based on my ethnographic
studies and historical studies

01:45:22.350 --> 01:45:25.240
of trade between
South Asia and China,

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:27.790
I argue that everything
is put in here.

01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:29.330
It can be foodstuffs.

01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:32.010
It can be textiles, it can be
anything that you do not want

01:45:32.010 --> 01:45:33.510
to get wet with saltwater.

01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:38.070
So if you're taking stuff
from the Indus Valley to Oman,

01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:39.370
you don't want the
saltwater on it.

01:45:39.370 --> 01:45:41.650
And you don't want
the rats eating it.

01:45:41.650 --> 01:45:44.450
So there could be textiles
and fiber inside these pots.

01:45:44.450 --> 01:45:45.790
There could be dried goods.

01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:47.840
There could be wet goods.

01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.620
And we need to analyze these.

01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:51.240
So right now I'm
working with the Ministry

01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:52.720
of Heritage and Culture.

01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:56.270
We're taking some sherds
from recent excavations

01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:59.570
in [inaudible] with the
Italian team [inaudible] Catani

01:45:59.570 --> 01:46:03.390
of from Ravenna.

01:46:03.390 --> 01:46:06.580
And we are working on
the residue analysis

01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:09.540
of these vessels to find
out what's, what's in them.

01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:11.900
We also have beautiful
painted vessels

01:46:11.900 --> 01:46:13.690
which are highly decorated.

01:46:13.690 --> 01:46:17.510
Now in an Indus site,
you'll find one

01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:18.810
or two of these vess-- .

01:46:18.810 --> 01:46:20.110
Oh, sorry.

01:46:20.110 --> 01:46:21.410
One thing more.

01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:22.710
So black-slipped jars
in the Indus Valley,

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:24.710
they're found in
every settlement.

01:46:24.710 --> 01:46:27.470
And you can ask me why
don't we do residue analysis

01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:29.160
of black-slipped jars
in the Indus Valley?

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:33.210
Well, in the Indus Valley, after
they had a black-slipped jar

01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:36.660
and they traded it to Harappa,
they took everything out of it.

01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:38.690
And then it's like
an empty bottle.

01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:41.660
And in Indus Valley,
they took these vessels,

01:46:41.660 --> 01:46:43.770
and they used them as latrines.

01:46:43.770 --> 01:46:45.370
So they buried them
in the ground,

01:46:45.370 --> 01:46:47.370
and then they used
them as a latrine.

01:46:47.370 --> 01:46:50.390
So I don't want to study
the latrine content

01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:51.690
of every house in [inaudible].

01:46:51.690 --> 01:46:57.380
We rarely find a black-slipped
jar that has been used for trade

01:46:57.380 --> 01:46:59.250
because every time they used
them, then they put them

01:46:59.250 --> 01:47:01.180
in the ground and used
them as a latrine.

01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:02.920
So I know what's in a latrine.

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:04.580
But I want to know
now what's shipped

01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:06.660
out of the Indus
Valley in these vessels.

01:47:06.660 --> 01:47:09.310
And they didn't use them
as latrines in Oman.

01:47:09.310 --> 01:47:10.610
They used them.

01:47:10.610 --> 01:47:12.690
They accidentally broke.

01:47:12.690 --> 01:47:13.990
You say them in Dahwa.

01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:16.270
I went to the site and
I saw all of the sherds.

01:47:16.270 --> 01:47:17.570
It's phenomenal.

01:47:17.570 --> 01:47:20.900
So Oman is the only place we
can actually study the contents

01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:23.430
of black-slipped jars properly.

01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:29.760
Then we have vessels which are
the beautiful painted vessels.

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:31.480
And these things, only one

01:47:31.480 --> 01:47:33.940
or two are found in
each Indus house.

01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:36.290
They're not made in
very many copies.

01:47:36.290 --> 01:47:38.430
So these I think were
used for rituals.

01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:41.310
And ceremonies and
marriage ceremonies.

01:47:41.310 --> 01:47:42.720
So then when we find
them in Oman,

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:45.270
the questions is why
are they in Oman?

01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:47.220
We also find what we call handi.

01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:49.930
Handi is a cooking
pot, specifically made

01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:53.470
for cooking piles of
Indus Valley food.

01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:54.770
Now we don't know
what the food was.

01:47:54.770 --> 01:47:59.440
Probably barley or
wheat, a gruel, and curry.

01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:02.110
We know they used turmeric
and spices in the Indus Valley

01:48:02.110 --> 01:48:05.670
so these would have been made
for making biryani and curry.

01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:08.900
And then we find lots
of these in Oman.

01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:13.240
We also find [inaudible] stands
which are presentation vessels.

01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:16.300
So this is a style of cooking
where you make certain foods,

01:48:16.300 --> 01:48:19.950
and then you present it in a
certain way on a very high stand

01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:22.830
which is a part of
an Indus food ritual.

01:48:22.830 --> 01:48:26.660
And then finally we find vessels
which we call perforated jars.

01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:29.070
And in the Indus Valley,
when we found them is Situ,

01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:31.770
they're always found
inside a very large jar.

01:48:31.770 --> 01:48:34.940
And this, I argue is
called a reverse strainer.

01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:38.230
It's used for making types
of beer or barley drink

01:48:38.230 --> 01:48:39.530
which is a special type

01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:42.220
of beverage used in
the Indus Valley.

01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:46.150
So Indus people developed a
wide range of food traditions.

01:48:46.150 --> 01:48:49.010
And ceramic traditions which
we're going to look at.

01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:50.830
And how they come to Oman.

01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:53.390
And the Indus people
used lots of bronze.

01:48:53.390 --> 01:48:56.190
They're probably the most
bronze-using civilization

01:48:56.190 --> 01:48:57.620
in antiquity.

01:48:57.620 --> 01:48:59.080
Everybody had bronze.

01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:02.640
Because they have copper from
all sides and now from Oman.

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.310
And everybody was using bronze

01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:06.670
to make pottery or
to make vessels.

01:49:06.670 --> 01:49:09.710
Weapons, tools, ornaments,
seals,

01:49:09.710 --> 01:49:12.280
necklaces, plates, everything.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.820
So bronze is very useful.

01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:18.150
Because if you put water
in a bronze vessel,

01:49:18.150 --> 01:49:21.340
it will kill the bacteria
within four hours.

01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:23.950
So people who had wealth
could have bronze vessels

01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:26.640
and these would help to keep
them healthy when they were,

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:28.220
when they're drinking liquids.

01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:30.030
So here we come now to Oman.

01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:33.190
So early scholars working
in Oman found evidence

01:49:33.190 --> 01:49:35.480
of Indus interactions
at the tip of Oman.

01:49:35.480 --> 01:49:39.100
The first discoveries were
at [inaudible] by [inaudible]

01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:42.310
and then some were found

01:49:42.310 --> 01:49:44.020
in [inaudible] during
the early excavations.

01:49:44.020 --> 01:49:46.360
And then later on,
people realized

01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:47.910
that there were lots
of inland sites.

01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:50.390
And now we have sites on
the [inaudible] coast.

01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:54.370
So basically all over
this peninsula is evidence

01:49:54.370 --> 01:49:55.930
for Indus interaction.

01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:59.800
But they did not have oxcarts,
and they did not have camels.

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:03.220
And so how do you get a big
black-slipped jar all the way

01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.520
into Salut?

01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:06.730
Or into Bat?

01:50:06.730 --> 01:50:08.590
You had to carry it.

01:50:08.590 --> 01:50:09.890
Because we don't
have any evidence

01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:11.550
that they were using
donkey transport

01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:13.460
or carrying these
things on donkeys.

01:50:13.460 --> 01:50:16.680
And one of these vessels can
hold 84 liters of liquid.

01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:18.210
That's a lot of weight.

01:50:18.210 --> 01:50:19.770
So it would have
been very difficult

01:50:19.770 --> 01:50:21.070
to move these things inland.

01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:23.180
But they were doing it,
and we have evidence

01:50:23.180 --> 01:50:26.450
of those materials all
through the inland areas.

01:50:26.450 --> 01:50:27.910
So you've already
had an introduction

01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:29.740
about the Umm an-Nar period.

01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:31.870
One of the things
that is important

01:50:31.870 --> 01:50:34.250
about Umm an-Nar burials
is that within the burials,

01:50:34.250 --> 01:50:36.640
they have very elaborate
ornaments.

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:39.990
Some of these ornaments are from
clearly the Indus civilization

01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:41.290
but I want to point
out that some

01:50:41.290 --> 01:50:46.200
of them are actually
Anatolia or from Mesopotamia

01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:48.940
and indirectly possibly
even from Egypt.

01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:51.330
So Oman was a nexus.

01:50:51.330 --> 01:50:52.700
It was a place where
people were coming

01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:54.180
from many different regions.

01:50:54.180 --> 01:50:57.220
And the elites were using
these symbols as a symbol

01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:59.910
of their power and connection.

01:50:59.910 --> 01:51:02.410
My recent work in Oman's funded

01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:05.130
by the Sultan Qaboos Foundation
helped me study materials

01:51:05.130 --> 01:51:10.060
from [inaudible] from Bat,
from a lot of different sites

01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:12.080
that I'm in the process
of publishing.

01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:14.460
Which shows that some of
these beads were coming

01:51:14.460 --> 01:51:17.610
from the Indus Valley
directly to Oman.

01:51:17.610 --> 01:51:20.700
Some of them may have
been made in Mesopotamia.

01:51:20.700 --> 01:51:23.480
And then come to Oman
from Mesopotamia.

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:26.980
And recently, this year we found
my first bead that I can say

01:51:26.980 --> 01:51:29.170
of carnelian or hard stone

01:51:29.170 --> 01:51:31.530
that was actually
probably made in Oman.

01:51:31.530 --> 01:51:34.620
So the question is when did the
different technologies develop?

01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:37.930
And how were these
communities interacting?

01:51:37.930 --> 01:51:40.010
We also, I was able
to study the seals.

01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:41.310
Some of these seals
from [inaudible]

01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:44.980
and also from [inaudible].

01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:48.160
Omani craftsmen were
using their own techniques

01:51:48.160 --> 01:51:50.820
to make their own style of
seals which is distinctive.

01:51:50.820 --> 01:51:54.160
They were not copying
Indus Valley seals.

01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.010
They were maybe some
shared motifs,

01:51:56.010 --> 01:51:58.440
but they had their own
way of doing things.

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:01.460
And then we have the
important seal from Salut.

01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:03.590
Which it's an Indus style seal,

01:52:03.590 --> 01:52:05.120
but it's not made
in the Indus Valley.

01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:08.180
And my analysis of this
argues that it was made

01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:11.360
by an Indus-trained craftsman,
somebody who has the skill

01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:13.120
of an Indus seal carver.

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.400
But they were making
it on chlorite.

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:16.700
The chlorite, we don't know.

01:52:16.700 --> 01:52:19.530
Maybe [inaudible] will
tell us about chlorite.

01:52:19.530 --> 01:52:22.450
It could have been
from somewhere in Oman,

01:52:22.450 --> 01:52:23.940
or it could have come from Iran.

01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:26.120
Or it could have
come from Yemen.

01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:28.860
But it wasn't an Indus stone.

01:52:28.860 --> 01:52:31.290
But they were using this
stone to carve an Indus seal

01:52:31.290 --> 01:52:33.150
so it has some slight
imperfections

01:52:33.150 --> 01:52:34.520
because of the tools.

01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:37.550
But clearly made by somebody
who was highly skilled.

01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:40.230
So this means that
I'm a, I'm a trader,

01:52:40.230 --> 01:52:42.540
I'm an Oman, I don't
have a seal.

01:52:42.540 --> 01:52:45.770
I call somebody to make my
seal using a local material.

01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:50.570
Which indicates a very
unique interaction system.

01:52:50.570 --> 01:52:53.280
And this is one of the earliest
sites where we have the evidence

01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:57.750
for Mesopotamian and Indus
interaction discovered

01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:59.050
by [inaudible].

01:52:59.050 --> 01:53:02.530
And then the recent, the work
by Sophie Marie and Clouseau.

01:53:02.530 --> 01:53:05.030
And then most recently,
Sophie Marie

01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:08.930
and I have been collaborating
to look at pottery from Salut

01:53:08.930 --> 01:53:11.500
and also from Ras al Hadd.

01:53:11.500 --> 01:53:15.250
And she's arguing that some of
this pottery is actually made

01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:18.890
in Oman used of Indus style.

01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:22.940
Now I've worked with potters
in Pakistan for 30 years.

01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:25.570
And trying to get
a modern potter

01:53:25.570 --> 01:53:28.100
to make an Indus-style
pot is very difficult.

01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:31.260
Because they're Punjabi or
their Sindi, or they're Balochi,

01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:34.200
and they're used to making
those types of pottery.

01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:38.060
It took me 15 years to
train a Harappan potter

01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:41.390
who makes modern Harappan
pottery, Punjabi pottery,

01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:43.860
to make a black-slipped jar.

01:53:43.860 --> 01:53:47.600
So to get a potter in Oman who's
used to making certain types

01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:50.280
of pottery to make a
black-slipped jar would have

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:53.920
taken many, many years of
experimentation with the clay,

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:58.230
with the technique before they
could finally make this vessel.

01:53:58.230 --> 01:54:00.060
Another solution would
just bring a potter

01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:01.360
from the Indus Valley.

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:04.330
And bring them to Oman, and
then say, "Here's some clay."

01:54:04.330 --> 01:54:07.390
And then they can make it.

01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:09.000
Or they're going
back and forth, yes.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.280
So this is the interesting
patterns

01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:13.260
that we're trying to understand.

01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:16.590
So this is where working
with Christ Thornton

01:54:16.590 --> 01:54:18.210
and Charlotte Gable, we were--

01:54:18.210 --> 01:54:21.310
Cable, we were able to look
at the materials from Bat.

01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:23.830
We were also able to look
at the materials from Salut.

01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:27.420
We were analyzing this pottery
using neutron activation.

01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:29.670
And now we're finding some
interesting patterns that some

01:54:29.670 --> 01:54:31.730
of this pottery looks
very similar

01:54:31.730 --> 01:54:33.900
to the clay from [inaudible].

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:36.180
So [inaudible] is an
important area of trade

01:54:36.180 --> 01:54:37.480
between the Indus Valley.

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:39.250
And I'm not presenting
the results here.

01:54:39.250 --> 01:54:41.800
Because we're still in
the process of analysis.

01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:44.510
A recent excavations
from Ras al Hadd

01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:48.590
which is a small little
seaport settlement.

01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:50.290
I mean, it's not
even a settlement.

01:54:50.290 --> 01:54:51.700
It's less than a
hectare in area.

01:54:51.700 --> 01:54:54.360
It's where they got the stuff
off the boats, and they sat

01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:59.400
by the beach and barbequed some
fish and then sent stuff inland.

01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:02.780
And we found a perforated
jar fragment here.

01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:04.350
So they were making beer

01:55:04.350 --> 01:55:07.230
or barley [inaudible]
we call it in Urdu.

01:55:07.230 --> 01:55:10.040
A special barley drink
using this reverse strainer

01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:13.670
at the beach near where
these ships were coming.

01:55:13.670 --> 01:55:17.020
And we also found
a goblet fragment.

01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:21.290
This type of goblet of the
Indus Valley was only used

01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:22.590
in the big cities.

01:55:22.590 --> 01:55:24.520
It was never used in
a small settlements

01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:26.990
because it's a disposable
vessel.

01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:29.040
You go to the shop, you
buy some [inaudible]

01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:30.620
or you buy some beer.

01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:32.950
You drink it, you throw it away.

01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:36.280
Why would somebody
carry a disposable cup

01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:40.440
from Mohenjodaro all
the way to Ras al Hadd?

01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:42.060
And the only suggestion
that I have is

01:55:42.060 --> 01:55:44.240
that they wanted
to keep a memento.

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:45.780
They had been to the big city.

01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:49.090
They brought this back to show
their family back in [inaudible]

01:55:49.090 --> 01:55:51.690
and they brought it
there, and it broke.

01:55:51.690 --> 01:55:52.990
[Laughter] So they
get all the way back

01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:54.290
to Oman, and then it broke.

01:55:54.290 --> 01:55:57.350
So we found a sherd of
this in Ras al Hadd.

01:55:57.350 --> 01:56:00.820
So the question then
is, pottery like this?

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:04.050
Why would somebody bring
elaborate wedding ceremony

01:56:04.050 --> 01:56:06.050
vessels to Oman?

01:56:06.050 --> 01:56:08.090
Probably because they
want to get married

01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:10.060
or they're bringing
somebody who they want

01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:12.870
to give this to as a gift.

01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:14.580
We also have evidence of toys.

01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:19.290
So Salut is so important because
we have Indus-style toys.

01:56:19.290 --> 01:56:20.690
This is a pottery disc made

01:56:20.690 --> 01:56:23.530
from Indus pottery only
found in the Indus Valley.

01:56:23.530 --> 01:56:26.010
And you stack them
up, and you throw a,

01:56:26.010 --> 01:56:28.460
a ball at it, and
you play a game.

01:56:28.460 --> 01:56:30.410
We find Indus whistles.

01:56:30.410 --> 01:56:32.170
This is a bird whistle
from Salut.

01:56:32.170 --> 01:56:34.230
So these are children's toys.

01:56:34.230 --> 01:56:36.560
So this means that
people who are living

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:40.620
in Salut are acculturating their
own children into traditions

01:56:40.620 --> 01:56:44.550
that are relating
to the Indus Valley.

01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:46.270
So then why are they coming?

01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:48.860
I mentioned this a bit earlier.

01:56:48.860 --> 01:56:50.160
They're getting copper.

01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:51.460
They're getting shell.

01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:53.500
And probably many other things
which we still need to study.

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:56.080
And they're bringing these
things to the Indus Valley

01:56:56.080 --> 01:56:59.300
to show exotic materials
from this other region.

01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:02.610
In return, materials are
coming from the Indus here.

01:57:02.610 --> 01:57:04.390
The question is who
are the people coming?

01:57:04.390 --> 01:57:07.870
Are they Magan traders going
to the Indus and coming back?

01:57:07.870 --> 01:57:10.560
Are they Indus traders
coming to Magan?

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:13.940
And if they're form the
Indus Valley to Maga,

01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:16.020
we don't find any
shell bangles here.

01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:18.260
So either the women are coming

01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:21.140
and they're taking
all their bangles off.

01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:22.870
Or the women are not coming.

01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:24.170
Because in the Indus Valley,

01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:27.690
every settlement has
filled with bangles.

01:57:27.690 --> 01:57:29.950
And there are not,
there's not a single bangle

01:57:29.950 --> 01:57:33.080
in any archeological site
in all of Oman except

01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:34.380
for Ras al [inaudible].

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:36.480
At 3700 BC.

01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:38.100
So no bangles are being used.

01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:40.350
So this is the next
mystery is what is happening

01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:42.200
to the bangles in Oman?

01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:44.210
And who are coming there,
and what are they doing?

01:57:44.210 --> 01:57:47.920
In Mesopotamia we have
bangles from the Indus Valley.

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:49.660
In Susa we have bangles.

01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:51.610
In [inaudible] we have bangles.

01:57:51.610 --> 01:57:55.550
We have bangles in everywhere
else but not in Oman.

01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:58.170
So in summary, we have evidence

01:57:58.170 --> 01:58:01.800
for really important domestic
ritual Indus-style pottery

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:04.210
at both coastal and
inland sites.

01:58:04.210 --> 01:58:07.330
Maybe made by Indus or
Indus-trained potters.

01:58:07.330 --> 01:58:09.350
Used by Magan or Indus traders.

01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:12.750
Who preferred to eat
food that was cooked

01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:14.800
in Indus-style pottery.

01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:16.100
They didn't want
to eat it roasted,

01:58:16.100 --> 01:58:17.400
they didn't want to eat it raw.

01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:20.250
They wanted to eat it cooked
in a handi and prepared

01:58:20.250 --> 01:58:22.010
and served in a certain way.

01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:24.720
They wanted to drink
beer or [inaudible]

01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:28.650
or [inaudible] prepared
in Indus-style pottery.

01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:31.520
We also have evidence
of carnelian beads some

01:58:31.520 --> 01:58:33.500
of them possibly made locally.

01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:35.950
And then Indus seals carved
with local techniques.

01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:38.010
So I'm going to leave
you with this question.

01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:39.950
We have a lot more work to do,

01:58:39.950 --> 01:58:42.620
but I think we have some very
interesting exchanges now

01:58:42.620 --> 01:58:44.780
between Oman and
the Indus Valley.

01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:47.620
And I'm hoping that the video
can be remade with Indus Valley,

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:52.320
with some component because it's
not just Mesopotamia and Egypt

01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:53.620
that are linking with Oman.

01:58:53.620 --> 01:58:55.390
But the Indus Valley is
a very important place.

01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:57.190
Thank you very much.

01:58:57.190 --> 01:59:04.640
[ Applause ]

01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:06.860
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much,
Professor Kenoyer.

01:59:06.860 --> 01:59:12.030
And now the floor is
open for questions.

01:59:12.030 --> 01:59:17.950
We have about 30
minutes for questions.

01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:22.240
So what is happening?

01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:23.540
[Inaudible]

01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:26.550
&gt;&gt; My thanks-- hello, is it?

01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:28.810
Okay, my, my sincere thanks.

01:59:28.810 --> 01:59:30.110
Ms. Williams.

01:59:30.110 --> 01:59:33.640
I'm curious about the
degradation of your, your sites.

01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:35.650
If you come back every
year, how do you,

01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:39.930
how do you find your sites
that you have worked on?

01:59:39.930 --> 01:59:43.350
And how much work do you
have to get to get them

01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:44.830
to the, how you left them.

01:59:44.830 --> 01:59:48.060
If that is a valid question.

01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:49.360
I don't know.

01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:50.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Kimberly Williams:
We backfill all

01:59:50.660 --> 01:59:52.190
of our tombs and buildings.

01:59:52.190 --> 01:59:57.530
And so when we come back, we
have to remove the backfill.

01:59:57.530 --> 02:00:00.060
In some cases, there
is no backfill.

02:00:00.060 --> 02:00:05.700
And in only in cases where
the structure is secure.

02:00:11.340 --> 02:00:12.710
&gt;&gt; So questions?

02:00:12.710 --> 02:00:15.580
&gt;&gt; There's one over here.

02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:16.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, hi.

02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:18.180
The question's for
Dr. Mark Kenoyer.

02:00:18.180 --> 02:00:19.480
Can you tell us something more

02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:21.210
about the political
administration

02:00:21.210 --> 02:00:24.230
in these two different regions
in specifically what kind

02:00:24.230 --> 02:00:26.050
of taxes and tariffs, if any,

02:00:26.050 --> 02:00:27.560
were they imposing
on each other?

02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:29.730
Did they try to regulate
the trade?

02:00:29.730 --> 02:00:31.270
&gt;&gt; Dr. J Mark Kenoyer:
Between Indus and Oman?

02:00:31.270 --> 02:00:32.570
&gt;&gt; Correct.

02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:34.780
&gt;&gt; Dr. J Mark Kenoyer: So
the Indus cities were ruled

02:00:34.780 --> 02:00:38.090
by a corporate rule where we
don't have a single ruler.

02:00:38.090 --> 02:00:40.670
And the cities had
walls around them.

02:00:40.670 --> 02:00:43.700
Anybody coming into and out of
the city was probably taxed.

02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:46.620
We have a very standardized
system of weights in all

02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:49.570
of the cities in
the Indus Valley.

02:00:49.570 --> 02:00:52.100
Some of those weights
have been found in Oman.

02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:56.830
And in prelim-- primarily
the sites in the UAE.

02:00:56.830 --> 02:00:59.760
So we know that some traders
were coming with weights

02:00:59.760 --> 02:01:03.440
into this area and were using
that same weight system.

02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:06.490
We also have Mesopotamian
weights that may have been used

02:01:06.490 --> 02:01:08.830
in some kind of exchange.

02:01:08.830 --> 02:01:11.630
But as far as we know, we
don't have very much details

02:01:11.630 --> 02:01:15.400
about how the settlements
in Oman were ruled.

02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:16.700
We have towers.

02:01:16.700 --> 02:01:18.000
We're still trying to figure

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:19.530
out what those towers
were function--

02:01:19.530 --> 02:01:20.830
how they were functioning.

02:01:20.830 --> 02:01:23.690
Whether it was with a
clan or a clan leader.

02:01:23.690 --> 02:01:26.570
So the question is, that,
this is a very good question.

02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:30.710
We don't know for the Oman side,
we do know for the Indus side.

02:01:30.710 --> 02:01:33.610
We know that Mesopotamians were
coming here to get materials.

02:01:33.610 --> 02:01:35.870
And, and they talk about
themselves, they're trying

02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:37.280
to conquer the regions.

02:01:37.280 --> 02:01:39.460
So I imagine that it was a bunch

02:01:39.460 --> 02:01:41.800
of separate little
polities spread

02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:44.260
into these different areas
with a big stone tower

02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:45.890
as one of the main centers.

02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:49.020
And then you know alliances
were made between them.

02:01:49.020 --> 02:01:52.820
But we don't have any evidence
of rulers, rulers' names

02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:56.240
or very large population
centers.

02:01:56.240 --> 02:01:57.750
They're relatively small.

02:01:57.750 --> 02:02:00.170
So one of these stone towers
can fit into the corner

02:02:00.170 --> 02:02:01.950
of one neighborhood of Harappa.

02:02:01.950 --> 02:02:03.690
So they're not very big.

02:02:03.690 --> 02:02:06.620
So Harappa's over
150 hectares in area.

02:02:06.620 --> 02:02:08.140
Multiple mounds.

02:02:08.140 --> 02:02:12.390
Mohenjodaro is 250
hectares or 300 hectares.

02:02:12.390 --> 02:02:13.940
So they're huge cities.

02:02:13.940 --> 02:02:16.350
And then these settlements
are relatively small compared

02:02:16.350 --> 02:02:18.560
to that.

02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:20.090
&gt;&gt; For Dr. Williams.

02:02:20.090 --> 02:02:21.880
Can you hear me?

02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:25.070
First of all, thank you very
much for a wonderful panel.

02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:28.200
Dr. Williams for you,
I had a small question.

02:02:28.200 --> 02:02:31.400
You showed one little
engraving of a human figurine.

02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:35.000
I was curious what the
hollowed-out heart would mean.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.300
I was quite curious.

02:02:36.300 --> 02:02:37.900
It was very beautiful.

02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:39.360
That's one question for you.

02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:44.870
And then for Dr. [inaudible]
is that how you say your name?

02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:50.050
Question regarding the
connection potentially

02:02:50.050 --> 02:02:52.980
with [inaudible]
three Persian sites

02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:55.130
in what is now Baluchistan.

02:02:55.130 --> 02:02:58.420
What kind of connection
do you think there is

02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:03.130
with both India as
well as with Oman?

02:03:03.130 --> 02:03:06.240
Also Makan and Makran.

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:09.490
Makran is the historic
name for Baluchistan.

02:03:09.490 --> 02:03:11.690
And I'm curious if Makan

02:03:11.690 --> 02:03:14.750
and Makran have any
connection linguistically.

02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:16.110
Thank you.

02:03:16.110 --> 02:03:17.680
&gt;&gt; Dr. Kimberly Williams:
Shall I [inaudible]?

02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:23.140
The carved relief of the
small circular depression

02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:25.520
on the chest of the individual.

02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:27.280
We're not actually sure.

02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:28.750
That's part of the
carved relief.

02:03:28.750 --> 02:03:30.760
If may be.

02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:32.730
We've had a lot of
conversation about this.

02:03:32.730 --> 02:03:34.150
It is real.

02:03:34.150 --> 02:03:36.010
There is a depression there.

02:03:36.010 --> 02:03:37.800
It is circular.

02:03:37.800 --> 02:03:42.340
There are shell pendants,
if you will.

02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:45.890
And other pendants made
of different material

02:03:45.890 --> 02:03:50.280
that are found from
around that period.

02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:52.550
It is possible that it's meant

02:03:52.550 --> 02:03:53.940
to symbolize something
like that.

02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:58.470
It's also possible that
it's a luck of erosion.

02:03:58.470 --> 02:04:07.520
&gt;&gt; Okay, the, the connections
Magan and Makran, Majan, okay?

02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:12.230
So these are terms which are,
you know, we, we can hear them

02:04:12.230 --> 02:04:14.090
in modern, modern languages.

02:04:14.090 --> 02:04:17.790
I'm sure that most people know
that [inaudible] used to be part

02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:19.090
of the Sultanate of Oman.

02:04:19.090 --> 02:04:21.520
Until 1962 or something
like that, right?

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:24.840
So this was controlled by Oman.

02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:27.850
The Sultanate had
control of that coast.

02:04:27.850 --> 02:04:31.380
And our evidence that we have,
people going back and forth

02:04:31.380 --> 02:04:35.620
from 7000 and I worked in the
site called Ba la [inaudible]

02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:38.820
which is just 55
kilometers from Karachi.

02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:42.230
And I, my student worked in
Balaji which is near Karachi.

02:04:42.230 --> 02:04:45.860
And the smugglers are going back
and forth every day by boat.

02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:49.170
If you need something, you can
get it from Dubai in one day.

02:04:49.170 --> 02:04:50.470
Or two days, you know?

02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:53.390
Because these areas
are not that far apart.

02:04:53.390 --> 02:04:56.580
So I, I don't think we can
really differentiate Magan

02:04:56.580 --> 02:04:58.000
and Makran.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:01.200
They're, I, I kind of
group them together.

02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:02.630
And I think they're
important to think

02:05:02.630 --> 02:05:06.830
about as both sides
of the same sea body.

02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:08.730
People interacting.

02:05:08.730 --> 02:05:10.030
Many of my friends

02:05:10.030 --> 02:05:11.950
in Baluchistan have
family in Muscat.

02:05:11.950 --> 02:05:13.760
And people vice versa.

02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:15.060
Have family in Baluchistan.

02:05:15.060 --> 02:05:18.970
So it's it's something that has
been going on for 7000 years.

02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:27.180
&gt;&gt; I have, I have a
question for the whole panel.

02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:32.050
In, when one looks
at civilizations,

02:05:32.050 --> 02:05:33.770
ancient civilizations.

02:05:33.770 --> 02:05:38.460
There are certain characteristic
features that determine,

02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:43.890
define a civilization
at any point in time.

02:05:43.890 --> 02:05:48.090
As you were looking
at your excavations.

02:05:48.090 --> 02:05:52.560
Are you able to at this stage--
I know it's an early stage

02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:54.710
and you're all digging there.

02:05:54.710 --> 02:06:00.240
Are you able to illicit certain
characteristic about the, the,

02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:03.350
well the civilization?

02:06:03.350 --> 02:06:04.650
The culture?

02:06:04.650 --> 02:06:09.370
Something that defines
it in terms of the region

02:06:09.370 --> 02:06:10.730
that you could say aha!

02:06:10.730 --> 02:06:14.020
This is this type
of civilization?

02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:17.830
And any of you can answer.

02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:19.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

02:06:19.130 --> 02:06:20.430
I mean so I think yeah.

02:06:20.430 --> 02:06:23.770
That's a difficult question
because there's also lots

02:06:23.770 --> 02:06:26.980
of issues as always in
archeology with preservation.

02:06:26.980 --> 02:06:29.840
But I think one of
the key differences

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:34.190
between ancient Magan or ancient
Oman and its surrounding areas.

02:06:34.190 --> 02:06:36.050
And i, I think it's also
important to remember

02:06:36.050 --> 02:06:39.380
that Magan is the name
given to the region.

02:06:39.380 --> 02:06:42.700
By Mesopotamian people,
by the cuneiform texts.

02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:44.630
So we don't actually
know the people living

02:06:44.630 --> 02:06:46.660
within Magan referred
to themselves

02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:47.960
as the people of Magan.

02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:50.390
But one of the big
differences is there's

02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:53.660
so little evidence
for social hierarchy.

02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:56.600
So especially when you
compare it to Mesopotamia

02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:59.720
and what's happening
in Elam and Iran.

02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:02.850
Where there's you know
massive cemeteries

02:07:02.850 --> 02:07:05.150
where people were
actually sacrificed

02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:08.060
to be interred with
their rulers.

02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:11.880
We have nothing like
that in, in ancient Oman.

02:07:11.880 --> 02:07:14.900
And instead, it seems like
there's a real emphasis on,

02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:17.010
on kind of community
togetherness.

02:07:17.010 --> 02:07:18.360
And we see that in the tombs

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:21.930
because while there are
these kind of elite objects

02:07:21.930 --> 02:07:26.020
like you know objects or
personal ornamentation from,

02:07:26.020 --> 02:07:28.900
from Harappa and also
really nice stone vessels

02:07:28.900 --> 02:07:30.640
that are coming from
Iran as well.

02:07:30.640 --> 02:07:33.010
They're not specifically
interred

02:07:33.010 --> 02:07:34.480
with any single individual.

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.580
Instead, they're just placed
in the tomb [inaudible].

02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:40.050
So I think that's an
important feature of,

02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:43.270
of the differentiates
Magan from its neighbors.

02:07:43.270 --> 02:07:44.800
Yeah.

02:07:44.800 --> 02:07:48.940
&gt;&gt; Would any of you
like to add something?

02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:52.620
&gt;&gt; I have nothing.

02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:54.950
I agree with him.

02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:56.250
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

02:07:56.250 --> 02:07:57.550
&gt;&gt; I'll follow up.

02:07:57.550 --> 02:08:02.400
But, but we do see, as time
goes on that that changes a bit.

02:08:02.400 --> 02:08:04.510
So as we move from
the Hafit Period,

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:06.070
we start to see people interred

02:08:06.070 --> 02:08:08.940
with specific objects
just for them.

02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:12.350
And then we move into this time

02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:16.090
where individual identity
is entirely removed

02:08:16.090 --> 02:08:19.380
by the breaking of the bodies.

02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:23.670
What's interesting is that
if you go down to [inaudible]

02:08:23.670 --> 02:08:25.240
or if you go all the way

02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:28.240
into the furthest
parts of the Emirates.

02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:32.340
Go to Umanar Island, you see
the same exact mortuary ritual.

02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:36.580
So that's something that there's
a cultural continuity on that,

02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:42.820
on the northern part of Oman
that despite the onslaught

02:08:42.820 --> 02:08:46.530
of people coming from many
different civilizations,

02:08:46.530 --> 02:08:50.290
it's, they maintain that.

02:08:50.290 --> 02:08:53.170
&gt;&gt; I would just add that
the presence of seals

02:08:53.170 --> 02:08:55.340
with what could be some form

02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:58.520
of possible writing is a
very important indicator

02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:01.100
of individual ownership
and power

02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:05.830
that links certain
individuals in Oman in the sites

02:09:05.830 --> 02:09:09.250
that have been found in Misar
and Salut and other places

02:09:09.250 --> 02:09:11.820
in [inaudible] that
show that they are,

02:09:11.820 --> 02:09:15.280
they are appropriating a
form of identity that is used

02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:18.520
in Mesopotamia, in
Iran, in Indus Valley.

02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:20.910
But using it from a stylistic

02:09:20.910 --> 02:09:24.160
and a cultural perspective
that's their [inaudible].

02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:26.330
So they're not copying
Indus Valley seals.

02:09:26.330 --> 02:09:28.640
They're not copying
Mesopotamian seals.

02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:34.810
But they are using
certain, chlorite which some

02:09:34.810 --> 02:09:37.810
of it is actually reused
vessels traded from Iran

02:09:37.810 --> 02:09:39.110
that have been broken.

02:09:39.110 --> 02:09:41.170
And it's so nice and
beautiful to carve,

02:09:41.170 --> 02:09:42.470
that it's easy to carve.

02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:44.790
And you use one of
those to make a seal.

02:09:44.790 --> 02:09:46.600
But they're doing it
with an indigenous style.

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:48.570
So that's the stuff
that I was able to study

02:09:48.570 --> 02:09:51.360
which really showed a
local style of carving

02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:53.130
which is totally distinct.

02:09:53.130 --> 02:09:56.070
And indicative of local elites.

02:09:56.070 --> 02:09:58.270
But some, you don't make
a seal to stamp something

02:09:58.270 --> 02:10:00.200
if you don't have
something to control.

02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:06.030
So there are some people there
who are appropriating that.

02:10:06.030 --> 02:10:07.360
&gt;&gt; Okay. Questions?

02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:09.700
&gt;&gt; Two quick questions,
if I, if I may.

02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:12.170
The first to Dr. Williams.

02:10:12.170 --> 02:10:16.740
You, you hinted at a more
significant meaning for corridor

02:10:16.740 --> 02:10:21.620
in an umm an-Nar tomb beyond
perhaps a practical passage.

02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:24.180
So I was wondering if you
could say something about that.

02:10:24.180 --> 02:10:27.280
And then the second question
is for Mr. Dollarhide.

02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:30.570
You had made reference
to the approximate dating

02:10:30.570 --> 02:10:34.170
of the petroglyphs that you
found to-- I can't remember.

02:10:34.170 --> 02:10:36.930
Early or mid-Iron Age.

02:10:36.930 --> 02:10:40.420
And so I was wondering if
you could just say something

02:10:40.420 --> 02:10:43.080
about how you determine
that date.

02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:45.070
Thank you.

02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:48.410
&gt;&gt; Dr. Kimberly Williams: So
with regard to the corridor,

02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:49.910
there's evidence
in Umm an-Nar tombs

02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:54.850
that the body was interred
and then taken apart.

02:10:54.850 --> 02:10:58.020
And pieces were organized
by skeletal element

02:10:58.020 --> 02:10:59.900
in different chambers.

02:10:59.900 --> 02:11:03.740
Potentially moving through the
different rooms of the tomb.

02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:08.410
Some of them, some of the tombs
do not have multiple chambers.

02:11:08.410 --> 02:11:10.120
Some of them have
multiple chambers,

02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:11.450
but they can't communicate.

02:11:11.450 --> 02:11:13.420
So there's no way to get
into the other chamber

02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:16.340
without going up
and over the wall.

02:11:16.340 --> 02:11:18.710
This tomb has a corridor.

02:11:18.710 --> 02:11:22.960
And this is something I'm
working on now so I'll be brief.

02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:27.210
But if you think of
Neolithic [inaudible]

02:11:27.210 --> 02:11:31.100
and long mounds in,
in Western Europe.

02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:34.260
And think of the theory
behind the development

02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:40.660
of chambered tombs and very
similar actions of moving bodies

02:11:40.660 --> 02:11:45.800
between these chambers over
time related to mortuary ritual

02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:48.400
that we can't put our finger on.

02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:52.430
I think that this is
a similar situation

02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:55.380
because of the evidence of
movement through the chambers.

02:11:55.380 --> 02:11:59.260
And so since [inaudible] tomb
has this central corridor

02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:02.350
that allows communication
to all of the chambers,

02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:04.500
I think we may be able.

02:12:04.500 --> 02:12:06.660
And because it's
a closed context.

02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:11.290
I think we may be
able to consider

02:12:11.290 --> 02:12:12.590
that a little more deeply.

02:12:12.590 --> 02:12:13.890
&gt;&gt; Mr. Eli Dollarhide: Yeah,

02:12:13.890 --> 02:12:17.190
and then about the dating
for the petroglyphs.

02:12:17.190 --> 02:12:21.000
So that is of course a
very difficult thing to do

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:24.550
because there's no artifacts
that we can directly associate

02:12:24.550 --> 02:12:25.850
with those petroglyphs.

02:12:25.850 --> 02:12:28.190
However, right next to those.

02:12:28.190 --> 02:12:30.240
So those all those
petroglyphs were spread

02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:32.230
over five wadi boulders.

02:12:32.230 --> 02:12:34.040
And then immediately adjacent

02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:37.150
to that was a large
Iron Age cemetery area.

02:12:37.150 --> 02:12:40.540
And so and also on the
petroglyphs themselves,

02:12:40.540 --> 02:12:42.080
there's lots of weaponry.

02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:46.520
That looks similar to objects
found from the late Iron Age

02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:49.690
or early pre-Islamic Period.

02:12:49.690 --> 02:12:53.340
So we're, we're not, we're
not certain about that dating.

02:12:53.340 --> 02:12:56.930
But it seems that that's likely
and also if you look [inaudible]

02:12:56.930 --> 02:12:59.660
of petroglyphs with
that same motif.

02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:02.330
Which does show up all
across Southeastern Arabia.

02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:06.050
They're often very, very
close to late Iron Age

02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:08.490
or early pre-Islamic features.

02:13:08.490 --> 02:13:12.580
So, so that is somewhat
contentious, definitely.

02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:24.850
And I will just say and there
are camels, domesticated camels

02:13:24.850 --> 02:13:26.150
in the petroglyphs as well.

02:13:26.150 --> 02:13:28.750
So we definitely know that it's
no earlier than the Iron Age.
