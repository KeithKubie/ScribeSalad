00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.130
More evidence that having a baby may in fact
be extremely crappy!

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:09.710
I stand by my theory that we should all opt
for PUPPIES instead.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.520
Hello hello everyone, Laci Green here for
DNews.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.890
Our society tends to frame having a new baby
as something that's really exciting and wonderful...and

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.939
that's probably true for most.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.009
But for some, it can bring an onslaught of
serious challenges.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.210
Postpartum Depression, or PPD, is a type of
depression experienced mostly by new moms

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.689
that is very severe and can last several months
or years.

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.020
It goes beyond mood swings and anxiety - which
are common after-birth experiences.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.079
PPD interferes with her ability to handle
everyday tasks by causing severe mood swings,

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.350
feelings of shame and inadequacy, difficulty
bonding with the infant, and perhaps even

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.840
thoughts about harming them.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.920
Up to 1 in 5 women may experience PPD after
they've given birth.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.039
The main cause is thought to be hormonal,
brought on by the fact that estrogen and progesterone

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.649
rapidly drop after childbirth.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.100
But, it's not all physical.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.610
It can also be brought on by the stress of
a new baby, lifestyle changes, a lack of support,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.900
sleep deprivation--which may be at the heart
of a new study published in the journal Pediatrics

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.159
examining PPD in fathers.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.100
The study looked at over 10,000 young fathers
for about 20 years and found that between

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.550
5 and 10% of them experienced clinical depression
in their first 5 years of being a dad.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.520
This was only true for guys who became dads
in their 20s who lived with their children.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.350
The scientists don't know what's causing the
PPD in fathers, but since there are no physical

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.150
changes, it's likely brought on by the lifestyle
changes that come with a new baby.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.890
They noted that the transition to fatherhood
can be a challenging one -- especially when

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.590
you're young; you know, you might not have
a stable job or have married life itself fully

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.590
worked out yet.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.460
The mental health status of parents is obviously
really important, not just because their quality

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.600
of life is at stake, but the baby's as well.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.860
The first few months after an infant is born
is when parent-infant attachment happens.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.570
It's the basis for the baby's relationship
with their caregivers as well as the outside

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.570
world.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.450
Studies have found that mothers with PPD have
a harder time being that mediator.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.259
Her personal challenges can cause a baby to
develop a more fearful and suspicious disposition

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.820
toward life and other people in the future.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.880
A mother with PPD has also been linked to
behavioral problems in children.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.119
Scientists are now examining how the infant's
attachment to the FATHER plays a role when

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.000
the father is afflicted with PPD.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.069
So heyyyyy, pretty grim stuff.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.750
But - it's a reality for a lot of people,
and fortunately, there are many therapeutic

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.610
and prescription treatments available to help
parents cope so they can feel like themselves

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.190
again and get on with their lives.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.150
YAAAAY THANKS SCIENCE FOR HELPING PEOPLE.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.889
And thank YOU for watching, we'll see you
next time with more DNews updates!
