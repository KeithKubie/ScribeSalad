well so there's malevolence that has to

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120
well so there's malevolence that has to
 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.490
well so there's malevolence that has to
be contended with and then the other

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500
be contended with and then the other
 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.320
be contended with and then the other
element is that you have to contend with

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330
element is that you have to contend with
 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.870
element is that you have to contend with
the tragedy of life and that so in the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880
the tragedy of life and that so in the
 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.120
the tragedy of life and that so in the
in the passion of the christ' did that

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130
in the passion of the christ' did that
 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.440
in the passion of the christ' did that
in that story Christ of course

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450
in that story Christ of course
 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.390
in that story Christ of course
encounters Satan in the desert and so

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
encounters Satan in the desert and so
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.010
encounters Satan in the desert and so
that's and is tempted there and so

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020
that's and is tempted there and so
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.220
that's and is tempted there and so
that's the encounter with evil

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230
that's the encounter with evil
 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.240
that's the encounter with evil
architecting and then the crucifixion

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250
architecting and then the crucifixion
 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.640
architecting and then the crucifixion
itself is the encounter with the tragedy

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
itself is the encounter with the tragedy
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.500
itself is the encounter with the tragedy
of life right it's betrayal and death

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
of life right it's betrayal and death
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.410
of life right it's betrayal and death
voluntarily accepted and so I understood

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
voluntarily accepted and so I understood
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.480
voluntarily accepted and so I understood
that that was a symbolic representation

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490
that that was a symbolic representation
 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.900
that that was a symbolic representation
of the logos and that that was the they

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
of the logos and that that was the they
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.990
of the logos and that that was the they
what would you say the embodied

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000
what would you say the embodied
 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.639
what would you say the embodied
manifestation of this heroic path that

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
manifestation of this heroic path that
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.130
manifestation of this heroic path that
mediated between these two extremes that

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140
mediated between these two extremes that
 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.750
mediated between these two extremes that
was really useful like that was a really

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
was really useful like that was a really
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.299
was really useful like that was a really
useful discovery for me and because

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
useful discovery for me and because
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.700
useful discovery for me and because
there was implications to it too and and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
there was implications to it too and and
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470
there was implications to it too and and
and profound implications that also

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
and profound implications that also
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.869
and profound implications that also
seemed to work out in relationship to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879
seemed to work out in relationship to
 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.250
seemed to work out in relationship to
what I was learning about clinical

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260
what I was learning about clinical
 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.990
what I was learning about clinical
psychology so for example one of the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
psychology so for example one of the
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.459
psychology so for example one of the
things you do if you're a clinical

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469
things you do if you're a clinical
 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.310
things you do if you're a clinical
psychologist is you help people learn to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
psychologist is you help people learn to
 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.189
psychologist is you help people learn to
encounter things that they're afraid of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
encounter things that they're afraid of
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.260
encounter things that they're afraid of
in a controlled manner and they get less

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
in a controlled manner and they get less
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.789
in a controlled manner and they get less
they don't get less afraid they get

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799
they don't get less afraid they get
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.359
they don't get less afraid they get
braver

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369
braver
 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.640
braver
so you actually act out the process of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
so you actually act out the process of
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.590
so you actually act out the process of
confrontation with tragedy voluntary

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
confrontation with tragedy voluntary
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.420
confrontation with tragedy voluntary
confrontation with tragedy and that's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
confrontation with tragedy and that's
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100
confrontation with tragedy and that's
curative it doesn't matter if you're

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110
curative it doesn't matter if you're
 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.690
curative it doesn't matter if you're
exposing them to their past or the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
exposing them to their past or the
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.160
exposing them to their past or the
present or things they're worried about

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
present or things they're worried about
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.810
present or things they're worried about
in the future as long as they decide to

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
in the future as long as they decide to
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.359
in the future as long as they decide to
do it voluntarily they get stronger and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369
do it voluntarily they get stronger and
 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.190
do it voluntarily they get stronger and
better so you think well what's the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
better so you think well what's the
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.289
better so you think well what's the
limit to that well the limit is to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
limit to that well the limit is to
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.440
limit to that well the limit is to
accept the limitations and catastrophes

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
accept the limitations and catastrophes
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.749
accept the limitations and catastrophes
of your own mortality voluntarily and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
of your own mortality voluntarily and
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.149
of your own mortality voluntarily and
and that's the potentially the proper

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
and that's the potentially the proper
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.980
and that's the potentially the proper
pathway through life or at least it's

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990
pathway through life or at least it's
 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.100
pathway through life or at least it's
the least bad pathway through life which

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
the least bad pathway through life which
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.140
the least bad pathway through life which
is something you know and then I think

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
is something you know and then I think
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.179
is something you know and then I think
the same can be said fairly decisively

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
the same can be said fairly decisively
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.960
the same can be said fairly decisively
for the willingness to grapple with with

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970
for the willingness to grapple with with
 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.230
for the willingness to grapple with with
malevolence on a personal and individual

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
malevolence on a personal and individual
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.050
malevolence on a personal and individual
level you know on so anyways I started

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
level you know on so anyways I started
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.420
level you know on so anyways I started
to lecture about that and and and to lay

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
to lecture about that and and and to lay
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.980
to lecture about that and and and to lay
out those ideas more and more clearly

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
out those ideas more and more clearly
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.510
out those ideas more and more clearly
over the years as I've been lecturing

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
over the years as I've been lecturing
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.420
over the years as I've been lecturing
and that's what I did for TD Ontario and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
and that's what I did for TD Ontario and
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.550
and that's what I did for TD Ontario and
I think that that's why the lectures

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
I think that that's why the lectures
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.100
I think that that's why the lectures
became popular because you know I'd put

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110
became popular because you know I'd put
 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.050
became popular because you know I'd put
some words to ideas that people already

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
some words to ideas that people already
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.449
some words to ideas that people already
knew and could revitalize a symbolic

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459
knew and could revitalize a symbolic
 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.369
knew and could revitalize a symbolic
vocabulary that people had become

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379
vocabulary that people had become
 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.410
vocabulary that people had become
divorced from and and that there is a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420
divorced from and and that there is a
 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.820
divorced from and and that there is a
hole in the culture

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
hole in the culture
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.280
hole in the culture
where those ideas needed to be and so

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
where those ideas needed to be and so
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.070
where those ideas needed to be and so
people found that they were while people

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
people found that they were while people
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.630
people found that they were while people
tell me when they come and talk to me

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640
tell me when they come and talk to me
 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.790
tell me when they come and talk to me
they said well when you're talking it's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
they said well when you're talking it's
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.470
they said well when you're talking it's
like I already know what you're saying

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
like I already know what you're saying
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.970
like I already know what you're saying
but I don't have the words for it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
but I don't have the words for it
 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.950
but I don't have the words for it
it's like well that's exactly what our

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960
it's like well that's exactly what our
 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.470
it's like well that's exactly what our
archetypal story is like is that you all

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480
archetypal story is like is that you all
 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.300
archetypal story is like is that you all
know the story you just don't know you

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310
know the story you just don't know you
 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.760
know the story you just don't know you
know it or you know it a level that you

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770
know it or you know it a level that you
 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.940
know it or you know it a level that you
can't articulate but you still recognize

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
can't articulate but you still recognize
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.560
can't articulate but you still recognize
it when you see it and you still act it

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570
it when you see it and you still act it
 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.090
it when you see it and you still act it
out and you see it in other people but

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100
out and you see it in other people but
 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.490
out and you see it in other people but
it's really really really good to have

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
it's really really really good to have
 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.130
it's really really really good to have
the words and that's partly why you

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140
the words and that's partly why you
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.660
the words and that's partly why you
should be very careful about what you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
should be very careful about what you
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.090
should be very careful about what you
say and particularly careful about what

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100
say and particularly careful about what
 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.460
say and particularly careful about what
you write
