00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:16.119
Helicopters will drop like a rock when the
engine shuts down.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.630
In fact, you have a better chance at surviving
in a helicopter when the engine fails than

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.349
you do in an airplane.

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.269
Helicopters are designed specifically to allow
pilots to have a reasonable chance of landing

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.489
them safely in the case where the engine stops
working during flight, often with no damage

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.489
at all.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.420
They accomplish this via autorotation of the
main rotor blades.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.400
Further, when seeking a helicopter pilot’s
license, one has to practice landing using

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.129
this no-power technique.

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.249
When practicing, instead of actually shutting
the engine off completely though, they usually

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.559
just turn the engine down enough to disengage
it from the rotor.

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.100
This way, if the student encounters a problem
during a no-power landing, the helicopter

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.829
can be throttled back up to avoid an accident.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.780
Given that this isn’t an option during actual
engine failure, it’s critical for helicopter

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.119
pilots to practice this until they have it
down pat.

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.440
A landing via autorotation is also sometimes
necessary if the rear rotor blades stop functioning

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.210
properly, no longer countering for the torque
of the main rotor blades, so the helicopter

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.720
will spin if the engine isn’t turned off.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.100
Whether this happens and the pilot shuts off
the engine or in the case of actual engine

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.870
failure, once the engine drops below a certain
number of revolutions per minute, relative

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.140
to the rotor RPM rate, a special clutch mechanism,
called a freewheeling unit, disengages the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.530
engine from the main rotor automatically.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.600
This allows the main rotor to spin without
resistance from the engine.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.120
Once the engine fails or otherwise is shut
off, the pilot must immediately lower the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.050
pitch, reducing lift and drag, and the helicopter
will begin to descend.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.220
If they don’t do this quick enough, allowing
the RPM of the main rotor to drop too far,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.710
they’ll then lose control of the helicopter
and will likely not get it back.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.340
When this happens, it may well drop like a
rock.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.320
However, this isn’t typical because as soon
as the freewheeling unit disengages the engine,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.560
the pilot is trained to respond appropriately
immediately.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.530
Exactly what the correct glide angle is to
maintain optimal rotor RPM varies with different

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.260
helicopter designs, but this information is
readily available in the helicopter’s manual.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.100
The glide angle also varies based on weather
conditions (wind, temperature, etc.), weight,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.010
altitude, and airspeed, but in all cases a
correct glide angle has the effect of producing

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.520
an upward flow of air that will spin the main
rotor at some optimal RPM, storing kinetic

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.420
energy in the blades.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.120
As the helicopter approaches the ground, the
pilot must then get rid of most of their forward

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.140
motion and slow the decent using the stored
up kinetic energy in the rotors.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.040
If done perfectly, the landing will be quite
gentle.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.590
They accomplish this by executing a flare,
pitching the nose up, at the right moment.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.060
This will also have the effect of transferring
some of that energy from the forward momentum

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.200
into the main rotor, making it spin faster,
which will further allow for a smooth landing.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.849
Because the flare will often need to be somewhat
dramatic, the tricky part here is making sure

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.970
that the rear of the helicopter doesn’t
hit the ground.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.360
Ideally the pilot executes the flare (hopefully
stopping most all the forward motion and slowing

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.040
the decent to almost nothing), then levels
the nose out just before touchdown.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.050
Autorotation may sound like a fairly complex
and difficult thing to do, but according to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.530
one instructor I briefly chatted with about
this, it’s really not all that difficult

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.230
compared to a lot of other aspects of flying
a helicopter.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.540
In fact, he stated that most students have
a lot more trouble when they first try things

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.770
like hovering, than they do when they first
try a no-power landing.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.629
Granted, this is partially because students
don’t try autorotation landings until they

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.400
are near the end of their training, so they
are more skilled than when they first try

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.410
a lot of other maneuvers, but still.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.460
It’s apparently not nearly as difficult
as it sounds and most of the problems students

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:16.769
have just stem from being nervous at descending
at a higher rate than normal.
