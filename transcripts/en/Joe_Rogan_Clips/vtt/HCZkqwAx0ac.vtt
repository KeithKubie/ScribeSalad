1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.000
The Joe Rogan experience.
Is that what you enjoyed the most about the stand up?

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.880
Yeah.
Uh,

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.300
no dramatic films I probably enjoy the most because I wanted to do that when I

4
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:12.960
was a kid,
I discovered that films existed.
I broke into Pinewood Studios,

5
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:16.590
one of our big studios when I was 15 broken.
Yeah.

6
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.970
Look like illegally.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Got It.
Yeah.
Well,
I,

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.570
I was watching a film battle of Britain and at the end it says filmed on

8
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:28.530
location in Spain and anyway,
at Pinewood Studios,

9
00:00:28.531 --> 00:00:32.790
I a heath bucks and I in the 70s and then remember we didn't have videos,

10
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:35.130
we couldn't freeze things over.
You'd have to scribble things down.

11
00:00:35.131 --> 00:00:38.790
So I was scribbling down stuff off the end of films and I said,
I buy mysterious.

12
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.240
He was bucks.
Okay.
[inaudible] Ivy hate.
What does that,
but it was a bucks.
Okay.

13
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.810
Bucks a shot for Buckinghamshire.
That's to play either heath must be a town,

14
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.960
it's a weird name.
Town city,
village them to be a village or a town.

15
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.180
So I've got a map of the United Kingdom,

16
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:55.050
which has alphabetically every town and village and city.

17
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.390
They're going listed alphabetically.

18
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.240
And I went all the way down and I felt I are,
he's,
but okay.
That's where it is.

19
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:03.360
So I took a train from my,
the south coast of England,
up to London,

20
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.560
a tube train and underground train that to play school oxfords and a bus to
this,

21
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.150
this roundabout.
And I got off.
I said,
uh,
Pinewood Studios,
and they said,

22
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:13.620
it's about half a mile down that road.

23
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:17.220
So I marched down the road and I got to the big gabled entrance where all the

24
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:20.790
big stars would come in.
And I went up and I haven't got this bit worked out.

25
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:24.270
So I went up and I said,
um,
um,
I'm going to,

26
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.150
I'm going to be in films,
I'm going to,
can I come in please?
Uh,

27
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.890
it's what I've got to,
I've to make.
I gonna I want to be an actor.
Can I come in?

28
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.090
I want to just piss off kid.
No,
no.
It's just what I need.

29
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:43.170
Just told me to piss off.
And I thought,
no,
I've come miles.
This is a big,

30
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.470
so I thought there must be another way in.

31
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.690
So I went up and there was another entrance that was near it,

32
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:52.440
but it wasn't the main star enters.
It was just the,
they're kind of more,

33
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.620
Laurie enters the truck entrance,
the bringing stuff in,

34
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.930
and I saw people going into that.
There was a draw bridge,

35
00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:01.320
a bit like where eagles dare the film either.
Anyway,

36
00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.040
someone on the gate and some people was showing them passes and stuff and other

37
00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:06.930
people just walking in.
So I thought,
okay,

38
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:08.370
you've got to have the confidence to walk in.

39
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:13.370
So I did the 16 1516 year old confidence and I just marched in and,

40
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.940
and suddenly I was through and I was in,
I was into Bible study.

41
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.840
So then in a spill we've broken the universal.
I broke into into thing.

42
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:26.480
He got a career going pretty immediately and I didn't get nothing.
Good.
Well,

43
00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.830
you're 15 and I know,
here's what it was.
You expect,
what's going to happen?

44
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.070
What was your anticipation?
Anticipation was,

45
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.810
as I've said in a piece of standard that I,
cause I,

46
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.210
I had to walk at a certain speed.
If you're moving a certain speed,

47
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:43.110
I thought no one's going to stop you so you can't creep around looking.

48
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.180
Was this cause they said,
what are you doing here?
You know,
I just thought,

49
00:02:46.181 --> 00:02:49.590
in fact it's kind of loose inside studios and no one really knows what everyone

50
00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:52.710
else is doing,
so you can actually creep her out a bit.

51
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.210
But I move around at certain speed and I sort of March,

52
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.400
I was marching down streets and up arms and past studios and,

53
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.090
and I was hoping someone go,
hey you kid.
Yeah.
Uh,

54
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.340
wait,
you your marching around.
Yeah,

55
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.770
we're doing the film called the monitoring around kids.

56
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.080
A lead kid has just exploded.
Can you continue my,
yeah,
I come out.
You Ran,

57
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.190
can you say words?
Oxen.
String a few words together or gray leave.

58
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.750
I marched out of the same space.
We're done here.

59
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.150
I marched around for two hours and I marched that,

60
00:03:25.151 --> 00:03:27.920
and I have since failed twice or three times in Pie with,
no,

61
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.490
I ain't gonna I want to do.
And whenever you tell them,

62
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:32.440
I go back and I'm actually filming that guy.

63
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.860
I broke in there and I just walk at very slow speeds down streets knowing that

64
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:42.760
anyone could stop me and I go,
I'm just filming around the code.
Just it's,

65
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.240
yeah.
