00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.360
Recently we've been focusing on 
climate change in California's Sierra Nevada

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.060
where about 60% of the state's
water resources come from.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.780
To get climate change projections
in the Sierra Nevada right

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.300
we have to incorporate a process
that we call snow albedo feedback.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.520
All surfaces have a property called albedo.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.600
It's the degree to which the surface reflects sunlight.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.120
You've encountered the effects of albedo when you've walked across an asphalt surface on a hot sunny day.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.940
Dark surfaces like asphalt and soil
absorb more sunlight and get warmer.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.660
Light surfaces like snow reflect
more sunlight and stay cooler.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.380
So what happens with climate change in a snowy place?

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.060
Temperatures rise and snow melts.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.460
At the snow margins, where snow is often
 shallow, it melts completely.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.260
And snow cover retreats.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.120
Now we have a land surface that
used to be covered in snow but now is not.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.780
That newly exposed land surface has a lower albedo.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.480
So it absorbs a lot more sunlight
and that area gets even warmer.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.700
the extra warming causes more snow to melt
and snow cover retreats even further.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.120
This creates a circular process
known as a positive feedback.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.740
If you want to model future climate accurately,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.680
You have to incorporate positive feedbacks
like snow albedo feedback into your research.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.060
California's snowpack is already
experiencing the effects of climate change.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.580
We found that in recent years, in both dry and wet years,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.700
the snowpack is already reduced because of the warming that has occurred over the past century.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.800
So even when we have a big water year
and it seems like there's a lot of snow,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.880
there's actually less snow than there
would be without this warming.
