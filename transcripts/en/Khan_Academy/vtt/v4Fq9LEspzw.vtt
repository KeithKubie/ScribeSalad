00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.370
In the last couple of videos
we saw that looking just

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.800
purely at market capitalization
can be a little

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.190
bit misleading, when you look at
companies that have a good

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.380
bit of leverage or companies
that have a good bit of debt.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.530
For example, if that's the
assets of the company, and

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.181
let's say that they have
this much debt.

00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.810
And this is their equity.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.180
And then let's say they
have some excess cash.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.420
Cash that's not necessary to
actually operate the business.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.150
I'll draw that up here.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.520
So this is excess cash.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.850
Some cash is necessary, and
oftentimes people don't make

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.220
the distinction.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.800
And they'll just view this
as all the cash.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.420
But we really want to separate
the value of the enterprise

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.620
out of the market value
of the equity or the

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.720
value of the debt.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:47.900
So let me just write
all this down.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.230
So this right here, this is
the value of the business.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.480
The enterprise value.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.160
Here is the debt.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.490
There's the debt.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.175
And this is the equity.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.870
And this is a little bit of
a slight, I would say,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:07.190
technicality.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.950
And you don't have to worry
about this if it

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.100
confuses you at all.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.780
When I write the enterprise
here, this is the value of the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.730
business itself.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.060
So it's kind of the operational
assets net of the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.230
operational liabilities.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.560
It's literally-- if you had
to go out in the past two

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.500
examples and buy the pizzeria--
how much net would

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.150
you have to pay for
that pizzeria?

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.150
And that's what we're trying to
figure out right here when

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.440
we're talking about the
enterprise value.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.585
And we saw in the last couple
of videos how you calculate

00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:35.370
it, but it never hurts
to review it.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.070
This is actually one of those
less intuitive calculations

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.380
the first few times you
see it, so it doesn't

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.970
hurt to do it again.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.950
So the first thing to figure out
is, how do you figure out

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.680
the market value
of the equity?

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.400
The book value of the
equity is very easy.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.570
You could go into a company's
balance sheet and they'll

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.070
write down a number.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.120
They'll say, this is what our
accountants say that the book

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.730
value of our equity is worth.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.260
But the market value, figure it
out from what the market's

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.580
willing to pay for a share.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.670
So the market value of equity or
the market cap is equal to

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.520
price per share times the
number of shares.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.240
And that's the market value
of this equity.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.800
And you can see, just even from
this diagram, that the

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.230
enterprise value plus the
non-operating cash or

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.590
investments or liquid
investments, whatever you want

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.280
to call them.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.580
Enterprise value plus the cash
is equal to the debt plus,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.420
let's just say the market cap.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.970
Because we want to know, when we
look at a price, we want to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.230
be able to figure out what
is the market saying the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.970
enterprise value of
the company is?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.500
What is the market value
of the enterprise?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.820
So debt plus-- instead of
equity-- I'll write market

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.020
capitalization, because
it's the same thing.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.150
Market capitalization is the
market's value of the equity

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.840
plus market cap.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.690
So we know market cap.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.240
We can look up the debt on a
company's balance sheet.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.820
We can look up the cash.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.470
So we just subtract cash from
both sides, and we get

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:20.480
enterprise value is equal
to market cap

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.120
plus debt minus cash.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.500
We're just taking cash
onto the right-hand

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.730
side of this equation.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.070
So for example, if I have a
stock that is trading at-

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.650
let's say the price is $10.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.290
And let's say that there
are 1 million shares.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.450
And let's say that the company
has $50 million of debt.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.400
And let's say it has $5 million
of excess cash, what's

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.880
its enterprise value?

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.510
Well, you first figure
out its market cap.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.750
Its market cap is $10 per share
times a million shares.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.670
So that's 10 million shares.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.510
That's the market cap.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.410
You add the debt.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.560
So, plus $50 million.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.760
And once again, I said this in
the last video, it's very

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.390
unintuitive when you figure
out the value of the

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.459
enterprise to add the debt.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.480
And the intuition is that if
someone were to want to buy

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.040
this company from the
stakeholders and be debt free,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.750
they would have to pay these
people the total amount of

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.270
debt, and they'd have to pay
these people the total amount

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.060
of the market value.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.610
So they'd have to pay the
debt plus the equity.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.830
And they get a refund
of the cash.

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.100
This would be extra stuff that
they would be buying that they

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.970
could get money back for.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.260
So you have to pay the equity
holders, you have to pay the

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.720
debt holders, and then you
get a refund of the cash.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.630
And so the enterprise value's
what? $60 million minus 5.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.200
That's $55 million.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.780
Fair enough.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.170
This is all just review of the
enterprise value video.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.980
But the question is, now that
you've figured out enterprise

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.490
value, how do you figure
out if that's a

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.130
fair enterprise value?

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.290
When you looked at market
capitalization you compared

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.440
that to earnings.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.560
The price to earnings ratio.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.880
You were doing this
on a per share.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.320
This is price per share divided
by earnings per share.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.350
This ratio's equivalent to
market cap divided by the

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.810
actual net income
of the company.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.520
Where if you just multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.370
by the number of shares, you get
market cap and net income.

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.490
This is EPS.

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.210
P/E is actually price
per share divided by

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.240
earnings per share.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.880
And that was one way
to look at it.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.210
You could compare
two companies.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.570
And we saw it breaks down if
they have different types of

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.310
capital structure.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.880
So what do you compare
enterprise value to?

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.670
Here we did market cap
to net income.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.450
Enterprise value should
be compared to what?

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.460
Now I made an argument in the
last video that, well if we're

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.340
looking at the enterprise, we
should look at essentially the

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.850
earnings that are popping
out of the enterprise.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.640
We should look at the earnings
that are coming out of this

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.100
asset right here.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.280
And on the very first video
on the income statement, I

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.180
implied that-- let's do
a balance sheet--

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.370
you have your revenue.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.740
Your revenue could be 100.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.730
You have your cost
of goods sold.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.130
Cost of goods sold could be,
let's say it's minus 50.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:24.520
And I'll show you another
convention.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.720
One of the commenters suggested
that I do this

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.100
convention.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.380
Which is actually the most
typical convention for a lot

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.260
of accountants and financial
analysts.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.050
Instead of writing a negative,
they'll write it in

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.720
parentheses.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.000
That means negative.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.270
Minus 50.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:45.060
And then the gross profit
would be 50.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.350
And then, actually I want to
do something a little bit

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.750
interesting.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.830
Let's say that this cost of
goods sold, it involves no

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.170
depreciation or amortization.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.360
And watch those videos if
those words confuse you.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.720
And all of the appreciation and
amortization is actually

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.850
occurring at the corporate
level.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:04.760
So let's say that there
is some SG&amp;A.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.240
But this is without the
depreciation and amortization.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:14.630
So let's say that this
is an expense of 10.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.110
Let's say there's some
depreciation and

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.505
amortization as well.

00:07:18.505 --> 00:07:20.990
D&amp;A.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.250
In the last couple of videos
I kind of grouped.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.490
And that tends to be the case.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:26.540
On a lot of income statements
they won't separate out the

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.060
depreciation and amortization.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.470
And you'll actually have to
look at the cash flow

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.890
statement to figure
out what this is.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.920
And I'm going to do that
in a future video.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.560
But let's say that we actually
do break it out.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.700
Sometimes that does happen.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.200
And let's say that
that's another 5.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.620
Maybe these are in thousands.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.160
And then you're left with
the operating profit.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.740
In this case, which is 50
minus 15, so it's 35.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.010
And then you have things
below that.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.360
You have interest. And I'll do
those just for-- you have the

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.420
non-operating income and
interest and all that.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:01.150
Let me just do that.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:08.160
Interest. Let's say that that is
also 5,000, if that's what

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.430
we care about.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.750
And then you have pre-tax.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.500
I didn't put the non-operating
income.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.820
Let's say this cash isn't
generating anything.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.570
So pre-tax income is 30,000,
if that's what

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:20.710
we're dealing with.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.920
It's getting a little messy.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.480
So then you have taxes.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.390
Let's say it's 1/3.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.380
It's 10,000 of taxes.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:28.630
And then you have earnings.

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:33.409
30 minus 10 is 20,000.

00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:37.250
So I suggested, what part of
this income statement is

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.059
dependent purely on this
piece right here?

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.180
Well all this stuff with
interest, that's

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.570
dependent on the debt.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.810
And essentially taxes is also
dependent on the debt.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.630
Because the more interest
you have, the more

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.500
you can deduct it.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.980
And so all of this down
here is dependent on

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.300
your capital structure.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.620
So if you wanted to look just
what the enterprise value is

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.810
generating, it's generating
the operating profit.

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.220
So I suggested that a pretty
good ratio, although this is

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.200
very non traditional.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.050
It's not very not traditional,
but you don't

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.970
hear it said a lot.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.730
I'd argue that you could look at
EV to operating profit as a

00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.980
good metric.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:36.550
Which in a lot of cases is the
inverse of the return on

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.200
assets, as I defined it
in the first video.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.770
There's a lot of different
return on asset definitions.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.350
But it's essentially saying, for
every dollar of operating

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.940
profit, how much are you paying
for the enterprise.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.010
Which I think is a pretty
good metric.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:52.340
Now, the more conventional
metric that you'll see when

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.100
you see people talk about
enterprise values, enterprise

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.370
value to EBITDA.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.340
And if you go and get a job as
a research analyst at some

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.550
firm, this is going to be
something that you're going to

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.620
be expected to calculate
for a company.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.410
And hopefully talk reasonably
intelligently about it.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.080
So the first question, to talk
reasonably intelligently about

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.720
anything is, what is EBITDA?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:18.460
So EBITDA is Earnings Before
Interest, Taxes, Depreciation

00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.300
and Amortization.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.560
So let's see what that
would be here.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:28.890
So it's earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:29.900
and amortization.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.280
So it's before all
of this stuff.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.920
Actually, let's compare that to

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.120
something we covered before.

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.370
So you have EBITDA.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.660
And you have EBIT.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.660
EBIT is Earnings Before
Interest and Taxes.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:47.520
So EBIT is earnings.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.240
You add back taxes and
interest. You're

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.350
at operating profit.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.530
And I've gone over this in the
past, but the distinction

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:57.220
between operating profit and
EBIT is that EBIT might

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.080
include some non-operating
income, which

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.890
I haven't put here.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:03.790
But if this cash was generating
some profit

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.740
unrelated to the operations
of the business, it'd

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:06.620
be included in EBIT.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.810
It wouldn't be an operating
profit.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.900
But they're usually pretty close
if we're talking about,

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.310
let's say, a non-financial
type of business.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:14.370
So this is EBIT.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.440
And if you want to get EBITDA,
you just add back the

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.670
depreciation and amortization.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.310
So EBITDA would be here.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.440
So the EBIT is 35,000.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.380
If you add that back,
it would be 40,000.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.510
So the EBITDA in this
case is 40.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.360
And if my units are in
thousands, it's 40,000.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.450
Now the question is, why do
people care about EBITDA?

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.710
Why is EBITDA used instead
of operating profit?

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.610
And the logic is that
depreciation and amortization,

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.040
and we did this in the
depreciation and amortization

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.860
videos, these are just
spread-out costs that

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.240
necessarily aren't cash going
out the door in this period.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.390
We saw that this depreciation
and amortization.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:01.120
Maybe this is, I bought
a $100 or $100,000

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.020
object 10 years ago.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:09.250
And every year I depreciate
1/20 of it.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.180
But the cash went out the
door 20 years ago.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.220
And so this depreciation and
amortization in this period,

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.040
it isn't necessarily cash
out of the door.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.350
In fact, it isn't cash
out the door.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.190
We'll talk in future videos
about how do you find out what

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.390
the cash out the door
is in a period.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.175
So it's considered a
non-cash expense.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.580
So when you figure out EBITDA,
when you add back taxes, you

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.290
add back interest, and you
add back depreciation and

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:34.360
amortization.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.820
What you're left with is
essentially, how much raw cash

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.925
is the enterprise
spitting out?

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.950
And a lot of people care about
this because this is an

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.510
indication of, one,
the company's

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:50.150
ability to do things.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:54.010
To do things like pay its
interest, pay its taxes, or

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.630
invest in the business itself.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:03.010
Or another way to view it is,
if you look at EV to EBITDA,

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:06.030
you're saying for every dollar
of raw cash that this

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.360
business spits out.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.490
And let's say I were not to
reinvest in the business or

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:11.590
buy new equipment.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.850
If it's just raw dollars, how
much am I paying for the

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:14.760
enterprise?

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.860
And a general rule of thumb, and
we'll do more on this in

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.290
the future.

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:21.210
I think I'm already well over my
regular time limit, is that

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:26.090
for a very, stable, simple,
non-declining non-growing

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:30.330
business, five times EBITDA is
considered a good valuation.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.340
But what matters more is what
other companies in that

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.490
industry are trading at.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:38.270
So all of these ratios
are better as

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:40.160
relative valuation metrics.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.240
In the future I'll show you how
to do maybe a discounted

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.160
cash flow or a discounted free
cash flow type of analysis.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.410
Or a dividend discount model or
something, so you can kind

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:49.890
of figure out an
absolute value.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.830
But when you're looking in
public markets, when you're

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.330
picking to decide something,
you're also implicitly picking

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.650
not to buy other things.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.690
When you're choosing to sell
something, you're also

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.800
implicitly choosing not
to sell other things.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.110
So relative value starts to
matter a little bit more.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.910
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
