Speaker 1:          00:00:00       There we go. Oh, and we're live. Hello. Okay. And that was that. That's looking that easy. That easy. Yeah. We didn't say very much interesting before it started. No, we were starting and then you just said shut the fuck said, hold that thought. Plus this, uh, this concept of things getting better. And we were talking about war more being too cause as a world war II helmet that um, Shane against the machine is the gentleman's name. He's made me another sculpture and he started making sculptures out of a, these world war two helmets with a lamp underneath it and an actual real world war II ban out as well. And you were saying was a terrible idea that it's going away, you think? Really? Yeah. Real really fast. And you, you mentioned Pinker and that's everything I will say is redundant to Pinker. I mean that I'm a better angels of our nature is one of, I think the most subversive books of our time.

Speaker 1:          00:00:52       You know, people are, there's such a, um, it's a fetish to suffer. It's a fetish to say how bad things are. People getting really off on it. And when you start saying, you know, after you say one death by violence is too many and we got to clean up the environment and duh duh duh duh, duh, say all that stuff and it's all true. But you can also take a breath and say things are getting better. Yeah, I think we need to recognize that. And the problem is there is, there is violence, there is horrible things, there are horrible things in the world. They still exist and now they're magnified because of the fact that we have this ability to look at it on your phone anytime you want to look at it on your computer. When you say one thing, it's the same thing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       I think calories in information are identical, you know, for millions, billion years. Um, the biggest problem, every living thing had was too few calories. And then for a, what may be 75 years, a very small percentage of the animals in the world had this problem of too many calories and there's nothing that prepares anybody for that. We now have more information in one issue of the New York times. Then I'm a 17th century peasant would had in their entire life. So we have this glut of information that we're dealing with about as well as we dealt with calories. I talked about this quite often, but the way I describe it as diet and that most people have a poor diet and then most people's diet is not nutritious. And if you have a poor diet that's not nutritious, your body becomes unhealthy. Well, if you have a poor mental diet, and I've discovered how many people do we talk about this with like three or four people we've been talking about this, like taking in information.

Speaker 1:          00:02:37       You should almost think of it as a mental diet because if you've taken bad information all the time and negative information, I will speak for myself, but I don't think I'm in any way alone. I often forget where I read stuff, so I have to be really careful to not read too much garbage or it just pops up in my head is, Oh, that's real. Right. You know? So I try to go with the new sources that are, I think are pretty reliable. Even if I disagree with them. Like I try to read the times cause I know there's a level to how much they're going to lie. We know, we know where the parameters are. They're lying there, you know, we know where they do the spin and if you just just pop around the web at random, you can't tell what kind of information you're getting.

Speaker 1:          00:03:20       But I also want to add to this, you know, it's, it's exactly the way I feel about drugs, you know, as much as I want to say, this is not right for me. Information has to be out there and all information. Absolutely no gatekeepers, you know. No, I, I completely agree. And I think that we're coming very close to a time where technology allows us to understand what's true and what's not true. We're not there yet, but I think we're, we're really close to being able to have some sort of an ability to read minds to, to decipher information like really clearly. But the problem with reading minds, um, if we could do it to ascertain truth is a truth is very different from what someone believes. You know, if you had a perfect lie detector, it would not help you with criminality at all.

Speaker 1:          00:04:08       Cause you know, people that think they're innocent may very well think they're innocent even if they are not. Oh sure, sure. Yeah, that's a really good point. And you know, another really good point, his memory is very fallible. Oh yeah. C I a, you know, I got a lot of, I've got a lot of shit for this and I talked about it a little bit on, on my podcast, but um, you know, I was in the room with Trump a lot. You know I did two tours. I did two tours of duty. Tell me about that. What does that like? Cause I was supposed to do that show and I passed on it. Yeah. I was like, I don't want to live in New York for three months or whatever. It was. Just seemed like it's wise. Either way. It was a, it was a primetime television show.

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       So it's sold tickets and that is our job. Right. And that's what we do. And I went on with one idea in my head, you know, Annie Duke, you know the poker player she had been on the year before. And I said, um, why am I going on? I mean, I know I'm normally going to sell tickets and that's, that's just a done deal, but where am I going on? What's my real goal? And she said, go on and show that atheist can be kind. That'll be your only goal for the whole show. Oh, because they're going to jump on you for being an atheist. They'll jump all over you for that and just show that you're the one that gets mad the least. So the one that you're the nicest guy on there and you're the hardcore atheist. And I went, okay, that's a good goal. But then you sit in the room and I don't know how well, you know, the president of United States, I don't want to know him at all. Yeah. Um, but you spend, um, uh, bout two or three hours every other day sitting in a room across the table like this with a table. You can't put your hands on, why can't you put your hands on it? Because it might Mar it in. That's hilarious. Put a hand print on it. They literally tell you don't put your hands on the table and you have to sit up straight. And the camera, if you're like the team captain, which by the way, they hate it if you call them team captain,

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       they like to have it, you know, sub sort of business jargon and you're in a, you're in a set. And that's the thing that everybody else on the show would say. We're going into the board room now. And I'd say, no, we're going onto the board room set. So it wasn't a real board room? No, of course not. None of it was really a sound stage. Ah, it was, you know, it was in the Trump towers, but they'd taken over Florida, NBC guts it and puts up this shit. And then you've got your camera that your hero camera that's um, over your shoulder that shooting Trump. So you can't lean into the camera. Right. And they want a little piece of you so you can't lean out of the camera so that you've gotten about two hours where you sit up straight and you can't move side to side and you can't put your hands on the table and you listen to someone speak for two hours that they're good at.

Speaker 2:          00:06:44       Try to edit out to get three minutes where he sounds okay. Okay. What does he have to say for two hours? He will talk. He would talk, I mean, things obviously have changed, but he would talk about, uh, I was reading this blog on the internet that said I didn't sell my property for enough and I bought it for $3 million and I sold it for 4 million. Isn't that a profit? Isn't that a profit? What do you think? Isn't that a profit? Yeah, that would be $1 million profit. Well, they said I sold it for two less than two little, okay. Who was this? There was somebody on the internet. Okay. So, you know, he'd be arguing in front of us with perhaps a 18 year old guy on the internet who thought that Donald Trump should've made more from a real estate deal. And this is something he really concentrates on.

Speaker 2:          00:07:38       He seems to, I'm still to this day, yeah. Obsessed with what anybody says about him. Anytime. It's so odd. And I thought, and I want to say this very clearly, um, I thought he was wonderful at his job. You know, if you had someone who was actually a business person, I'm on that show, it would be the worst show in the world because bill Gates would make proper decisions. Right? And there'd be no surprises. You want someone capricious and crazy, but no filter. That's what you want. Right? And that's what we got. So he makes arbitrary decisions that you try, you know, the human brain tries desperately to make those make sense. And that ends up being some kind of entertainment. And, um, so I actually, uh, actually a Donald Trump jr said to me, and of all the people we've had on this show, you seem like the only person who's ever liked my father.

Speaker 2:          00:08:31       He said, you actually seem to like them. And I said, you know, I have a fascination and to respect and a, um, affection for people who are able to get out of their filters. And I said, some people do that with pure genius, like Bob Dylan. Some people do it with bravery, like Lenny Bruce. Some people do it with drugs. You know, Neil young, perhaps, uh, Jimmy Hendrix perhaps, and most people do it with a mixture of stuff. But I said, um, Thelonious monk said the genius is the one who is most like himself. And I said with some sort of, um, mental problems coupled with, um, greed and a lack of compassion. Your father has somehow found a way to throw off the filters. And I will listen to tiny Tim talk on tape for hours because I liked that little bit of Asperger's and all that other stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:09:32       But, um, I, I'm not assuming I'm not qualified to do, but I'm saying this is auntie, I can hear him talk forever. I can listen to Lenny Bruce. You know how we will never has those hundreds hours of him just ranting on his tape. I think. I don't like people on drugs that much, but boy I do. And I listened to a Lenny Bruce talk forever and uh, Donald Trump had the dark side of that. You know, it was almost like when I was hitchhiking around the country and you know, homeless and shit and you'd end up at a biker place and you know, some clubhouse and some guys just holding court ranting. I've always been interested in the people who were out on the margins, you know, and what, what Donald jr um, took as affection I guess was a bit of affection. But it's also that if you have thrown off some filters, I'll listen to you talk.

Speaker 2:          00:10:29       And um, so that was that. It was very, very strange. And then, um, I really did spend a lot of time kind of sticking up for Donald Trump saying, yeah, there's interesting stuff there. And yeah, he's, he's crazy and he's venal and, um, he's empty. Uh, you know, really weird stuff that you've never seen before. You have never seen someone who is never laughed sincerely and never made a joke. Never laughed sincerely. No, he will, he will laugh in a bully way. He look kinda fat Joe. Yeah, he'll do that. But he won't laugh at himself. Oh no. And also, but never a even a joke. Even it says phrase on Twitter. Did you see the thing he did on Twitter the other day where you put a picture of Trump tower in Greenland and he said, I promised not to do this. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I laughed.

Speaker 2:          00:11:19       That was funny. Giant Trump tower in the middle of Greenland. I never saw it. I mean, I saw that, but we never saw him in person. I never saw him in person. I also never saw him showing the enjoyment or understanding of music. And those two things are two things that I connect with people very much on. I do too. But one of my best friends, Doug Stanhope does not like music. Oh yeah. Yeah. I know that guys fucking hate music. And tell his father, really tell her his father didn't like music. I mean, I don't know mean and aggressively did like abuse. Yeah. I don't know what that is, but

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       I do know that I don't, I don't believe that we see things the same way. Like I don't think we taste things the same way, which is why some people enjoy certain kinds of foods and some people hate those exact same foods that some people, the music sounds different, if you will, in terms of like what, what their emotional and psychological makeup is and what it does to them. Some people don't want to have none of it and that's staying up. When I lost all that weight, you lost over a hundred pounds. Congratulations. And I read a lot and also more importantly for years and kept it up. But, um, uh, when I was reading about taste, I read this book and I know it's awful that I can't bring up the name, but, um, woman wrote this wonderful book about, uh, preferences in food and she was trying to set up a dichotomy.

Speaker 1:          00:12:39       Let's talk to those people who think there's a natural taste and desire in food and those that think it's all environment and what you in memory and so on, and you just can't find scientists on the other side. All of our food preferences are habit and there's nothing else habit. It's just habit. Is that proven? How can they prove? Seems to be a lots of studies, uh, with young children, um, lots of studies with people who they control their body. But how do you make, how does it make sense when you have two kids that have radically different tastes that grew up in the same household and they have essentially very, very similar food experiences? Yeah. Well, I don't know how they tease out that, but they, I have one daughter, one daughter who loves spicy food and she's young. She's nine and I love spicy food.

Speaker 1:          00:13:28       Yeah. And, I mean, this fucking kid can eat jalapenos cause he eats habanero sauce. She'll like, I'll say this one might be a little too hot for you. She's like, let me try it. And she'll like dip her finger in and she's like, put it on. She'll eat chicken with habanero sauce and she's a little Savage. My other one doesn't want to have nothing to do with it. She did. She thinks everything's too hot. Like a little bit of pepper. She's like, Oh, it's too hot. But you know, I, I found when my, uh, when I, when I changed my diet so radically that my comfort foods changed and my habits changed and what I liked Chino, a lot of that is because of gut bacteria. Oh, I know that. I know. Yeah. Micro-biome. Fascinating. Really fascinating stuff. And seeding back to your brain, you know, uh, that was the thing that was so, so strange because seeing your emotions.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       Yes, very much so. But when I, uh, I became plant based vegan, um, for health reasons and I wrote in my book, I wrote a lot of stuff about I am an unethical vegan. I'm not doing this or any sort of animal, any sort of animal, lack of animal cruelty, nothing. Strictly health. That's why I'm doing the plants and the story. And this has happened to a lot of friends of mine who changed that after whatever it takes. And people are guessing like three months, four months of 'em have no animal products. Uh, those little critters eating shit and you're in your guts dye that liked the

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       meat stuff and they're not giving that feedback loop. And I just found a real emotional change where all of a sudden I went, I don't want to be part of that. I'm of the suffering. Yeah. It was really strange how that changed and it really felt to me, uh, I was so want to, uh, I, you know, hardcore atheist as you know, and um, I don't believe in a mind body separation at all. And yet I seem to believe that when I was 350 pounds, that, um, none of that affected my emotion. And then I lost all this weight and found there were so many changes in me that seem to be intellectual and emotional. And actually I had a lot of evidence where physical, well put me up on the mind, body separation should fuck you up

Speaker 3:          00:15:49       because a lot of people make these assumptions that you know you are not your body and a lot of very intelligent people, they issue working out and they don't want to exercise and they find it like it's a vanity thing. It seems egotistical. They don't, they don't like it. And so they put it in this category of kind of knucklehead dumb things to do. But your body and your mind are all in the same house. Yeah. If your house is filled with shit, it doesn't help.

Speaker 2:          00:16:17       And it was so amazing how, I mean I completely believe that and yet I wasn't living there. I was like thinking that I was living this, you know, 2000 year old idea of little homonculus who's kind of living inside me, who's this pure pen and then the body is just, the vehicle is driving around it. That's just not true.

Speaker 3:          00:16:39       BW with that. I think knowing you as long as I've known you, you're an intense thinker and you, your mind is something you mean, you cherish your thoughts and you, you embrace them and your, you're a very intelligent guy and I think you just probably rejected the idea that there was anything outside of the mind that had any influence.

Speaker 2:          00:17:01       Yeah. We also talked about this. I was also, you know, I was the biggest guy to ever go through my school. So, uh, my, my small high school in Western Massachusetts, you know, so I was, I was six, seven and they wanted me as center of the basketball team. They wanted all this stuff and those kinds of people and that kind of culture, you know, I wanted to listen to music, I wanted to read and I set up this, you guys who are physical, I don't like you, I'm on a different team. Yeah. You know, and my dislike of competitions and teams became a team thing. Yes. Yeah. That's the thing. You always get stuck in the, the, the dislike of teams becomes your team. And I'm trying so hard now to think I have two choices, one or 7 billion, and there's no teams between that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       I can either be myself or I can be one of all humanity, or I won't even say 7 billion, let's say 108 billion. The number of people who have lived in history, you know, those are the people I can be. It's why I'm trying to not, and this is impossible to do by the way. I'm talking about how I'm explaining to you how I'm driving myself crazy, right? I'm not going to get real information. Um, I'm trying to not think ever of us in them, but I'm trying to say those of us who voted for Trump, those of us who believe this. So it's always us because man, I'm so fucking sick of teams and I even look back and go, you know, I love the velvet underground. I hated the fucking Eagles. And that was a fucking team. And that was bidding [inaudible] at forced upon, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:18:37       I wanted to be the kind of guy that went from, you know, Zappa, the velvet underground to Bob Dylan. That was all okay. And the Eagles and the Doobie brothers, they were not what I listened to. I'm just trying to let that go. Yeah. You want it to be one of the cool kids. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And whenever you want that, you've got to say, well, you don't, one of the cool kids that's the hundred 8 billion who've lived on this planet. Yeah. That's a great way to look at things. And I think, I wish people taught that in school. The dangers of being involved in teams because we get involved in teams in terms of like, you know, you're playing basketball or whatever, but, but teams in terms of like the what I believe versus what you believe. And I think we're experiencing that politically right now with the most polarizing time and in my lifetime that I've ever, ever met worldwide.

Speaker 1:          00:19:25       Yes. Worldwide. I mean, it's, it is not, it is not an American thing. Right. And, uh, it's just insane. And I also know, that's why I said, you know, I, I try to go with the velvet underground and the Eagles because that's where I can really see where I'm wrong. You know that I'm wrong. How do you deny victim of love? That's a great song, man. Okay. Once jokes in the mix, the Eagle's changed. You know, people have to recognize, I was in the middle of the China's see with Joel Walsh, ah, through a series of odd coincidences. Why don't I add, well, just a, just last year we got this gig, uh, Paul Allen, who is one of the sure. Microsoft guys. Sure, sure. Great guy. Right. And he had great things about him. Books us to be on a cruise, uh, to do a show for his friends.

Speaker 1:          00:20:13       He had like 200 friends and he's bought this fucking cruise ship. He's rented this fucking cruise ship thrown off all the chefs and everything. Bring on his own people and they're going to go from, I'm from Kobe to Shanghai and he wants the entertainment to be Jay Leno, Penn and teller and Ringo Starr. Whoa, okay. That's what it's going to be on the China sea, on a cruise boat for like 200 people. And he books it. And as I said to my friend, Piff the magic dragon, I said, do you know how much it costs to shutdown Penn and teller in Vegas and fly us all to fucking

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       Japan to beat on a cruise ship to do a fucking Penn and teller show and then come back. Do you have any idea how much that costs? And Piff said no. And I said, me, me either. But it must be a lot. You gotta talk to my managers or something cause that must've been a shit ton of money. So he books this whole thing and then Paul Allen dies, right? Dies. So you know Glenn, who you met out there, the long suffering Glen who our manager, he calls up and after few days and says, really sorry for your loss and we'll trade in the tickets and get you the money back and we can probably rebook those those weeks or it's not going to cost anything. It's so sorry but them, no, no, we're still doing it. And then goes, well, you're w w w the person that booked us, his dad, we're still doing this gig.

Speaker 2:          00:21:37       And they go, Hey, yeah, we went, okay. And I said to Glen, do you know now that we could work for dead people, our careers going to take off, you know, cause that opens up the market. Right, right. Um, so turns out that his friends, you know, Paul Allen's friends are people like Joel Walsh and Billy Gibbons and all these food scientists and all these great people. So there I am in the middle of the China's sea with, um, with a Joe Walsh onstage, just in three in the morning playing piano for like 15 people and you know, singing Desperado and those kinds of things and talking to Joe Walsh and stuff and going, now, why exactly was I on a different team from Joe Walsh? Why exactly was I on the Lou Reed team instead of the Joe Walsh team? They knows the big Lebowski influenced you. Maybe, maybe, maybe it was there, but it's, it's just, um, it's just trying to be more and more inclusive is just a really difficult thing to do.

Speaker 2:          00:22:38       Whether it's the, and the music guys are all that stuff, just everybody be everybody. You can become a prisoner of those thoughts and those, those things as you espouse. Like when you start saying fuck the Eagles, like you're stuck, you're stuck with fuck the Eagles. And then when you start to realize that, you know, when the clash was hitting in the U S there were people sitting around a board room going, how do we get 20 year old assholes to buy this shit? Right? It was all being done and laid out and that's fine. That's their job and that's great and God bless him, but I got to be aware that they're doing that. Yeah, I know. When you think about someone's selling sex pistols merchandise, just like, well there's sex pistol slump, sorry, there's sex pistol slot machine. When I was first in the hard rock, you know, and there's a big side, the only notes that really count are the ones that come in wads, and that's over the door of a casino that you're walking in. And then there's a Sid vicious slot machine and you go, okay, okay, so this is, you know, sat tires, debt. We can no longer do satire. That's over. Well, it's hard to do attire to this dot. Oh, never liked it. I

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       never worked really hard because there's so many people that are serious that are more ridiculous than satire. There's a guy who, I don't know his real name, but his, his Twitter name is Tatyana McGrath, and he plays like the most woke person in all of Twitter. And I retweet his stuff or her stuff, the, the pseudonym all the time. And people get furious. They're like, Oh my God, is this fucking person serious? Like this is bullshit. And I'm like, it's parody. And they're like, Oh. And they go, okay, I get it. I'm like, it's that close. It's that close to being a real person, but not close. We've already crossed over. Oh yeah, absolutely. There's no way to tell. No, there's no way to, well, with woke people with the, with the woke young, they're still wouldn't tell with you, with anybody far writings. Well, yeah. Anything, yeah. There's no way to tell with any of us or so. But I never, ever, ever liked satire. I never, ever liked parody, even when I was reading national Lampoon on the onion. How about that? Is that a turnaround fast enough for you? The onion is too good. When the onion did the headline, when Steve jobs died,

Speaker 2:          00:24:53       which said a nation, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:24:56       mourns the loss of the last person to do what the fuck you was doing, I went, ah, that's perfect. But you know, I, I, I saw that post. Do

Speaker 2:          00:25:07       you have up? Yeah. About here in your, uh, which one? The Lenny Bruce without tears. Oh yeah. Yeah. And you know, the idea of walking, I mean, and I looked, I was, I was whatever. I was, uh, 10 or 11 when Lenny Bruce died. And, um, but you know, I, I didn't ever hear him until after he was dead. And you're younger than me, so even more so for you. But I, um, I did not go to college, but I, uh, I would hitchhike up to the college that was nearby when I was in high school, which was UMass and all that. And yeah. And, uh, cause I'm from little dead factory town North of there. And, uh, I remember seeing, uh, Lenny Bruce without tears. They showed that as a film. Oh wow. I'm a college campus. Wow. Uh, I think I'm remembering this right. Like we know our memories are wrong, but I saw the film very early and it was, uh, completely life changing for me. You know, um, the idea that stand up comedy was going to go from [inaudible] to me was the Smothers brothers, uh, to, um, to somebody actually talking from their heart in a way that, uh, made people laugh, but who cared. And of course, then Andy Kaufman turns that entirely inside out. But the idea that that form was created, you know, um, created here in the U S when you went from being a, you know, a park, a carcass, you know, Albert Brooks, his father doing the Greek dialect and even throw in Amos and Andy and all

Speaker 1:          00:26:43       of those people that did joke, joke, jokes and character stuff. And then all of a sudden the guy coming out as himself and talking about his real life was just mind blowing to me. And so the idea that instead of doing parody, being able to get your laughs, stating what you believe, and maybe that means people are laughing at you and maybe that's okay. It's definitely okay. Um, but I don't think there's anything wrong with any way to do it. I think there's nothing wrong with Abbott and Costello. You know what I mean? It's, I was having a talk with Gilbert, you know, Gilbert Gottfried and we were talking, he said, you know, and in the, um, in Laurel and Hardy stand, Laurel was the brains. And then the three Stooges, Moe was the brains. And in the Marx brothers, Groucho was the braids. And dabbin. Costello had no brains.

Speaker 1:          00:27:35       You know that total you want to talk about the Stooges began archi? Yeah, the Abbott and Costello or just completely off the map. Yeah, just really for the time though, it was groundbreaking. We, it's hard for us to wrap our head around as was Cheech and Chong, you know, Cheech and Chong for the time was groundbreaking. I know that has to do with drugs and that for me, for me, I was on a different team at that time, but I've gone back and that stuff is good and of course, but I'm also a liar because I was crazy for Firesign theater and memorizing everything and feel Proctor's still up. A good friend of mine and that was very much drug base. I think that comedy is like music in that there's a whole bunch of different ways to do it. You know, and if you were a big fan of Bruce Springsteen and you went to see Bruce Springsteen, but run DMC showed up instead, you'd be furious if you're like, what the fuck is this?

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       But obviously people love run DMC. It's a different way to do a thing. It's a different way to express just and, and, and, and a way to learn. Yeah. No way to learn when you get, when you get pushed out of there. But it's, it's just, uh, uh, that, that whole idea that you've got to, um, this, I mean, my life is so heavily affected by drugs, even though I had this whole, you know, I, uh, I'm not gonna do any drugs. Why did you have that decision? You know, I don't know. I don't know. That's always, and I've talked about this on my podcast forever, you know, I tell him, how old are you now? I'm 64 years old. And you have no experience with drugs other than gun medication, surgery? Sure. I mean, yes. And I have, I've had a deep enough injuries that I have experienced.

Speaker 1:          00:29:21       Keep getting surgery cause you love drugs. Excuse. Well, you know, uh, Trey Parker, um, said that my big flaw was never having been high so we can fix that. So I know. So he did fix that. I went in for dental surgery, serious dental surgery, and they fucked up. And the, uh, the dentist told the nurse what he had given me in terms of painkillers and she took that as what she was supposed to give me, so instantly doubled the dose and I was so fucking high and out of my mind. People can die that way. Yeah. And I told my wife through my Hayes of not knowing who I was called, Trey Parker drag came to Vegas and said, I want to sit with Penn high. So he flew in while you were fucked up. Oh my God. How long did it take him to get to you?

Speaker 1:          00:30:18       We, we, he was, he was planning on being there like, he came like a day early. Oh. So he got, he got there like I was still high and Trey said I didn't remember anything and traced out the next day. I was right. You should be high. Well, there's different kinds of high, like there's different kinds of music. And you know, I was very, I was very, uh, I was very close to Lou Reed and I was a very good friend of mine. And Lou said, speaking on behalf of the people of earth, which I often do. We don't want to see ya. I'm a motherfucker, don't do it. So Lou says no, Trey says she has, what does Joe say? Well Joe is interesting cause I wanted to talk to you about this cause we had a conversation a long time ago about this and you said that I, and I'll remember this very clearly, I may paraphrase this, but you said, I think we've learned all there is to know and I don't need to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:09       Oh yes, I said that and I was wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think you should experience psychedelics cause I don't think psychedelics are a totally different thing. They don't take, you know, Sam Harris. Sure. And Sam Harris is the one who got me meditating. Awesome. Which took him a years of arguing with me. And now it's been three or four years that I have not missed a day, not Mr. Day. You, uh, you have a problem. Here's one of your problems. You're very intelligent. You're also very large and you're very articulate. And people like to hear you talk. So you just can talk and you can take over, you could overrun things, and you can make an argument that people just go, all right, okay. And they stepped back. And that's good if you're trying to win an argument, but sometimes it's bad to take an ideas. And I remember when I had that conference exactly right.

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       Thank you. When I had that conversation with you, I remember saying, I'm going to revisit this someday and one day I want to get pen fucked up on mushrooms. That's what I remember thinking like it might be a good thing for, well, the best thing for you would be something that doesn't take very long, just so you can expect like DMT is the best one because it takes like 15 minutes and it's over, and then your body brings it back to baseline almost immediately. So you literally traveled to another dimension and then you're back and you don't have to worry about any overdosing because it's an indogenous chemical. Your body knows exactly what to do with it. So one of the quickest chemicals that your body can break down and bring back to baseline in, in my defense, uh, from the very beginning of my not doing drugs, um,

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       which is an odd, odd kind of a kind of baseline there. Um, I always left the door open for, um, for psychedelics and what I, what I disliked the most was wine with dinner. Really. I disliked the most social kind of lubrication, wine with dinner. Amazing. Doing this in past tense, you know, that's, that's right. That's right. That's where I always was and I always left open the possibility of some of the more intense stuff. Wine with dinner is a delicious drug. It's one of the rare delicious trucks. Like, I like whiskey, but let's be honest, it tastes like shit. It's weird. You're drinking is tough. Like, whew. Like it's got kind of a good flavor, but it's like, it's harsh. She can't drink it. Like, it can't fuck with Koolaid. Kool-Aid tastes way better than whiskey, right? Koolaid. It's cheap. He doesn't mix it up.

Speaker 2:          00:33:33       It tastes delicious. It's way better tasting. But you know, wine has a delicious tastes that you can enjoy. Here's my problem. One of my many problems, we'll detail more than one. Okay? But I have no skill at moderation. I'm 64 years old and I've never been able to do anything with moderation. So I think if you told me we're gonna do acid for the rest of our lives every single day, you could make that argument. The idea for me, that's hard. Like I said, but I said I was meditated. I haven't missed a day. Maybe you should microdose yeah, maybe. Yeah, we could give you a little right now. Just a little spray. You do. Microdosing just raise how I gonna do it now. Now I want to think about it a little bit before, although it would be pretty boss, tell me why and I'll open the box.

Speaker 2:          00:34:25       You get the box right there. I got a box right here. Yep. So, um, how often do you see, Oh, I was going to, I was going to answer that question. I have a zillion answers to why I've never done drugs and none of them are of course true cause we don't have access to that stuff that we really do. But my parents and my whole family and back generations teetotallers so there was never alcohol in the house ever. I never saw my parents take a drink when it was on TV. It was a totally different thing. It just didn't happen. I didn't have any, they never preached about it. They never said don't drink. They never said don't do drugs. It just never was in the house. And that statistically has a huge effect on people. And then the first people I fell madly in love with, you know, uh, Lenny Bruce, Jimmy Hendrix, um, had been in my mind killed by drugs and I kind of said, Oh people would that have this kind of personality when they get into drugs, they sometimes have trouble. And I think that maybe being 19 years old and trying to get into show business that may be being the sober one allowed the dumber guy to do a little better, you know, is everybody else kinda get out of my way? They were fucked up

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       some of the time. I could get other stuff done and then that starts reinforcing that may no longer be valid. Well there are drugs. I mean I've never done Coke and one of the reasons why I never did Coke, and I've talked about this many times, my friend growing up, his cousin used to sell it and I watched his life fall apart. They were just doing Coke all the time and lost a lot of weight and looks like a vampire. It was very strange to just hung out in their attic. Apartment is really weird. And I remember thinking, fuck Coke. It's like, like a guy I know got bit by a monster, you know, and was infected with something. The people, the people that I've been on Coke, not pleasant, not good. It's not. I don't, and I think that's also, you know, one of the accusations against Trump that he's on some sort of speed, you know, which is why he's so inexhaustible, you know?

Speaker 3:          00:36:21       And also why he has this inability to be affected by criticism in terms of like he doesn't, there's no self reflection, no shame, no shame, no self reflection. And that's something that is a symptom of people that are on speed. You know, and this is the Adderall generation that we're living in. God damn, there's so many fucking people that are on Adderall. I mean it's so, it's so goddamn common. You know, I was having this conversation the other day and someone was telling me about this guy that they know who's really brilliant, but he won't stop til he's got ADHD and you know, he just can't stop and he won't stop talking and this and that. I'm waiting. I'm just waiting while this person's talking to me. I'll go, he's on Adderall. And they go, yeah, he is. It's a medication. I go into their [inaudible], it's fucking speed.

Speaker 3:          00:37:05       That guy's on speed. Okay. And you can call it a medication because you can buy it at the pharmacy. But that fucking guy's on speed all day long, every day. And there is a giant number of people in this country that are medicated and that are on speed all the time. It's a great Andy Warhol quote, which was in the 60s we thought we're getting to know people, but we were getting to know drugs. Uh, you know there's there, there is definitely, there is definitely a personality type that we think is an individual that actually does seem to have a tie in with its fucking Adderall mindset. There's a speed mindset and it's a go, go, go get everything done more, bigger, faster, accumulate shit. I'm the fucking man. I'm the fucking man like that. That's a speed mindset. It's a dangerous mindset. It's a real weird one. And it's not one that laughs at itself.

Speaker 3:          00:37:54       It's not one that's self deprecates. It's all me, me, me, me, me. I'm the shit. And that's what you get out of Trump. I mean, this is, I mean, there's a guy who was in a journalist who wrote a story about how he knows the very Dwayne Reed pharmacy in Manhattan where Trump was getting diet pills way back in the day. We were supposed to take it for like six weeks. He took it for years and this guy is saying like, this is what you're dealing with. Like many people have called him the Adderall president, like this is it. It absolutely could be that he's on something that all the we're talking about this whole time is just speed. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and it gives them the energy to look. Remember when he was running for president? I'm like, how the fuck is this guy not tired?

Speaker 3:          00:38:36       I get tired if I tour and do stand up. When I do stand up, it's an hour, 20 minutes of my own routine that I've wrote myself. I'm hanging out with friends. I do two shows a night and I'm like, whew. This motherfucker's touring, flying around in jets all over the country, just in exhausted. Just no fucking script. Just goes on stage in front of everybody. Just ranted and raved about China and the economy and build wall. Well, all right, we're going to go to Ohio and then off to the jet eating Kentucky fried chicken and fucking flies in Ohio. And he does it again. I mean, who the fuck at 70 has that kind of energy people on speed? I don't know if it's true. I might be wrong, I might be wrong, but it seems like it, it seems like all the pieces are in place and there was a psychologist is, did an analysis of all the various psychological, um, traits that people who are on in fed amines have. And they compared it to Trump and like all of them megalomania all over the various psychological characteristics, inability to accept criticism. You know, this thinking that everyone's against them. This, the, the, this, this delusions of grandeur, all these different,

Speaker 1:          00:39:41       thanks. What was, there was a guy on, uh, on, uh, there was, there was on apprentice who talked about him, uh, him doing these, these kinds of drugs. There was a news story. It was like a, it was like an intern that we weren't going to, uh, w w just kinda faded away after that. But I, it's a, a, it's a, it's a nutty a, it's a nutty thing. Tom Arnold claims Donald Trump's snorted Adderall and the apprentice set. Okay, well I know Tom, he's crazy. I love you Tom. But I don't know. Yeah, maybe he did, but mate, Tom Arnold would say that he snorted Trump or snorted a Coke just to piss Trump off. He would say that just cause I'm fucking with him. I'm getting under his skin. Maybe did snort Adderall. I don't know. I don't know. It doesn't seem like he, that it's the kind of thing he would snore it. It seemed like he would pretend that it was medicinal. Yeah. He take a pill.

Speaker 3:          00:40:32       Yeah. I mean it's kind of medicinal. Here's the thing, it will allow you to get more things done. You know, we had a guy in here wrote a book on Hunter Thompson and

Speaker 1:          00:40:40       uh, one of the things that he's talking about was that he needs Adderall to right. And I was going into it with him because one of the things that dirty little secret about journalism is a tremendous amount of journalists are on Adderall. Tremendous amount. Like an enormous amount. Like one of my friends who's a, a pretty rigid, do we know how much Adderall is going into the USA? That's a good question. How many Adderall prescriptions were made in 2018? Let's just find that out. Um, but my friend who was a legit journalist for legit publication said you would be stunned. And he goes, he goes, it's an enormous percentage. The majority, they just started banging it out too. I mean, like they did with, um, with the fentanyl, the vets to children. They just bang out Adderall under and a what's the other one? Prozac. No, the other one they do for, I guess for it, for, um, attention to fish deficit disorder is another one. Other

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       than Adderall was, I'll just Adderall maybe. Prozac. Adderall. I know Prozac. Prozac was, they put my neighbor's kid on Prozac was fucking horrific. Seems low. 16 million adults are prescriptions refilled. 16 million adults had prescriptions filled. That's low thousand abuse it, which seems low also. So 16 million. Yeah. What does that like 3% yeah. Yeah. That seems low. Less than four 4% something like that. I don't know. It seems very low. That was last year. Did 2012 is the last, Oh, 2012 I couldn't find any, but that's a million years ago showing up. Maybe that was true for 2012 I think it probably was true for 2012 I think we live in a whole new world now and I don't think it's anywhere near 4% or 5% whatever the fuck the real number is. I bet it's about 10 I bet it's 10% of people in this country on Adderall. If I had to guess, I bet it's around 30 million.

Speaker 3:          00:42:30       I bet it's around there. Yeah, I'm not, yeah, I wouldn't be shocked. I know a bunch of people that are on it a bunch and you know, some people tell me they have to take it. That's when my favorite one is. I have to take it. I won't tell you what happens is you die, you disappear. What happens? You don't take it. It's fucking speed, man. You know, like a lot of the people that take it, they're not healthy otherwise. Like they're not exercising, they're not drinking a lot of water. They're not meditating, they're not eating healthy foods. Like what do you, why do you need that? Like what happens if you get rid of all that other stuff? Like cut out the shitty food, cut out all the sugar, start drinking water, no booze. Let's get you exercise in three times a week. Let me see if you really need that.

Speaker 3:          00:43:07       Adderall shit. Yeah. How many vitamins do you take? Do you take vitamins? Do you eat healthy? Are you drinking fruit juice and vegetable juice? Are you what kind of nutrients you taking into your system, man? And you're wondering why you don't have any fucking energy. So you're just pouring jet fuel into your tank. Lighten the whole fucking thing on fire. But, and the other hand is like, things get done when you take speed. You know what we were talking about Hitler the other day that, um, why wouldn't she be, why wouldn't we be, we were talking about who was, who were we talking about? Was it a with Faheem? I don't remember. Um, but we were talking about how Hitler, um, w there was a time where Hitler had come back from something and he was supposed to meet Mussolini and he was like physically exhausted. So his doctor injected him with a combination of steroids and liquid cocaine and he just just fucking fill with energy.

Speaker 3:          00:43:55       He's like, give me another one. And the guy's like, no, I can't give you another. It's like fucking give me another one. And he gave him another one and then he went to Mussolini and ranted at Mussolini. Just fucking talked at them for five hours and Mussolini just never got a word in edgewise. And apparently mousseline his plan was to talk to Hitler and go, Hey man, Italy wants to get the fuck out of this. We're not really interested in that. And he was like, what? Then just fucking going crazy for five hours, sweating like a pig. Cause he was on fucking Coke, he was on Coke and steroids. They just pumped him up with it. Maybe it's best to stay away from some drugs. Yes. Okay. Yes. But

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       I mean it's, it's amazing how much productivity gets done because of caffeine. Right now. What is caffeine? Caffeine is a very mild stimulant in terms of, you know, compared to Adderall or things along those lines. But it is a fucking truck and it's a drug. There's a God damn drug store on every corner. Everyone's buying it. It's in every gas station. Everyone's fueling up. Y'all have few up caffeine. You know, I, I don't, I brought, no, I drink decaffeinated coffee, which means I drink 5% of what? Right. You know, I drink, I can drink eight cups of coffee and it makes a, you just like the taste. I don't like the taste, but I liked the social stuff. I like having a hot, bitter thing in front of me. Let's just have tea. I have tea too. Yeah. My eyeball. I nervously, I nervously drink.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       Yeah. But like, you know, like some people smoke. Oh, I to sell sir. Like they have uh, uh, decaf coffee or decaf tea or something like that. I like sells her too. It makes me feel like I'm doing something rather than drinking water. You know, like, I like sparkling water. It's water with entertainment. I like sparkling water with a little lime. Oh, I've got a drink here and I still drink. Or you know what, you take decaffeinated espresso and then you pour a carbonated water on top of that and then you've got bitter bubbly. You're drinking a potion, you want that. You want a potion, a potion makes you feel like an adult if they feel like it grow Koolaid. This is an adult boy. Exactly. And when you're, when you're a non drinker of alcohol, you have to work very hard to look like you're drinking like an adult.

Speaker 1:          00:46:03       Yeah. So you've never fucked with alcohol at all? No walls, no nothing. No nothing. I mean, try it. Okay. I know I'm talking to somebody who pays attention. So you can say that there is alcohol and vanilla, there's alcohol and things like that. So you can't say none, but none that I ever acted. I never, I never went to, I never went to a searched out. It feels good, so I never even accidentally, no one ever even, you know, fuck with me on that real well. That's good. That's, that's surprising. Yeah. That is surprising. Given the circles you travel in. I would imagine eventually someone would be like, enough is enough. Get this guy fucked up. It's to be funny. Yeah. This would be really funny. Yeah. It seems like someone would have that would've fit in someone's sense of humor. Some great word knows.

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       This may be the day. No, I wouldn't do that. If you, if you really want to say the word, we'll open up the box of doom. You box it. How often do you do a psych and drugs drill? Yes, I can do not that often. A couple times a year I'll go get like, I mean we did mushrooms on a podcast a couple months ago, but that was a small dose, but a, the tank is my friend [inaudible] century two. I have one right here. I have one your size. [inaudible]. I went to one of these places where you pay them X amount of money and you go, man, because my buddy Tim Jenison, we did a movie called Tim's Vermeer where you painted a different mirror in his garage and uh, Tim was really into that. I'll do anything Tim does. I just, I just loved him. And uh, so I went and you know, whenever you pay

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       a few bucks in you, you'd go in and float in the tank. And I was so ready. I have S this happens so much in my life. I get so ready for a major change in my life. The first time I wanted to become a vegan, I went out with a friend. This was like in 1990 and there was a guy who was making fun of brutally ripping them the fuck apart for a stupid eating, you know. Then I said, listen, I want to go out with you to a restaurant, just eat vegetables and I'm not going to interrupt you. I'm not going to make funny. You talk to me for three hours about all your Peter singer's stuff, all your ethical vegetarian stuff and you convert me, that's all I want you to do. Ah. That was the reason I went out. That was the reason I went out with them and I finished up the whole evening and I went, you know, I really respected your point of view until I understood it. Then motherfucker talked me out of doing what I wanted to do and so I got ready man with the, with, with the uh, isolation tack. I said, this'll be good. He's told him about this. I'm just going to go there. Sensory deprivation. I'll just let my mind wander. And I went in there and it was just salting. I was bumping against walls.

Speaker 3:          00:48:40       Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's, you need to get used to it. It's like the meditation. Try meditating once you're like, I couldn't concentrate and meditate me once is useless. Yes. Yeah. It's um, you often, you do the tech all the time. I used to have one of my handles sitting now, no all times, but often I should say. Um, I used to have one in my house and now I just have it here. But it's a very valuable tool. And you meditate as well? Yeah, I meditate. I like to meditate for shows. I've been doing a lot more lately. Um, uh, but the tank is a great place to meditate as well because it's meditation squared. It's meditation without any external stimulation so I can climb in there and [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:49:22       And do you follow, do you follow breathing rules and stuff you would do on normal? What kind of meditation do you do when you meditate?

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       I'll do what I've been doing. What I've been doing lately is all I do is concentrate on my breath. Other things get in there, but I just say, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out. And I just concentrate on long, slow, rhythmic breaths and I get myself into this weird state. And you know, this'll come in. Ah, you gotta fucking low front tire. You gotta you gotta get that filled. Uh, this is, you need this, the your inspection sticker and all and the bullshit comes in. But I just breathe in, breathe out, force it out before, sit out and after five or 10 minutes of this, I can get to a nice state where I can just keep doing it, keep doing it. But in the tank, it's very accentuated because in the tank, I don't have to think about my butt in the seat, my hands on the table.

Speaker 3:          00:50:15       I don't have to think about anything else, just I'm just lying there. What you're experiencing when you're talking about bumping into the walls, that's just a technique thing. When you, when you lie in it, right? You get into the tank. First of all, you need a big tank. You're a giant guy. Um, there's a lot of those little pods, those, those are barely big enough from me. You know, it's for a guy like you, you need a large one and you lie down on the tank and then you put your hand on one wall and your hand on the other wall and you let the water still, because it's going to be a lot of little ripples when you're floating because you're so buoyant. There's a thousand pounds of Epsom salts in there and you're floating and it's easy to just kind of bounce back and forth.

Speaker 3:          00:50:49       So you put your hands there until they steady. And then once the ripples kind of stop, then you slowly bring your hands down. And then when you slowly bring your hands down, you do it really slow so you're not making any ripples and then lay there. And then you could be in the exact same position for hours. And that's, that's how it's a technique. It's just you have to center you. So how long you do? Two hours is what I like to do and I'll do an hour if I'm in a rush and I have, um, a, a work shape or throw it is. Yeah. I mean, it's not a rush. It's just an hour. But if I can't spend any more time than an hour, but I have a tape recorder that's voice activated and it's Velcro and so I can stick it up inside the thing. So if I have an idea, which I do sometimes, sometimes I have this temptation, fuck, I gotta get outta here.

Speaker 3:          00:51:36       I gotta write this down. I can just say it and the, the tape recorder will pick it up and there have been brilliant stuff you said no nothing and never used it once it's there. You haven't gotten out of the tech and had satisfaction? No, there's no that Keith Richards thing, right that nobody went to sleep. Really. He had this sound activated recorder that he got by the side of the bed and, and his guitar and he went to sleep one night, woke up the next morning there on the tape recorder. Oh, there was some voice activation in the night. He played it. It was satisfaction. My friend. We haven't gotten that yet. No, I haven't had that yet. My friend works at a school in Connecticut where his kids go, or Keith Rich's kids go and Keith Richards will ride on a bike to school with a fucking bandana on.

Speaker 3:          00:52:22       And like my friends, like, Holy shit, that's Keith Richards. Like he's just kinda hanging around with normal people and he said, it freaks you out when you see him. You're like, what? That's fucking Keith Richards. He just hangs out. Just like, you know, he's a giant superstar, but he drifts into the real world and it just freaks people out. Yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, I mean, I only met Keith Richards in groups of people that were what's really like bicycling into your yeah, but still it's so, it's so amazing. Surreal, so surreal. Epic human. Yes. The voice recorder thing is new. That's why I haven't had any new, it's a new idea that I have because there's times that I did to this team thing and the, uh, and the separation of America and getting more polarized. That's going to be solved by Joe in the tank at some point. We can count on that. No, now that you got the recorder, we're going to solve it ourselves. I think we're going to solve it ourselves through just time. I think as we're getting back to Pinker were talking about Pinker earlier that he gets so much shit for saying that things are better than ever.

Speaker 2:          00:53:26       It doesn't dismiss horrific acts. It take place or terrible things. And it doesn't say that the battle is over. No, I mean this is one of the things that I would push in my little microcosm, push for so hard in Penn and teller, you know, uh, tell her and I would have real trouble just crossing a finish line. I would just say to him, you know, tell her we, we, we've done five seasons of bullshit and it went well, let's go out the two of us have coffee and donuts and let's just say, wow, we did that and then push ahead for the next thing. And I would just, uh, I just think that Pinker is like that with me. Pinker's like saying, you know, human beings, we're doing okay. We're doing okay, we'd done some really good things. Now let's get back to work.

Speaker 2:          00:54:13       We're most certainly doing better than ever before. And I think that's an accumulative thing. It's like it's time. Don't blow everything that pink came come, which if we don't destroy the environment, if those two things, the two enormous ifs, we're in very good shape. They are. The thing that blew my mind about Pinker in that, in that book better angels blew my mind is, uh, there's this line that's that, that, that has been obsessing me, uh, with a Cracker in teenage angst. I don't know what the world may need, but I sure as hell know it starts with me. And that's a wisdom. I've laughed at all this shit that I've laughed at that turns out to be true for me now. It just makes me smile and fills me with joy. You know, uh, early part of the 20th century, all these authors and artists and all these guys were saying Hemingway's step, we're gonna stop war by writing about war and writing about how bad it was.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       And we're going to give empathy for other people and we'll understand this and we're going to really, with our art, make an effort to make humanity better. What I Jack off bullshit thing to do. I think there's, could you imagine something more that's just twiddling your Dick than say a neck. Oh, I'm going to do art. I'm going to write and it's going to change the wine poetry. And then Pinker's book says, why is all this stuff get better so fast? We think it may be art had a baby empathy. And it turns out that, uh, all this stuff people were saying about, you know, we can change, we can change how people see warfare and how people see one another. And that's what scares me so much about, um, how some people speak of. And I think it's because I don't understand it. Usually when I'm against something, it means I don't understand it. But when they talk about cultural appropriation, cultural appropriation seems to me to be the greatest thing you can possibly do to see the world through the eyes of someone who grew up differently than you. To even try to do that for. Even for, to pretend right now to be a a, you know, white nationalist

Speaker 3:          00:56:29       even trying to do that seems like it's a really good thing for us trying 10 just to get into their head just to try to fantasize what it's like to be,

Speaker 2:          00:56:39       for instance, a uh, uh, African American transgender man. If we try to do that, we're writing a piece of art and we try to see ourselves from that point of view. I'm not, not that I'm not herself see the world from that point of view. That seems like nothing but healthy. It seems like that takes you out of your identification.

Speaker 3:          00:56:59       Well, I think there's a lot of what we're calling cultural appropriation that is really people trying to tell other people what to do. Cause people enjoy telling people they can't do that anymore and getting angry at those people. They enjoy it. They enjoy pushing buttons. People, you give them a rock and a window, they want to throw that rock through the window. It's a natural part of being a person. And if you see a girl with hoop earrings, like bitch, take those earrings off. Those are for Latino's or there's a for this. So those are for that. I mean, and the argument is so often not even based historically, like the earring thing. Like fuck Ben, what are you from Sumir like that's the oldest known hoop earrings like you, that's all you're from Babylon.

Speaker 2:          00:57:37       It's also what a, I don't know if this is, this is not Pinker, this is Noah. Um, Rari um, who uh, who talks about when you're talking about cultural stuff, how far back you going? Right? I mean, there are no tomatoes in Italy, but you know, sure. Yeah. Tomatoes are not indigenous. Italy pasta came from China and potatoes aren't from Ireland. They, they don't start there. You know, so you have to keep going back. There was a great, you know, uh, Paul Simon got so much shit for Graceland, uh, you know, and uh, and, and David Byrne get so much shit for stuff and there's this wonderful thing and David Burns, uh, book how music works, which is a fabulous book, but he doesn't ever address this picking things from other cultures ever. But he talks very strongly about the African kinds of music and the influences they have from other places. You know, cause there is not, there is not a culture other than the whole world, especially not now. You might be able to have made the argument 200 years ago. There were

Speaker 3:          00:58:43       Pat, the thing is though, that people enjoy cultures. So if that is the case and everything does assimilate and becomes one big gray mass, we're worried that we're gonna lose Indian food. Right. We're worried that we're going to lose. I have no worry of that at all. No, I have no worry because I think that me

Speaker 2:          00:59:00       loving sun RA, even though I'm not African American and me loving Lenny Bruce, even though I'm not urban and identify as Jewish, I think that loving these kinds of cultures should not be based on an accident of birth. The

Speaker 3:          00:59:16       loving thing is one thing though. I think the real fear of cultural appropriations is that will take on those things as their own. Like there's a gentleman, I'm trying to remember his name. Uh, he is a famous Mexican chef, but he's not Mexican, but he cooks Mexican food. He cooks it in Chicago. Walt Bayless, is that his name? Um, something. Bayliss. Rick Bayless. Rick Bayless. He, this guy has an undeniable passion for Mexican cuisine. I mean, he fucking loves it. He has a couple different restaurants where he cooks Mexican food and he was getting protested and people were furious at him. Um, because they had just decided at one point if this guys had like, you know, a 30 fucking year career of being in love with Mexican cuisine and being like a real historian of Mexican cuisine work where it comes from. The regions, the ingredients, like where's the best ingredients, where's the best places to cook these things, how they do it, why they did it this way and I mean speaks with incredible passion about this.

Speaker 3:          01:00:14       They were deciding that he's a white guy and he shouldn't, shouldn't be able to do this, shouldn't be able to sell. This, shouldn't be able to like do you fucking assholes? Like this is the guy he's helping everyone recognize the beauty of this much maligned food. When you, when people think about Mexican cuisine, he is one of the rare people in Western culture that talks about it like it's five-star cuisine. So many people talk about, Oh I love street tacos and fucking I'm going to be a big fan of case a D no, this guy is talking about the very best Mexican cuisine in the world and trying to interpret that and sell it to people and trying to turn people on to how good this food is. And yet he was taking so much shit when a person that wasn't born in that act, the accident of birth to be in there falls in love with another culture.

Speaker 3:          01:01:01       I don't see why that isn't more beautiful. Yes. Yeah. That's, that's, that's, that's what I'm looking for. That Steven Seagal. Yeah. He moved to Japan, became a master before he became kind of silly. He was one of the very first guys to ever teach a kiddo in a dojo in Japan. That wasn't Japanese. I think he actually was the first, I think it was the first American to ever run a dojo in Japan. So no. Okay. Giving me on psychedelics is very easy compared to getting me to really dig Stevenson guy. I mean, I'm not sure I do, although I do appreciate his first movie above the law. I appreciate what he look. He likes his prepositions. He's a silly fail silly fella for sure. Many of us are. Sure. But what he, he did do is he learned I KIDO at a very, very high level, like undeniably. And he was teaching and in Japan he spoke perfect Japanese. And it was a very rare guy, you know, and now, you know, became a Hollywood guy in movies and who knows what the fuck else. And it became an enormous, you know, physically you got fat and you know, he's kind of silly now, but at one point in time that guy was as legit as it gets. Isn't that always true? It's always starts. You don't want it. I'm going to completely change the subject is like if I met, you know, I to talk about

Speaker 1:          01:02:20       when you came on my radio show with Phil plait about the talking about the moon landing. Yeah. But what I, what I think is fascinating about this, about clubs and stuff, you know, is, uh, I, uh, you know, and I, I know I've, I've read here and there that you, you've, uh, you've gone back on a lot of that and your conspiracy stuff. And so, yeah, but that, that's not what I can explain that to. I don't know what I'm talking about. You know, this, this is the thing, I have zero astrophysics education. Zero. I don't know anything about whether or not it's possible to put people on the moon. I do know fuckery and I, I do know teams and I do, I do understand when people are bullshitting people. And I think there's a lot of that with, with a lot of the NASA stuff, a lot of the older stuff, and particularly there was a lot of manipulation of images and putting things online that may not have actually really happened because it was press releases and there's an image of Michael Collins from like a Gemini 15, that's a, a, a very clear, um, image of him, uh, doing a simulation like in a studio with straps and harnesses.

Speaker 1:          01:03:25       And then someone from NASA or someone put that exact same image, blacked out the background and used it as a photo of, um, of a space. Meaning it's not real, you know, but they sold it as real. There was some overzealous shirt like that, that if you're conspiratorially minded, you might say, ah, once, once you start lying. Yes. [inaudible] you're 51 and stuff. We know they lied like motherfuckers. Yeah. And that's the problem. But what I just want to compliment you and I just also think this is really interesting, you know, so Joe Rogan believes this crazy shit. We didn't go to the bone. I know Joe Rogan, we're on it. We're on a radio show together, but dah, dah, dah. He's a good guy. But that fear factor, but, and he believes this shit. Let's, let's have him talk to someone who's real. So I call Phil play do.

Speaker 1:          01:04:13       I don't know that well, right? But he's the bad astronomer and he knows this shit. And I say, I really want you to come on my radio show and just talk to Joe Rogan about, uh, about, um, the moon landing landing. And uh, Phil says, OK, no problem. We'll just go on there. We'll, we'll set them straight. And I go, I just want to warn you, uh, have your ducks in a row. Cause Joe's really good. And he goes, well, Joe's Joe's a comic, right? I go, yeah, and that's your problem because Joe's better at talking than you. Joe knows when the commercials are coming. Joe knows how to make a joke and Joe knows also how to set you up and take you down here. Oh no, no, no. It'll be no problem. I said, you understand that he's smart. He's a comic, right? Yeah. Not an Astro physicist, but you understand that he's smart and he's also, you are going into his form. We're going to be on radio. This guy has done a lot of radio. This guy's talked to a lot of people, so just have all your facts in line and then we're sitting there, cause you know, you were, you were on the phone and

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       uh, Gudo it was on my podcast with me too, sitting across from me and we're listening and you come in and you come in humble and charming and sexy and with perfect timing on everything. And Phil placed as well. I'm like, go, Oh man, Joe is wrong and Joe is going to fucking win. And I said, how you set this up so that, um, so that uh, it will be a fee. It'd be fair. My whole thing of doing this, the way I bill boarded it was I'm just going to have two guys talk from two points of view. I'm not supposed to commit it. I don't know if you remember, but the whole show EDS and I go, Oh, by the way, we did lay it on the moon. They just tried to do this final authority thing and Phil us afterwards. Well, he, he had, I said, yes.

Speaker 2:          01:06:11       Yeah. And it's just that idea that you can't, you know, his idea was there's the science team. That's right. And then there's just goofy comic and trying to get Phil plait understand that a goofy comic was not a goofy comic. And I believe that the only thing that the SATs truly test is how good you will be. That can be as a comedian, that kind of verbal, it was a wonderful thing to listen to. It was wonderful to listen to someone who I believe absolutely was 100% wrong who was just so skilled and so moral and so thoughtful and so humble. You had everything going for you that I respect, except it didn't happen to be right.

Speaker 3:          01:06:56       Well, we don't know what happened. We assume that what we see is what happened. We assume that what the scientist tell us was hat was what happened. We assumed that what NASA told us was what happened. When you say, I know this happened. Right. You are not always correct. Exactly. Oftentimes. Correct. I know Kennedy got assassinated in Dallas. I've seen the video. I know he got assassinated. Dallas. I don't know of Lee Harvey Oswald did it? I don't know. I assume he was involved. It seems like he was. Yeah. Was there other people involved to, I assume there were, and one of the reasons why I assumed there were the magic bullet. The fucking, the guy who got hit with the ricochet under the overpass know that I made the shot with Amandla Huracan. Oh yeah. It can be made. Yeah. Oh, that's horse shit. Listen, I've talked about that in, in length towards that. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of things is a lot of things. Um, there's, there's a lot of things we could go over the Kennedy assassination. There's a lot of things. I'm not [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:07:56       are we good? Are we going to solve the polarization in America or are we gonna sell them the Kennedy assassination? Or are we going to solve the bullying? Or you would do all of them. Okay. I just want to know what our goals were. The Moonlight branding

Speaker 3:          01:08:07       is a conspiracy theories dream of conspiracy theorists dream because it's got everything in place. It's got this incredible technological achievement. It's got these three guys that look incredibly nervous at the post landing press conference and they'll look all sketched out. It's got these guys that don't do interviews afterwards. It's got no one ever lands on the moon again after 1973 or whatever it was. It's got all these technological achievements, but we never get outside of Earth's atmosphere again. We're always inside of Earth's orbit. There's so many beautiful things that conspiracy theories can grasp a hold of them. Go see it's bullshit. But it doesn't mean it, but it doesn't mean it didn't happen. There's the van Allen radiation belts. There's that. We never even send a chicken in deep space and had to come back alive. There's all these things, but it doesn't mean it didn't have. Right. And my problem was, and this is, you know, when people said, Oh, you know, you've sold out.

Speaker 3:          01:09:03       You're a shill now. And like, no, no, no. I'm just being honest now. Whereas before I wasn't being honest with myself and I wasn't being honest about the subject. I do not know whether or not people went to the moon. I was pretending that. I knew that people didn't go to the moon and I was arguing it that way. I was on a team, I was on team. It's bullshit. We didn't go to the moon and you, you really can't do that accurately. It can't be done. You can say, this is what's interesting. This is what I find curious. This is what's weird. In fact, there's not a single technological achievement from 1969 that's not cheaper, easier and faster to reproduce today except going to the moon like he's one of the rare things in life that still doesn't mean it didn't happen. Right? Like outcomes. Razor's a slippery thing because there's weird shit that happens and you gotta take that into account. Like there's no absolutes. There's not one thing that you can say, well there is a rule and this rule must be followed. And here's that rule. It doesn't work that way. The world is made of weird.

Speaker 2:          01:10:03       And I'm also the, the, the idea, there's, there's a thing that's changed. There was an article in the times about this and you might've even been mentioned in it. Um, there's a, uh, a playful space of conspiracy theories that it's taken me a long time to understand. My daughter is 14 and she talks about, you know, her, her father did a show called bullshit and she talks about how she loves conspiracy theories and this is from Paul McCartney's dead till we didn't land on the moon, all those things. But she sees it, which I so hard for me to understand. She sees it as not impacting reality, but as a playful inter intellectual exercise. I don't know what's going on. But there was this wonderful article in the times and you were mentioned there too, but there's also another guy who does it who will do this.

Speaker 2:          01:11:03       Uh, to use a cliche, I can't think of a better one going, going down the rabbit hole of conspiracy stuff, playing around with the logic that feels like a mathematical thing or a pure philosophical thing or a or a angels dancing on the head of a pin thing and a, there's a quality that you have learned, um, that my daughter has learned indirectly I think from you, um, through other people doing this of there is a playful space or rediscuss how we, uh, how we share our reality that is happening in the conspiracy theory art form and the conspiracy theory art form is now seeming to me to be more like rap or rock and roll or it's just a form of thing where you play around with this kind of thing. And I am so I'm literal minded. So verbal minded, you know, Bob Dylan's easy for me. The stones are hard, you know, Zappa's easy, 20th century classical's easy, but just funk is hard for me and it's the same kind of thing here. It's really easy for me to say we are doing, um, uh, the old fashioned scientific inquiry and this is the way falsifiable, but there is something happening in our thinking that's really interesting. Then I had to have my daughter explained to me and the New York times after I already [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:12:42       I knew you and watched you do it. Well, you've, you've always been a champion of science and reason, right? And conspiracy theories for the most part, flying the face of science and reason. And if you don't want to be a buffoon, nobody wants hopeful poetic theory happening. But it's tricky and you don't, people don't want to be a fool. Well, I'm a professional fool. I don't mind being a fool and you know, being self-deprecating and being a moron as part of being a comic, it's fun. The, the conspiracy theory world went South for me when I did a television show. I did that. Joe Rogan questions. Everything shown. I spent six, seven months doing this show and at the end of it I was like, okay, I get it. This is a bunch of unfuckable white guys. That's what it really is. That's what I decided.

Speaker 3:          01:13:24       I said, you know, I had a bit about it. I said, do you want him? The one thing you don't find when you're looking for big foot black people, you're more likely to find Bigfoot than you want black guys looking for big foot is a bunch of unfuckable white dudes out camping and listening to, what did you hear that? What is that? You know? It's like it's nonsense. Like you're, you're wrapped up in this idea that there's a mystery and there's a something. There's a thing, a quality, but human beings where we want to uncover secrets, we want to be the person that finds out the truth because then you're miserable. So shitty fucking life now doesn't matter. The fucking aliens are real man. They're here and aha. Aha. One of the best

Speaker 2:          01:14:03       things we can get probably better than coming, is that feeling of, aha, I understand. I've gotten a, and we see this all the time, detective shows, you know, Sherlock Holmes, you know, nothing to do with police work, but there is a feeling that wouldn't it be nice if in this hour I were able to figure something out? Because if you want understand string theory, you're not going to do it an hour.

Speaker 1:          01:14:31       You're not going to do it ever. Those guys understand it. Even if they T precisely, let's take an easier one. Let's take a candle flame. You're never gonna know

Speaker 2:          01:14:39       STEM at, right. Uh, studying that forever. And there's, there's an area where conspiracy theories are exercising the muscles of logic, exercising the muscles of skepticism, playing around with the, with the haiku of if then, if then playing around with, um, what we feel about the government and other people and stuff like that. And you're playing around with all of that in kind of a semi safe zone and even watching you just do it here, where you will, you, will you bang out that stuff and say, this is the stuff. I questioned what's coming out of that poetically. Uh, and I thought, let's not even talk about whether we went to the moon or not. What's coming out of your style of inquiry on that kind of thing. Your style of skepticism is just fascinating and beautiful. And I see the conspiracy thing as not so much a breaking down, which I used to see it as a breaking down of science and reason, but I see it as rather a, a creation of a new form of poetry. That's weird. I don't know if my daughter just said, my daughter just says, you know, I really like conspiracy theories and I say to her, you know, Paul McCartney's still alive. Right? But you know, she's 14 and your pen Gillette let,

Speaker 1:          01:16:08       so she's rebelling. You understand that, right? You're a parent, you know, it's like your baby just told me something really important. Yeah, there's two dirt down the real life. Here's the thing, it's like Neil Gaiman's daughter coming in, uh, all golfed out and you'll say to her, I invented this. You can't do this. This is not the way you can rebel. You can't rebel against me like this. You can't do it with black hair and eye shadow, you can't do it. But yeah. Yeah. Well kids, you know, they, they find their own way and they, they want to express themselves, you know, they want to exert power over their world. But did you see that article that you were mentioning? No, I did not. I try not to read anything that I mentioned that, I mean I briefly do oftentimes. And I'm like, huh, I tried to never read anything with my name in it because it's not written for us. Right. And I'll tell you the exact moment that happened to me that was so great. Uh, it was in the 80s were on Broadway

Speaker 2:          01:17:10       and, uh, I, the cone brothers were just starting to do movies, you know, and I was really interested in them, you know, and uh, I had, I had like an hour fray, which when I was doing stern and Letterman and Saturday night live and on Broadway, I never had an hour free. And I was a magazine, like vanity fair, something, who cares? Fuck what it was. And has said what the cone brothers are really like, what it's like to work with the cone brothers. Okay. And I said, ah, I'd never read magazine, but a by this I'll learn a little bit about the Cohen brothers on up to our office. You know, it's like the Brill building, you know, uh, Lauren Michaels sit in my office, open it up, put the cone brothers like turn to that page. I said, if you want to know what the Cohen brothers are like, it's like hanging out with Penn and teller. And I went, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa.

Speaker 2:          01:18:03       How does that even real close the bag of seed? Put it aside. And they were going on comparing it and I went, I have no information on this. None. There's no way I can access it. Then that moment I went, Oh, wait a minute. When it says Penn Jillette in an article or in a book, there's no way I can understand that. Maybe others can, you know. So when it says in the article, um, you know, when Joe Rogan does conspiracy stuff, duh, duh, duh, duh duh duh duh, you can't understand that. It's like Mike Desmond said to me, the major problem with talking to Jimmy Hendrix was he never heard Jimmy Hendrix. He never saw Jimmy Hendrix on stage. He couldn't. And you know, so you are the one person that using Joe Rogan is an example, you know? Well you know, kind of a Brola Terry kind of a kind of a does this bro culture. This is Joe. You can't understand that. You have no idea what that means cause you're an individual.

Speaker 3:          01:19:01       Well it's also people are trying to encapsulate you by those brief moments and might've seen a video or heard you talk about what it means something to other people. It means something. And it also, you can easily categorize someone and put them in this box and now I've defined that, Oh, I know what that is. Let's see what else before hanging out with Penn Jillette. Yeah. It's also part of your job, part of your job. One of the things you've created is you've created something in the culture that means the New York times can say Joe Rogan and are people reading that know what that means. But there's no way Joe Rogan can know what that you can pretend, right? Well, you could be like Trump and get mad about it. You know where the rubber really hits the road with conspiracy theories right now, Jeffrey Epstein. Oh yeah. That's the where the rubber hits the road.

Speaker 3:          01:19:48       That's where people that are not conspiratorial minded are like, wait, what the fuck is going on? What all the cameras were bad? Oh, that guy was on suicide watch. He tried to commit suicide and then they're like, well, don't do that again. And then he did it. Like if you talk to people that have been locked up, they'd take away, man, you've been on suicide watch. They fucking take away everything and you find this guy, he's got a broken neck and he hung himself. Like how? How did he hang himself? Can we see the video footage? Oh, sorry. The cameras are broken and yourself is wicked hard. It's not easy. It's not easy. It's not easy when you're in a jail. And they told me, Oh, have you been to jail? No, no, no. Never been in jail. I was only in jail over night. But I mean they, if you're on suicide watch, man, they make it hard for you to kill yourself.

Speaker 3:          01:20:36       They watch you and if your, is that what? Suicide watch beans. Yes. They watch you so you can't kill yourself again. That's the, they watch you every 30 minutes or so. What the fuck was this psychologist thinking that took this guy off suicide watch? Literally a couple of weeks after he tried to commit suicide. If someone tries to commit suicide, you know, not speaking as a guy who's had friends commit suicide, why? They're fucking thinking about it for years, man. Some of them, they go back and forth day to day. Some of them, some of them just do. Yes, some of them just do that. But when someone does actively try it, they're not gonna just be fine while they're in fucking prison awaiting trial for having sex with kids. It seems like Jeffrey Epstein's life was going to get really worse from what it was few months before. Could be or other people's lives are going to get really worse because Jeffrey Epstein's now in jail and they're digging deep into his past and well when we flew with them 26 times, 26 times, and ain't a lot of times to fly with a guy.

Speaker 3:          01:21:35       I don't understand what the big deal is. We flew in a Chet, we rode a bus together. He was on the back of my bike. Do you know, do you know people that know Jeffrey Epstein? Yes. Yeah, yeah. I do think too. And a lot of them, uh, it really was that, yeah. Talk to him, well hung out a little bit. There's many people that feel like he was an agent, uh, and that he was trying to compromise people and that's one of the things about this whole Lolita Island thing is that they would compromise people. They would compromise people by having a bunch of young girls who are very sexy, who were hired to go and flirt and maybe even have sex with people and that these people were young. These girls were like 17 under age, perhaps under age, some places perhaps not under age, other places, but in incredibly embarrassing and you know for, for the people and agent compromise for home.

Speaker 3:          01:22:24       Who knows? I mean there's a lot of thoughts, but that's one of the things about when he got arrested, the the, was it the prosecutor or whoever was it cut him. The deal literally was quoted as saying, I was told he's above my pay grade and that he was intelligence. That's the quote. Really the intelligence thing. Try to find that quote. Yeah. Try to find that quote. Yes. The guy said this was when he gave him a lenient sentence many years ago, Shelly 12 or something. No one seems to know how he got his money. Well, the fucking $70 million penthouse that he had in Manhattan was given to him. Right. Given to him, who the fuck gives someone a $70 million house? Well, I was kind of hoping you would to me. I don't have one. Okay. If I have a bunch of them, I'd give you one.

Speaker 3:          01:23:07       I got it wrong. You gotta go now I'm just joking. I was here to give a $70 million house. Oh, you were told wrong. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I think the guy, I think they are, look, I've talked to people many times that work for intelligence agencies and there's a lot of weird shit that they do and one of the things that they do to compromise people as they get them involved in weird stuff that could be very bad for them if it comes out and then they have influence over this person. And if you got a guy with a voracious sexual appetite, I mean there's a few of those fellows out there and you know, Hey man, proud of that. Archie, I'm out off now. I'm going fucking hanging out, having a good time with Jeffrey and we're just flat around. I mean, come on man, it's, it's, it's highly likely.

Speaker 3:          01:23:54       One of the guys that I know that knew him was also a freak, like a sexual freak. And I'm like, okay, I think, I think I see a pattern here. This the, it's very likely that that's what was going on. This guy was compromising people and probably absolutely a sex addict himself. And I believe all the women that say all the horrible things that he did to them and hired them for things and had underage girls do sexual things with him. It's probably true. It's probably true. He's probably a fucked up twisted dude. But many people that are involved, even in good things get compromised. Like there's many people that work for the CIA that were legitimate CIA operatives who wound up selling drugs. This, there's a lot of this happens. People go sideways, people get in involved in shady activity that are cops. There's cops that wind up doing illegal things.

Speaker 3:          01:24:40       They signed on to be a cop, to be a, a person who's going to serve and protect and be involved in the community. And slowly but surely they get compromised and they get involved in illegal activity. And the next thing you know, they're corrupt. That happens. It happens. And then sometimes people's fucking suicide themselves, the people that, uh, that I know that knew him, it was a, they weren't even aware of the CD stuff going on. So of course that's going to be true too. Well, he was a, it'd be 100% he was also a champion of science. I mean a champion. Yes, he, but that's the thing about people. They can be really good. Sure. In some ways and horrible in other ways. This idea that people are buying or you're one or a zero is nonsense. There's really good people that do terrible things.

Speaker 3:          01:25:27       There's really terrible people that also do good things. You know, like look, fucking Trump just passed something and no one wants to give him credit for this. He stuff was the kidney stones. He did. He did wonderful stuff for kidney transplant stuff. I'm sure he pushed through, well that was going to say that he absorbed all the student loans for disabled veterans. [inaudible] fantastic. I love it. You don't hear a word about it and where to praise. Look, we should absolve student loans for fucking everyone. We're crippling kids. We're crippling the 17, 18 year old kids who sign up for these fucking loans and they get compromised to the point where we have people to this day right now that are getting their social security,

Speaker 1:          01:26:04       their social security money's getting docked because they owe student loans. They're at the end of the fucking road. But what do you do? What do you do? Uh, and this is a real question. This is not rhetorical. What do you do about the feeling of fairness? The people that work their way through college waiting tables? That's a good question. Working really hard. And then they, uh, we just say their feelings, which I think is valid, which is, yeah, yeah, you got fucked on this, but let's help someone else out. What did we hear? Compassion. Here's the cause. You know, um, uh, there are people that worked really hard to not have student loans and there are people that took them. Um, there has to be somebody who took them prevalently 100%. I think quite a few. And I think it's also, we also should pay attention to the human mind and the development of the human mind in the frontal cortex.

Speaker 1:          01:26:57       And the frontal lobe does not develop properly until you're 25 years old. Right. So some somewhere in that roster minus four years, definitely out 17 it's definitely not 18 months. So you're taking on these fucking loans. You, you, you can't be trusted with money or your future or thinking about what the fuck you're doing in terms of like taking on a debt of hundreds of thousands. We have to, and this also ties in, um, uh, with, with bisexual stuff as well. Don't we have to decide when someone's adult and then give them that respect? Yes. We have to say you're 18 years old. We can't control what decisions you make. Yes. Does that, you're going to be, cause I think 25 is too old. I think 25 is too old as well. Yeah. But I think

Speaker 3:          01:27:40       we're saying is, I mean look, there's a lot of 18 year old people that make very good moral decisions. Yes. And we should, we should praise that. Here's the problem with the student loan thing, in terms of the fee, that's the only loans that you never get exonerated from. You can get bankruptcy, right? And you can get exonerated. You can, you could escape the loans of credit cards, the debt of mortgages. You could escape a bad business collapsing and owing millions and whatever you get. You could escape that through bankruptcy. You cannot do that with student loans. It's a corrupt system. You take a child who's trying to learn a trade or trying to learn a profession and you acquire insane debt that's going to track you and cripple you for the rest of your life. And no matter what happens to you,

Speaker 1:          01:28:29       you owe that money. But also you're taking your colleges out of the free market too, by giving those, by giving those loans easily. Yes. And by having government help. Yes. So you're also taking away the free market because you know, we found out that when you put the free market in, like play six surgery, when insurance doesn't cover it, it gets wicked cheap. You know? And if colleges had to be paid as people went without easy loans to get and colleges did not

Speaker 2:          01:29:02       get government money, they might be wicked cheaper.

Speaker 3:          01:29:05       I think that will be really, really expensive. I think [inaudible] crazy expensive. I think the real solution is in treating education like a thing that's going to make our society better. And think of it as the same way we think about the fire department. Same way you think about police department,

Speaker 2:          01:29:23       that, I mean when you read the paper, there's always one whole thing about colleges getting too expensive and people can't go do they need to. And then you turn 20 pages later in the paper and there's an article about how online learning is going to happen is happening and all of this stuff is going to happen. Do you think that that idea of college is going to hold up for another 10 years? I think there's an experience that people, I mean, did you go to college?

Speaker 3:          01:29:48       Well, I did, but I went to college in my town. I went to UMass Boston and uh, I really only went because I didn't want to be a loser. It was really all it was. I was, uh, doing martial arts and fighting and traveling all over the world or all over the country rather. And, and thinking about doing standup at the time as well. And then transitioning to doing stand up while I was also still taking classes. I was learning nothing. It was a complete waste of time. I was only doing it so I could say yeah, taking classes at UMass Boston, I was barely paying attention, barely showing up. And um, it was just a thing that I didn't want to tell people that I wasn't going to college. Like that was the number one reason why I did it, but I, but that was, I had a unique life from the time I was, uh, you know, graduating from high school to the time I started doing standup. I was obsessed with martial arts and competing and that's all I wanted to do was make the Olympic team for TaeKwonDo. That's what, that was my goal. And that's what I was trying to do. So I wasn't a normal person. I wasn't like I wasn't going to go to Ohio and fucking travel over there and take a full course load and not be able to pursue what I wanted, what I wanted to do.

Speaker 2:          01:30:53       And also you've got a window [inaudible] yeah. Politically that's it. It's fairly,

Speaker 3:          01:30:57       and there's no, there was no scholarships for TaeKwonDo goes and doesn't, it didn't exist. And the only other option was the army. There was a dude, I think his name was clay barbers, this really talented guy who was a fighter who was, uh, on the U S team at one point in time, I think. And he was a competing through the army. Like they, they had subsidized his training somehow or another. And I was thinking maybe I should join the army like those, the other, the only other thing that I was thinking about doing. But um, for people, I think there's a thing about getting away from your parents, getting away from them, getting away from their influence, being wild and crazy and be with a bunch of other kids and trying to find yourself. And I think that comes from traveling to a place and going to college. And I think there's, there's some benefit in that. And I have friends that have had great benefit in that sort of a transformative experience of being on a campus, a physical campus in a place that's outside of their hometown where it gives them this new experience where they get to try to reinvent.

Speaker 2:          01:31:51       There's no doubt about that. Yeah. People do that. Being able to be someone else. But I wonder, I wonder if all of that, why are we giving that a four

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       year period? Why isn't that our whole lives? It can, it could be and should be. And isn't that the way that's going to change? Cause people aren't having jobs for the whole life anymore. And by the way, the liberal arts education was never supposed to teach people a trade. Right. It was always supposed to make it so that young men could talk in it at parties. Yeah. That was the idea. We can have the same cultural thing. We can tell about Shakespeare, we can talk about this, we can talk about that. But none of this was meant to give people jobs. Well, it's so rigid, right? You get out of high school, high school was this torturous affair where you're being a square peg, they're trying to shove into a round hole. Then you get out and then they fly off to wherever the fuck you're going to go to school and you go there and you're forced with this overbearing workload of school and then social things.

Speaker 1:          01:32:48       You're trying to figure out what's okay and what's not okay now where's the safe space and what am I, what am I? Am I allowed to say this and am I allowed to say that? And what are the new rules now for this new generation and where are we really gonna change the world. And then all the sudden you're out in the world and you realize that fucking money that you spent or that loan that you got is not getting you a job and you're fucked and you can't get a job and you're also massively in debt and severely depressed and trying to figure out your future. I mean, Missy go on Adderall and you're like, we're setting people up. We're setting people up for a horrible failure. I am with Bernie Sanders in that I think education should be free and I don't think that's a bad thing.

Speaker 1:          01:33:26       I think as you burn it, I think you should have to earn it. How bout if education is really cheap? Like everything else is getting cheaper, ma? Well, I mean TVs are really cheap. [inaudible] more expensive. I think we could pay for it with taxes or maybe wrong or the individuals could pay for maybe the individuals because cheap and if it made sense, if it made sense. I mean if you want to learn something now we know this very well. If you want to learn anything now you can get it for free on the web. You definitely can do many things. I mean other than physical things, there's a lot of physical things that you need to be taught by a coach, but I think there's a lot of things you can learn online and even the physical things, you can get a big chunk of it from online tutorials.

Speaker 1:          01:34:08       I mean let's, let's talk about all that matters. Okay. Let's talk about juggling. You know, I grew up as a juggler when you were doing the TaeKwonDo, I was juggling all the time. That's all I did and that was my whole life was juggling. And what happened was with the internet juggling gut tremendously better because people could watch videos of things they knew were possible and get better if juggling get better. Physics certainly can. It seems like you can take a course at any college online and if you sincerely want to learn, you know, I don't know if we need to have this, what is, what does the term called when the, when the Amish take their one year of Rumpelstiltskin assessment from spring program spring. I don't think we need a nationally tax subsidized Rumspringa for every person

Speaker 2:          01:34:58       in the country. I don't see what it is. Right? Yeah. You go to college, well you just described we do the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. It seems like live your fucking life. There isn't this four year magic period or there's two year magic period and go out and learn the stuff you want to learn. I mean, um, you know, we both have children and they'll be talking about going to college and of course my, my, well not of course, but my wife will push very hard for college and my thinking is anything they want to learn they can, they can just learn it. Yeah. You know, by the way, this was also true with just the libraries in local towns. It's just more true now. It's even easier now. You know, I can't imagine growing up where my, my son can type in Lenny Bruce and it all just pops up.

Speaker 2:          01:35:46       Right? I mean, that was amazing. Store order it, order it. They didn't grip into Griffin's music store in Greenfield, Massachusetts did not have the Carnegie hall concert right there in the stacks I had to order. All right. Frank Zappa on the back of one of his records. Menches Lenny Bruce and he's on Sergeant pepper. I guess I should learn about him. Um, uh, let me write that down. That's how I learned about Terrence McKenna. I learned about Terence McKenna from listening to a bill Hicks record. Yeah, yeah. I was like, who is this McKenna and what's a heroic dose? And at, at Frank Zappa, one of his records, I forget which it is, I think it's freak out, but it might be absolutely free. Says on the back. Do not listen to this song until you've read Franz Kafka and the penal comedy. Ah, I got the record, opened it up.

Speaker 2:          01:36:34       It said that I listened to one side, got to that song, got on my bike, rode down to the Greenfield public library. Kafka. I've got this written down. Kafka in the penal colony, sat there, Reddit went back, listened to the record. My entire education starts with Mike Nesmith of the monkeys who said, listen to Zappa, listen to Hendrix from Zappa to Lenny Bruce from Lindy Bruce to the whole world. And I believe that, uh, that is available to everybody all the time. I mean, I don't know, as I would say tax players should pay for college. I think I would say, did we need college? Isn't that fade in a way? I think there's a real benefit to being in a classroom with a brilliant professor. Yeah. Yeah. I think there is, but we're also seeing with Ted talks, which I know are jive, but there is a, there's all these, you know, their job, you, there can be a lot of jive Ted talks. There's some jive Ted talks. Yeah. Yeah. But what I'm saying is I went to one of the first Ted conferences and [inaudible] and got to hear, um, you know, um, all these credible people speaking. It was mind blowing and I wasn't college age. I was, you know, I was whatever I was 45 or something 40. And it was, it was an amazing spirit. Jonas Salk, you know, I sat

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       and listened to Jonas salt talk. I know I've been in a room with brilliant people speaking and it's really, really great, but I think we can, we can deliver that cheaper. And that's the side that Bernie Sanders I want to talk about. It's not, can we give endless amounts of money to these fucking people on college campuses? Can we pay them all the money in the world to take our children and give them something to do in between smoking dope? Could we rather just say, can't we make this experience cheap enough so that anybody can go and experience it? Why don't you, why? Why isn't it possible for you for a few bucks to go and be in a room with a brilliant person? I think that would be a thing that would be beneficial to almost anybody at any point in time instead of the rigid structure of like, you know, this is, you know, you have to get all this work done by X amount of time.

Speaker 1:          01:38:49       That's the other thing that happens to kids too. They're, they're taught about having no sleep and about beating your body up and about cramming and about getting all this work done in a short period of time. They're really, we're really preparing them for a horrible job and all this shit that doesn't work, you know, all that weird, that weird kind of hazing shit that we do for medical professionals. You're going to work for, for a fucking, never weren't saying it's terrible for the patient if we're bad for everybody, you know? So my thing, you just made the argument about the frontal cortex and you're not really ready to your 25 [inaudible]. What are the huge advantages I had in my life was a shitty, shitty education, horrible education. You know, I went to a bad, bad, bad public school that had an influx of hippies from UMass that came in and experiment that on us.

Speaker 1:          01:39:38       So we had no education whatsoever. I graduated from high school on a plea bargain. Uh, I had very good, um, S a T so I had scholarships to wherever I wanted to go, but I chose not to because I misunderstood Bob Dylan. I didn't know he was lying. So I went and hopped trains and hitchhiked around and lived homeless for a couple of years and I never read Bowlby Dick till I was 45. Thank you. If I'd read Moby Dick when I was supposed to would call the JJ, I wouldn't have gotten it. But I was able to get it at the right age and now it's my favorite book cause I was ready for it. You know, there's so many things that are on the curriculum that are very, very important. Maybe not that day. I think there's also an issue with people not thinking of education in terms of like that it's a lifetime for sure. It's not something that you graduated from college and then you're done. We really should be educating ourselves throughout life shorts and not just accidentally or incidentally by experiences. We should do it because there's things that we pursue that are interesting now is one of the greatest times ever to do that because of audio books that you can do it while you're in the car. You could do it while you're on the train, you can get educated and you can also, they're doing this weird connecting

Speaker 2:          01:40:54       thing where I've not experimented with this, but I'd love to where people take courses online and then find people who are also taking courses online in their communities and then immediate like a fucking Starbucks to discuss what happened before, uh, in the class, which is mind blowing that that can happen. So you can take, you know, uh, one of my huge, I mean, one of the things I wanted to do is I wanted to learn to play jazz and let it play upright bass. I took that up at 45 and I learned to play upright bebop bass passably a huge accomplishment. And now I really want to learn a language, you know, so I was looking at a little bit, cause I figured maybe there's a government watch list I'm not on, so I should learn Arabic.

Speaker 3:          01:41:40       No, that was my thing. Cause don't you think that that, that ticks all the boxes that's going to give me everything. Yeah. If I just learned Arabic. So I started looking

Speaker 2:          01:41:49       to how I can learn how I can learn Arabic and uh, it's amazing the kind of network that's developing all over the world to be able to learn anything. So my argument with you, uh, on, uh, on the, uh, on the Bernie thing of paying for everybody's college is I think we can get college so fucking cheap. You can go to college your whole life. Well,

Speaker 3:          01:42:15       I don't think that's a bad idea, you know, if it's possible to get called that cheap. But I don't want professors to be poor. I mean, I think one of the real problems we have with public education is that people don't want to be a teacher because Patriot teachers don't get paid much. Sure. But there's, there's a way, there's, I would say that's government intervention that's doing that. I would say if you, government intervention is keeping the salary.

Speaker 2:          01:42:37       I think so. Really? I really think so because I think that we're not having enough of the, of the, of the, of the competition is stuff there. I mean, um, you know, you, you would pay good money to be in a room with the Steven Pinker, you know, and I think that locally, this was always a problem that I'd never figured out. You know, when I was in Greenfield, Massachusetts, a town of 20,000, I would say to all the other, uh, by other high school students, I would say, you know, if we didn't give our money to the rolling stones and the Beatles and Dylan and all these other bands, we could pull our buddy together and have a really good local band. We could have a great band right here in town, you know? And I think that if you thought of education that way, can't we get in our little area really great teachers, you can teach this stuff. It might be pretty [inaudible]. Well, it'd be okay

Speaker 3:          01:43:32       using if we could spread education right through any, any method, whatever we can do, if we can encourage people to be more educated. But I think that one of the best ways to do it really is just, look, there's a lot of podcasts that are educating people. There's a lot of information that you can get and it's minor, but it's what getting is, where

Speaker 1:          01:43:52       there's more information available now than ever before. I think it's very different than what colleges traditionally colleges. A thing where you go and it's a Rite of passage. It's like, and we don't have those in this world, and I think we could do with them. I think we could do with these rights, particularly for young men. I don't mind, and maybe it's the case for young women, obviously I never was one, but when you're a young man, there's this transitionary period where you're a boy and then all of a sudden, am I a man yet? Like when am I a man? Certainly a lot of, a lot of cultures, religions have done that. Getting thrown into getting that certificate and getting your diploma. Holy shit, I graduated from fucking university. I'm a man now. I'm a grown up. I have a degree. I'm a woman now.

Speaker 1:          01:44:35       I have a degree. I am an adult. And you're obviously, you know, uh, I'm, I'm seeing this, you know, it's okay to speak with an accent. It's not okay to hear with one. Uh, I'm hearing that from someone who spent an awful lot of time explaining to myself and others why I didn't go to college. You know, you wanted to show you weren't a loser. I didn't have that. I didn't say I went to Ringling brothers Barnum Bailey greatest show on earth clown college. You know what I mean? If you want a big shore, you don't get respect. That's where you go. Well, I'd say I talk about it. It's just cause I want people to really know where my head was at. I don't want to like glorify was when I was in college, I went without any right of passage at all. Right. You know, and the closest I had to a right of passage was earning my living. Well, the trust. Huge. You were also, you were on a different pursuit. Like your pursuit was the Carney pursuit and you enjoyed that. I mean there was like a, you have how to lust for it, you know, and it obviously worked out well.

Speaker 1:          01:45:38       Did okay, listen, you really have to bale it too because it has to occur around now. Yeah. Okay. Alright. What are you doing? You just hanging out.
