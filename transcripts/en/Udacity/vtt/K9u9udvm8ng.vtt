When you're building components,
it's a very common practice to reflect

00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:07.875
the state of the component
using CSS classes.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:12.394
For instance here is a toggle button
that I've built and when I click on it,

00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:14.632
it's going to go into a pressed state.

00:00:14.632 --> 00:00:16.424
And in order to style that state,

00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:20.640
my JavaScript has added a pressed
class up here to my class list.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.671
And because I want to have good
semantics, my JavaScript has also set

00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:28.020
the aria-pressed state for
this toggle button to true.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.118
And the style of a pressed state of the
button in my CSS, I have a selector that

00:00:32.118 --> 00:00:36.260
targets any instance of the button
that has this pressed class.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.910
Now a useful technique which we can
employ in this situation is to actually

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.310
remove this pressed class, and
instead replace it with aria attributes.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.370
So I'm going to update the selector so
that it looks like this.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.240
Here I'm using a CSS attribute selector

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.539
to target the element when
aria-pressed is true.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.120
And the effect is the same as before,
but

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.680
now I get this nice verification that
I've set the aria state properly

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.510
because it's visually
reflected by my element.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.520
Not to mention I can cut
down on some of my CSS noise

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.430
by getting rid of additional selectors
and replacing them with aria attributes.
