00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.960
Let's finish the job of decoupling the car class from the use of System.out.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.925
There's a second print statement in the drive method where we print something

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:14.144
out every time that a passenger gets dropped off. So we want to move this again

00:00:14.144 --> 00:00:19.278
to the simulation class that caused the drive method. There's just one problem

00:00:19.278 --> 00:00:23.990
and that is that this statement occurs in a loop. There may be more than one

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.778
printout per call to drive. So let's think a bit out of the box here. We drive

00:00:28.778 --> 00:00:32.958
the car to the next location and what could we tell the caller? We could tell

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:38.080
the caller what the passengers are that have been dropped off. So go ahead,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.830
take this out. Change the return type so that it now returns an array list of

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.087
person each time you remove a passenger, stick it into that array list. And at

00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:54.170
the end of the method, return that array list. In the drivesCars method of the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.433
stimulation class, look at where you called drive. Now that returns a value

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:05.293
namely an array list of person. Save that array list in a variable. Then make a

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:08.770
loop over all of the people in that list and for each of them, print the drop

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.436
off message. Go ahead and implement that now.
