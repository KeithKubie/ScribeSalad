00:00:00.437 --> 00:00:01.757
- [Voiceover] Hey,
grammarians, today we're going

00:00:01.757 --> 00:00:04.313
to be talking about
correlative conjunctions and

00:00:04.313 --> 00:00:07.585
I know this this looks like
pretty ugly word, correlative,

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:09.725
like, it's kind of
complicated looking but,

00:00:09.725 --> 00:00:11.117
let's break it down.

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:12.881
This co part comes from the Latin,

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:15.631
cum, meaning with or, together...

00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:20.383
And relative, well, we know
that the word relative is, like,

00:00:20.383 --> 00:00:23.075
your aunt or, your uncle or,
your cousin is a relative.

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:24.583
So, we're just going to say, that

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:27.250
just means relative or, related.

00:00:28.462 --> 00:00:30.343
So, correlative conjunctions, there

00:00:30.343 --> 00:00:32.875
we see it, definitionally
or, etymologically,

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:35.219
are related together in some way.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.515
They're matched pairs;
they're a matching set.

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:41.395
And this just means that,
when you see one, it's

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:43.299
probably time to use the other.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:47.131
In this video, we'll go
through five of my favorites.

00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:50.427
So, either/or, is a good
pair to start off with.

00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:52.891
And when you start a sentence
with either or, either,

00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:54.541
I don't know how you say it.

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.537
It sets up the expectation
that you're going to have to

00:00:56.537 --> 00:00:59.229
be choosing between two things,
so, we're going to say, or,

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.201
later in the sentence,
as in, what is reputed to

00:01:02.201 --> 00:01:04.317
be Oscar Wilde's last words, either the

00:01:04.317 --> 00:01:06.317
wallpaper goes, or I do.

00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:12.452
The opposite of either/or is neither/nor.

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:17.591
So, either/or sets up this
choice between two options and

00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:20.197
neither/nor rejects both options, so,

00:01:20.197 --> 00:01:23.114
neither Jia nor Becca liked Howard.

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:25.677
And I recognize that I say neither and

00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:27.137
some of you say neither and there's a

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:28.344
whole George Gershwin song about that but,

00:01:28.344 --> 00:01:29.775
let's just chalk it up to

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:33.303
my Midwestern American accent, how 'bout?

00:01:33.303 --> 00:01:36.241
♫ Either, either, neither, neither

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.889
♫ Let's learn about some conjunctions

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:44.056
♫ But oh, if we talk about the
both and you use and, and oh,

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:51.232
♫ If you learn to use conjunctions,
that is grand, oh yes ♫

00:01:53.217 --> 00:01:57.001
Both Bigby and LaDoux
were career criminals.

00:01:57.001 --> 00:01:58.977
Why we're using both to indicate a

00:01:58.977 --> 00:02:02.041
connection between two things
and then we use and later in

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:05.041
the sentence to really firm that up.

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:09.749
As/so, is kind of an interesting one.

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.349
It's a little formal and it kind of

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.717
allows you to set up this relationship of

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:18.505
consequence, right, to say, if
one thing is happening then,

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:22.700
another thing happens
as a consequence, so...

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.174
As goes Kansas, so goes the nation.

00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:28.634
So, you know, as one thing happens,

00:02:28.634 --> 00:02:30.422
so must another thing happen, is

00:02:30.422 --> 00:02:33.302
what this is trying to set up.

00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:37.318
Whether and or, is
similar to either and or,

00:02:37.318 --> 00:02:41.485
except it has a, kind of,
whiff of possibility about it.

00:02:43.078 --> 00:02:45.910
Whether you like shrimp or
chocolate, there's certain to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.438
be something for you at
the Veracruz food fair.

00:02:50.438 --> 00:02:51.582
Right, because whether is, kind of,

00:02:51.582 --> 00:02:54.090
setting up this possibility
between these two options and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.758
it doesn't really matter
which one you choose.

00:02:56.758 --> 00:02:59.962
It's just offering up possibilities.

00:02:59.962 --> 00:03:01.358
And I would like to offer you the

00:03:01.358 --> 00:03:03.238
possibility of checking out more of these

00:03:03.238 --> 00:03:06.394
correlative conjunctions in our exercises.

00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:09.554
So, stick around; you can learn anything.

00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:10.387
David out.
