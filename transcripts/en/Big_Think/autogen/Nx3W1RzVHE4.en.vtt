would come up with a ha here's a way to
 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.900
would come up with a ha here's a way to
get around the Heisenberg uncertainty

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910
get around the Heisenberg uncertainty
 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.600
get around the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle and that Niels Devore would

back and forth and what's funny about
this and in a way is that Einstein

mathematics was worked out he accepted
 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.110
mathematics was worked out he accepted
it and yet he kind of poked and prodded

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120
it and yet he kind of poked and prodded
