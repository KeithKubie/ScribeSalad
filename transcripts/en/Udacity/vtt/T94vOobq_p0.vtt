00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.171
So there's only one really important and

00:00:03.171 --> 00:00:07.055
interesting thing about this
equation and here it is.

00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:11.274
Notice the Z value of the point.

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:13.933
So this is written in a funny way,
right?

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.056
This is Z of x, y.

00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:16.609
What does that mean?

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.551
That means, if I'm at some point x,
y, remember that's a ray in space.

00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:21.751
Right?
Z in the,

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:26.204
in accordance to my camera
is the depth of that point.

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:32.043
You'll notice that this thing is made up
of two terms, the A term and the B term.

00:00:32.043 --> 00:00:34.889
The A term has the translation in it.

00:00:34.889 --> 00:00:37.251
The B term has the rotation in it.

00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:42.075
The depth is only in the A term,
the translation term.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:46.011
Why?
Think about motion that happens.

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:50.950
If you remember, a projective
camera just has rays out in space.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.406
And you can think of the rays as
going out till they hit something and

00:00:54.406 --> 00:00:55.405
they stop, okay?

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:59.027
Now, if I rotate those rays.

00:00:59.027 --> 00:01:00.896
In fact, maybe I can draw this.

00:01:00.896 --> 00:01:03.613
So here's my point and
here's a whole bunch of rays.

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:07.827
So let's suppose here's my image
plane for frame one, okay?

00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:14.149
If I rotate some angle, so
my image plane will now be there.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.782
So before this ray was hitting
at that point on the plane and

00:01:17.782 --> 00:01:20.615
now it's hitting at this
point on the plane.

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:23.605
So, if before it was in the middle,
now it's to the right-hand side.

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:24.238
Okay, fine.

00:01:24.238 --> 00:01:29.384
Notice I didn't tell you how far the
rays went, because as the image plane

00:01:29.384 --> 00:01:34.787
rotates and it cuts through the rays,
it doesn't matter how far the rays go.

00:01:34.787 --> 00:01:41.934
So the depth has no impact on the amount
of motion that you see as you rotate,

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:46.031
but if I translate
the depth matters a lot.

00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:47.900
Remember, the whole
thing about the moon?

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.684
Right?

00:01:48.684 --> 00:01:50.037
That the moon seems to follow you?

00:01:50.037 --> 00:01:51.964
And we're going to
demonstrate this right now.

00:01:51.964 --> 00:01:55.354
So now get out your rulers
on the screen, right?

00:01:55.354 --> 00:01:57.351
I'm going to take a step to the right,
like that.

00:01:57.351 --> 00:01:58.953
Okay?

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:04.003
So the amount of motion that you
saw is whatever it is, all right?

00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:06.824
Now, I take the same size step.

00:02:06.824 --> 00:02:09.419
Megan, did I move in more of the field?

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:12.496
Did I move much further across the field
than I did when I was in the back?

00:02:12.496 --> 00:02:13.506
Megan's going yes.

00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:16.741
In other words, the amount of motion you
get, this is called motion parallax.

00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:18.152
It is a function of the depth.

00:02:18.152 --> 00:02:22.936
So that really dorky demonstration
is why the Z value is

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:27.619
only in the term that has
the translation component.

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:29.115
If you don't translate,

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:32.518
the depth doesn't matter in
terms of how much things move.

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:37.493
That's why we talked about when
you build panoramas from rotation,

00:02:37.493 --> 00:02:39.388
I can just map the planes.

00:02:39.388 --> 00:02:42.911
I can map the, the rays, because it
didn't matter what the depth was.

00:02:42.911 --> 00:02:44.676
This is the general motion model.

00:02:44.676 --> 00:02:47.033
I, I hope this was not too pedantic.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:51.160
I like tying back the stuff we're doing
now with the, the stuff we did before.
