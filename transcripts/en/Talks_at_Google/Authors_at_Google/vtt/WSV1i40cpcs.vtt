[APPLAUSE]

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.280
ANDREW SOLOMON: Thank you.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.670
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.910
I was assigned about 20 years
ago to write a piece on deaf

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.760
politics for "The New York Times
Magazine." And when I

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.290
got the assignment, I was a
little bewildered by it

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.400
because I had mostly been doing
foreign reporting, and I

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.090
wasn't at all clear on why I
was given this particular

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.800
assignment.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.730
And my editor said to me,
you've been very good at

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.010
penetrating foreign cultures,
and I think this is a foreign

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.540
culture within our
own society.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.840
And at the time, I thought that
deafness was simply a

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.540
disability.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.600
It was a misfortune.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.690
Those poor people, wouldn't it
be great if we could get them

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.770
all hearing?

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.830
And I was very surprised because
I worked in the deaf

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.340
world to find the robust nature
of the deaf political

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.040
movement and the deaf
cultural movement.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.160
I met deaf people who were
members of deaf clubs.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.980
I saw the deaf theatre.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.620
I saw deaf poetry.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.910
And I saw what an intimacy there
was among people united

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.830
by the common use of
sign language.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.540
And I came to understand
deafness as a culture.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.610
It wasn't my culture, and I
didn't particularly want to

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.310
lose my hearing and go to join
it, but I recognized that it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.850
was a very valid culture for
all of the people who were

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.960
part of it.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.200
And then after I had that basic
experience, I discovered

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.900
that most deaf people are
born to hearing parents.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.090
That they mostly are brought up
by parents who really want

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.140
them to function in
the hearing world.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.700
That many of them discover the
deaf culture when they get

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.280
into their adolescence or at
some point thereafter.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.170
And when they discover it, it
comes as a great liberation.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.280
And then their parents have to
reckon with the fact that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.720
their children belong
to a culture

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.870
that's foreign to them.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.880
And some parents deal with it
well, and some parents deal

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.380
with it very badly.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.620
So as I began examining that
set of questions, I thought

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.680
they had a lot of resonance
for me because I had the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.980
experience of being gay.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.310
And most gay people are born
to straight parents.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.430
And those parents by and large,
at some level, at least

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.740
traditionally, have tried to get
their children to conform

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.640
to what they see as the norms
of the normal world either

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.760
because those parents are
embarrassed by who their

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.330
children are, or simply because
they think that this

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.800
life in some other culture
looks foreign, and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.170
frightening, and disorienting.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.080
And they think that it's a
harder life and possibly an

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.070
unhappier one.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.910
And so I saw this parallel,
and I wrote when I did the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.880
piece for "The Times Magazine"
about the similarities between

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.020
deaf politics and culture and
gay politics and culture.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.230
And while, as I've said deafness
is not my culture, it

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.750
seemed to me to have much of the
vitality that was familiar

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.030
to me from gay culture.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.560
And then about 10 years went by
and a friend of a friend of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.430
mine had a daughter
who was a dwarf.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.170
And I saw her one night, and she
started talking about the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.430
questions she was facing.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.550
Should she bring her daughter up
to think she was just like

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.090
everyone else but a little
short, or should she bring up

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.470
her daughter with a sense of
difference and a sense of

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.530
pride in that difference.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.140
Should she get involved in the
Little People of America.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.550
What were the things that she
should do in order to ensure

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.330
that her child grow
up healthy.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.640
And as she talked about it and
as I found out that most

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.040
dwarfs are born to parents of
average height, I thought,

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.000
this is a recurring thing in
which you have a family the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.150
perceives itself at some level
or another to be normal.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.640
And they have a kid whom they
perceive at some level or

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.970
other to be alien.

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.730
And they have to figure
out what to do

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.730
with this alien child.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.340
And eventually, I formulated
the idea that there are two

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.480
kinds of identities.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.780
There's vertical identity
and horizontal identity.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.570
And vertical identity it is the
word I use for any kind of

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.840
identity that's passed
down generationally.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.040
So one's ethnicity is usually
a vertical identity.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.750
It's something you have in
common with your parents.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.860
Your nationality, often your
religion, your language, these

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.110
are all things you have in
common with your parents.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.460
And there's very little attempt
made to redress

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.770
vertical identity.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.130
So arguments can be made that
belonging to an ethnic

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.040
minority, even in the United
States as it's constructed

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.990
today, carries with it
difficulties and burdens but

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.990
nobody is trying to prevent
members of the minority from

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.950
being born and being part
of their ethnic group.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.430
You can argue I don't know, for
example, there's a lot of

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.820
anti-Semitism.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.960
It could be difficult
to be Jewish in

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.590
certain sectors of America.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.880
But no one has sort of started
a campaign on how to make

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.900
sure, at least not since it
rather tragically happened a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.200
long time ago, to make sure
that Jews are not born to

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.130
Jewish parents.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.550
But any kind of identity which
is what I've called

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.490
horizontal--

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.450
where the child has a quality
that's expressly different

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.480
from the parents and has to come
to a feeling of identity

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.550
about that quality-- that
feeling of identity is learned

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.300
as I've said horizontally
from a peer group.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.320
It's learned from other
people you meet

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.720
outside of the family.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.400
And those identities
consistently people are trying

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.090
to fix, and to change,
and to address.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.850
And so I set out to look at
what is the range of these

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.530
horizontal identities.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.350
I looked at my own experience
as a gay person.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.060
I looked at deafness, dwarfism,
Down syndrome,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.900
autism, schizophrenia.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.330
I looked at multiple severe
disabilities and the way that

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.710
people respond to those.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.920
At families who had kids who
were prodigies because the

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.050
point I wanted to make is that
it's difference that's

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.390
difficult rather than whether
the valence of that difference

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.850
is positive or negative.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.280
Most prodigies are born to
parents who don't have any

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.640
particular genius in the field
that the children operate in.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.140
I looked at families bringing up
children conceived in rape

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.950
in order to demonstrate that the
sense of the child being

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.780
somehow alien and different
could have to do not only with

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.940
what the child inherently
was but also where

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.460
the child came from.

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.250
I had families of kids who
commit crimes, who have their

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.170
image of their child destroyed
by something that the child

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.780
does and then have to reckon
with that difference.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.020
And then a chapter on families
of people who are transgender.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.570
And I framed the whole thing
with my experience as the gay

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.760
child with straight parents
at the beginning and my

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.180
experience of becoming a parent
myself at the end.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.980
So that's the sort of narrative
structure that I

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.670
worked with.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.980
And it took a long while to
penetrate all of these

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.620
communities.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.890
I ended up interviewing about
300 families over 11 years.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.650
It's different understanding
the genetics of autism, and

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.150
understanding the problems of
the criminal justice system,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.600
and understanding what
constitutes musical genius,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.820
for example.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.290
So I was very much in the thick
of all of those studies.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.730
What I found is, I looked at
all of these categories was

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.790
that each of them

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.760
individually, is quite isolating.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.590
There are only so many
families dealing with

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.650
schizophrenia.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.565
There are only so many families
who have kids who

00:06:15.565 --> 00:06:16.730
have committed crimes.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.830
There are only so many families
who are dealing with

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.730
children who have got multiple
really severe disabilities.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.890
But that actually the experience
of dealing with a

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.310
child who's somewhat different
from you is almost a universal

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.140
experience.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.060
And that every family I talked
to described things that were

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.140
in common with the other
families I talked to.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.170
And I thought if you think of
yourself as having something

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.310
in common only with other
families dealing with autism,

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.340
you're in a little segment
of the population.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.740
If you think of yourself as
having something in common

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.250
with families who are
negotiating difference, then

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.600
suddenly you find that
you're in the

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.970
mainstream in many ways.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.660
And I've yet to meet any parent
who hasn't occasionally

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.210
looked at their child and
thought, where on earth did

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.900
you come from?

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.010
And I found as I got deeper and
deeper into the experience

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.260
of writing about all of these
families, that there was a

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.840
parallel between their more
extreme experience and

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.500
everyone else's experience.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.570
So the same way that you might
test children's pajamas by

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.830
putting them in an inferno to
make sure that the sleeve

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.610
doesn't catch fire if your child
reaches across a stove.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.870
So in that same way by looking
at these extreme circumstances

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.780
and this extreme negotiation of
difference, you really are

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.750
looking at what the universal
experience of parenting is.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.440
So that was sort of where
I started out.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.360
And then I got very deep into
these communities and tried to

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.150
look at the enormous prejudice
people experience, at the

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:36.450
shape and nature of that
experience, and at how people

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.470
are able to transcend it.

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.170
And I think that we forget to
some degree how much our

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.910
perception of all of these
differences has changed over

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.130
the last 30 or 40 years.

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.120
And I thought to myself, each
of these things can be

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.700
experienced as an illness,
and each of them can be

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.290
experienced as an identity.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.770
Indeed, almost anything can be
experienced as an illness or

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:00.930
as an identity.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.540
You can experience being very
young or very old as an

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:05.880
illness in some ways.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.510
There are context in which
it will make it

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.000
harder for you to function.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.940
You can experience any of these
things as who you are in

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.700
central to your identity.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.860
And I thought the tension
between the illness model and

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.170
the identity model
is very strong.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.780
And I felt especially well
qualified to talk about it

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.130
because when I was growing
up, I experienced

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.530
gayness as an illness.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.910
And in my adult life, it's very
definitely an identity.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.600
And when I was experiencing it
as an illness, almost everyone

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.330
experienced it as an illness.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:34.150
And now a lot of people are

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.070
experiencing it as an identity.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.490
And I thought, OK, how did we
get from there to here?

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.840
So I'm going to read to you just
a few little excerpts in

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.549
the book of things that
people have said.

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:46.440
But this was written when
I was a child in "Time

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.770
Magazine," which was considered
a relatively

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.620
liberal voice of the American
establishment.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.640
"Even in purely non-religious
terms, homosexuality

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.320
represents a misuse of
the sexual faculty.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.040
It is a pathetic little
second-rate substitute for

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.350
reality, a pitiable
flight from life.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.260
As such, it deserves no
encouragement, no

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.960
glamorization, no
rationalization, no fake

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.340
status as minority martyrdom,
no sophistry about simple

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.150
differences in taste, and above
all, no pretense that it

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.180
is anything but a pernicious
sickness."

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.730
So the fact that we could in
about 40-some years, get from

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.810
that to having a president who
has come out in support of gay

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.510
marriage, is little short
of astonishing.

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.620
And I was very interested
in how that

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.190
shift had taken place.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.580
I'm gonna read to you-- just for
purposes of parallelism,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.980
because sometimes I mean, the
gay movement has been more

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.040
visible than some others--

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.960
a passage from about the same
time by an ethicist named

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.050
Joseph Fletcher who was writing
in "The Atlantic,"

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.120
which was an even more
liberal paper.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.150
And he's writing about kids
with Down syndrome.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:10:02.060
He said, "There is no reason to
feel guilty about putting a

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.650
Down syndrome baby away, whether
it's put away in the

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.650
sense of hidden in a sanatorium
or in a more

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.330
responsible lethal sense.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.940
It is sad, yes, dreadful,
but it carries no guilt.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:20.220
True guilt arises only from an
offense against a person and a

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.200
Downs is not a person."

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.730
So that was 1968.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:30.060
So I was very interested in
where the shift came from and

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.560
what the shift has
looked like.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.510
And I also became interested in
the tension that frequently

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.290
exists between social
movements, which are

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.770
liberalizing and have
essentially said, we should

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:44.270
recognize and respect and
value difference and the

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.340
medical movements that exist
that say, these differences

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.710
are difficult and can we
cure and resolve them.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:53.050
So in writing about the deaf, I
ran into the question of the

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.010
cochlear implant.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.270
The cochlear implant is a
medical device surgically

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.990
implanted in the brain which
create some sort of facsimile

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:02.890
of hearing, bypassing the
cochlear which is often

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.200
damaged in people who
have deafness.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.010
Most people who have
deafness have some

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.630
form of cochlear deafness.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.770
So it was greeted by many
people as this glorious

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.840
resolution to a terrible
problem.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.790
And it was greeted by many
people within the deaf

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.270
community as a terrible affront
in which they felt

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.780
that the implant was
erasing deafness.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.070
That it was genocidal.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.600
That it was going to wipe
out the deaf community.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.410
And I found myself feeling
very torn about that.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.670
Because at the individual
level, I do think

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.570
it's hard to be deaf.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:36.460
And at the individual level, I
think if you can save someone

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.730
from that difficulty and enable
them to have full

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.860
communication, especially with
their parents because being

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.560
able to communicate with your
parents is a cornerstone of

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.980
early mental health, which is
a cornerstone of lifetime

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.550
mental health, I thought
that's very valuable.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.700
At the same time, having spent
time in the deaf community, I

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.920
thought the disappearance of
it on the face of the earth

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.460
would be a terrible loss.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.230
And I felt as though the social
acceptance of deafness

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.040
as a culture has really reached
its apex just as this

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.990
medical ability effectively to
eliminate much of deafness

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.700
from the world has
reached its apex.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.180
And I sometime said, it was like
one of those operas in

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.080
which the hero realizes he loves
the heroine at the exact

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.960
moment when she expires
on a sofa.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.270
So that was kind of a
persistent thing.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.060
And I also thought, what does it
mean for parents to accept

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.240
what their child is like?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.080
What does it mean for parents
to change what

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.300
their child is like?

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.130
What does it mean for parents
to have to decide what to

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:31.870
accept and what to attempt
to change?

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.140
And I wrote a little bit about
my early experience.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.890
I have dyslexia.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:38.710
My mom picked up my dyslexia
very early on.

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:41.710
She worked with me endlessly
on reading when I

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:42.810
was a little kid.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.090
And while I'm still dyslexic,
we found lots of ways to

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.140
compensate for it, and reading
and writing turned out not to

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.650
be my problem in life.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:54.440
But I think her sense that we
could trounce that obvious

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.810
neurological abnormality led her
then, when I was older, to

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.280
think that really we could deal
with this thing of my

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.860
being gay, and get
it to go away.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:06.790
And I always remember and have
written about the time that my

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:09.670
mother and my brother and
I were at a shoe store.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.550
And when we were leaving, the
salesman asked us whether we

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.550
would like a balloon.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:16.070
And my brother wanted
a red balloon.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.010
And I said that I wanted
a pink balloon.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.440
And my mother said
that actually I

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.250
wanted a blue balloon.

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.870
And I said, no, I really wanted
the pink balloon.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.690
And she reminded me that my
favorite color was blue.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:33.140
And the fact that now my
favorite color is blue and I'm

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.210
still gay is evidence, I
think, of my mother's

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.490
influence and its limits.

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:41.140
So what is it that happens when
you're trying to change

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:41.630
your child?

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.520
What are the things that's
appropriate to change?

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.910
What are the things that's
appropriate to accept?

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.910
Those questions run all the
way through the work.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.340
And I found as I started working
on this, that there

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.950
are people in many communities
where I would have thought

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.640
that amelioration of some
condition was the appropriate

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.150
step who actually felt very
strongly that they wanted to

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.250
stay as exactly who they were.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:04.660
So the autism rights movement,
which is very vibrant and very

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.010
much alive, in which people who
have got various forms of

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.480
autism talk about how
it's their identity

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.730
and who they are.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.120
How does that line up the kids
were banging their head

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.730
against a wall in the corner
and don't have any speech?

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.430
How do you reconcile the full
spectrum of autism?

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:22.870
These are complicated
questions.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.370
But this is what one of the
autism activists said.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:30.920
"When parents say, 'I wish my
child did not have autism.'

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.360
What they're really saying is,
'I wish the autistic child I

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.920
have did not exist and I had a
different, non-autistic child

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.440
instead.'

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.060
Read that again.

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:45.910
This is what we hear when you
mourn over our existence.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.110
This is what we hear when
you pray for a cure.

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:52.350
This is what we know when you
tell us of your fondest hopes

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.230
and dreams for us, that your
greatest wish is that one day

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:00.200
we will cease to be and
strangers you can love will

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.100
move in behind our faces."

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.100
That's from Jim Sinclair
who has autism.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.620
One of the questions that comes
up over and over again

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.840
in considering any of these
issues is what constitutes a

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.320
disability, what constitutes a
difference, and what the sort

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.070
of upside can be to various
kinds of difference.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.150
So one of the people
I interviewed is

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.550
a guy and his family.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.150
He was born with diastrophic
dwarfism.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.290
And the doctors at the hospital
said to his mother

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:33.170
that he was never going to learn
to walk or to talk, that

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:35.370
they were never going to have
any kind of relationship with

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.750
him, and that they really
probably should just leave him

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.590
at the hospital, and hospital
would take care of

00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:41.980
him until he died.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.910
And his mother decided that she
was not going to do that--

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.100
and his father, the two
of them together--

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.600
and they brought him home.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.140
And his mother then did
a lot of research.

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:54.430
This was pre-internet for
most people at least.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:58.160
It was the mid '80s, and his
mother was doing research to

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.220
try to find the best doctor
to treat him.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.150
She herself worked as an
operator in a call center.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.700
His father was a construction
worker.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.930
They didn't have huge resources

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.500
or tremendous education.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.140
But his mother some how found
the best doctor for dealing

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.600
with kids with his condition was
someone at Johns Hopkins.

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.850
In the course of the first 10
years of his life, he had 30

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.200
surgical interventions as a
result of which he is in fact

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.320
able to walk.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.420
While he was stuck in the
hospital for these long

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.710
periods of time, he had
nothing else to do.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.460
So when the tutors came around
to teach him, he ended up

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.820
actually doing a lot of school
work, turned out to be

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.680
extremely bright, was the first
person in his family

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.890
ever to go to college.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.210
And his mother told me one day
we were talking on the phone

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.700
and she said, oh, I
had such a day.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.120
She said, I was out.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.870
Clinton drives this
special car with

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:46.870
all of these fittings.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:49.970
I was driving home, and I saw
it was parked, she said,

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.270
outside a bar.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.800
And I thought to myself,
oh, my god.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:53.900
He's in the bar.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.170
His friends are six feet tall.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.220
He's three feet tall.

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.340
Two beers for them is
four beers for him.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.970
She said, I just thought,
is he going to be OK?

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:01.560
Is he going to make
it back home?

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.790
I couldn't go in there.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:03.220
I went home.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.520
I left him a bunch of messages
on his answering machine.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.060
She said, and then I suddenly
thought, if someone had said

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.900
to me when he was born that my
worry was that he would go

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.960
drinking and driving with his
college buddies, I would have

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:17.260
been so thrilled to
have that problem.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.720
And this is a little
quote from her.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.579
I said to her, because he's a
remarkable and very charming

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:24.790
fellow, I said to her, what do
you think you did that helped

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.730
him to have such a good and
successful life and to be such

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.350
an amazing guy?

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.640
And his mother said,
"What did I do?

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.720
I loved him, that's all.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.850
The other day, these people
much higher up than us

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:40.870
socially, much more educated
called me up and said, they

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.460
couldn't handle this.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.390
They were in Texas politics and
thought the stigma would

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.910
be harmful to them.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.630
And they gave their baby
up for adoption.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.370
That's just what they were
going to do, and it's the

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.240
opposite of what I
was going to do

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.160
right from the beginning.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.980
The other day, Clinton came home
and he goes, 'Ma, I saw a

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:03.110
blind man today with a
stick in Manhattan.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.890
There were people rushing
back and forth,

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.550
and he was all alone.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:07.730
I just felt like crying.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:09.630
I felt so sorry for him.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.430
So I offered to bring him to
where he needed to go.'

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:17.350
Clinton just always had that
light in him, and we were

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:21.860
lucky enough to be the first
to see it there."

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.550
And I felt that model of
parental love was one that I

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.070
ran into over and over again.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.700
That sense of parents who
managed truly to see children

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.580
who by some standards would have
been considered difficult

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.870
to see, difficult to sympathize
with, difficult to

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:36.920
understand.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.440
And I found that there was
always the question of why

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.950
some families were able to
derive a positive version of

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:45.650
these experiences
and others not.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:48.830
And I increasingly saw it as
something that people could

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.920
construct for themselves.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.180
So I interviewed a family, Tom
and Karen Robards, who live

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.870
here on the Upper West
Side about their son

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.370
who has Down syndrome.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:02.540
And they were hard-charging,
Wall Street types.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:06.450
At some point, they decided
that they were

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:07.400
going to have kids.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.110
When their son was born with
Down syndrome, they looked at

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.340
the educational things that
were available to him, and

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.100
they decided that none of them
was really very good.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.570
They started a tiny little
center to help kids.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.090
It was in two rooms which were
converted lavatories here in

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:23.560
New York that they somehow
got from the

00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:26.730
Archdiocese of the city.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.600
They've been involved
in Catholic causes.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.280
And they ended up getting very
involved in building the Cooke

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.300
Center, which now serves
hundreds and hundreds of

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.530
children and helped to set up
the educational principles,

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.660
which have allowed people with
Down syndrome to function at a

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.480
level that was completely
unimaginable

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.540
30 or 40 years ago.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.820
People with Down syndrome
live three times as long

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.910
as they used to.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:46.120
They're on TV.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.680
They're able to live
on their own.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.120
The progress with Down syndrome
has being huge at the

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.470
exact same time that the
progress with prenatal

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.140
screening has been huge, and
the numbers of people being

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.140
born with Down syndrome
have come down.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.170
But I said to them, look, this
has been such a gigantic part

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:00.710
of your life.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.330
You've worked so hard on it.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:03.540
I said, do you regret it?

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.440
Do you wish that your child
didn't have Down syndrome?

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:09.940
Do you wish that you weren't
doing this whole thing that

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.470
you're doing?

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:12.620
Would you like to
make it go away?

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:17.010
And his dad said, you know, for
my son, I would like to be

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.760
able to make it go away.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.180
For the world, I think if we
didn't have people with Down

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.920
syndrome, it would
be a real loss.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.540
And his mother said, you know,
I'm with my husband.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.410
For my son, I would make it go
away because it's a difficult

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.720
way to be in the world, and
I'd like to give him the

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.450
easiest possible life.

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:35.980
But speaking for myself, while
I would have never have

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.870
believed 23 years ago when he
was born that I could come to

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:42.010
such a point, speaking for
myself, it's made us better

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.780
people than we would have been
without it and given us a

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.790
richer and more interesting
life.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.410
And speaking for myself, I
wouldn't give it up for

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:52.030
anything in the world.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.400
That motif of people saying I
have this child looks aberrant

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.940
and whom one would think I would
want not to have, and I

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.170
nonetheless have found enormous

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:02.380
meaning in it, was recurrent.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:06.090
And I found at some point
that I kept thinking,

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:06.890
yeah, but come on.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.060
I mean, really, if you had the
option, you wouldn't have a

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:09.890
child like this.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:10.990
You wouldn't have this life.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.860
You'd have some other life.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:16.070
And ultimately I thought it
doesn't really matter what

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:18.510
someone would have chosen if
they had had a choice they

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:19.560
didn't have.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.030
What matters is whether they've
managed to construct

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.370
the feeling of value
in their own life.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.130
And the more that they're able
to do that, the more likely it

00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:30.560
is that they're actually going
to be able to take care of

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.790
their children adequately and
find joy and pleasure

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.880
in their own lives.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.410
And a lot of the parents, as
it turned out, actually

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.390
recognized the degree
to which this was a

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.230
manufactured business.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:47.190
So I had one mother who had two
children with very, very

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.210
severe disabilities.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:48.920
She had one.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.890
She was told it was an absolute
anomaly and she

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.430
should go ahead and have
more children.

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.590
They were told that.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.290
They had a child, a second child
who was born with all of

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:57.320
these disabilities.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.350
And eventually, the children,
who are very difficult to take

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.350
care of and had to be lifted
in and out of bed in the

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.430
bathtub, the mother
herniated a disc.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:08.170
The father was finding it very
difficult to schedule things.

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.560
They put them in a group home,
which they visited every day

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.250
but where there were
professionals who could deal

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.080
with those things.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.600
One of those professionals
left one of the children

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.000
unattended in a bathtub and he
slipped down and drowned.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.080
And when I talk to them about
it, his mother described the

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.400
enormous pain she felt.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.310
And when she buried his ashes,
she gave this extraordinary

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:34.780
sermon and she said, "Let me
bury here the rage I feel to

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:40.740
have been twice robbed, once of
the child I wanted and once

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.550
of the son I loved."

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:46.400
One of the other people who also
had ended up-- it happens

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.460
more than you would think--

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.500
with two children who had very
severe disabilities, I was

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.700
talking to her about the ways
in which she and her husband

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:54.900
had found meaning in things.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.040
And she said, "I actually think
it's not believing in

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.150
God that has given us
this perspective.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:05.180
People always regale us with
these little sayings like,

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.490
'God doesn't give you any more
than you can handle.' But

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:12.120
children like ours are not
preordained as a gift.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:16.110
They're a gift because that's
what we have chosen."

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:19.250
Well, to choose that about a
child with severe disabilities

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.220
is one thing.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:23.030
To choose it about a child who
has some of these other

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.480
extraordinary qualities
is something else.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.200
And so I went and talked to
these many women dealing with

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.990
children conceived in rape,
many of whom were deeply

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:34.940
traumatized and in enormous
pain about it.

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.250
And there was one of them
to whom I said--

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.890
I was in Rwanda where I went
to interview people who had

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.140
been raped in the genocide
because there were so many of

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:45.510
them bringing up children
from that period.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:51.410
And there was one woman I met
who said to me, told me her

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.333
story, I mean her horrific
story of what

00:23:53.333 --> 00:23:54.860
she had been through.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.480
And at the end of interviews,
especially when I'm out of my

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.200
own context, I tend to say to
people, do you have any

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:01.060
questions for me.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.130
Because it helps to redress the
sort of power imbalance of

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:05.650
the interview situation.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.260
And in Rwanda, people had
said, will this be

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.280
published in French?

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.680
Are you going to use my name?

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.000
How long are you staying here?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.090
Those were the kinds
of questions I got.

00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:16.540
And I interviewed this one woman
who said to me when I

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.980
asked her that, she said, well,
you work in this field

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.580
of psychology, right?

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.270
And I said, well,
yes, sort of.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:26.470
And she said, can you tell me
how to love my daughter more?

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.110
Because I want to love her so
much, but when I look at her,

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:33.050
I think about the terrible
things that happened and it

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.740
gets in the way.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.040
And I was so taken aback by the
question, I just sort of

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.120
stood there, and she repeated in
this very insistent voice.

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.490
And she had tears running
down her face.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.820
She said, can you tell me how
to love my daughter more?

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:49.070
And it was only a week
afterwards as I kept thinking

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.360
about it that I thought how much
love there was in that

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.510
question itself.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.560
In talking to families of people
who committed crimes, I

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.700
looked at the ways in which
people have to struggle with

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.860
what their children have done
and especially with the injury

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.020
their children have
caused to others.

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.630
And one of the families I
interviewed was the family of

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.980
Dylan Klebold who was one of
the perpetrators of the

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.900
Columbine massacre.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.410
And Tom and Sue Klebold were
initially very resistant to

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:14.520
the idea being interviewed.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.290
It was a long dance
of seduction to

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:17.280
draw them into it.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.600
Finally, we got to the point
at which they were ready to

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.050
talk to me.

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:26.020
The first weekend that we spent
together, having said

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:27.680
that they weren't sure they
were going to talk at all,

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.530
they couldn't stop.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.940
They were so full
of their story.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.300
And at the end of three days in
which we recorded more than

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:38.000
20 hours of interviews, we
were all sitting at the

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.960
kitchen table.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.570
And I said, well, if Dylan were
here now, do have a sense

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.890
of what you'd want to ask him or
what you want to tell him?

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:47.990
And his father said,
I sure do.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.870
I'd want to ask him what the
hell he thought he was doing.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.830
And his mother kind of looked at
the floor, and she thought

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:54.450
for a minute.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.520
And she looked back up and she
said, I would ask him to

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.310
forgive me for being his mother
and never knowing what

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:03.980
was going on inside his head.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.930
And afterwards, several years
afterwards, she and I had

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.280
dinner together.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.250
And she said to me, "You know,
when it first happened, I used

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.240
to wish that I had never
had children,

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.910
that I had never married.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.740
If Tom and I hadn't crossed
paths at Ohio State, Dylan

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.650
wouldn't have existed, and this
terrible thing wouldn't

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.020
have happened.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.060
But over time, I've come to feel
that, for myself, I am

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.220
glad I had kids and glad
I had the kids I did.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.880
Because the love for them,
even at the price of this

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:40.020
pain, has been the single
greatest joy of my life.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.860
When I say that, I'm speaking of
my own pain and not of the

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.720
pain of other people.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.900
But I accept my own pain.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.140
Life is full of suffering,
and this is mine.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.380
I know it would have been better
for the world if Dylan

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.240
had never been born.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.900
But I believe it would not
have been better for me."

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.290
The final chapter as I mentioned
is about people who

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.530
are transgender, and that was a
world in which I spent a lot

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.280
of time, and in which I had
a lot of very, very moving

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.180
experiences.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.220
And one of the people I got to
know is a transwoman named Kim

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.820
Reed, who, when she was a boy,
was the quarterback on her

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.080
high school football team.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.520
And she eventually made a film,
which was about going to

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:30.080
her 20th high school reunion
and what it was like coming

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.820
back to Montana having
made this change.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.645
And my particular favorite
moment in the film is when

00:27:36.645 --> 00:27:39.360
she's at the reunion and she's
talking to somebody else from

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:46.950
her class who says, "But Kim,
we've all changed." But Kim

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:53.880
was eventually invited to do a
weekend at her church in which

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.180
she gave the sermon.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:58.690
And she was also invited to show
the film at her church.

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:01.520
And the church had a whole day
in which people could have

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.840
seminars to discuss the issues
that it brought up.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.160
And I want to just
read you a little

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.330
excerpt from that sermon.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.950
I was there in Montana for
the weekend in question.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:12.990
The sermon was quite amazing.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:16.590
She said, "The night before last
when our film was playing

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.000
in here, I went outside to the
columbarium where my father's

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.500
ashes rest.

00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.720
As I was kneeling there by
what I call Dad's spot, I

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.500
thought of the hours and hours
of videotape that he shot

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.640
lovingly of me during my
football games and how much of

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.260
the same footage was now being
shown inside this sanctuary.

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:36.510
Now, it's certainly not the
context that any of us

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:40.020
expected, but I knew
dad would be proud.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.680
And just then, the dusk breeze
blew in this waft of sound,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.050
and it was strangely
familiar to me.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:48.820
And I realized it was the
crosstown football game coming

00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:50.470
from the stadium.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:53.300
The band was playing, and the
announcer was bellowing, and

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.140
all of these old tapes
were playing

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:57.210
inside here on the screen.

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.430
And I knew that new ones were
being recorded just a few

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.420
blocks away.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.400
Those recording their new
memories to tape should be

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:08.680
only so lucky as to be surprised
by the last thing

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.570
that they expected from their
loved ones, only so fortunate

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:17.120
as to get a chance to welcome
them home with radical love.

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.630
I thought about how all
these cycles of lives

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.060
would continue on.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:25.740
And so many aspects of my life
coalesced in that one moment,

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:29.730
that one beautiful, stunning,
blessed moment, the past and

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:35.350
the present, parent and child,
male and female, the pain that

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:39.200
life sometimes brings, and the
soothing love that welcomes it

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.570
with open arms after its
exhausting journey into a

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.980
distant country."

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.790
And when that afternoon I said
to Kim's mom, Carol, I said,

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.890
do you wish things
were different?

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:54.310
Do you wish that Paul had been
happy to be Paul and hadn't

00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.170
had to change to be Kim?

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:58.560
She said, "Well,
of course I do.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.930
It would have been easier for
Paul and for the rest of us.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:06.090
But the key phrase in there is
'happy to be Paul.' He wasn't.

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.550
And I'm just so glad that
he had the courage to do

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.410
something about it.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:14.110
I had someone say this weekend,
'Carol, Paul died,

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.490
and I haven't finished
mourning that.'

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.100
I don't feel that.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:22.380
Kim is much more present to
people than Paul ever was.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.960
Paul was never rude.

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.120
He just wasn't totally
present.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.560
We didn't quite have his
attention, and look what we

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:33.700
got, Kim."

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.970
It's a book about familial
acceptance.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:39.260
And it's easy in the course of
telling these few stories that

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.460
I've pulled for a talk here
today, to lose sight of the

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:44.120
fact that actually
many families

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.490
reject their children.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:49.410
That about half of transgender
children are rejected by their

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.730
families of origin.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.650
That many people in all of these
situations are rejected,

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.290
are put up for adoption,
are sent away.

00:30:56.290 --> 00:30:58.930
That however, isn't news, and
it isn't particularly

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:00.190
surprising.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.250
I tried to talk about
it in the book.

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.410
I looked at, for example, how
frequently parents of children

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.770
with autism end up committing
filicide and killing their own

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:12.870
children because they find life
with them so unbearable.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:15.260
It's not happening in most
cases, but it's happening more

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.770
frequently than you think.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.330
But I really wanted to look
at what this process is of

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.620
constructing meaning and what
the process is of allowing

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:26.200
your child to emerge in their
full independence.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.380
And I feel it profoundly
informed my decision to become

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:30.790
a parent myself.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:33.590
So many people said to me, I
can't believe you decided to

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:35.820
have a family right in the
middle of a book about

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.670
everything that could
go wrong.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:40.690
And what I've said over and over
again is, it's not a book

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.140
about everything that can go
wrong, it's a book about the

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.390
resilience and power of parental
love even when

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:48.140
everything goes wrong.

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:53.880
So I married my husband
in 2007, originally.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:32:00.580
And when I met him almost 12
years ago, he was already the

00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:03.100
biological father of his son
with some lesbian friends in

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:03.870
Minneapolis.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.680
He had said he would be involved
in that son's life to

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.250
the extent that the son
and his moms wanted.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:12.240
But for the time being, he was
very disengaged to ensure that

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.090
the two mothers were
recognized as

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:16.500
his son's two parents.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.170
A few years later, they asked
him to be the donor again.

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:23.250
And so Oliver was the first
child and Lucy was the second.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.880
In the meanwhile, one of my
closest friends from college

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.210
had gone through a divorce.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:28.560
And I said to her, oh,
are you feeling

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.820
sad about being divorced?

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.400
And she said, I'm actually glad
to be out of a marriage

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.650
that had become very painful,
but I'm sad

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.120
about not having kids.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.010
And I said in a rather jocular
way, I said, well, if you ever

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.490
decide you want to have
kids, I think you'd

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:42.480
be an amazing mother.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.980
And I've always wanted
kids, and I'd be

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.070
glad to be the father.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:47.630
And she came to me and said
that she had thought it

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.810
through, and if I really wanted
to do that, she wanted

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:50.405
to do it too.

00:32:50.405 --> 00:32:54.280
And so we have a daughter of
whom I am the biological and

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.410
actual father.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:57.730
My daughter, Blaine, who lives
with her mother in Texas, but

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:59.130
comes to visit a lot.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.130
And then I said to John that I
thought it would be really

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.540
great for us to have a kid at
home with us full time.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.700
He wasn't as sure of the
idea as I was, but he

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:09.040
came around to it.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.220
And so we then decided
to do that.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.940
Since I was the one who
championed the idea, I was to

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.700
be the biological father.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.940
Laura, the lesbian mother of
Oliver and Lucy, then offered

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:21.360
to be our surrogate.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:26.000
So we have an egg donor and
Laura carried the pregnancy.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.665
And as she was doing that, we
got to be very close to Laura

00:33:28.665 --> 00:33:30.740
and Tammy and Oliver and Lucy.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.840
And they announced at some point
that they wanted to call

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.040
us Daddy and Papa as little
Blaine in Texas did.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.300
And so we now have by shorthand,
five parents of

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:42.210
four children in three states.

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.420
And it's proved to be an
unbelievably joyful

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.090
experience.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.660
And I think my sense that you
could have a child who is

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:51.290
different or a childhood that
was different and that it

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.920
could still be so rich and
rewarding, very much came out

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.050
of this book.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.870
Now, the day that George was
born, there was a knot in the

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:00.550
umbilical cord when
he was born.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:03.940
And the day after he was born,
the doctor came in and said

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.160
he's extending his legs in a
very peculiar fashion, and

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.239
we're concerned that there
may be brain damage.

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:12.230
And it was very shocking to me
having written this whole book

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.670
about how people find all of
this wonderful meaning in

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:17.190
these experiences of difficulty
to suddenly be

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.230
confronted with that idea myself
and to think how much I

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.929
didn't want to find that
particular kind of meaning.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:26.120
And it lasted a couple of hours
and then it turned out

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:29.159
that he was fine, and the whole
thing was over, but it

00:34:29.159 --> 00:34:30.639
was a very traumatic
experience.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:33.090
And I'm just going to close this
talk by reading to you

00:34:33.090 --> 00:34:36.659
from the final paragraph
of the book in which I

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:38.870
reflected this idea.

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:43.850
I said, "Children ensnared
me the moment I connected

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.719
fatherhood with loss.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:49.020
But I am not sure I would have
noticed that if I hadn't been

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.219
immersed in this research.

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:54.750
Encountering so much strange
love I fell into its

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.270
bewitching patterns and saw how
splendor can illuminate

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:01.370
even the most abject
vulnerabilities.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.500
I had witnessed and learned
the terrifying joy of

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.320
unbearable responsibility,
recognized how it conquers

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.020
everything else.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.860
Sometimes I had thought the
heroic parents in this book

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.290
were fools enslaving themselves
to a life's journey

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.130
with their alien children,
trying to breed

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:22.090
identity out of misery.

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:25.440
I was startled to learn that
my research had built me a

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:30.610
plank, and that I was ready to
join them on their ship."

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:32.170
Thank you very, very much.

00:35:35.537 --> 00:35:36.499
Thank you.

00:35:36.499 --> 00:35:39.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:42.520
So I'll be glad to take some
questions, and there's a video

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.410
that we are apparently not
going to be able to show.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.270
But I think that it will
be available online.

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.500
AUDIENCE: We can show it.

00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:47.275
ANDREW SOLOMON: Oh,
you can show it.

00:35:47.275 --> 00:35:47.870
Oh, fantastic.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:48.970
You can meet some of
the people I was

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:50.176
just talking about.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:53.530
-When I was born death,
my mother cried.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:56.680
She really did not
see a future.

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.736
-The doctors said, he would
never amount to anything.

00:35:58.736 --> 00:36:01.065
His mental capacity would
be little to none.

00:36:01.065 --> 00:36:02.570
And you should probably
give him up

00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:04.010
and think about adoption.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:08.000
-I really didn't even know that
something was going on,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.500
that there was something
wrong in my mind.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.456
-I didn't know the
word transsexual.

00:36:13.456 --> 00:36:16.290
The word transgender hadn't
even been invented yet.

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.600
-He has a mentor
that helps him.

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.440
No biting, Chris.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:24.270
Chris probably had one of the
worst diagnosis ever-- self

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:28.320
injurious, swollen intestines,
poisons in him system, mental

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:30.300
retardation, severe autism.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.316
And I was pretty much told to
put him in an institution.

00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:35.775
-When I was born, my
mom refused to see

00:36:35.775 --> 00:36:36.140
me for three days.

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.260
She was scared.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.430
-Before I transitioned, I
just wasn't all there.

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:44.100
I couldn't quite share
my feelings.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:49.250
I couldn't quite be a full
member of the family.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:50.690
-You sort of get what you get.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:51.850
And you go from there.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.300
And it's your choice.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.210
You want to make the best of it,
you make the best of it.

00:36:56.210 --> 00:36:57.735
You want to make the
worst of it, throw

00:36:57.735 --> 00:36:59.100
yourself a pity party.

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.240
-I set out to write a book which
was about how people

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.680
found meaning in difficulty.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.180
It's hard for the kids
to accept themselves.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.600
It's hard for their families
to accept them.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.950
It's hard for the larger society
to accept the kids and

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:11.970
their parents.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.285
All of it is a struggle.

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.630
I wouldn't ever want to pretend
that these aren't

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:20.990
difficult lives.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:22.480
They are very difficult lives.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:25.310
They're full of pain
and complexity.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:29.380
-We have joints and bones that
are twisted and distorted.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.410
So our life is marred with
a lot of surgeries.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:34.350
Myself, I've had 30.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:36.140
-And there was one guy that
I had a crush on.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.230
He said to me, why
do you lisp?

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:41.800
And my heart would crush.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.250
-Chris did not communicate.

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.290
He didn't sit down.

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:45.200
He didn't put on clothes.

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200
He wouldn't go outside.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.670
He ate the walls.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.430
He ate the table.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.075
He at the rug.

00:37:49.075 --> 00:37:54.580
-I could feel the back of my
neck popping and sizzling.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.280
Like my head was just
heating up.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:57.450
-We couldn't eat in the home.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:58.420
We couldn't have lights on.

00:37:58.420 --> 00:37:59.570
We couldn't have the TV on.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:03.490
If I coughed, he would run
downstairs and punch me.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:08.600
-I actually felt that I was a
surgeon, and I felt I had to

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.010
literally extricate the demon
from inside of my body.

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.760
-When I started this book, I
knew that I was going to be

00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:18.370
looking at a lot of desperate
situations.

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:22.760
-And I would do that by cutting
and burning myself.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.890
-What I didn't know was how much
joy I was going to find.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:29.080
-When I was born, my dad
said, he looks cute.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:31.760
He's just got a big head
and little arms.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.180
The funny thing is I still
look that way.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:38.530
-And the relief that came over
my face when I heard that

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.100
there was a name to what
was going on with me.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:42.570
-I used what God gave me.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:46.010
God didn't give me
legs to run.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:50.010
He didn't give me arms to
play football with.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:54.760
He gave me a brain, and He gave
me a heart, and I try to

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.020
use both of those things
to the fullest.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.570
-The thing I've learned most
over the years is to be a

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:01.640
parent first.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:05.090
I thought to myself, if he's
happy, if he stops hurting

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:09.620
himself, if I can hug him, that
would be the greatest

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.600
gift in life.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.670
-It's kind of pretty sure that
I'm going to have obstacles,

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.100
but I would have had
them anyway.

00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.220
-I know my dad is very,
very proud of me.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:25.170
Because I went on a
journey that he

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:26.772
never dreamed possible.

00:39:26.772 --> 00:39:33.882
-I don't think of myself
as a schizophrenic.

00:39:33.882 --> 00:39:35.070
I am Susan.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.970
-There really isn't any
definition and what's normal,

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:42.720
or not normal, or far from the
tree, or right under the tree.

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:45.970
-I'm lucky to have had her in
this particular period of

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:46.390
time.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.670
-I'm lucky too.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:48.934
-And thank you.

00:39:48.934 --> 00:39:52.005
-The love that parents have
for their children--

00:39:52.005 --> 00:39:53.765
-I guess we are pretty
lucky, huh?

00:39:53.765 --> 00:39:54.675
-Yes, Mom.

00:39:54.675 --> 00:39:55.820
We are.

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.620

an enormous amount.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:19.488 --> 00:40:24.864
AUDIENCE: I was just curious in
terms of the parents that

00:40:24.864 --> 00:40:29.256
you characterized as heroic
versus the parents, who

00:40:29.256 --> 00:40:32.184
without sort of that judgment,
maybe we characterize as less

00:40:32.184 --> 00:40:33.840
than heroic.

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.800
Did you see any commonalities
between those two groups in

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.217
terms of their attitude?

00:40:39.217 --> 00:40:42.292
Or what did it take for
parents to be heroic?

00:40:42.292 --> 00:40:44.420
Did you see any common things
among those parents?

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.210
ANDREW SOLOMON: Well, I should
first of all say that I have a

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:49.800
lot of empathy for parents who
have got children like this

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.590
and are not having the easiest
and best time with them.

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:54.450
I think it's a tall order,
and it's tough.

00:40:54.450 --> 00:40:57.130
And so I wouldn't want to come
down against the other.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:41:00.680
But what I found mostly was this
thing of searching for

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:04.100
meaning and trying to see a way
in which having this child

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.310
had forced them to grow
and to change.

00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:10.050
So I think it's the issue
really with difficulty

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.540
altogether in life, is that you
can either rail against it

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.740
and be angry at it, or you can
accept whatever difficulty

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:18.830
can't, in fact, be ameliorated
and just decide that's you're

00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:21.190
going to look for a way
to build something

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:22.600
positive out of it so.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.555
When you had the mother of that
dwarf saying our child

00:41:25.555 --> 00:41:28.050
had this extraordinary light,
and he did these things.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.020
Or even when you had the mother
who said when she

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:33.260
buried her child that she had
come to love him, it's the

00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:36.070
onset, it's the openness to
falling in love with your own

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.050
child that I think makes an
enormous difference in the

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.210
sense that you've been put on
this path that isn't the one

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.550
you would have chosen, but
nonetheless, offers rewards

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.460
which are perhaps different
from the rewards you

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:48.450
anticipated.

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.670
There's a famous little passage
that was written by

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:52.930
Emily Kingsley who's the mother
of a child with Down

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.380
syndrome called "Welcome to
Holland," which I have

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:57.940
reproduced in this book that we
may have to take it out for

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.880
the edition published in the
Netherlands, but in which she

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.810
says that having children is
like planning a trip to Italy

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.450
but having a child like hers is
when they are coming into

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:10.130
land and you're told actually,
you're landing in Holland.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:13.000
And you have to recognize
that you will never see

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.250
Michelangelo's David.

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:17.710
And you will never get to sort
of walk through the forum or

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.400
take a Gondola in Venice, but
actually the place you're in

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.080
is full of Rembrandts
and tulips.

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.700
And if you can learn to
appreciate those other things

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.260
instead, no matter how much
you may still regret not

00:42:27.260 --> 00:42:29.980
getting to Italy, you can find
a lot of joy in Holland.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:33.260
And it's a little cutesy, but it
actually, I think, sums up

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.210
a lot of the attitude
in question.

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.380
Yeah?

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.029
AUDIENCE: You talked about a
couple of quotes about in view

00:42:39.029 --> 00:42:43.086
of homosexuality and Down
syndrome back in the '60s and

00:42:43.086 --> 00:42:47.870
'70s and how society
has evolved.

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:50.289
What do you think has
contributed to that?

00:42:50.289 --> 00:42:55.054
And what do you think will be
your prediction of how things

00:42:55.054 --> 00:42:59.070
will be 30 or 40 years from now
in terms of perception and

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.895
experience with different
children?

00:43:01.895 --> 00:43:03.540
ANDREW SOLOMON: That's an
excellent question.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.020
I think the thing that really
has made for the shift has

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.430
been the rights movements.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:10.620
And I think the rights movements
have come in a wave.

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:13.650
I think the women's movement and
the original civil rights

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:16.800
movement really set the stage
for the gay rights movement

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:18.340
and the disability
rights movement.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:21.600
And that uncomfortable though
people in some of these groups

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:24.540
may be with people in others of
these groups that actually

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.870
it's been a liberalizing
tendency that's taken place

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.290
over a long period of time.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:32.420
You know, met also with a
certain amount of opposition,

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.000
but there's been more and more
of a recognition that there is

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.410
a diversity of experience that
constitutes human experience.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:42.060
In terms of where we'll be in 30
or 40 years, I'd be really

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.400
curious, because I feel like
where we are now in terms of

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.050
gay rights was unimaginable
30 or 40 years ago.

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:49.770
And will we continue to go
in the same direction?

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.620
Will more and more ways of being
become acceptable, or

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.950
will the medical progress we're
making cause us once

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:58.360
more to narrow the definition
of what it is to be human?

00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.590
History has gone in waves.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.420
It's unusual for there to be
nothing but steady progress

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:03.970
over a long period of time.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.280
I don't know which of the things
that we now experience

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.550
as an illness will in
the end be conceived

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:11.420
primarily as an identity.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.570
What I know is that it will
not all be the same

00:44:13.570 --> 00:44:14.610
as it is right now.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.380
So there are things that right
now we think of as totally

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:20.790
bizarre that in 40 years ago
might seem to people to be

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:22.300
perfectly ordinary.

00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:26.240
Will polygamy be an ordinary
thing in 40 years?

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.760
I don't have any crystal ball
to say what the things are,

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.860
but I think there are things
that the standards of sexual

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.490
contact between adults and
children, will things that now

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:38.985
seem acceptable become
unacceptable.

00:44:38.985 --> 00:44:42.480
Will things that now seem
unacceptable seem more

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.590
acceptable?

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:47.720
Will there be more integration
of people with different kinds

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.640
of intelligence?

00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.270
Will autism continue
to increase?

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.780
Will the autism rights movement
mean that we more and

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:57.880
more accept that many people
are not neurotypical and we

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.260
accept the motor social
interaction that seems to come

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:01.490
most readily to them?

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.050
All of it is unclear.

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:04.860
So I don't know what it
will be, but I do

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.850
know it will be different.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:07.420
And where we are is
so different from

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:08.750
where we were before.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.420
And where we're headed
will be different.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.570
And I think I should say that
part of the reason that

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.190
everything has changed now, and
there may not be another

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.160
radical revision like this, but
is because of the advent

00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:23.380
of the internet and the ability,
if I may be allowed

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.560
in this context to say so, to
figure out what the quality is

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:28.480
you have and Google it.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:33.590
All you have to do is to put in
child with multiple severe

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:36.580
disabilities, and you've got
thousands and thousands of

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.000
articles and links and means
of meeting other parents.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.830
So a lot of these conditions
people

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:44.010
experienced in terrible isolation.

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.090
And now they experience
them in community.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:48.470
And that shift has
been enormous.

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:51.770
And once you have a community,
you can fight for tolerance.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:56.688
So that has also been
a gigantic shift.

00:45:56.688 --> 00:45:58.152
Yeah?

00:45:58.152 --> 00:46:00.348
AUDIENCE: My question
sort of comes--

00:46:00.348 --> 00:46:03.032
I'm not a parent and I haven't
finished the book yet, but I

00:46:03.032 --> 00:46:04.496
love what I've read so far.

00:46:04.496 --> 00:46:04.984
ANDREW SOLOMON: Thank you.

00:46:04.984 --> 00:46:10.219
AUDIENCE: So I have had a hard
time understanding the choices

00:46:10.219 --> 00:46:13.047
some of the parents who
choose to-- kind of,

00:46:13.047 --> 00:46:16.041
here was my life before.

00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:20.033
And it's all gone and now I
have a child, and my whole

00:46:20.033 --> 00:46:24.025
life is involved in taking
care of them.

00:46:24.025 --> 00:46:29.015
An example that I use this from
the chapter on autism,

00:46:29.015 --> 00:46:30.512
the mother--

00:46:30.512 --> 00:46:33.007
Betsy or Betty--

00:46:33.007 --> 00:46:36.167
basically had multiple
depressive episodes that

00:46:36.167 --> 00:46:37.498
caused her to be hospitalized.

00:46:37.498 --> 00:46:41.323
Her husband had bipolar
disorder and was also

00:46:41.323 --> 00:46:41.490
hospitalized.

00:46:41.490 --> 00:46:46.979
And I think they actually put a
child into a care facility.

00:46:46.979 --> 00:46:49.168
But I wonder if you could--

00:46:49.168 --> 00:46:53.466
if you don't mind explaining as
much as you can maybe, the

00:46:53.466 --> 00:46:54.963
choices that the parents
go through.

00:46:54.963 --> 00:46:59.121
I still have a hard time
understanding how people get

00:46:59.121 --> 00:47:02.947
rid of their old life and
get self-directed again.

00:47:02.947 --> 00:47:06.939
I wake up and have breakfast in
the morning versus oh, what

00:47:06.939 --> 00:47:08.436
does my child want.

00:47:08.436 --> 00:47:10.307
Again, I'm not a parent so maybe
it changes no matter

00:47:10.307 --> 00:47:10.931
what anyway.

00:47:10.931 --> 00:47:13.925
But I just wonder how
do they do that?

00:47:13.925 --> 00:47:14.923
And how does it make sense?

00:47:14.923 --> 00:47:17.990
And how are they crazy?

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:19.020
ANDREW SOLOMON: Well, some
of them are crazy.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:20.800
As you observed, the particular
family you're

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:25.620
talking about all ended up in
intensive psychiatric care.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.550
A lot of the time, it's not
something that people have

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.100
thought through before
they have children.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.050
And then you have children with
these kinds of special

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:36.850
needs, and they really require
you to make this radical shift

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:39.370
in your way of life partly just
because of the actual

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:41.150
physical demands on your time.

00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:44.820
So especially for people who
don't have enormous economic

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.360
resources and can't outsource
a lot of the early care, you

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.300
have a child who's
got a disability.

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.850
The child is being
operated on.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:53.040
You're stuck in the hospital.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.810
You're stuck going
back and forth.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:55.940
You take the child home.

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:58.000
He requires 24-hour care.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.280
I mean, a lot of them don't sit
and make the decision, I

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.870
will nobly and heroically give
up my life in favor of this

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:04.010
other way of being.

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.040
But rather simply--

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:07.840
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.885
ANDREW SOLOMON: Well,
there's the--

00:48:10.885 --> 00:48:17.840
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.090
ANDREW SOLOMON: OK.

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:24.090
If we could get the picture,
that would be great.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:29.642
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:37.320
ANDREW SOLOMON: Yes.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:37.850
Where were we?

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:40.900
So making the huge sacrifices,
I think it's really a process

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.810
in which people are dragged
kicking and screaming.

00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:45.120
And then they make sense of
it a little bit later on.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.560
That's really how it begins.

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:48.930
Yes?

00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:51.834
AUDIENCE: In the introduction
you talked a little bit about

00:48:51.834 --> 00:48:54.738
some of the identities you
thought you might discuss in

00:48:54.738 --> 00:48:57.158
the book that were
not included.

00:48:57.158 --> 00:49:00.000
And I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.540
the process and how far you went
in your research and then

00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:02.860
why you decided not
to pursue those.

00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:06.856
And whether those may become
magazine articles later or a

00:49:06.856 --> 00:49:07.832
second book.

00:49:07.832 --> 00:49:09.300
I don't know.

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:10.950
ANDREW SOLOMON: Someone just
actually asked me, they want

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:14.150
to do a sort of little limited
edition book with some of

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:16.050
those stories in it.

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:19.920
I started off looking at dozens
and dozens of topics.

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:23.630
And I narrowed them down--
partly, I chose the ones in

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:29.010
which people had in which
I heard amazing stories.

00:49:29.010 --> 00:49:30.880
And so some of them
came really out of

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.130
the narrative content.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.850
But I also felt that if I was
talking about deafness, even

00:49:34.850 --> 00:49:36.970
though blindness is very
different, I didn't really

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:40.400
need to blindness because
the issues were similar.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:44.290
And if I was doing dwarfism,
I didn't really need to do

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:48.010
gigantism because a lot of the
underlying issues-- even if

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:49.835
the medical issues were actually
quite different-- a

00:49:49.835 --> 00:49:51.760
lot of the underlying issues
were the same.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.900
There was a lot of doing that
kind of elimination and then

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.100
there was a certain amount of
just slashing things because

00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.790
it's quite a chunky
book as it is.

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:02.360
And I was worried that if I
tried to make it any longer,

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:04.300
it would become unwieldy
and unreadable.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.050
So there were some that just
went for that reason.

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:11.660
But there were so many amazing
stories that I heard even in

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.490
these other areas.

00:50:13.490 --> 00:50:16.960
And the idea of giving them
up, it was difficult.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.010
It came at a cost.

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:20.520
I gave up individual families
within each of the chapters,

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.460
and I also gave up
whole chapters.

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.940
But I wanted to cover
a spectrum.

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:26.573
And I felt that if we started
with deafness, which is

00:50:26.573 --> 00:50:29.270
probably the most readily
accepted as an identity and

00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:32.230
which is in some ways for people
who grow up using sign

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:37.100
fluently, the one that has the
least long term, obvious

00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:38.120
detriment in their lives.

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:40.100
We started with the deafness
and dwarfism really.

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.790
And then we went on to
these other things.

00:50:41.790 --> 00:50:44.060
And if we looked at the
ones that are disease

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:46.540
constructions, which is the
first half of the book, and

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.650
the ones that are more identity
constructions, which

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.000
are the second half, I
hoped I was being as

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.592
representative as possible.

00:50:52.592 --> 00:50:52.990
Yeah.

00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:54.478
In the back.

00:50:54.478 --> 00:50:59.438
AUDIENCE: I'm curious when you
set out to write the book, and

00:50:59.438 --> 00:51:00.430
you talked a little bit about
it, you touched on it here

00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:01.918
some of it in an initial
publication.

00:51:01.918 --> 00:51:07.374
But was this a bit of like a
parental litmus test for you?

00:51:07.374 --> 00:51:10.846
Were you sort of looking for a
reason not to be a parent?

00:51:10.846 --> 00:51:15.310
I mean, I don't mean to sound
simplistic, but was it a way

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:17.790
to talk yourself out of it?

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:20.130
ANDREW SOLOMON: It was certainly
not a way to talk

00:51:20.130 --> 00:51:21.340
myself out of being a parent.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.570
I wanted to be a parent.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.580
I'd always wanted
to be a parent.

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.430
And I had at various stages
struggled with the issue of

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:29.400
being gay mostly because I
thought it would prevent me

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.320
from being a parent.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.920
So that had been
kind of steady.

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:35.160
When I realized I could be a
parent, of course, I then went

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:38.590
into a panic mode, but that
was a little later on.

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:45.970
But I think that it was a means
of looking squarely at

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:50.435
what parenthood entailed and
realizing that it was doable.

00:51:50.435 --> 00:51:52.550
So I think in a way,
it was the reverse.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:55.210
It was a way of saying, I'm
terribly anxious about how I

00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:58.260
would deal with having a child
who's different in some way.

00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:01.260
I know that I am a child who
was different in some way.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.480
I know that it was hard for my
parents, though we all got

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.550
through it and came out
happily in the end.

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:09.066
You know, would I be able to do
it and how can I learn how

00:52:09.066 --> 00:52:11.780
to do it in case I have a child
who presents what are,

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.000
for me, challenges like
the ones that I

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.881
posed for my own parents.

00:52:15.881 --> 00:52:18.350
And it was really kind
of the focus.

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:20.140
So yeah.

00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.450
But I mean, I don't think I
realized that I was writing it

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:23.570
until well into it.

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:26.902
AUDIENCE: But I was wondering
if your parents are still

00:52:26.902 --> 00:52:31.246
alive, and if so, how they
responded to the book and how

00:52:31.246 --> 00:52:33.380
that journey has
been for them.

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.890
ANDREW SOLOMON: My mother died
22 years ago, but my father is

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:39.750
still alive, and he's been
immensely supportive of the

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.950
book all the way through.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.680
He read all of the
drafts and so on.

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.200
He's been a big supporter.

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:47.860
I think there were things in it
that were difficult, but he

00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:50.870
said that he felt like
ultimately it expressed a real

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:53.420
truth about ways in which we
had all struggled and how

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.210
we've made it through.

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:56.350
So it had a very good
response to it.

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:57.338
Thanks.

00:52:57.338 --> 00:52:59.314
Yeah, yes?

00:52:59.314 --> 00:53:01.784
AUDIENCE: My question
is a kind of

00:53:01.784 --> 00:53:03.034
writing process question.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:07.586
Was there a moment or was there
sort of a process where

00:53:07.586 --> 00:53:09.216
you committed to the fact that
this was going to just be like

00:53:09.216 --> 00:53:15.084
a huge endeavor and one single
thing rather than a collection

00:53:15.084 --> 00:53:18.751
of articles about identity
politics that were sort of

00:53:18.751 --> 00:53:19.500
different outlooks?

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.430
ANDREW SOLOMON: So I was always
clear that I wanted to

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:22.590
keep it as one book.

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:24.500
There was discussion about
whether it should be broken

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.710
into two books, and I felt like,
well, I have insights

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:29.610
within each chapter, the primary
insight is the uniting

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:32.030
insight, and if we broke it
up, that would get lost.

00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:33.175
And that was the problem.

00:53:33.175 --> 00:53:34.030
And the complexity--

00:53:34.030 --> 00:53:36.000
actually, I'm now looking at
the possibility of making a

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:36.960
documentary film--

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:41.180
is how do you sort of squash all
of this into 90 minutes or

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.660
something like that and not
have it become completely

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.620
incoherent.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:46.750
I don't think I understood
the extent to it.

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:48.760
I mean, I saw it as a book that
was going to take me 3

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.060
years and it took me 11.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:56.040
So it became clear as I went
along that for me to feel like

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.995
I could really speak with
authority on these topics, I

00:53:57.995 --> 00:53:59.600
had to learn a huge amount.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.930
I was thinking, if a book
expresses more than 10% of

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:03.960
what you know about the thing
you're writing about, it's not

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.120
going to be a very
convincing book.

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.800
And I think if I understood how
huge it was going to be, I

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.080
would never have
undertaken it.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.970
But then once I was in the
middle, it was a little like

00:54:12.970 --> 00:54:13.990
the Vietnam War.

00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:15.890
I sort of thought I put
in so much already, I

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:17.420
have to keep going.

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.264
So that was kind of
the feeling of it.

00:54:20.264 --> 00:54:21.590
Yeah.

00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:24.425
Anyone else?

00:54:24.425 --> 00:54:24.850
OK.

00:54:24.850 --> 00:54:28.030
Well, thank you all so much
for coming to this in the

00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:29.080
middle of your busy day.

00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:29.680
Thank you.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.280
Thank you.

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:33.548
[APPLAUSE]
