I think Ruby and rails absolutely lowers

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:04.790
I think Ruby and rails absolutely lowers
 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.990
I think Ruby and rails absolutely lowers
the bar in terms of what it takes to to

unpure programmers I think it's

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770
unpure programmers I think it's
 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.310
unpure programmers I think it's
there is no such thing as the pure

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320
there is no such thing as the pure
 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.710
there is no such thing as the pure

about the Ruby and rails community is

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420
about the Ruby and rails community is
 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.090
about the Ruby and rails community is
exactly that it attracts people from

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100
exactly that it attracts people from
 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.070
exactly that it attracts people from
from all different camps that attracts

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080
from all different camps that attracts
 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.290
from all different camps that attracts
people who are not primarily programmers

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300
people who are not primarily programmers
 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.470
people who are not primarily programmers
I find that often the best ideas come

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480
I find that often the best ideas come
 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.910
I find that often the best ideas come
from people who are not programmers

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920
from people who are not programmers
 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.490

people who bring just a entirely

different perspective on things in fact

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.060

being a newbie is such a important stage

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449
being a newbie is such a important stage
 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.580
being a newbie is such a important stage
because that's where you question

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590
because that's where you question
 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.190
because that's where you question
everything when I first came to to Ruby

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200
everything when I first came to to Ruby
 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.590
everything when I first came to to Ruby
I questioned everything it was like why

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600
I questioned everything it was like why
 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.750
I questioned everything it was like why
doesn't this thing exist why is this

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760
doesn't this thing exist why is this
 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.000

hard that's stupid

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010

like we should change that you have this

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810
like we should change that you have this
 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.060
like we should change that you have this
sort of initial naive approach to things

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070
sort of initial naive approach to things
 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.410
sort of initial naive approach to things
that makes it impossible for you to see

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420
that makes it impossible for you to see
 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.070
that makes it impossible for you to see
what should be impossible you just do if

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080
what should be impossible you just do if
 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.289
what should be impossible you just do if
I had known in the beginning how much

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299
I had known in the beginning how much
 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.140
I had known in the beginning how much
work it would have been to actually

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150
work it would have been to actually
 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.580
work it would have been to actually
create rails I probably would never have

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590
create rails I probably would never have
 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.500

one little thing that to my naive newbie

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380
one little thing that to my naive newbie
 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.060
one little thing that to my naive newbie
sense seemed easy to do so I think it's

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070
sense seemed easy to do so I think it's
 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.280
sense seemed easy to do so I think it's
really important that we keep this flow

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290
really important that we keep this flow
 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.859
really important that we keep this flow
of new people new blood fresh blood

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869
of new people new blood fresh blood
 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.740
of new people new blood fresh blood
coming into the community and I also

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750
coming into the community and I also
 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.950
coming into the community and I also
think it's wonderful that we're creating

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960
think it's wonderful that we're creating
 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.780
think it's wonderful that we're creating
a larger group of people who can create

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790
a larger group of people who can create
 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.929
a larger group of people who can create
applications trying to have

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.520
protectionism

carefully trained programmers who are
able to make programs bad that's not how

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930
able to make programs bad that's not how
 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.970
able to make programs bad that's not how
it should be we should

it should be we should
 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.190
it should be we should
absolutely have programmers of all kinds

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200
absolutely have programmers of all kinds
 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.920
absolutely have programmers of all kinds
some of these programmers will be new

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930
some of these programmers will be new
 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.270
some of these programmers will be new
and they won't know everything and

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280
and they won't know everything and
 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.070
and they won't know everything and
they'll create shitty programs but you

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080
they'll create shitty programs but you
 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.610
they'll create shitty programs but you
know what

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620
know what
 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.460
know what
most of the time a shitty program solves

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470
most of the time a shitty program solves
 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.509
most of the time a shitty program solves
the problem

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519
the problem
 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.759
the problem
you don't need perfect programs all the

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769
you don't need perfect programs all the
 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.160
you don't need perfect programs all the
time there's so many problems in the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170
time there's so many problems in the
 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.430
time there's so many problems in the
world that the tiny group of pristine

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440

white knight programmers just can't

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700
white knight programmers just can't
 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.339
white knight programmers just can't
solve like they can't solve all of them

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:42.349
solve like they can't solve all of them
 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.229
solve like they can't solve all of them
there's just not enough of them so we

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239
there's just not enough of them so we
 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.289
there's just not enough of them so we
need programmers of all all levels to to

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299
need programmers of all all levels to to
 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.030
need programmers of all all levels to to
solve the programming problems of the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040
solve the programming problems of the
 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.970
solve the programming problems of the
world

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980
 
 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.300
 
so for me it's really there's two angles

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310
so for me it's really there's two angles
 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.210
so for me it's really there's two angles
to this there is we can absolutely make

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220
to this there is we can absolutely make
 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.150
to this there is we can absolutely make
things simpler I think I made a lot of

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160
things simpler I think I made a lot of
 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.910
things simpler I think I made a lot of
web development a lot simpler with rails

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920
web development a lot simpler with rails
 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.000
web development a lot simpler with rails
but there's a natural physical limit

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
but there's a natural physical limit
 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.990
but there's a natural physical limit
where at the end programming is just

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000
where at the end programming is just
 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.140
where at the end programming is just
choices how should the program work what

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
choices how should the program work what
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.990
choices how should the program work what
should happen when you click this button

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000
should happen when you click this button
 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.509
should happen when you click this button
those choices are ultimately what's the

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519
those choices are ultimately what's the
 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.640
those choices are ultimately what's the
key of programming and you can't get out

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
key of programming and you can't get out
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.740
key of programming and you can't get out
of that which is also why I think that

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750
of that which is also why I think that
 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.600
of that which is also why I think that
sometimes it's a little bit of a pipe

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610
sometimes it's a little bit of a pipe
 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.120
sometimes it's a little bit of a pipe
dream to think that oh there's gonna be

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130
dream to think that oh there's gonna be
 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.620
dream to think that oh there's gonna be
these magical new environments where

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630
these magical new environments where
 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.789
these magical new environments where
somebody who knows nothing about

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799
somebody who knows nothing about
 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.410
somebody who knows nothing about
programming will just be able to drag

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420
programming will just be able to drag
 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.390
programming will just be able to drag
and drop a few things into a box and

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400
and drop a few things into a box and
 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.789
and drop a few things into a box and
then voila you will have the most

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799
then voila you will have the most
 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.160
then voila you will have the most
amazing program in the world no it's

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170
amazing program in the world no it's
 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.210
amazing program in the world no it's
really not gonna happen like that

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220
really not gonna happen like that
 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.949
really not gonna happen like that
because to have the most amazing

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959
because to have the most amazing
 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.839
because to have the most amazing
programmer in the world you need to care

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849
programmer in the world you need to care
 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.259
programmer in the world you need to care
about a thousand decisions and recording

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269
about a thousand decisions and recording
 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.150
about a thousand decisions and recording
those thousand decisions takes a

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160
those thousand decisions takes a
 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.940
those thousand decisions takes a
programming language so there is a lower

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950
programming language so there is a lower
 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.460
programming language so there is a lower
limit to how simple it can get and that

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470
limit to how simple it can get and that
 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.400
limit to how simple it can get and that
lower limit is you care about these

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410
lower limit is you care about these
 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.080
lower limit is you care about these

and I don't know of any more effective

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739
and I don't know of any more effective
 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.620

way of doing that then then with a great

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630
way of doing that then then with a great
 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.690

gonna create these wonderful
 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.009
gonna create these wonderful
applications there'll be a class of

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019
applications there'll be a class of
 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.199
applications there'll be a class of
applications where you design a niche

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209
applications where you design a niche
 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.650

there can be something simple for that

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680
there can be something simple for that
 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.310
there can be something simple for that
but if you want a freedom of expression

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320
but if you want a freedom of expression

say you need a tool that's expressive

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979
say you need a tool that's expressive
 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.000
say you need a tool that's expressive
enough to to enable that and that is a

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010
enough to to enable that and that is a
 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.800
enough to to enable that and that is a
programming language it doesn't get any

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810
programming language it doesn't get any
 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.150
programming language it doesn't get any
simpler than that

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160
simpler than that
 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.220
