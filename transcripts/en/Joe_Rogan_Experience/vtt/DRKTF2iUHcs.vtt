1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.710
Well,
I grew up base that came to get down.
I'm not internationally known,

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:09.570
but I'm known to rock a microphone.
Oh,

3
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.410
it's crisp and clean.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.180
<v 1>No Caffeine.
That's better than the other brands I have seen.</v>

5
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:16.230
It's not a different color.

6
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:21.231
And I called the rest the radish and that seven up which Wilson's,

7
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.980
that third grade is that a real friends from third grade for a walk in the

8
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.910
garden and do some call.
Pretty Shitty.
Let's start on that.

9
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.660
I don't mind if you tell me.
Just stop following me.
I'm trying to smell you.

10
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.800
Go small for yourself.
This is all secondhand smoke.

11
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.460
You talk too loud in the movies.
Would you please get a little bit to consider,

12
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.270
but did you found a bit too much to think things on the planning cause you got

13
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:52.340
weapons into any dirty dishes in the sink.
[inaudible]

14
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.460
this lead to more cockroaches.

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.660
You need fumigation some hot go with them and stuff and castigation that.

16
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.770
Don't say it man.
Just do what?
I want a curl up in this fluid

17
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.890

18
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.870
Could you please be a little bit considerate you in the movies?

19
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.430
We could please get up in the concert.

20
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.910
You too loud in the movies,

21
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:22.770

22
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.660
which are please give a little bit to consider,
but stop,

23
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.220
Someone was looking at me.
Cool.
Oddballs and certain little something might go,

24
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.540
Bro.
Let it,
let it,
don't forget it.
Like,
mom,
I need a towel.

25
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.320
Influence.
Use New towels.

26
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.070
<v 0>So it was Tillery here.
Bad Flavor for the fuck has started.</v>

27
00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:49.180
I gotta hit add flavor in the house.
Ladies and gentlemen,
how are you guys doing?

28
00:01:49.181 --> 00:01:53.440
All right.
This is,
uh,
the Joe Rogan experience podcast with Brian Ryko,

29
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:58.390
Aka red band with our special guest,
Joe Coco Diaz,

30
00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:01.870
Aka mad flavor eight times a day.
Planet Rock,

31
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.650
Aka Joey Karate sponsored as always by the flashlight.

32
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.530
I don't know why I have to hold this up to the microphone or to them because a

33
00:02:08.531 --> 00:02:10.840
lot of people have seen it for the first time right now.
Oh,
okay.

34
00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:13.480
I do every time though.
I don't know why I do it.
I just keep holding it up.

35
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.890
Most of the people probably listen on iTunes anywhere,
right?
But,
um,
or the Zune,

36
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.030
I don't want to be a Microsoft racist.
Right?
Yeah,
totally.

37
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.640
Is there some something you hear in the background?
Is that like,

38
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.430
oh that's a song part.
Sorry.
It's uh,
the show.
Um,
anyway.

39
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.430
fleshlight.com if you go to my website,
Joe rogan.net,

40
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.770
there's a a link and if you order this,

41
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.210
it gives you 15% off coupon code.
Really good if you fuck it.

42
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.010
And one of the thing,

43
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.120
<v 2>just a little shout out,
cause when I spoke to one of the owners,
Chris,</v>

44
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.310
he said they were going to come up with some new ideas.

45
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.000
You know like when you buy a box of Campbell soup and shit on the side of it.

46
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.890
Yeah.
It gives you the directions for Campbell soup,

47
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.470
but it also gives you directions for other things you could do.

48
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.390
And I was thinking about other things you could do.

49
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.810
Like you could this out and put ice cubes in there and fuck it.
You follow me?

50
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.110
A lot of people having an invented that yet the ice cubes,
ice cubes.

51
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:08.040
I wouldn't do it.
But I know for some people you put ice cubes in.

52
00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:10.150
It's like a fucking trick.
We put some ice cubes,

53
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:13.960
you shake it up and you fucking dry eyes or green tea,
heated.

54
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.090
You know what I'm saying?
Cause it feels nice on your Dick.

55
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.640
Or let's say you had a rough night the night before your bank,

56
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.190
18 hawkers and you fucking Dick is bleeding.

57
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.240
You put Epsom salt in there with warm water and you fuck the ups and saw just a

58
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:28.390
couple of different recipes.
We have fear at Joe Rogan experience.

59
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.860
Not that I would try this shit,

60
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.290
but I know a lot of you fucking freaks would try this stuff at home.

61
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:33.760
I know red band would definitely try it.

62
00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.030
So try ice cubes that would make it shrink and be sad.
But whatever the fuck.

63
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.540
Maybe somebody stepped on your Dick and ultimate may contest wouldn't dry ice

64
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:41.380
burn your Dick.

65
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.760
Well that's some people like that Shit took 20 years ago I went to a club to get

66
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:48.130
quite loose and I walked in,
I'll never forget,
there's like a,

67
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:51.460
it was called Ramrod.
It was a gay bar in the city and we were kids.

68
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:54.220
We were like 18 that's the first time I seen a dude with a Cape on.

69
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.800
I thought it was the coolest fucking thing in the world.

70
00:03:56.801 --> 00:04:01.390
A man had a cape on and I walked into this club and before we walked in,

71
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:02.880
there was a fetish club on the side.

72
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.700
There was a guy in a tub that had a sign on them that said spit on me.

73
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.810
That was his fetish for people to spin on.
So here's the beauty.

74
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.720
I'm standing there.
You know your jaw is gone.
You're drinking.

75
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.160
You Know You had to pee.
And Austin,

76
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.130
they see 20 guys standing on a line for the fucking bathroom.
And I asked him,

77
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:22.000
I go,
listen,
why don't you just ask the guy in the Tub if we could pee on?

78
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.520
So I walked over to the guy who,
can I ask you a question?

79
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.010
Do you mind if we pray on you?
The guys go right ahead.

80
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.250
There was a point in the night I looked at him,
he had a circle of guys just,

81
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.680
you know all those guys that don't want to wait online,
like Fuck It,

82
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:36.400
just pee on him.
When I left,
the guy had three inches of p and the fucking tub,

83
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.600
the sign was all fucking melted,
like the black ink when,
but nothing.

84
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.240
It was this guy wanted people to spit on them.

85
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.050
We ended up pissing on it and I pissed on and I'm guilty of,

86
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.120
I don't give a fuck and suck my Dick Allen.
I would piss on anybody.

87
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:51.940
I don't give a fuck.
He seems like the luckiest man alive.
Oh please.

88
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:54.730
But that's a crazy as fetish.
But you never know.

89
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.790
Some people's chicken is in the men's Gumbo.
You know what I'm saying?

90
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.300
I don't like pissing on myself.
But this guy wanted you to business spit on him.

91
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.570
Wow.
What is that?
That's crazy shit.

92
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:08.020
That's crazy shit that when I was in Seattle on Wednesday night at the comedy

93
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:10.210
club that had a fetish club afterwards,

94
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.760
and there's a couple of times I stayed people fucking crazy.

95
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:15.720
It ain't my bag of tricks.
You know,
people crazy,

96
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.630
but like clips on their nipples and all that.
I'm not into that fucking shit.

97
00:05:19.631 --> 00:05:22.540
But some,
some people like where's all that shit coming from?

98
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.520
Once all that come from,
I don't know.
The same people who are in hoarders.

99
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.710
I Dunno.
I Dunno what these people fucking comes.
It's just a broken brain.

100
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:32.860
Like someone who just wants to shock the shit out of everybody.
I don't know.

101
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:36.070
Like sometimes you're sitting there going,
wow,
I need some action in my sex life.

102
00:05:36.071 --> 00:05:38.170
Fucking people in the ass just ain't enough no more.

103
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.350
I just want to go around and have people piss all over them.
Yeah.
Like,

104
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.160
well that shit or,
or compliment me.
Fuck man.
I like my boy.

105
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.360
It's wasn't really the guy that wasn't what the guys' intentions with the guy.

106
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:51.580
Just wanted people to spit on him.
Wow.

107
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.930
I just took it to the next level because I'm crafty like about dudes who like

108
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.190
girls to beat the fuck out.
Yeah.
There's people

109
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.240
<v 0>who are into a lot of them.</v>

110
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.970
A lot of them do to like girls to have beat the shit out of him,

111
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.600
kick them in the balls,
punched them in the faced.
It's fucking,

112
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.480
there's so many videos online dudes love that.

113
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.320
Go for until like the third smack they'll have lose my mind.

114
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.810
Fucking punch you right in the throat.
What are you fucking kidding me?

115
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.040
That's a weird instinct.

116
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.720
Fight with checks and smack them around or for them to smack the fuck out of
you.

117
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.500
Yeah,
but what are you gonna do with people that are animals on a low fee?

118
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:27.110
You know,
there's people that only fight with their spouses.

119
00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:31.070
They don't fight with other people.
They just fight with their spouses,
you know,

120
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:34.100
with everybody else.
They like resolve arguments with their spouses.

121
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.870
They beat the fuck out of each other.

122
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.360
<v 3>Yeah.
Sorry,
I was doing some business.
What were you doing?
Oh God.</v>

123
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.170
Plug this list on the laptop or coming out of the left speaker.

124
00:06:44.171 --> 00:06:46.930
So now it's coming out there.
Right?
But only for extreme.
Oh,
sorry.

125
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.670
Fucking tech tar used to use trim.

126

You'd been having a successful podcast lately.

Um,

it's called beauty.

132
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.480
The Bob Cousy of the,
of the thing.

133
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.360
She controls the fucking thing because she's nice and white.

134
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.550
You know the Celtics are one in the 50s.

135
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.300
They had four fucking black guys jumping up and down.
But the guy who was there,

136
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:23.050
hang wrangler was a whatever the guy just said,

137
00:07:23.051 --> 00:07:27.200
the little Bob Cousy was the white point guard.
He was five foot five.

138
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.720
You wouldn't listen to him,
but he fucking control.
You know,

139
00:07:29.721 --> 00:07:31.940
he pulled the reigns in.
You know what I'm saying?

140
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:34.940
So she's like the brain puller and I go fucking nuts.

141
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.140
I know so little about sports.
No,
no,
we don't talk about sports.
I'm not,
I mean,

142
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.830
no.
Say it's just the,
it's just that,
you know,
I just used it now.

143
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:46.850
Should know.
No,
you don't have to.
No,
you wouldn't even fucking boring.

144
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.670
I just used the wild analogy about it.
You know what I'm saying?

145
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:52.270
What's up red bed?
You're all fucking sponsor of.

146
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.360
There's a fucking big group of people that don't get into any sports at all.

147
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.350
No sports,
no nothing.
And when you talk to them about,
they're just like,
oh no,

148
00:08:00.351 --> 00:08:01.010
I'm not really

149
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.510
<v 3>separate the UFC,
I'm that person.
You know</v>

150
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.390
<v 0>more than surprised at how many people are just like that.</v>

151
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.830
How many people don't like going to sports,
but this,

152
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.480
there's people that you would never expect that were like big UFC fans like
that.

153
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.380
I would think it would be like,
like above this,
right?
Like Mike Judge,

154
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.040
the guy who created Beavis and butthead and you know the,
the,
the Fox show,

155
00:08:21.041 --> 00:08:24.560
what does that Fox animated show,
King of the hill and you know,

156
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:29.280
and so many fucking movies.
He's a huge fan.
I hung out with him in Austin when,

157
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.280
yeah,
well I met him before too.
Yeah.
Met him a long time ago.

158
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:34.560
News radio.

159
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.710
He was hanging out with Paul Simms and they were playing instruments together.

160
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.030
And this is when I was in full Mike,
Judge Man Lust,

161
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.220
because this is when he had,
uh,
done Beavis and butthead.
Right.

162
00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.660
So I was a full on fan boy,
you know,
I was like,
Oh man,

163
00:08:49.661 --> 00:08:52.000
it's fucking Mike Judd cause Beavis and butthead.

164
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.930
To me it was the funniest cartoon of all time.

165
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.190
Totally the funniest handmade show corn.
Julio Dude,
I remember crying,
laughing,

166
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.740
laughing so hard.
I couldn't breathe,
watch my show.

167
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.230
And I didn't even smoke pot back then.
Wow.
I didn't eve.

168
00:09:05.231 --> 00:09:08.800
That was both part about beavers and Bob get really stoned and watching Beavis

169
00:09:08.801 --> 00:09:13.410
and butthead.
Dude,
I got a,
I did something for whoever did Beavis and butthead,

170
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:14.430
something for MTV.

171
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.690
And they hooked me up with every episode ever on VHS.

172
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.560
They gave me boxes of them and me and this chick that I was dating,

173
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.920
this is when I first moved here and me and this chick droves dating,

174
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:30.600
just sat in front of the TV all day.
We ordered pizza.
I didn't even know a couch.

175
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.800
And we watch these episodes every episode of Beavis and butthead crying,

176
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:38.670
laughing.
Wow.
So hanging out with him.
I was like,
this guy likes the UFC.

177
00:09:38.671 --> 00:09:41.250
Like I would thought,
I would have thought you had been above that,
sir.

178
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.670
I can't believe you haven't seen mediocracy yet.
Have you?
Idiocracy no,
no.

179
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.283
You got,

180
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.630
if you're a fan of him and your theories and how you think the rural it is and

181
00:09:51.631 --> 00:09:55.630
stuff,
it combined those two.
It's that movie.
Yeah.
Everybody told me.
Well I,

182
00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:00.210
a lot of people actually accused me of stealing my bit about a dumb people

183
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:01.410
appearing smart people.

184
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:05.520
But luckily I had it on DVD before that movie came out and then one could say

185
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.420
idiocracy come on about four years ago,
but I think like three years ago,

186
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.700
it's the,
it caters pick world.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it came,
it went right to video.

187
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:18.170
I believe.
I read for that look,
it's a,
the,
the,
you know,

188
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:21.450
the theory that people are dumb.
People were out breeding smart people.

189
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:22.910
It's not just mine,
but wasn't it just,

190
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.220
was that that move where they want it mixed races?
No,
no,
no,
no.

191
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:27.840
It's a movie we're dumb.
People take over.

192
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.910
It's eventually there's no smart people left,

193
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.760
which is basically just like my bit,
but then you know,

194
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.650
everybody sees that everybody's,
you know,

195
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.360
that's the number one concern that an intelligent person has is that public.

196
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:39.750
How many dumb people are having kids?

197
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:42.360
Look how many dumb people are in your school system,

198
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:47.361
clogging up the system with their fucking kids that are already predestined for

199
00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:50.610
retardation.
Just by the way you've raised them,
you've just fucked her.
Head's up.

200
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.680
What they're exposed to.
Also,

201
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.890
because lately I've been watching a little bit more television just so I could

202
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:58.260
be in the fucking loop instead of criticizing.

203
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:02.370
I've been watching more television.
It's fucking scary,
guys.
I'll be TV.

204
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.030
I've been watching the Kardashians like for the first time.

205
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:09.330
I didn't know who these people were and I wanted to see what this is about.

206
00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:13.530
That is the goofiest fucking show ever.
Yeah,
it's ridiculous.

207
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:14.490
There was some shows out there,

208
00:11:14.491 --> 00:11:16.410
but I'll tell you what shows kicking that hoarders.

209
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:19.200
How can you let yourself go there?
I know.
It's sad.

210
00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.780
It makes me sad about the Kardashians show is Bruce Jenner.

211
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:26.790
Bruce Jenner was a mother fucker,
Bro.
The fuck is motherfucker.
He was a fucking,

212
00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:31.560
one of the greatest Olympians ever do decathlon.

213
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.870
Is that what he did with the fuck did he do,
he can speak.

214
00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.700
He shaking the fucking super.
Absolutely.

215
00:11:38.701 --> 00:11:43.140
Super athletes through super athlete.
Bad mother.
He just got caught up.

216
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:46.350
He got the plastic surgery.
I mean I don't,
that's just,

217
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.080
how can one deteriorate to that point?
We body nobility.

218
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.100
He's a young kid shooting us fucking

219
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:58.060
<v 3>botox shit where we're talking about there.
Could that girl Heidi,</v>

220
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.260
Heidi Montauk.
Yeah.
That's what we do.
We talk about her Warren.

221
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.540
I know we're talking about it cause she apparently is friends with Brian's

222
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:07.750
friend Esther [inaudible] podcast together.

223
00:12:07.751 --> 00:12:10.360
Her sisters UFC Ringo for awhile.
Uh,

224
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:15.550
for no Heidi Hollywood.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
That's good.
The other one hills.

225
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:19.840
Yeah.
You're talking about the one that's in playboy.
Yeah.

226
00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:23.200
I don't know these people.
I tried the one that was on that show.

227
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.830
The girls next door I went to,
I went to a party the other day.
I don't think.

228
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:27.920
We didn't talk about this.
How,

229
00:12:27.921 --> 00:12:32.260
how crazy have you ever been to a crazy Hollywood party?
Like you know,
just,

230
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.470
you know,
thousands of thousands of dollars were spent on a party.

231
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.760
I was at a party the other day that there was baby tigers.
That's how crazy.

232
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:39.941
It was.

233
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:44.800
Like burlesque dancers or the biggest Sushi bar you'll ever see and baby tigers

234
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:47.860
walking around and I was like,
that's ridiculous.

235
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.440
And then you walk out and it's like,
oh,
there's Nikki Hilton.

236
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.810
I guess if you're going to have a party and Nicky Hilton's come coming to a

237
00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:57.370
party,
you have to get baby tigers or she will be pissed off or something.

238
00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:57.761
You know,

239
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:01.540
because these girls have this fame now where like the Kardashians and stuff like

240
00:13:01.541 --> 00:13:05.500
that where they go to parties and they expect certain things.
Parties are weird,

241
00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:07.030
man.
Parties are weird.

242
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:10.450
When you're going to basically a club that is someone's house,

243
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.830
I mean that's what parties are.
Yeah,

244
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:15.670
your house bring your friends and it turns to this gigantic conversation pit of

245
00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:19.060
people.
Those are so strange,
man.
When you don't know people,

246
00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:22.030
you don't know who's there and you're,
there's 102 hundred people in your house.

247
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.280
I mean,
how many parties you've been over like that?
That was,

248
00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.510
I've been to like to like,

249
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:29.050
like the South Park guys had a party once where everyone was dressed like Moulin

250
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:32.110
Rouge and they were like,
everyone spent like $400 per costume.

251
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:35.290
At least kind of party.
It was cool.
You walked in and it was like,

252
00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:37.390
it looked like a circus.
That was the first one I went to it.

253
00:13:37.391 --> 00:13:38.320
And the second one was this one.

254
00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.880
The last one I went to was they had staff that was trying to keep people out of

255
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:43.780
the rest of the house.

256
00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:46.420
They would have staff that would like stand there with their hands behind their

257
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:50.250
back.
So you couldn't go upstairs,
you couldn't go rummaging through,
you know,

258
00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.250
the bedrooms and shit.

259
00:13:51.251 --> 00:13:54.400
But they have like a living room area where you're allowed to go to and then

260
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:58.300
some big crazy ass backyard and just some nutty,

261
00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:01.930
rich motherfucker that just wants to have a bunch of people over his house.

262
00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.070
I hate fucking dancers on Poles.
You know that I hate fucked.

263
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.890
They're very strange,
man.
I was a kid.
I'd never really been there.
Very strange.

264
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:11.430
I don't like people in my house either.
For a party.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

265
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.240
Every time the door opens,

266
00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:16.990
everyone's head turned towards the door like who's coming?
Who's it gonna be?

267
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:21.760
Who's it gonna be?
Oh,
it's Ah,
Shit.
I saw her and then magazine.

268
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:25.780
She looks fat in person.
Oh my goodness.
She's had some work done.
Well,

269
00:14:25.781 --> 00:14:29.950
a party here at the party where these people are gonna Watch you guys go to a

270
00:14:29.951 --> 00:14:33.880
part of this normal.
Somebody puked,
somebody catches a beat,
a purse gets robbed.

271
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.230
That's a fucking party.

272
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.710
When you go to these parties here with these worthless motherfuckers and they're

273
00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:42.250
all walking around thinking that,
and it's fucking amazing.

274
00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:46.720
It's amazing that people stand in line for hours to go into a club.

275
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:50.440
These are the things that take me and I get baffled by it.

276
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:52.010
Like I would wait fucking

277
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.790
<v 0>10 minutes to eat dinner.
Never mind.
Stand that again on a fucking club.</v>

278
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.890
By the time I'm standing there.
He asked if kicked in.

279
00:14:57.891 --> 00:15:02.060
I wouldn't waste my time if I'm not walking in.
I don't want to be there,
man.

280
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.320
That's a strange thing.

281
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.360
Yet that shit with big ass lines that VIP tables and and whatever.

282
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:11.470
When I was a kid,
you did coke in the bathroom.
That was the fucking VIP.

283
00:15:11.471 --> 00:15:14.780
All right?
That was VIP.
Now you've got to have a VIP table.

284
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.680
It's 1500 just to sit and you gotta be behind the velvet ropes.

285
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.790
100 for a per bottle.
What if I fucking want water?
Listen man,

286
00:15:22.791 --> 00:15:26.270
if you want to live like you're at an art Kelly video.
Oh fuck rules.

287
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.250
There's no rules.
I was once in one of those

288
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.870
<v 4>lines,
whereas with two girls and we waited in line like an hour and again,</v>

289
00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.580
this club and then they get to,
I get to the front and they go,

290
00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.350
the two girls can come.
You have to wait.

291
00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.780
And I waited for another half hour until I get in.

292
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.710
I get in and then they're like,
the girls are already with gun.
No,
no.

293
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.640
The girls were like,
this place sucks.
Let's go.

294
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.470
<v 0>And I'm like,
Oh,
where was this?
Uh,
I don't remember.</v>

295
00:15:48.471 --> 00:15:52.910
Miscellaneous Hollywood bar.
Wow.
Fucking crazy.
That's brutal.

296
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:55.150
That was brutal.
There's this one

297
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:59.570
<v 4>please.
Uh,
in Hollywood.
That's cool.
It's like a bondage type.</v>

298
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.770
A dance club.

299
00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.700
You walk in there is net above the bar where people,

300
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:06.740
naked girls are just climbing above you,

301
00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.190
so you're drinking and looking up and there's just like Spiderman on top of you.

302
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:11.024
It's crazy.

303
00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:16.190
<v 0>That's crazy.
Yeah.
We're weird fucking parties like that,
man.
There's,</v>

304
00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.600
that's like a big social thing.
Like who could put on the craziest one?

305
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.990
Who could have a,
you know baby tigers,
right?
You know what?

306
00:16:22.991 --> 00:16:27.100
I want to just set poles and ice cube that melts the fuck.

307
00:16:27.101 --> 00:16:30.840
Is that like an ice sculpture?
Like once the ice sculptures done it apart?

308
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.230
What are you fucking in?
The party's over.
What I say it's fine.

309
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.510
Qualities over with fucking popping does his last fucking line.

310
00:16:37.511 --> 00:16:40.690
That's what it's fucking ice sculpture.

311
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.800
Fucking kidding me.
Oh please.

312
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.080
Beautiful Swan ice at angels.

313
00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:52.450
It's amazing what they've done.
Just like life.

314
00:16:52.451 --> 00:16:55.970
It's amazing what they've done to parties and what people think of parties

315
00:16:55.971 --> 00:16:59.080
should be and how they stand on line and you wait an hour.

316
00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:01.300
So you go to a party for four hours.
You may be,

317
00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.300
if you're a regular person and get full fucking drinks at the bar,

318
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.790
by the time the bartender comes to you and you give a,

319
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.240
it's amazing and you're going to go do all this shit tick.

320
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:13.420
I've told the story about the very first big party that I ever went to.

321
00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:16.440
I was in high school.
I think I've told this story before.
I buy,
I don't remember,

322
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.720
it was a big brawl broke out.
I was with my pal Jimmy Wallace,

323
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:24.410
who's solely on the message board and uh,
me and him and this kid John Batter,

324
00:17:24.411 --> 00:17:24.760
Rocco.

325
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.330
We went to this part of this Iranian kid through this Iranian kid had just moved

326
00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:29.770
into town.
His family was very,

327
00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:33.910
very wealthy and he just wanted to make some friends.

328
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:36.850
So he decided he was going to throw a party because his parents weren't home.

329
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.490
Well this kid was like,
you know,
like 1415 years old or something.

330
00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:44.710
So he throws this fucking party and has like five different high schools.

331
00:17:44.711 --> 00:17:48.520
They're like the entire class,
like seniors,
juniors,

332
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:50.430
everyone's under age.
Everyone's

333
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:51.210
<v 5>drinking.</v>

334
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.190
The place is mobbed and people are stealing shit left and right.

335
00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.230
All right,
so this place is flooded with horny drunk teenagers.
That's a mansion.

336
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.290
It's a mansion in like this MP,

337
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:07.800
credible old Boston neighborhood with this giant lawn.
I mean,

338
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:12.060
it is a huge fucking place and right in the middle of this,
this party,

339
00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:16.530
these kids are drunk and one check says something fucked up to some dude and the

340
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:19.920
dude says something fucked up to her.
I don't remember what the words were,

341
00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:22.500
but I remember something she did to him.

342
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:25.350
She either smacked him or she threw a drink in his face.

343
00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.740
I forgotten because the right hand and he hit her with is embedded in my brain.

344
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:33.330
There's no room for anything else.

345
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.660
The student who had a punch and whatever she did to him,
I think she hit him.

346
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:40.770
Maybe she hit him.
He fucking uncorked one on our face.

347
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.380
I've never seen a dude knock a checkout like this before.

348
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.710
He knocked the checkout like she was at [inaudible] boom.

349
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:48.810
Just connected on her face.

350
00:18:48.811 --> 00:18:52.380
We'd like this perfect punch and her arms went out.

351
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.950
Her body drops.
You went totally unconscious.

352
00:18:54.951 --> 00:18:59.040
This dude caught her as she went unconscious and then it was on,
it was just on,

353
00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.970
it was tables were flying,
glass was breaking.

354
00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:08.040
People were dive in onto piles of people and it was like a fucking movie.

355
00:19:08.041 --> 00:19:11.580
I was like covering my use and sneaking my way through the house,
Bro.

356
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:14.210
It was a brawls everywhere you looked,

357
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:18.460
it's like that one punch lit a fire that these kids were just looking for a

358
00:19:18.461 --> 00:19:22.230
reason to fight and people started screaming at people and then piling on top of

359
00:19:22.231 --> 00:19:25.980
people and girls were fucking hitting people with their shoes and people were

360
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:30.140
diving off piles.
Other pilots of fucking party Jack,
Ooh,

361
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.780
I got outside.
My friends were all cut up and shit.
They're like,

362
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.480
let's get the fuck outta here.
They had just gotten through a pile,
you know,

363
00:19:36.481 --> 00:19:39.920
like dudes were just piling onto each other duties,
just fighting.
It became like,

364
00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.240
like they got infected with that rage shit from 28 days later.
Wow.
What's this?

365
00:19:44.241 --> 00:19:45.031
Oh probably like that.

366
00:19:45.031 --> 00:19:49.500
It's tough to stay on the line for a fucking hour to stealing VCRs.

367
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.540
And we saw people walking out with shit.
We saw them walking out with shit.

368
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.990
They just robbed this dude.
Crazy new nobody.
He just moved there.

369
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.740
It was nuts.
Wow.
It was not,
and I'm just,

370
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.880
I've just thankful that nobody fucking jumped on me.
That's all it was.
I mean,

371
00:20:05.881 --> 00:20:08.040
easily,
I could have been at the bottom one of those piles.

372
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:11.460
There was no logic to those piles.
Those piles were just wild.

373
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:13.320
Chimp add alcohol.

374
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.400
Who's this fucking prick is fucking prick from Newton north thinks is going to

375
00:20:17.401 --> 00:20:19.470
come down here.
We won shit here.

376
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.680
You know at the scariest thing about that whole thing is zero cell phones.

377
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.250
So that was like

378
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.820
10 minutes to get your fucking car and nobody took a picture of your license

379
00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:31.960
plate.
Hit somebody with a chair,

380
00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.380
get eight minutes to get the fuck bad time is back down.

381
00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:37.710
When someone stole your car,
they stole your car.
Let's say that Shit's gone,
son.

382
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.230
There's no internet.
You can't put the license plate online.

383
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.200
Mobile need to find my car.
Take Your Shit,
man.

384
00:20:43.201 --> 00:20:48.040
One of the biggest lessons I ever learned,
I never drank again on new years.
Never

385
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.910
<v 2>after I seen that one new years,
I went to a party like that.
It was very chill.</v>

386
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.180
Everybody was having a good time and also on one of my buddies couldn't drink.

387
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:59.050
He started drinking and he started spitting on the floor.
Oh No.
The people,

388
00:20:59.051 --> 00:21:02.890
that person said something to him and he,
he put like 200 hours in.

389
00:21:02.891 --> 00:21:05.290
The person said sometimes.
It was like,
really?
He goes,
he'll,

390
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.480
I'd take my money and leave or I'll fucking,

391
00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.210
cause we started some shit and next thing you know,
I'll fight broke out.

392
00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:14.050
That's the first time.
Fuck Mike Tyson,
the Neb on cooler a bit.

393
00:21:14.051 --> 00:21:16.990
My friend's ear off that night,
we had a drive to the hospital.

394
00:21:16.991 --> 00:21:21.010
It was a Baggie with icing and the bottom of his liberal ear lobe was in the

395
00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:24.370
thing and he kept holding on to the car saying as soon as I get stitched up,

396
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.770
I'm going to go back there and fuck him up.

397
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.280
And was one of those times the kid been a movie,
it was hanging.

398
00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:33.400
He's got his ear and a baggy with ice and he's like,

399
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:36.670
I hope this fucking doctor hurries up cause I'm going to go back to his house

400
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:41.410
and knocked the fuck out of him.
He's just beats you up 10 times to stop you.

401
00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:44.530
The tech time,
he bit your fucking ear cause you couldn't take it no more.

402
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.780
He didn't know what else to tell the fucking kid.

403
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.110
But I remember that I never drank.
I do years again.
I was like,

404
00:21:50.111 --> 00:21:53.560
I never want to be in that position.
There's some dudes that just don't give up.

405
00:21:53.561 --> 00:21:55.930
No,
he this motherfucker til this day won't give up.

406
00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:01.300
You have to kill him with a stick.
But he was,
he was covered in blood.

407
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.300
They broke them up and he would say,
okay,
I'm already wipe his lip.

408
00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:07.210
He'd wipe his face.
They say go over and shake daddy's hand.

409
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.130
He'd go to the dentist,
said,
Danny,
I'm sorry but your mother's still occur.

410
00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.330
Let's go one more fucking time.

411
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:19.300
And then they do it again for 20 minutes.
The fuck I don't remember again.

412
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.900
All right,
get me low rate and I'll stop.
Danny would go,

413
00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:26.290
you going to stop this time here,
break it up.
Towels,
ice massages.

414
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.160
You know a stitch with Devita and while stitches showing them up here,

415
00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:32.920
let me go shake his hand bro.
Yeah,
it's over.
You know what?

416
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.180
Your mother's still has vd and ass off Jesus fucking Christ.

417
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:41.530
He just beat you up 10 fucking times and that's how bad it was.
And I never ever,

418
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:46.120
ever drag again on new years dog.
That's an east coast thing.
Yeah,

419
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.030
that's what some east coast I've ever taken.
Marsha,

420
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:53.640
no jeans and his parents were like,
where were his friends?
And we're like,
AH,

421
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.460
look at our shirt to cover with fucking blood.
You know what I'm saying?

422
00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:01.600
Like we were holding onto him for dear life and you got people with their kids

423
00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:04.840
is just like having a pit bull that gets to leave the house and go wherever the

424
00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:07.720
fuck it wants.
Right.
You know,
and some people,

425
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.980
you know there's some people that have some crazy fucking kids.

426
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.790
Could you imagine if you had a crazy kid where every time we used to live

427
00:23:14.791 --> 00:23:17.110
leaving the house,
you knew he was gonna come home covered in blood.

428
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.320
His knuckles all fucked up screaming and yelling at three o'clock in the
morning.

429
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.260
<v 4>I just have a feeling that if that was the happened to me,</v>

430
00:23:23.261 --> 00:23:25.740
like if it got really bad that I would be like,
all right,

431
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.940
I'm taking you to the orphanage or whatever.

432
00:23:27.941 --> 00:23:30.820
Like I feel like I would give up if the kid was like this little redhead kid

433
00:23:30.821 --> 00:23:35.220
getting in fights every day and you say that man,
Shit,

434
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.250
I want to sit anymore.
I'm going to Canada and doing crack.

435
00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.590
You have to be a real piece of shit.
I give you a kid up.

436
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.610
People love their kids up.
They keep trying,
but that's what I'm scared of us.

437
00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.010
I feel

438
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.280
<v 2>like I would do that and that's excitement.
Your kid fucking getting in trouble.</v>

439
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.810
Why that's exciting.
Your kid having some fucking drama.

440
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.190
Kind of let me ask you something.

441
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.650
You want to have a fag fucking kid that what you want.

442
00:23:57.651 --> 00:23:58.610
You want your kid to really,

443
00:23:58.611 --> 00:24:02.660
you want your kid to have some fucking opinion even though an early age and to

444
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:04.430
his,
for him to have some,
some opinion,

445
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:08.180
there's gotta be some problems somewhere along the line guy.
Yeah,
that's true.

446
00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:10.040
You had your own fucking opinions at eight and nine.

447
00:24:10.041 --> 00:24:13.310
I know you and so I don't know about fucking you,
but I know I did.

448
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.700
I told people what the fuck was on my mind.
I know you did.

449
00:24:15.701 --> 00:24:19.160
You grew up by yourself.
You want your kids that I'd see these kids listen.

450
00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.900
Before I was driving,
I seen this kid,

451
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.310
Jewish kid with a Yamaka on walking around like a fucking Momo with sandals on.

452
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:27.470
I almost pulled over and grabbing him by the shirt and said,

453
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.960
you're a fucking Jew.
Act like it.
You're dumb.

454
00:24:29.961 --> 00:24:33.200
Fuck walking around like some fucking dumpy won't be dude.

455
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.630
I seen [inaudible] fucking kids to the roads.
You Act like you're,

456
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.160
it's like a fucking jubilot mud.

457
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:43.280
Somebody wants so shoes or something around like a fucking monkey.

458
00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:47.540
Dumpy and not that's a monkey.
But I'll stop fucking book with little sandals on.

459
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.590
Look at these fucking kids.
You want half of these kids to be your fucking kids?

460
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.170
What are you about this fucking shit.

461
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.360
I'm just saying it's not what they dress like,

462
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:59.780
but you know this kid's a fucking loop walking around and I'm looking to tell by

463
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.110
bodies have racist milk.
No,
I think to milk like he's a fucking moron.

464
00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:09.650
What the fuck?
Fuck Jesus fucking Christ.

465
00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:11.383
Why would I know

466
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.150
these fucking kids around your texting all fucking day and drinking energy

467
00:25:17.151 --> 00:25:19.970
drinks.
You need these fucking kids.
These kids can't even work.

468
00:25:19.971 --> 00:25:22.820
They're so fucking worthless.
You want this shit in your life.

469
00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:25.600
You want your kid to have a little opinion and to stick up from,

470
00:25:25.601 --> 00:25:29.720
so you want your fucking principal to call home and say,
hey man,
you teach it.

471
00:25:29.721 --> 00:25:30.600
Your kid suspended.

472
00:25:30.601 --> 00:25:33.710
Cause he told the teacher he didn't believe that or he didn't believe what he

473
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:36.590
was saying or something.
And then you talk to them and you level them out,

474
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.620
but you don't want half these fucking kids who the sheet?
The fucking nukes.

475
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.070
I don't want no fucking kid.
That's a half a sheep.
I understand that.

476
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.990
Well what I'm talking about,
it's crazy kids.

477
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:49.160
You know what kind of crazy kid moboto crazy.
I never grew up with a crazy kid.

478
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:52.970
Yam.
A fucking crazy kid.
Look at me.
What are you talking about?

479
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.390
What's a crazy kid?
A kid that's going to cause problems all the time.

480
00:25:56.391 --> 00:25:58.800
It's not gonna cause problems like just a minute stints.

481
00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:03.440
The mits causing problems all the time.
It's scary.
It's like shit out my fires.

482
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:04.700
I didn't do nothing like that.

483
00:26:04.701 --> 00:26:08.630
I didn't mug other kids or or rape little fucking girls.
I was a fucking kid.

484
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.200
I like to have a good time.
Yeah,
me too.
I was an idiot.

485
00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:15.290
I was an idiot when I was a kid.
Why are you an idiot?
Oh,

486
00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:17.420
I used to drive too fast.
I had always had hot rods.

487
00:26:17.421 --> 00:26:21.370
I spun one out in front of the school and smashed it into a tree right in from

488
00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:25.210
the school and broke the car in half.
Life is,

489
00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.740
there's no way a 17 year old,

490
00:26:27.741 --> 00:26:30.380
I think I was maybe 16 shouldn't have been able to have a car like that.

491
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:34.750
What kind of car?
The Jetta?
68 four four two.
Is that a regret of yours?
Uh,

492
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.240
no because everybody lived,
but they didn't have to,
you know that that car?

493
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:44.170
Yeah.
Oh the car could have hit somebody stuck into the,
to

494
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:45.150
<v 5>the car was a piece of shit.</v>

495
00:26:45.151 --> 00:26:47.780
The problem was I didn't know how to drive when it was raining,
when it,

496
00:26:47.781 --> 00:26:52.781
when the car's hydroplane cause it had shitty back tires on it and I hit the gas

497
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:55.640
and the car just lost it.
It just stuck.

498
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.080
It just spun out and there was no way I can control it.

499
00:26:58.081 --> 00:26:59.010
I didn't know when I was doing,

500
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.040
there was no way I should have had that kind of a car.

501
00:27:02.041 --> 00:27:05.650
The kind of powered those cars have old muscle cars like that for you have young

502
00:27:05.651 --> 00:27:09.090
for that call.
What was the,
what was the first car was a muscle car.

503
00:27:09.091 --> 00:27:13.580
I went straight to muscle cars,
man.
My first car was a 73 Chevelle.
I'm an idiot,

504
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.650
dude.
I didn't want something that gives you economy.
I was,

505
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.760
I had no guidance growing up.
I was pure instincts.
My,
my was like,

506
00:27:20.761 --> 00:27:25.650
what puts the crazy shit I could get?
Fuck yeah.

507
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:28.520
I want to be like,
hi,
cubic inches.
You know what does it?

508
00:27:28.521 --> 00:27:33.240
It's a 400 to 400 Holly,
eight 50 double pumper.
Holy Shit.
Let's get that.

509
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.140
I wanted to hit blog.
I just wanted hot rods,
man.

510
00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.500
That's,
to me it was like there was cars that were like,
just do it.

511
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.620
Get your round,
but they wouldn't do anything for you.

512
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.240
And then there was hot rods.
Like,

513
00:27:45.241 --> 00:27:48.150
why would you have a car that wouldn't do anything for you when you could have a

514
00:27:48.151 --> 00:27:51.720
car that every time you look at it,
you go,
Holy Shit.
You know,

515
00:27:51.721 --> 00:27:53.800
but they're just such a nightmare.
You.

516
00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:57.940
She really shouldn't be allowed to drive one if you're 1617 years old,

517
00:27:57.941 --> 00:28:02.941
that's a death trap is crazy engine in this little retard brain of mine and I'm

518
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:07.260
16 and I'm allowed to have this fucking metal,

519
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:10.710
monstrous death machine out there with a bunch of people with their kids out

520
00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:13.020
there walking in the streets and there's no way,

521
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:15.420
there's no way kids should be able to have that kind of power.

522
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:21.310
I had in 19 1981 no alliance and my cousin was just going to like donate it to

523
00:28:22.471 --> 00:28:23.780
charity but she,

524
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:27.600
I bought it off for her for a dollar for I guess for some reason that you can,

525
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.420
you have to have pay something right.
If for some reason,

526
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.570
and it was all beat up and my dad's like this is your first car,

527
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.330
you have to read through this whole entire car to make it look new and stuff

528
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:38.460
like that.
I'll show you how to do it,
but you have to do all the work.

529
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:41.340
So like we took like side panels off and I took it,
that putty,

530
00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:45.250
that molding putty and I had to re sculpt this Renault alliance.

531
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:50.370
You bondo did yeah.
Bonded the whole car.
So we may be like earn it.
Yeah,
yeah,

532
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.830
yeah.
And so I,
but at the end of it,

533
00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.890
it looked like a brand new Renault alliance and it was like,

534
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.110
it was a Renault lines.
I was still funny cause it's like,

535
00:28:59.111 --> 00:29:02.470
and then I went to a station wagon with wood on the sides.
I heard a,

536
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:06.450
I had a bunch of cars that were like big American muscle cars,

537
00:29:06.780 --> 00:29:09.530
a bunch of them in a row.
And then I got,
I always had,

538
00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.640
they were always pieces of shit.
The,
the,

539
00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:14.940
the one that crashed in front of a tree or into the tree rather was the best
one.

540
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.320
That was the nicest one that I had.

541
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:19.680
They're the ones afterwards were just shitbox of muscle because I was broke.

542
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.610
But uh,
I got an Audi Fox.
Do you know what that is?
Yeah.

543
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.910
It's a little tiny four front wheel drive,
car manual.

544
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.680
It was my first manual and it was my first like really well engineered car and

545
00:29:31.681 --> 00:29:34.050
it was the first car that I drove it.
I was like,
what a piece of shit.

546
00:29:34.051 --> 00:29:38.730
These fucking American cars are God like you don't realize like what a hunk of

547
00:29:38.731 --> 00:29:42.580
Shit,
you know it is to drive a 70 barracuda

548
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.780
<v 3>like all stock and everything would stock breaks and stock suspension.</v>

549
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.340
Those things are just barely connected to the road there.

550
00:29:49.341 --> 00:29:50.980
Just throw it all over the fucking place.

551
00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.400
Taking corners where there was a nightmare,
the steering is numb,

552
00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:55.750
you have no idea where it's going.

553
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.830
And he'd take that and then you go to like a little tiny car that's like well

554
00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:03.340
engineered and handles was like,
wow,
this is amazing difference.

555
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:06.040
And that car was a piece of Shit,
you know?
But it was still,

556
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.910
it was so much better in.

557
00:30:07.911 --> 00:30:10.180
And then I started to appreciate cars that weren't powerful.

558
00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.650
I didn't have to be that powerful to me.
I just realized it was clear.

559
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:16.630
The Toyota Super I think was my favorite car growing up.
That was fun.

560
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.600
That was my first expensive car.
That got really,
yeah.
When I got on TV,

561
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:22.120
when I was on news radio,
that was the first expensive car guy.

562
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.700
I got a Toyota supra.
I was like,
Holy Shit,

563
00:30:24.701 --> 00:30:28.660
I have a fucking Toyota supra with the crazy space wing on the back of it.

564
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.230
I heard the bringing it back.
I heard the super coming back.
Really Nice.

565
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.970
I heard that a couple of months ago.
Well,
you know,
they have that Lexus,

566
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.950
if you've never seen it,
that LFA.

567
00:30:35.951 --> 00:30:40.300
They have this new Lexus that's in this incredible piece of engineering.
I mean,

568
00:30:40.301 --> 00:30:45.301
it's like $400,000 and you're not even allowed to buy it apparently.

569
00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.240
Um,

570
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.960
what you have to do is you have to lease it and you have to pay the entire lease

571
00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:50.980
portion up front,

572
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.480
and you get it for two years and it's like $260,000 and you have to pay for it

573
00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:58.450
for like two years.
I might in the moment,
my numbers might be off,
but you,

574
00:30:58.451 --> 00:31:02.020
you lease it for two years and then at the end of two years you get an option to

575
00:31:02.021 --> 00:31:02.854
buy it.

576
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.780
It's this fucking insane new Japanese supercar.

577
00:31:07.781 --> 00:31:10.420
It's like 500 plus horsepower.

578
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.450
It's sounds like it's like a super car.

579
00:31:13.451 --> 00:31:15.610
It's like the next generation of car.

580
00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.140
How long till apple makes the car that I car?
You know that's on the works?

581
00:31:20.141 --> 00:31:23.110
That's a little table somewhere in some German.
Do think so.

582
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.930
I absolutely think so.
Look at the segway.

583
00:31:25.931 --> 00:31:30.190
Met An apple and mixing in with the car electronics and combining with another

584
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:35.250
car company to have like just the ultimate car are think they should stick with

585
00:31:35.261 --> 00:31:37.480
the fucking computer and it'd be the gayest thing ever.
It would be like,

586
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:40.820
what are those things that everyone has now?
I'll hear the hybrids pre areas.

587
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:45.580
It'd be just like that.
Everyone will have on the same fucking car.
Oh my God.

588
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:50.910
My first car was a fucking 73 Monte Carlo black on black leather,

589
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.660
500 down to 800 a month.
I got it from the bank.

590
00:31:56.050 --> 00:31:57.910
I drove the cough for two months like a pimp.

591
00:31:57.911 --> 00:32:00.370
I had the electric package with the windows.

592
00:32:00.371 --> 00:32:02.950
I had the roof and one day in the middle of winter,

593
00:32:02.951 --> 00:32:06.700
I went over to the city to get some weed and I went and I was smoking,

594
00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:09.580
so I put the sun roof up.
I lost on the sun,
roof,

595
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:13.870
went back and the window started going up and down like the electrical system

596
00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.790
was sizzle.
I told my buddy,

597
00:32:18.791 --> 00:32:22.210
fuck it,
put your thing.
We're out of here.
I swear to God it was in a blizzard.

598
00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:23.800
I went back there three days later,

599
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:28.120
the call has a foot of snow on it and all the windows one window was shut.

600
00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.060
The rest of the window come in like a day later the sun came up.

601
00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:36.160
I went back two days later with a tow truck.
There was nothing,
nothing.

602
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:40.520
It was the back.
It looked like a fucking chicken.
The day after thanksgiving,

603
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.810
<v 2>it was just bone.
They took everything.
Joe,
the seats,</v>

604
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.110
the upholstery,
the fucking black around it.

605
00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.670
It was just the tires though,
whatever that the axles,
they took everything.

606
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.170
They left the body on bricks.
That was it.
I never heard from the bank.

607
00:32:57.171 --> 00:33:01.610
I never paid it off and never came back and never came back on my credit thing.

608
00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.980
It was vanishes.
Poof,
poof.
I've got to pay for that.

609
00:33:05.981 --> 00:33:09.920
I went years later and get credit like is there check bank a fucking America

610
00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:14.050
with nothing,
nothing without puff,
nothing.
How did,
how's that possible?

611
00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:18.800
I fucking asked me.
I left the car there when it was $5 for whatever it is,

612
00:33:18.801 --> 00:33:20.510
$5 in those days,

613
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.570
like all you had to do was go by the George Washington Bridge and under the

614
00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:28.040
bridge you left your caught in with the keys in it would have half a tank of gas

615
00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:31.220
and leave like a nickel bag.
Your car,

616
00:33:31.221 --> 00:33:35.990
you go back there the next day they would be nothing there.
Nothing vanish.

617
00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:40.490
You can get fucking Barney fife on it.
They wouldn't find your car in New York.

618
00:33:40.491 --> 00:33:44.840
They would demolish your car like that.
He did some little shops in New York,

619
00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:49.160
little bodies this and can I say up in Brooklyn,
like rat.
Then you're done.

620
00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.840
You could find like a broken down street,
a broken down car,

621
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:55.310
driving into all these places.

622
00:33:55.311 --> 00:33:59.060
They'll give you a hundred cash and 24 guests and you'll never see that cog and

623
00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:01.790
dog.
Anybody involved in a junkyard in the junkyard.

624
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.670
The guys involved in the junkyard.

625
00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.400
That dude knows how to get rid of looking for too.

626
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:06.850
I just want something antibody.

627
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:11.690
I just watched something on CNBC about how big the air bag business was five

628
00:34:11.691 --> 00:34:15.560
years ago before they put the numbers on it.
You have no idea.

629
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.270
People would just steer.
Oh my God.

630
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:19.910
People stealing their bags like it was going out of style.

631
00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.970
I mean just taking your air bags and they didn't work a lot of money.

632
00:34:22.990 --> 00:34:26.060
You 1500 a pot,
so I give it to you.

633
00:34:26.061 --> 00:34:29.090
You saw 15 1500 you rob them,
you take it to a guy,

634
00:34:29.091 --> 00:34:31.900
he gives you three at least sons,
they're 1500 wow.

635
00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.050
And everybody's in on the scan because nobody wanted to pay 2,500 wow.

636
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.740
So a guy could steal,
want it sound for 15 was stealing 20 a day.

637
00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.360
Oh my 1500 holy shit dude.
CSM,
who's doing that?

638
00:34:44.361 --> 00:34:48.020
Some dude who's making $30,000 that's who's doing all the guy had incredible
guy,

639
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:49.090
had a ring airbag.

640
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:54.120
It got so big that he had to get an office and eventually got pot because it was

641
00:34:54.381 --> 00:34:57.860
so big.
He was sending them out across the country.
He went on lunch,

642
00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:02.800
he went on fucking line ed bags for sale next day,
delivery air.

643
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.410
This guy was through,
so you'd say,
no,
my leave,
whatever car you have,

644
00:35:06.411 --> 00:35:09.320
I want a 2010 had back for call given your order.

645
00:35:09.321 --> 00:35:13.120
By the next day he'd send out a robber to go steal it and send you the airbags

646
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:17.360
overnight.
It was a fucking CSM.
BC.
A one hour special on how bad this,

647
00:35:17.490 --> 00:35:19.970
what's craziness?
Fucking air bags.

648
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.070
How did he think he was not going to get caught if you had a bus?

649
00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:25.190
People working for him.
Yeah,
you'd have to do that Ninja style,

650
00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:26.600
you know would have to only be you.

651
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:28.850
That's a business where you can't have too much growth.

652
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.920
If you want to go run around stealing,

653
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.740
you've gotta be the one who understands where steel when to do it.

654
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:38.070
How the alarm word is dealer.
He had first of course not.

655
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.920
<v 3>Why would it work for him?
Why would they work for you?</v>

656
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:43.500
The other ones are going to get arrested down Bob Day and waited for him to say,

657
00:35:43.501 --> 00:35:45.720
here,
go get a 68 Chevelle here.

658
00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:48.690
Go get a bread Holt here you'll get an 89 Subaru.

659
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.860
And they just drive around until they find it.
There it is.

660
00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.750
They fund now you'll even have to leave like a color.
So do,

661
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:59.100
did they do it at night?
Everything at night?
I don't know.
Fucking say it really,

662
00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.300
but it's just amazing that,
you know,
even if you go over to that,
who are we?

663
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:05.900
You know,
uh,
Iraq and I ran years ago.

664
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.610
They found that when they went over there that all the cars they would drive

665
00:36:08.611 --> 00:36:11.070
with stolen cars and the states.
Wow.

666
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.200
That they would just sending the whole cars over there.

667
00:36:13.201 --> 00:36:16.620
So when cars get robbed here and we're like,
it's in Mexico.
No it's not.

668
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.330
It's a cab and fucking I route that's could I ran and to don and all those

669
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:25.800
control,
that's where the stolen cars from here going to fuck.
Wow.
You know,

670
00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.070
it's amazing.
And everybody's in on it.
And here we're thinking like,

671
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.450
oh my fucking car got robbed.
I left my fucking kids pictures in there,

672
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:35.870
whatever the fuck.
And that's what they do with your shit.
You know,
it's,

673
00:36:35.871 --> 00:36:40.330
it's fucking amazing that uh,
and every,

674
00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.750
they come up with a new fucking scam,
whether it's online,

675
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:46.080
I read something and people doing online,
that's just fucking amazing.

676
00:36:46.081 --> 00:36:49.290
Now the Internet has really destroyed scammers.
Here's a new,

677
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:52.770
a Facebook scam that I just witnessed last night.
Uh,

678
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.220
people who get hacked accounts on Facebook.
They'll be like,

679
00:36:56.221 --> 00:36:58.770
you'll be on Facebook and selling a little chat will pop up and like,
dude,

680
00:36:58.771 --> 00:36:59.890
check this out.
And it,

681
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.570
they put a link and it goes to like the login page of Facebook again.

682
00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:07.020
And so now they're attacking through chats on Facebook.

683
00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.650
Like it looks like they're chatting to you.
So watch out for that one because I,

684
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.160
she,
the person I was with almost dead.
I was like,
no,
wait a second.

685
00:37:14.161 --> 00:37:18.500
Why are you logging back in?
You know?
Whoa.
So watch out for Facebook.

686
00:37:18.501 --> 00:37:21.750
So yeah,
those are tricky man.
What is that a virus?
How do they do that?

687
00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:25.050
Somebody gets hacked and I think it just grows and grows and grows like a virus.

688
00:37:25.051 --> 00:37:28.990
He had like one person got hacked and then those persons friends or websites

689
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.370
like or the websites,
the ones that are trying to set you up like how's it,

690
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:36.000
how are you getting to that?
What's it's doing is,
yeah,
I don't know.

691
00:37:36.001 --> 00:37:38.070
It's like a collecting information.

692
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:41.640
I think about people probably because someone told me that sometimes you'll go

693
00:37:41.641 --> 00:37:45.270
to a legit website in a legit website.
We'll have been hacked with this thing.

694
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:47.880
Right?
I don't know.
I don't think,
I don't think it's sad.

695
00:37:47.881 --> 00:37:51.060
I think it's like almost like a spam bot that somebody puts on Facebook,

696
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.440
like my space used to do.

697
00:37:52.441 --> 00:37:56.010
So they can't do that to your website where you would go to a red band.com and

698
00:37:56.011 --> 00:37:57.600
all of a sudden it would say,
hey,
you know,

699
00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.060
login to Facebook or something like that,

700
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.440
that your server got completely overtaken or there's your website coding got

701
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:08.520
somehow can they,
can't they invent a virus that does that?

702
00:38:08.521 --> 00:38:11.130
Like every time someone wants to click on a link,
it opens up a window.

703
00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:12.840
Ask them to log into something.
Absolutely.

704
00:38:12.841 --> 00:38:16.950
That's where your servers have to have good virus software and detections and

705
00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:21.670
what a tricky world we live in.
I'm petrified of the computer.
Petrified.

706
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:25.420
Just fucking petrify them.
It was like,
I don't put my name on there,

707
00:38:25.421 --> 00:38:28.200
like this things I want to order and shit.
I just got,

708
00:38:28.201 --> 00:38:31.380
I read about all this stuff on that.
I don't know anything about it,

709
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:36.160
so it even scares me more.
That even scares to me.
What do you have of you?

710
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.500
<v 0>What have you have drawings,
writings,
you know,
what do you,</v>

711
00:38:38.501 --> 00:38:40.840
what do you have that's that you would really worried about getting out?

712
00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.530
I don't know what it is it a big deal you people make about,
I don't know.

713
00:38:44.531 --> 00:38:46.510
What the fuck did,
he has a lot of videos,

714
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:50.820
like webcam videos of him just sitting there like recorded dancing.
No,

715
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.233
no.

716
00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:57.760
[inaudible] to you.

717
00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:02.500
What can I get from you?
Nothing.
Writing mostly my writings or you know,

718
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.950
it's just the,
the most uh,
intimate thing on my computer.

719
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.310
I'm going to have to quiet these kids up.
Yes.
Okay.

720
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.530
What are you gonna Strap Jelly.
We'll talk about cats.

721
00:39:11.531 --> 00:39:13.480
We hadn't clocked back in house.
You know what I'm saying?
It's deaf.

722
00:39:13.481 --> 00:39:15.880
Fucking house.
I noticed her house.
What do you want from me?

723
00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:21.640
The misses should have tell the children aren't there.
You know what I'm saying?

724
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:26.010
We should shut up in here.
People know nothing about kids right away.

725
00:39:26.011 --> 00:39:29.980
He's dropping knowledge.
My fucking kids that said fucking hell.
So old school.

726
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.940
This is that.
We're,
we're over here like bothering them.
This is four o'clock.

727
00:39:33.941 --> 00:39:34.571
I don't know if you look,

728
00:39:34.571 --> 00:39:37.360
this is their fucking time when we were kids at four o'clock.

729
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:39.310
You come into my house,
I'm going to shut up,
bitch.

730
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:44.380
<v 2>I got,
I got pipeline,
I'll stab you.
You know what I'm saying?
They don't.</v>

731
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:48.020
<v 0>All I'm saying is don't play in front of my door.
Oh,
they're cute kids.</v>

732
00:39:48.021 --> 00:39:51.470
Let them do what they do.
This they house.
What are you gonna do?
Right.

733
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:57.110
Brain brains.
So old school or excuse me,
Joey is so old school,
right?

734
00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:03.390
You're so old school like it's like almost like,
like you're,
you,

735
00:40:03.391 --> 00:40:07.750
you have your own defined set of rules and he's still use my space.
Yeah.

736
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.690
Do you still use my space and he pimps my space on Twitter,
Bro.

737
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.940
You got to bring them motherfuckers to you.

738
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.420
<v 2>You don't say enough is enough.</v>

739
00:40:16.421 --> 00:40:18.070
If you put it up and you've got to have something.

740
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:22.090
There's nothing wrong with my space and I'm gonna tell you why because in a year

741
00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:24.370
we'll be back.
Yeah.
But you know,
it'll be back.

742
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.010
And then all you momos that got rid of your page and slept all your books.

743
00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:31.960
All you fucking moocs.
Me Tappc I have my friends and that zone.

744
00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:35.240
I've been paying attention all this time.
Why are people getting off his face?

745
00:40:35.241 --> 00:40:38.490
Because he hit Joey.
Here's a perfect example of to get off when you,

746
00:40:38.570 --> 00:40:41.830
you're carrying hardy lost two in a row.
You hang out with him.

747
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.690
You know what I'm saying?
You gotta hang on my school.
Your friends aren't real.

748
00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.880
All your friends aren't real.
Those are robots.

749
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:51.640
What do you think those fucking momos on Facebook are going to hang out with you

750
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.720
and bail you out when you hit somebody with a stick?

751
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.650
I don't think some of your fuck go fuck yourself with your friends.

752
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:59.830
You just want to get up there and tell people what's happening at Facebook.

753
00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:02.500
There's still people alive and kicking that around.
School pitch.

754
00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:06.070
I still got eight track tape.
They track.

755
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:08.380
I'll send you a podcast on an eight track and shit.

756
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:12.190
That's the problem with you fucking kids.
Everything has to be fashionable.

757
00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:15.310
Stop fashionable.
They got to come to your fucking world.

758
00:41:15.311 --> 00:41:18.610
That's what we're serving here.
Sorry about the phone.
That ain't me this time,

759
00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.600
this time.
So what I'm saying,
that's what's fashionable anymore.

760
00:41:22.601 --> 00:41:26.110
I've got to have a fucking goatee and shaved my head and have an for form suck

761
00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:27.280
for him to what we do.

762
00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:30.550
That's why we do form spring and that's why people are special.

763
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:34.010
That's why we're special,
because we're fucking three man.
We've got to

764
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:36.560
<v 0>have a voice.
Joey,
you registered to vote in California.</v>

765
00:41:36.561 --> 00:41:37.700
That was fucking hysterical.

766
00:41:37.701 --> 00:41:42.020
You said that somebody called me yesterday from Sacramento here.
People listen,

767
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:46.460
I've got will total all together bus five felonies.
You know what I'm saying?

768
00:41:46.461 --> 00:41:50.870
Total like altogether and out of 52 states,
I ain't fucking bed these days.

769
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.810
So even if I have one east,
there's 50 that's less than 10% I really moved into,

770
00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:00.280
two of them are questionable.
Right?
So there's 52 54 will that Alaska and Hawaii.

771
00:42:00.281 --> 00:42:00.620
I'm fight.

772
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:05.620
Yesterday I got a calls are stolen from Sacramento yesterday asking me if I was

773
00:42:07.551 --> 00:42:10.300
interested in working the election for one of those cocktails.

774
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.410
Meg Whitman and went,
oh,
that's hilarious.
Hey,
I don't even know what she is like,

775
00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:16.340
God,
you should say yes,
they're going to buy it.
But they threw me off.

776
00:42:16.341 --> 00:42:19.190
I was stoned and they were asking me a bunch of personal questions.
Like,

777
00:42:19.191 --> 00:42:22.090
what if I'm a Republican?
You know,
I don't even know a fucking,

778
00:42:22.091 --> 00:42:25.590
you say you're Cuban.
I'm Cuban from Miami.
Of course,
some are upon me.

779
00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:27.850
I never went through Miami.
I went around that motherfucker.

780
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:34.240
Where did you land?
New York City with fucking Jz and the chicken.

781
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:37.900
It's so close to Miami.
You can claim my God,
I don't want,
it's like if you live,

782
00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:40.490
if you live in San Bernardino,
that shit.

783
00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:44.980
If you lived in San Bernardino and [inaudible] North Carolina and some chick,

784
00:42:44.981 --> 00:42:46.610
those where you're from,
you go la.

785
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.960
Did you ever play stickball?
When you're living in New York,

786
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:55.540
you take boss and I took everybody.
Did you take the fucking thing off the chair?

787
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:59.670
You see acting.
Joe's got his chairs that it's on the bottom of your chest.

788
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:00.981
You take that out,

789
00:43:00.981 --> 00:43:04.700
you unscrew from Your Dad's work bench and you take it to the hardware store for

790
00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:05.330
a quarter.

791
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:08.330
They take the screw out of it and you take that metal thing and you take a

792
00:43:08.331 --> 00:43:09.980
Crayon,
whatever your color is.

793
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:13.850
Mine was burgundy red in those days when you melt the Crayon into the middle and

794
00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:16.460
then you go out and play those fucking things on the street in New York where

795
00:43:16.461 --> 00:43:20.180
they have one too.
It's like nine ball.
My ball went up the fucking stick.

796
00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.800
So you play that for money.

797
00:43:21.801 --> 00:43:23.750
That's how I made money in the first and second grade.

798
00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.310
Why would I be doing with your finger?

799
00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.010
I always thought stickball was like baseball,

800
00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:30.870
but you have to have stickball which is automatics.
It's,
you know,

801
00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:35.420
that's a far single.
If I hit your mother's fucking pot roast,
it's a double.

802
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:36.433
I was,

803
00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:41.210
I was very lucky that there was not a pool hall anywhere near my house when I

804
00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:42.044
was growing up.

805
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.920
Very lucky cause I didn't get into pool till I was 21 years old after I had hurt

806
00:43:45.921 --> 00:43:49.280
my knee.
I tore my ACL and I couldn't do taekwondo for awhile.

807
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.090
I couldn't kick box.
So I needed something to do with my time,
you know,

808
00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:56.580
just something to just for my own,
all I was doing was doing stand up.

809
00:43:56.930 --> 00:44:01.220
So I started doing this.
I started,
I started playing pool.
If I was like seven,

810
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.530
eight years old and I started playing pool,
I would've been fucked.

811
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.240
I have never paid attention in school.

812
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.970
I would've just been obsessed with playing that fucking game out.

813
00:44:07.971 --> 00:44:10.580
I've been like one of those dudes,
like every pool hall you go to,

814
00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:14.120
there's some kid who's just cotton school and he's just sitting around waiting

815
00:44:14.121 --> 00:44:17.480
for somebody to gamble all over the country.
They're just sitting around for it.

816
00:44:17.481 --> 00:44:20.540
You want to play a game?
I wanna play a game.
And it's all just about that,
that,

817
00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:23.990
that's just like how they fulfilled their competitive instincts and desires.

818
00:44:23.991 --> 00:44:26.480
It just get caught up in games and gambling for pool.

819
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.060
And then you ever watched that episode of the twilight zone?

820
00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:34.310
There is a twilight zone where a pool hustler.
Yes.
Played for his soul.
Yeah.

821
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.130
And you know,
and it turned out that,
what was the last episode?
Who was in it?

822
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.250
We talked about this already.
You and I just got Jonathan Winters.

823
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.610
Shot them with this was the devil.
Yeah.
And Jack Klugman was the,

824
00:44:44.611 --> 00:44:45.390
what's the fucking point?

825
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:49.740
He wanted to be the best and I slow one and this guy was like a dead guy and he

826
00:44:49.741 --> 00:44:53.380
came back to play him right.
And the,
the,
uh,
the,

827
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:56.760
the thing was he had already lost cause he had,

828
00:44:56.761 --> 00:45:01.230
he had devoted his entire life to just playing pool.
He had wasted his life.

829
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:05.910
He'd wasted his life playing this game.
So He'd lost anyway.
And it was like,
wow.

830
00:45:05.911 --> 00:45:09.840
It's like you don't realize like [inaudible] there's certain things that you can

831
00:45:09.841 --> 00:45:13.620
get obsessed with and you know,
and it's fun and you enjoy it and you can,

832
00:45:13.621 --> 00:45:14.460
you can have a good time.

833
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:18.330
You could play golf on the weekends and it can add flavor to your life or you

834
00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:22.320
could just get caught up in it.
And that becomes everything you know,

835
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:25.410
and gambling when you're a kid,
when you're a young kid,
how many guys,

836
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:26.121
you know that what you are,

837
00:45:26.121 --> 00:45:28.110
you are kids that all they wanted to do was play cards.

838
00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:30.960
The only wanted to do was find games.
All they wanted to do is gamble.

839
00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:35.730
Go to the track race,
track,
horse track.
Everybody was camp when you're a kid,

840
00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:40.500
fuck yeah.
I didn't live with us.
I really,
one thing I really,

841
00:45:40.501 --> 00:45:41.580
I never told you about that.

842
00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:46.740
My mom had the bar and from the ages of like seven to 10 I was really,

843
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:49.400
I got hooked on pool,
but it was I,

844
00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:52.590
the reason why I stopped playing full pool was cause I got really creepy.

845
00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:54.810
It overtook me.
Oh yeah.

846
00:45:54.811 --> 00:45:57.390
I asked to get into the pool and I would say things to people about them.

847
00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:58.381
That was creepy.

848
00:45:58.381 --> 00:46:01.680
Like I was always playing and one day I went home and I checked myself.

849
00:46:01.681 --> 00:46:03.570
My mother asked me,
she goes,
what the fuck is that?

850
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:07.230
Why you just your competitive drive?
It really taught me,

851
00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:08.940
I've ever wanted that feeling ever again.

852
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:11.730
Like it stopped me from being that competitive.

853
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.210
It's not just balls going into a hole.
There's something about pool.

854
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:18.420
There's a reason why everybody has this thing about Paul being a manly game.

855
00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.300
You know what I'm saying?
Like there's certain games like not who gives a fuck.

856
00:46:21.301 --> 00:46:24.090
If you're good at donkey Kong,
no one's going to be impressed.
But like,

857
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:26.760
you know what I'm saying?
If a girl beats donkey Kong and what the fuck?

858
00:46:26.761 --> 00:46:30.990
Who Cares?
A girl beat you at pool though.
That's a totally different world.

859
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:34.800
There's something very manly about being able to control that ball.

860
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.310
Being able to keep your composure,
being able to pocket those difficult shots,

861
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.830
being able to run out.
That's a manly thing.
That's uh,

862
00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:44.040
being able to keep your shit together,
keep everything tightly tuned.

863
00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.950
It's almost like are like I'm moving yoga sort of a thing.

864
00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:50.400
I'd be so much more specific.
Girl beat me at donkey Kong.
Really.

865
00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:55.140
This is horrible.
What is happening to me that's just cause you're a super nerd.

866
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.740
Like if a girl beat me a quick,

867
00:46:58.741 --> 00:47:01.220
that would be way worse than this quake,

868
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.990
which would be way worse than pulled from me.
But that quake was,

869
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:07.680
quake was a bigger obsession.
That pool was because I didn't always have to,

870
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:10.320
you know,
I couldn't always get people to play me in pool.
Like,

871
00:47:10.321 --> 00:47:13.440
sometimes I'd go to the pool hall and there'd be no one in play.
You know,

872
00:47:13.441 --> 00:47:16.010
you'd have to sit around and wait or you have to practice by yourself and you

873
00:47:16.011 --> 00:47:18.090
know,
and maybe someone will come in and you know,

874
00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:21.420
this guy can't play him to good or you don't,
he won't give up a spot.

875
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:26.210
Or I'm looking for a new with playing quake.
He just get online anytime you want,

876
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.300
you just hop online and play.

877
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.010
You didn't need to buy it and you call it a duty next week or

878
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.640
<v 3>whatever.
I'm scared.
I saw this fucking an for the new star wars game,</v>

879
00:47:33.641 --> 00:47:35.950
there was a star wars game and that they showed during the UFC.

880
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:40.420
It looks so dull for suddenlies too.
Oh my God,

881
00:47:40.421 --> 00:47:41.710
the fucking graphics.

882
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:44.950
I don't know if this was in game footage or if it's one of those tricky things

883
00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.680
where they like pretended sim game footage,
but it's not really,

884
00:47:47.681 --> 00:47:50.440
it's just like some animation about the game that they've created.
Right.

885
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:53.920
The last one was pretty good,
but that's not my cup of tea too much.

886
00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:57.730
I like the first person shooters more unless they changed that.
I don't,

887
00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.330
it's not our first person shooter to third person shooter where it's like from

888
00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:04.810
behind the person.
I don't like those.
Yeah.
Those aren't as fun to me.

889
00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:07.630
I want to see everybody else.
I want to see it as if I'm seeing it.

890
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:10.390
I don't need to see my character.
That's stupid.
You know?

891
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:13.090
I might want to see the hand in front of me with the gun.

892
00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:14.440
I kind of liked that look and quake.

893
00:48:14.441 --> 00:48:16.760
Sometimes when you see the hand in front of you with the gun,

894
00:48:16.761 --> 00:48:18.400
I'm like sometimes it's easier to come or something.

895
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:20.110
It's easier to remember what you have to look.

896
00:48:20.111 --> 00:48:22.720
You don't remember if you have a lightning gun or if you have a real gun or

897
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.360
sometimes I would just have it where I'd only see the cross hair,

898
00:48:25.810 --> 00:48:27.760
but that's the muscle most fun game.
The way.

899
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:30.880
That's the most fun way to play it to me because it's the most immersive cause.

900
00:48:30.881 --> 00:48:34.030
That's how we see things.
We don't see our body outside our body running around.

901
00:48:34.031 --> 00:48:35.890
That's ridiculous.
It doesn't even feel like me,

902
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.800
but when I'm playing quake and it's just me,

903
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:42.040
you know there's a cross hair and I'm running down hallways and shit.

904
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:43.960
It's too exciting.
Can't do it.

905
00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:48.520
Scary to you should do it and now do it in three d.
That's the best.

906
00:48:48.521 --> 00:48:52.330
When I'm at peck playing first person shooters in 3-d on on the TV,

907
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:55.630
I'm sure it's about the shirt.
Give you like crazy.

908
00:48:55.631 --> 00:48:58.900
I site it would probably be fuck with your eyeballs.
It's,
it's intense though.

909
00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.930
You feel way more immersed into it.
A lot of guys,
when they're playing quick,

910
00:49:01.931 --> 00:49:03.190
they kill all the graphics.

911
00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.580
They would kill all the graphics and make it look really flat and the,

912
00:49:06.581 --> 00:49:10.450
the idea would be that so that the opponent would show up better and so that

913
00:49:10.451 --> 00:49:14.770
their,
their processor,
their computer,
that looks terrible,
but it's,

914
00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.120
they're more in it for the numbers.

915
00:49:16.121 --> 00:49:18.700
They're half the look like the real gun looks like.

916
00:49:18.701 --> 00:49:21.130
You only see like a straight line to it.
There's like a lot of,

917
00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.640
a lot of the graphics are gone.
She does claim.
Have you ever played a video game,

918
00:49:24.641 --> 00:49:27.940
Joey?
No,
not even PAC man pac man.
Yes we uh,

919
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:31.030
pacman frenzy back in the day you were by them.
The other one,

920
00:49:31.031 --> 00:49:36.031
Mrs Pack Miss Bag on anybody who got good at that quake game and started playing

921
00:49:36.081 --> 00:49:37.390
it,
anybody would get hooked.

922
00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:42.370
It is so exciting because it's so three d you know the thing about first person

923
00:49:42.371 --> 00:49:46.090
shooters,
especially ones like quake,
it's like you can do things like you can,

924
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:49.620
you could run around,
you can jump,
you can,
you can rocket jump,

925
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:52.570
shoot down at the ground and go flying through the air and land on things.

926
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.410
I mean this is a completely three dimensional world and most of these maps that

927
00:49:56.411 --> 00:49:58.870
you're fighting on,
they have all these levels to them,

928
00:49:58.871 --> 00:50:02.200
layers and levels and you travel back and forth and up and down and you're

929
00:50:02.201 --> 00:50:05.740
running down these corridors.
It's all in real time fighting other people.

930
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.010
So you really need to place a new video cam chat.
I can't get,

931
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:14.830
cause if you really think that highly of quakes graphics in rural,

932
00:50:14.831 --> 00:50:17.380
it's like four is pretty dope.
Even quick for it.

933
00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:19.360
You take quick for the best machine you can possibly buy.

934
00:50:19.361 --> 00:50:23.560
You take that times that probably by 2 million and then that's where that video

935
00:50:23.561 --> 00:50:26.410
games are nowadays,
which,
which games are really like,

936
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:31.190
there's just so many like call of duty is one that I personally love that it's

937
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.860
amazing.
I mean it's,
yeah,
it's so realistic.

938
00:50:33.861 --> 00:50:37.760
It's just so immersive at Uw Madison we sorta lands and another one that you

939
00:50:37.761 --> 00:50:38.960
would totally fucking love.

940
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:41.940
Do you remember when we saw gears of war before it even came out?
Yeah.

941
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:45.650
Gears of war buddy cliffy be,
uh,
from epic games.

942
00:50:45.651 --> 00:50:48.080
Who's a cool motherfucker.
I get him on.
Yeah.

943
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:51.800
I would love to have him on the podcast.
He's just one of the nicest guys ever.

944
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:56.160
And just super cool,
friendly dude.
And we met him,
uh,

945
00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:57.860
and he showed us a bunch of shit.

946
00:50:57.861 --> 00:51:01.920
It was before gears of war ever came out and he was like,
you know,
what did he,

947
00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:05.830
what we're going to,
we're about to fuck doom in the ass,
right?
Cause Yeah.

948
00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:09.710
Cause do three d it just came out and yeah,
I forgot all about that.
Yeah,

949
00:51:09.711 --> 00:51:12.350
I remember that.
And he was showing us the gears of war stuff and we were like,

950
00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.460
oh my God.
Yeah.

951
00:51:13.461 --> 00:51:16.430
That was like eight months before that game was even like released or something

952
00:51:16.431 --> 00:51:20.900
like are announced and you don't realize what hard work is until you see game

953
00:51:20.901 --> 00:51:21.734
developers.

954
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:25.940
You see the amount of hours they put in like Tim Willits from ID software and

955
00:51:25.941 --> 00:51:28.580
Todd Hollingshead and all those guys and John Carmack,
you know,

956
00:51:28.581 --> 00:51:32.630
have I get to hang around with them getting to go to like id software and see

957
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:35.360
like where they make the game it wanted to,
first of all,

958
00:51:35.361 --> 00:51:39.500
it's so humbling how fucking Badass these guys are.
Like the,
the designs,

959
00:51:39.501 --> 00:51:42.860
all the crazy graphics and all the things that they're constructing.
You know,

960
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:46.610
I remember we went there to id before doom three came out and they were showing

961
00:51:46.611 --> 00:51:50.990
us like some demo versions of it.
It's just fucking amazing shit.

962
00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:54.000
Just the artwork.
But then you talk to them,
you're like,

963
00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:56.840
like how much time do you guys spend working this?
And they're like,

964
00:51:56.841 --> 00:52:01.520
it's like 16 hour days every day.
You work on Sundays.
They were constantly,

965
00:52:01.521 --> 00:52:05.930
man,
it's in the till to take time off and go on vacation.
It's amazing how much,

966
00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:09.080
like they're kind of like South Park for eight months,
you know?

967
00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:12.350
And then there's like,
even when it comes to everything in Hollywood,

968
00:52:12.351 --> 00:52:15.470
like any kind of CGI or computer graphics,
it seems like they're all like that.

969
00:52:15.471 --> 00:52:19.700
Like I know somebody that's doing Harry Potter Three d right now and it's just

970
00:52:19.701 --> 00:52:24.380
like 19 hour shifts.
Know what's up with that man.
If you had kids and you know,

971
00:52:24.381 --> 00:52:27.980
it's like you motherfuckers need to hire more people.
Like this is ridiculous.

972
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:29.990
Why is this guy going to work 16 hours?

973
00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:33.740
Don't you guys make like $1 billion a year doing this shit?
I mean,
how many,

974
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.890
how many fucking video games that they make?
You know,

975
00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.260
video games make a fuck load of money,
man.

976
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.890
Did you ever play it into plane to new UFC game with you in it?
And I don't know,

977
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.620
fuck around with.
No,
I'm scared.
I told you I'm scared of games man.

978
00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.810
I love it cause I don't want to get fucking hooked.

979
00:52:47.811 --> 00:52:49.090
I don't want to have people over come on,

980
00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:52.870
what was supposed to move to and then also than the sun's up and birds are

981
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.800
chirping and I can't believe I'm still awake.

982
00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:58.550
My eyeballs shot and I sleep til three in the afternoon.
Yeah,
I did that.

983
00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:03.270
I did that for years.
I love it because I do it in target.
They have a UFC,
a,

984
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.570
a demo that's constantly playing.

985
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:08.510
And so I was in target the other day shopping and stunning to hear your voice

986
00:53:08.511 --> 00:53:10.940
like behind me going,
oh no.
Or something like that.
I'm like,
fuck,

987
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:17.180
isn't that what you'd probably do?
And what we actually did,
um,
we did two things.

988
00:53:17.181 --> 00:53:21.200
We did it.
So I have to go in,
start working on it again.
I'll really,
yeah,

989
00:53:21.201 --> 00:53:24.770
we're working on a new one soon.
They just,
uh,
I think next month I start.
Wow.

990
00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:29.130
But um,
what we do is we play certain clips of fighters,

991
00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:32.370
like doing stuff and you call the action while it's actually happening.

992
00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:36.600
He'd do that.
And then you also like make imaginary scenarios,

993
00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:37.800
like imaginary scenarios.

994
00:53:37.801 --> 00:53:41.190
Like he'll hook transitions to the arm bar and watch how it transitions to the

995
00:53:41.191 --> 00:53:44.700
back and we'll try and come up with a bunch of different possibilities for that.

996
00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:48.640
And then we have descriptions of this fighter taken on this guy and this fight

997
00:53:48.641 --> 00:53:51.460
or take them.
There's like endless combinations.
So there's,
there's uh,

998
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:55.740
there's so many hours he put into the game.
I mean,
just ridiculous,

999
00:53:55.741 --> 00:53:57.830
stupid hours.
When you guys filmed it,

1000
00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:01.800
was there any Easter eggs that you know of where you had like weird scripts that

1001
00:54:01.801 --> 00:54:05.250
you wrote that was like,
all right,
why am I doing this?
This is weird.
No,

1002
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:06.270
that's a good question though.

1003
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.640
That's a good question because there's a lot of Easter eggs and games,
right?

1004
00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:11.700
And Yeah,
there's actually a bunch of games.
There's a list of like the top 10,

1005
00:54:11.701 --> 00:54:15.460
I think it was on crack.com of the top 10,
like Easter eggs that were,

1006
00:54:15.461 --> 00:54:16.890
it took the longest to find,

1007
00:54:16.891 --> 00:54:20.070
like there was one that it was just found the other day from some nes game,

1008
00:54:20.071 --> 00:54:23.310
you know,
from,
I don't get Easter eggs,
man,
I don't get it.

1009
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:28.020
If you want to put something on like,
and Eddie Bravo on is a twister.

1010
00:54:28.021 --> 00:54:32.940
The DVD to twister.
He had uh,
the Easter egg was Brian Keaulana doing that?
Uh,

1011
00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:34.970
Gay Brazilian Jujitsu instructor.
All right.

1012
00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:38.000
You don't remember that you've seen that video,
right?
Which is hilarious.
Like,

1013
00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:40.290
dude,
why wouldn't you just put that on the day that seems,
yeah.

1014
00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.460
Easter eggs should be just little things maybe,
but that's only the video.

1015
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.860
Why would you hide that somewhere?
Deepen your,
well,
you have to press control,

1016
00:54:46.861 --> 00:54:48.030
alt delete to get to it.

1017
00:54:48.031 --> 00:54:50.310
Or what do you have to press to get to the east direction?

1018
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:53.870
Musically it's just up arrows.
Like you have to hit the air right down,
you know?

1019
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:57.150
Yeah.
But you have to do it in the right order.
Right?
Like down,
down,
left,
right.

1020
00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:57.721
It depends.

1021
00:54:57.721 --> 00:55:00.780
Sometimes it's like you fuck you for making me look for shit like that.

1022
00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:05.040
Just clicked the flock.
If you've got something,
show me.
Put it out there.
Yeah.

1023
00:55:05.041 --> 00:55:08.620
What the fuck man.
You treasure hunt,
all those sorts of treasures out there.

1024
00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.000
What is this shit?
He's the barracks yourself to your daughters and shit.

1025
00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.070
So you guys come up with the bosses?
Yeah.
You go out there,

1026
00:55:14.071 --> 00:55:18.070
you say you can't talk.
No,
you don't look at you with this motherfucking,

1027
00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:23.040
I'll say that.
You look at the wife and he goes,
oh,
okay.

1028
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:26.640
Really?
Are you fucking serious?
She doesn't have had them all.
God Damn.

1029
00:55:26.641 --> 00:55:28.740
They run up and down,
run around and target.

1030
00:55:28.741 --> 00:55:31.320
They heard your voice yelling and screaming.
I thought it was you there.

1031
00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.630
What are you nuts?
And look at?
And then I said,
quiet.

1032
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:37.290
So you can't say that until the kids just kind of fuck.
You know,
I told you,

1033
00:55:37.291 --> 00:55:42.150
you don't say anything to the kids.
Nothing.
They run the fucking place.
And Joe,

1034
00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:44.670
have you ever heard of something called Geo caching?

1035
00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:48.150
I think that's what Geo caching?
No,
it's this whole thing and said,

1036
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.700
this is one of these weird things that you would never know existed with us.

1037
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:52.890
He just ran across it.

1038
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:57.070
It's like a game that the whole earth or whatever is the,

1039
00:55:57.071 --> 00:55:59.660
the playing field and these people,
uh,

1040
00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:04.800
put g get gps coordinates to different boxes or treasures throughout the haunt.

1041
00:56:04.890 --> 00:56:08.400
Heard about this.
It's so crazy.
So like,
so what it is,
there's maps and there's,

1042
00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:12.380
there's websites that you go to that you try to find these little boxes that's

1043
00:56:12.381 --> 00:56:16.530
spread out throughout cities everywhere.
And then you get to one of these boxes,

1044
00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:19.620
you open it up and I think he signed like your name on it.
And then you look,

1045
00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:22.500
sometimes there's little treasures or presence in there and you just,

1046
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:24.850
or you add things to this little box,
like,
you know,

1047
00:56:24.851 --> 00:56:29.350
like a cool badge or like a diamond or something.
Not Real diamond,
but whatever,

1048
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.620
you know.
And then,
uh,
it's like this whole like game that people play.

1049
00:56:32.621 --> 00:56:35.680
It's called Geo caching and there's iPhone apps for it.
There's,
it's,

1050
00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:38.350
it's so weird.
I've always wanted to do it,
like at least,

1051
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:41.140
or at least look at a box and see what's inside of it.
You know,

1052
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:46.150
if you weren't worried about people being stalked and you weren't worried about

1053
00:56:46.151 --> 00:56:47.800
like nuts on the internet,

1054
00:56:47.950 --> 00:56:52.290
you could have a pretty dope TV show or you like give out coordinates.
Right.

1055
00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:53.740
You know,
and,
and you know,

1056
00:56:53.741 --> 00:56:56.500
you tell this dude where to go and then you're released that information on the

1057
00:56:56.501 --> 00:56:59.340
Internet and he's got to go do something that people from the Internet will help

1058
00:56:59.341 --> 00:57:01.120
them out.
Right.
But then you,

1059
00:57:01.121 --> 00:57:04.510
the problem is you just have some nut who would just be like,
you know,

1060
00:57:04.511 --> 00:57:06.130
you will know her brothers in another life.

1061
00:57:06.130 --> 00:57:08.190
I have eaten crystals and seen this version,

1062
00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:11.470
and then he'd be fucking followed you around everywhere and you could have

1063
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:12.880
issues with that dude,
you know?

1064
00:57:12.881 --> 00:57:15.790
And if he knew that he could get on television by helping you and becoming your

1065
00:57:15.791 --> 00:57:18.910
friend,
you know,
but you can have a pretty dope TV show like that,

1066
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:21.690
that would be cool.
You'd have to,
you can't,
that's no filter.
I mean,

1067
00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:25.300
Internet show,
there's no reason to have TV show.
Oh,
you mean,
yeah,
I guess,

1068
00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:28.850
I don't know,
man.
I mean exterior siding,
dude,

1069
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:32.170
TV is still what you're getting from TV,
the,
but there's not,

1070
00:57:32.171 --> 00:57:34.600
it's not like there's not going to be TV anymore.
What is this going to be?

1071
00:57:34.601 --> 00:57:38.290
Is that Internet and TV sort of merged together?
Yeah.
You know,

1072
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:40.300
because TV is still cool because you've got,
first of all,

1073
00:57:40.301 --> 00:57:43.930
you got to experience producers,
people who know how to film things correctly.

1074
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:45.940
People who know how to like write scripts.

1075
00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:47.910
You've got like all these talented motherfuckers,

1076
00:57:47.911 --> 00:57:50.830
so it's never gonna go away if the shit they're producing is really cool.

1077
00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:53.560
It's just somehow or another they're all going to merge together,

1078
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:57.070
but you're not going to get rid of TV.
The idea of like getting rid of TV,

1079
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:58.390
who's going to make lost?

1080
00:57:58.450 --> 00:58:00.550
Who's going to make some know what it's going to be though.
It's like,

1081
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:01.301
that's an example.

1082
00:58:01.301 --> 00:58:04.150
You've got a Jimmy Kimmel's website you can watch like every single one of his

1083
00:58:04.151 --> 00:58:06.760
episodes for way,
way,
way back.

1084
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:11.220
So it's just going to get to a point where they're not broadcasting TV to like,

1085
00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.010
that's what I want to fucking do is watch Jimmy Kemble.
You know what I'm saying?

1086
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.670
Listen,
let's get down and fucking dirty here.

1087
00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:22.720
Cocksuckers so like it's going to get to a point where they're just not

1088
00:58:22.931 --> 00:58:25.300
broadcasting in any more.
There's no cable companies.

1089
00:58:25.301 --> 00:58:29.010
It's just going to be like every show has their own website initially.

1090
00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:31.770
Jimmy Kimmel's dot com state of Jimmy Kimmel on channel.

1091
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:35.290
And then there's been going to be people who set up networks online or it's just

1092
00:58:35.291 --> 00:58:37.920
like connects online to your television and it's an alternative.

1093
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:42.090
[inaudible] Google TV,
apple TV,
TV show,
Sam.
So,

1094
00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.760
so right now your website might have some cool youtube videos,

1095
00:58:45.761 --> 00:58:49.080
but imagine it in the future being a channel.
Yeah.
You know what I mean?

1096
00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:52.200
Is we always said that that's probably what's going to happen right to it.

1097
00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:53.500
Everyone's going to get their own channel.

1098
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:56.830
That websites literally will be like channels and everyone's gonna have their

1099
00:58:56.831 --> 00:58:59.740
own little fucking thing.
That's why it's going to be a real problem.

1100
00:58:59.741 --> 00:59:03.010
Like I reality show,
like if apple reduces a thing,

1101
00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:05.660
produces some new thing where you make your own reality show,
right?

1102
00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:09.940
Like it's a fucking hat and you put this hat on TV like a little thing and

1103
00:59:09.941 --> 00:59:12.310
there's a camera right in front of you and you just carry it around with you and

1104
00:59:12.311 --> 00:59:16.430
it broadcasts wirelessly on the four g network and to Justin TV.

1105
00:59:16.431 --> 00:59:21.130
It started off as he did at one guy,
one guy,
24 hours a day he was on TV.

1106
00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:22.040
What I'm saying is that

1107
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.320
<v 0>apple would create an APP,
not an APP,</v>

1108
00:59:24.321 --> 00:59:28.940
but a a device like a new version of,
you know like they have the iPad,

1109
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:33.920
some new crazy thing and this thing would be I reality show your own reality

1110
00:59:33.921 --> 00:59:35.660
show.
It would edit it for you.

1111
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:40.730
You'd be able to do it all with voice commands and shit.
Cut,
edit,
rewind,

1112
00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:44.600
delete,
broadcast.
Totally.
Yeah.
It'll show it to you.

1113
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.530
A little heads up display right in front of you.

1114
00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:50.660
Would you like to send this online right now?
Yes.
Bam.
Do it online.

1115
00:59:50.661 --> 00:59:53.840
Right from there.
That's when we're going to have real attention whores.

1116
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:58.010
Who's gonna you know what was going to do the nutty shit on their reality show

1117
00:59:58.130 --> 00:59:59.630
to get people to watch them.
Totally.

1118
00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:02.990
And there's some people out there that'll become famous that can't get a reality

1119
01:00:02.991 --> 01:00:05.610
show right now.
You think,
well,
hey,
you know,
all you have to do,

1120
01:00:05.611 --> 01:00:08.060
no days just get a reality show and you're famous.
Yeah,

1121
01:00:08.061 --> 01:00:11.180
try getting a reality show shit head.
You think it's that easy?

1122
01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.910
You gotta be like Kim Kardashian.
You gotta suck some black tick.

1123
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:16.760
You gotta fucking,
you've got to get people interested in you.

1124
01:00:16.761 --> 01:00:20.980
You gotta get that white ass naked.
What is one of people?

1125
01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:22.890
What are people going to see every week and listen,

1126
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:25.550
she shows that big thick going into a big Dick.

1127
01:00:25.551 --> 01:00:30.320
Go in and do a pretty face gobble,
gobble,
gobble.
That chip just went for it.

1128
01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.580
She just like,
how about this?
Come on seven.
I'm going to be a,
a fake porn star.

1129
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:37.820
I got a plant in porn site with an out,
you know,
you're gonna Watch me.
Fuck.

1130
01:00:37.850 --> 01:00:41.930
But it's only because it was an accident.
You know,
it's post to see me.
Fuck.

1131
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.600
Should I tie him?
And then she just slings it out there.

1132
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:47.660
All those crazy bitches showing their pussy when they getting out of cars.

1133
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.110
I mean,
they just took,
took whoredom to like the next level.

1134
01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:53.580
Hopefully when they raised the bar.
That's,
yeah,

1135
01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:55.430
that's how hard it is to get a reality show.

1136
01:00:55.550 --> 01:00:57.560
You've got to do something like that and you gotta be there.

1137
01:00:57.561 --> 01:00:59.930
You gotta be in this,
the soup of Hollywood.

1138
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:02.390
You can't start a reality show like that from Nebraska.

1139
01:01:02.391 --> 01:01:04.940
No one's going to give a fuck.
They're just,
it's just not going to happen.

1140
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.260
Everybody shot reality shows.

1141
01:01:06.261 --> 01:01:09.920
Even octomom now you have to be fucking interesting.
Something has dot.

1142
01:01:09.921 --> 01:01:12.690
You have to be interesting.
Now you have to be interesting or crazy.

1143
01:01:12.691 --> 01:01:15.170
Could shoot a reality show,
but now you have to be interesting.
Yeah.

1144
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.640
You're like I was saying,
I'm watching a couple of shows lately.

1145
01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.030
I understand that he's fucking people crazy.
Hey,
let me tell you something,
Doug.

1146
01:01:21.031 --> 01:01:24.440
I just want to mention one thing that this is the year of the Mexican,

1147
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:29.720
the Miss America Philippe spa is the one in the last comic standing the

1148
01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:30.380
dishwasher.

1149
01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:33.710
They'll compadre toot you getting off on that one pound of the coke deal with

1150
01:01:33.711 --> 01:01:38.711
the racial profiling and now your boy came motherfucking Valasquez on Saturday

1151
01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.630
night.
It's the year of the Mexican Mexicans are taking over the fucking,

1152
01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:45.290
just a matter of time.
So many of them,
it's the year of the fucking Mexican.

1153
01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:49.370
But the way he took over was amazing.
I couldn't call that in a million years.

1154
01:01:49.371 --> 01:01:52.820
That's why you didn't see Joey karate video cause I really couldn't call that

1155
01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:56.540
but was at eastern fuck them up dog.
I would've lost a lot of money at that.

1156
01:01:56.541 --> 01:01:59.600
UFC booze and psychological first told me about this.

1157
01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:03.260
Well I had heard good things about him.
I had heard like,
this guy's really good.

1158
01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:07.010
You know,
this guy is a very talented,
this guy works really hard.

1159
01:02:07.011 --> 01:02:09.530
This guy's very dedicated.
But you hear that about a lot of guys.

1160
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:12.320
There's certain guys who stand out.
Cain was always the guy that stood out.

1161
01:02:12.321 --> 01:02:14.900
Like you'd remember him.
Like people would talk about him like before,

1162
01:02:14.901 --> 01:02:18.070
like when he had like his very first fight in the UFC.
But,
um,

1163
01:02:18.100 --> 01:02:20.370
Phil Baroni was to me and

1164
01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:24.780
<v 5>uh,
I think we were in Germany and we were sitting around talking and he was just</v>

1165
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:29.130
going off about how good cane is.
He's like,
he's the real fucking deal.

1166
01:02:29.131 --> 01:02:30.540
He's the best in the world.
He goes,

1167
01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:33.630
I don't give that up for anybody because I watched him run through guys.
He goes,

1168
01:02:33.631 --> 01:02:34.860
I watch them,
never get tired.

1169
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:38.640
I watched him do these conditioning drills and he's the last one to get tired

1170
01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.580
when guys like Josh Koscheck and well two words.
And he was like,

1171
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:42.540
you never see that.

1172
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:46.200
You never see a heavyweight that can go at the same pace as welterweights and

1173
01:02:46.201 --> 01:02:49.800
beat them in con and conditioning and endurance drills.
He's like,

1174
01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:53.110
the God never gets tired.
He goes,
it's incredible.
He goes,
he would,
you know,

1175
01:02:53.111 --> 01:02:54.860
like him and cost check,
you know.

1176
01:02:54.861 --> 01:02:58.560
And both of them are incredibly well conditioned and he would like do as much as

1177
01:02:58.561 --> 01:03:00.450
cash check or more.
That's insane.

1178
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:03.420
Like you never hear about a 240 pound guy that's able to do that.

1179
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:07.020
You know the hundred 70 pound guys mean that's where the real endurance is.

1180
01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:10.770
Now that's where the above hundred 45 pound guys,
some motherfuckers can go,

1181
01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:14.340
go figure you go for f Frankie Edgar,
try slow and Frankie Edgar down.

1182
01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:17.670
Good luck through Frankie.
Edgar could go for 20 rounds if,
if,

1183
01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:21.300
if it was a fucking contest to see like if I get it gets very difficult to
catch.

1184
01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:24.840
You might be able to beat him at a decision.
Very difficult to grab a hold of.

1185
01:03:24.841 --> 01:03:27.540
Very difficult to catch in this submission.
I mean he's fast,

1186
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:32.010
it's fuck his foot works good as wrestling's good.
If every fight was 25 rounds,

1187
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:36.120
Frankie Edgar might not ever lose ever for the rest of his life until he decides

1188
01:03:36.121 --> 01:03:36.810
to retire.

1189
01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:40.800
If he just keeps going until one of your breaks to one of your slows down,

1190
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:43.680
it's going to be,
you know a mother fucker.
You just keep going.

1191
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:45.630
There's certain guys that that weight,

1192
01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:48.530
but you never hear about that for two 40 except Kane.

1193
01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.940
Kane's the only guy I've ever heard about that as a heavyweight.

1194
01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:54.070
Can you hear things about Brock Lesnar studies freak like that?

1195
01:03:54.071 --> 01:03:57.720
His like if you look at like as a numbers,
like his ability to like,
I think,

1196
01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.510
I don't remember what his combine numbers where I have it on my phone.

1197
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:04.180
<v 2>Well,
but they're insane that the fuck knocked out of him.</v>

1198
01:04:04.181 --> 01:04:06.340
So the combined numbers don't come into it.
No,

1199
01:04:06.341 --> 01:04:09.850
but I'm saying is confused about all those numbers.
Go out the fucking window.

1200
01:04:10.170 --> 01:04:11.620
Let me tell you something.
You know what,

1201
01:04:11.621 --> 01:04:15.160
What Aka seen that I seen the first fight with Shane Carwyn Bro,

1202
01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:18.520
that really fucked me up.
That it all comes to you right there.

1203
01:04:18.730 --> 01:04:21.670
It all came to me as I was looking at them right before they're getting ready to

1204
01:04:21.671 --> 01:04:25.780
go.
I looked at my wife and I go,
Cain Valasquez and knock this mother fuck out.

1205
01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.020
And I didn't think that two right there,
that's why they didn't do a video.

1206
01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:31.120
And I thought about two things.
A lot of people saw that.

1207
01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:35.340
I thought that I thought that I seen what Shane did to him and,

1208
01:04:35.341 --> 01:04:37.090
and I think that this guy just said,
I'm going to do it.

1209
01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:39.940
Shame do with endurance and just get them before the first round.

1210
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:43.540
And then I seen some of the Shane Carla fight that nobody fucking mentioned.

1211
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:44.050
Yeah,

1212
01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:47.060
there's one part in the shin color fight when they're getting started where she

1213
01:04:47.061 --> 01:04:49.660
ain't call and hits him and after he gets hit he goes,

1214
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.020
that mother fucking never been hit before a bitch.

1215
01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:55.930
That motherfucker that he thought this was a wrestling game.

1216
01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:00.130
He ain't never been hit before.
Did you know that?
I didn't think about that.

1217
01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:04.450
Think of an experienced fighter when he gets it,
he'll smile.
He'll go like this.

1218
01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:05.373
He went like this,

1219
01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:10.060
look at that first fight again when he fought one and that's when I said,
Ooh,

1220
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:13.300
they just,
if Aka scene that they said they seen something,

1221
01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:14.610
he don't like getting it.

1222
01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:18.070
So I had to fight against somebody posted on the underground.

1223
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:21.760
<v 0>They could have very well been trolling.
I have no idea.
But they said trolling,</v>

1224
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.713
trolling is just,

1225
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:26.050
you post something that's not true to try and get people to bite and that people

1226
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:28.120
start arguing this is bullshit and then you know,

1227
01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:31.150
you'll laugh your ass off because he got a bunch of idiots arguing over
nonsense.

1228
01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:33.300
<v 4>Do you know what trawling used to mean by the way?
No.</v>

1229
01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:37.740
It used to mean a guy that chased after other men.
Really?
Yeah.
Because,
uh,

1230
01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:42.800
when was that online and Meghan in trouble with the animal pet or Los Angeles,

1231
01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:47.130
uh,
pet police or whatever they're calling.
What you got,

1232
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:49.250
there's pet police and somehow they got in trouble.

1233
01:05:49.251 --> 01:05:52.420
Did they call it and you got in trouble with the pedal at all?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Uh,

1234
01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.251
animal control,

1235
01:05:53.251 --> 01:05:56.730
animal control weapon cause people on the Internet like outlaw on all these

1236
01:05:56.731 --> 01:06:01.650
people were telling this poor girl in my space that I like tortured cats and

1237
01:06:01.651 --> 01:06:04.380
there was something like that.
Oh,
that's right.
Right.
You know,

1238
01:06:04.381 --> 01:06:06.580
you had made a fake video or something.

1239
01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.750
I made a fake video where I had a cat and a fridgerator and I used to,

1240
01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:13.050
I just like,
I keep it in the freezer,
stuff like that.
But anyways,
uh,

1241
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:16.440
so they call the animal control at me and I had to explain to this guy that I

1242
01:06:16.441 --> 01:06:20.640
was trolling or they were trolling people on the Internet and he goes trolling

1243
01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:23.580
in and he's like,
yeah.
And he goes,
well,
what's me?
And I'm like,
you know,

1244
01:06:23.581 --> 01:06:25.980
like joking or kidding goes,
oh,
well that meant something out.

1245
01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:29.150
Something else went back in my brain.
Oh,
boxy.

1246
01:06:30.210 --> 01:06:34.150
<v 0>Wait before that,
way before that Jeanette.
Yeah.
Talk about,
she was trolling.</v>

1247
01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.950
Trolling is like a lot of people,

1248
01:06:37.951 --> 01:06:42.630
a lot of dudes will pretend to be girls and they'll get dudes to bite.

1249
01:06:43.020 --> 01:06:43.860
So the,
you know,
like,

1250
01:06:43.861 --> 01:06:47.130
and then they'll get to say some ridiculous shit and then at the end they're

1251
01:06:47.131 --> 01:06:51.900
like,
ah,
I'm a dude.
You faggot.
No one's coming to your house to suck your Dick.

1252
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.230
You know,
there was a lot of that.
And Doug,
uh,

1253
01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:59.460
Stan hope did a whole bunch of trolling against,
with pedophiles.
He would,
uh,

1254
01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.640
do it.
There was a thing called baiting.org.
I don't know if it's still around.

1255
01:07:02.641 --> 01:07:06.280
I think Doug wrote a book about it.
I think he's got a book up upper,
doesn't he?

1256
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:08.940
I,
I think there were doing a book or he has a book,
I'm not sure,

1257
01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:11.310
but I know there's a lot of his blogs that are still available.

1258
01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:13.500
You can find them online if you just go to Doug's Dan hope.com.

1259
01:07:13.501 --> 01:07:15.800
I'm sure everything is there.
But he,
uh,

1260
01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:19.200
had this whole thing where he would pretend to be a little kids and he would

1261
01:07:19.201 --> 01:07:22.080
troll pedophiles and then we would post it all online.

1262
01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:26.040
Like what were they charging about?
Oh,

1263
01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:28.530
see that somebody was trolling something about Brock Lesnar.

1264
01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.060
What they were saying was that,
um,

1265
01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:32.850
no one was allowed to punch him in the face during Johnny telling you dog.

1266
01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.760
That dude has never been lit up all his life.

1267
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:38.220
He's always been the fucking biggest guy.
What about,

1268
01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:41.370
so nobody's ever said to him,
come on [inaudible] let's get it on.

1269
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:43.380
Do you think it's possible that um,

1270
01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:45.930
all the pro wrestling than he did and you know,

1271
01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:47.670
playing football for a little bit that he did too.

1272
01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:50.940
Do you think maybe he suffered a bunch of concussions?
No,
Bro.
He don't think so.

1273
01:07:50.941 --> 01:07:53.970
Some people had never been hit because they've always intimidated people.

1274
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:57.030
This motherfucker took a tool.
I really don't think he's coming back.

1275
01:07:57.390 --> 01:08:00.090
I think his ego got busted up like your boy again.

1276
01:08:00.091 --> 01:08:02.700
Trinidad against but not Hopkins.
I don't think so.

1277
01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:06.950
He's two ECO Pisco is ego and this confidence.
Well,
you know he came back,
left,

1278
01:08:07.110 --> 01:08:08.260
came back and comment on,

1279
01:08:08.310 --> 01:08:11.010
I don't know about that because he came back better and stronger after frank

1280
01:08:11.011 --> 01:08:12.570
near tapped him.
But that was a leg lock.

1281
01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.220
That wasn't a punch to the fucking face brow.
True Big fucking difference.

1282
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:19.510
When you get punched in the fucking face twice and when they cut you and you got

1283
01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:23.090
to see that every time you shave,
you see that every time.

1284
01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:26.960
I don't think he's going to beat that guy.

1285
01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:30.050
I don't think he's going to beat that guy.
I think the gap is too big.

1286
01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.150
When I think about when I,
when I see that guy,

1287
01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:33.860
what I see when I see the two of them,

1288
01:08:33.861 --> 01:08:35.630
the way they performed when they were fighting each other.

1289
01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:40.640
I saw one guy who was like this unbelievably strong,
powerful,
fast guy,

1290
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.550
but he didn't know exactly what to do with his body.

1291
01:08:43.730 --> 01:08:46.040
He didn't know exactly how to handle situations.

1292
01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:49.280
He did know to do the right thing and the other dude who maybe not as strong as

1293
01:08:49.281 --> 01:08:53.150
him,
but pretty fucking strong and has real good technique.

1294
01:08:53.151 --> 01:08:55.400
Everything he does perfect.
Everything he does is smart.

1295
01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:59.300
All his footwork is smart.
He can go at that same pace and keep going.

1296
01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.720
He's not exploding a shitload of energy that he can't recover from.
He's like,

1297
01:09:02.750 --> 01:09:05.570
he pays himself better.
He handled it more professionally.

1298
01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.130
It's like one guy's a black belt.

1299
01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.910
I'm looking at a black belt in MMA and came to Alaska.
It's like a master and it,

1300
01:09:10.911 --> 01:09:14.780
Brock,
I'm looking at this super powerful purple belt.
You know this,

1301
01:09:14.781 --> 01:09:18.800
this just ridiculously powerful guy who could get away with a lot of shit.

1302
01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:21.920
If you don't have perfect technique,
you really won't be able to stop them.

1303
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:24.870
But a guy like Cain has perfect technique.
That's the difference.

1304
01:09:24.871 --> 01:09:26.690
I think that the next guy they're going to put them up against,

1305
01:09:26.691 --> 01:09:30.620
which is what's online is frank man.
No,
no,
no,
no.
Oh,
go Brock.
Saying,

1306
01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:32.610
can I tell you what I think Frank Miele,
take it.

1307
01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:36.620
Come down because now we all know what to attack straight at them.

1308
01:09:36.621 --> 01:09:39.290
Throw a bunch of fucking punches and punch him in the face.

1309
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:42.920
It was when I was a kid.
I grew up in Northbrook and we played all the fucking,

1310
01:09:42.921 --> 01:09:43.754
I hate to say this,

1311
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:47.600
we played all of the black schools were group for you play a passe.

1312
01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.180
You play Paterson,
eastside.
These are fucking schools,
Jack.

1313
01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.760
You don't go in there and just talk,
hi,
how are you about Chad?

1314
01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:55.910
There ain't no chat at these fucking schools.
And the coaches would tell us,
bro,

1315
01:09:55.911 --> 01:09:59.840
the first play of the game,
fire out like you fucking assholes on fire.

1316
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:01.730
And then you establish,

1317
01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:04.130
then you'll see that they back off a little bit and that's right.

1318
01:10:04.131 --> 01:10:05.900
This didn't happen.
Happened.
Brian,
everybody's seen that.

1319
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:07.310
If you're a great fighter,

1320
01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:11.050
you seen that car and had them in a way go call cotenancy.

1321
01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:16.130
Karlyn had them and the question,
I think that he never been hit.

1322
01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:20.660
I think he's never been fucking lit up.
Well he is sparring with people though.

1323
01:10:20.661 --> 01:10:23.760
There's video barn they call used to eat broccoli.

1324
01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.310
I think they just take it easy on them.

1325
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:28.280
I got by Lowe's broken in the sixth grade.
It's still hurts.

1326
01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:30.380
It's still fucking hurts.
All right.

1327
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:34.310
It still hurts my nose and I didn't know for years cause I was doing coke for

1328
01:10:34.311 --> 01:10:38.150
years.
I thought I was doing coke because I had pain in my heart.
Who I was.

1329
01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.420
I don't cook from the fucking pain in my nose.
I had my nose busted.

1330
01:10:41.421 --> 01:10:45.950
Three you doing?
What are the pain your nose go cause you like coke

1331
01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:50.960
police thing over here.
Let me tell you.
So that's the newest,
latest theory.

1332
01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:54.080
The last 10 years my fucking nose has been hurting.
I can really,

1333
01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.870
what is that pain from?
It's from fucking getting your nose broken.

1334
01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.450
It's doing the sixth grade.
I was never going to be a fucking fighter.

1335
01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.400
It's totally unrelated to all that coke.
I know there's a joke.
It's a joke.

1336
01:11:04.401 --> 01:11:05.300
You fucking mobile.

1337
01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.380
What I'm saying is go that it's so weird that the last two years my nose is

1338
01:11:09.381 --> 01:11:12.740
really been fucking hurt and I never hit it by mistake and nothing lately,

1339
01:11:12.741 --> 01:11:16.380
but I remembered when I broke it.
The pain I had that when you fucking break,

1340
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.410
let me tell you something.
He got a cut in desire.
He had a bloody nose.

1341
01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:22.680
The worst thing about having your nose broken as if you have your nose broken.

1342
01:11:22.681 --> 01:11:26.940
Seven out of 10 times they busted your upper lip too.
So you got snotty blood.

1343
01:11:26.941 --> 01:11:29.580
You're tasting and salt the blood fucking from your mouth.

1344
01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:31.980
You remember that taste for the rest of your fucking life.

1345
01:11:31.981 --> 01:11:34.890
I don't give a fuck who you are and that's not a fucking good taste.

1346
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:38.900
That tastes always equivalize as to something that ain't good,
man.
I'd been my,

1347
01:11:38.901 --> 01:11:41.610
my nose had been fucking broken jack and I'll tell you what,

1348
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:46.110
it hurts and he got fucking beat up Dni.
He got beat up dog.

1349
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:49.080
I did that last punch when he got it.
He got that on the floor.

1350
01:11:49.081 --> 01:11:52.590
I've watched that and 10 times already.
He got it on the fucking floor.

1351
01:11:52.591 --> 01:11:55.870
He got hit.
I don't think he's coming back like that.
I think that fuck with him.

1352
01:11:56.040 --> 01:12:00.870
He's a big viking ego fucking shit.
Somebody took it to you mother fucker.

1353
01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:04.320
It's a different game now.
You get humble and he may come back strong,

1354
01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:06.570
but he's going to let people punch them in the fucking phase.

1355
01:12:06.571 --> 01:12:09.390
Now watch that car when fight when it's on next time.

1356
01:12:09.570 --> 01:12:12.330
Watch it again on your computer and you'll see what I'm talking about.

1357
01:12:12.331 --> 01:12:14.940
And nobody mentioned,
nobody mentioned that at all.
He got hit.

1358
01:12:14.941 --> 01:12:18.550
One people did mention it.
A lot of people,
he got hit.
He cowered when she fucked,

1359
01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:22.830
he went e that means he's never been hit before.

1360
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:28.200
That means Jack.
Um,

1361
01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:31.130
I don't know about that man.
Never been.
You know,
it's kind of a,

1362
01:12:31.131 --> 01:12:34.510
it's an interesting thing because he was such a huge draw,
you know,
and,

1363
01:12:34.511 --> 01:12:37.590
and still is such a huge draw because a pro wrestling and everything like that

1364
01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:41.340
that he was like rushed right into the big leagues right away.
Like if really,

1365
01:12:41.341 --> 01:12:44.880
if you wanted to be smart with a guy like that and you wanted to really build

1366
01:12:44.881 --> 01:12:48.120
them up correctly,
you know,
you wouldn't just do that with them.

1367
01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:51.780
You would slowly work them in and then having fight for the title once the

1368
01:12:51.781 --> 01:12:54.300
demand was through the fucking roof.
But they just,

1369
01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:57.050
they had that perfect fight with him and Randy coture,

1370
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:59.850
it was such a perfect promotional fight,
you know,

1371
01:12:59.851 --> 01:13:04.620
one of the greatest ever fucking hall of Famer fighting this new,
big,
young,

1372
01:13:04.621 --> 01:13:09.090
crazy dude and holy shit.
Can he beat him or really Randy was,
you know,

1373
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.380
I mean he was the heavyweight champion,
but you know,

1374
01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.400
he was 45 I think at the time.
And it's like,
you know,

1375
01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:18.750
it's past his prime to be fighting a guy that's this big and this athletic at

1376
01:13:18.751 --> 01:13:19.470
this crazy.

1377
01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:23.070
So all the sudden Brock be him and now Brock is just at the top of the heap with

1378
01:13:23.071 --> 01:13:27.990
all these for Roche's Lyons who have been doing MMA for 10 years nipping at his

1379
01:13:27.991 --> 01:13:31.410
heels.
And so there's a big goddamn gap there.
You know,

1380
01:13:31.411 --> 01:13:34.840
there's a few guys there that have a big ass gap.
You know Keynes,

1381
01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:38.850
one of them is his full MMA game is at a way higher level.

1382
01:13:38.851 --> 01:13:42.720
The time that he's put in the,
the way he picks things up,
he's just,

1383
01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:46.310
everything he does is perfect.
He's a baby and each one six or so,

1384
01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:49.800
something like that.
Yeah.
Fucking baby is a baby.

1385
01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:54.120
So all you heavyweight motherfuckers just by the start dropping that at two oh

1386
01:13:54.121 --> 01:13:58.250
five and shit.
Yeah,
it's going to be scary for a while.
Good luck with all that.

1387
01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:01.410
I just want to tell people that when I don't make a joy karate videos sometimes

1388
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:03.420
it's like sometimes Eddie's out of time,

1389
01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:06.600
but the other times is that I'm fucking stumped and I don't want to give you bad

1390
01:14:06.601 --> 01:14:09.630
info.
I was going to go with Brock.
I would've gone with Brock.

1391
01:14:09.631 --> 01:14:10.980
I would've gone with Martin Kampmann.

1392
01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.550
Matt Hamill was the lock of a year.
Let me tell you something.

1393
01:14:15.551 --> 01:14:18.460
Anytime Tito fights,
when you better get,
and I love Tito debt.

1394
01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:21.470
I was one of his biggest fucking fans,
but every time he fights now,

1395
01:14:21.471 --> 01:14:24.490
just bet against them dog.
That's as easy fucking locked right there.

1396
01:14:24.491 --> 01:14:26.260
And I hate to say this,
but it's true.

1397
01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:29.170
If I had $10,000 I would've bet better on fucking Manhattan.
Well,

1398
01:14:29.171 --> 01:14:33.040
that's a no brainer anymore.
Damn stop.
You can always bet Sam style.

1399
01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:36.220
I'm not going to sit there and be Houdini.
That was the win rate.

1400
01:14:36.221 --> 01:14:39.430
Rock against whatever stem style is always fucking good.

1401
01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.990
There's a casino that always got a line on sand style.

1402
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:45.960
Those motherfuckers always come down.
Those guys played a wind.

1403
01:14:45.961 --> 01:14:49.000
San Stay just don't hit too fucking hard.
It's hard as fuck.

1404
01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:53.130
Sam started hits very hard.
He just fighting really good guys,
you know?

1405
01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:56.410
I mean not duty fought Paul Taylor,
that goes,
I'm motherfucker,
motherfucker,

1406
01:14:56.650 --> 01:14:59.870
motherfucker.
That was a great fight for the kids.
Hear me yelling and screaming.

1407
01:14:59.871 --> 01:15:01.890
Yeah,
they can hear you.
That's all right.
It's all right.

1408
01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:05.680
I'm sure they've been swept a though it's their uncle Joey.
That's fucking crazy.

1409
01:15:05.681 --> 01:15:09.130
That's uncle Joe Kampman shields fight.
Man Catlin could've won that fight.

1410
01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:12.640
A lot of people thought that I was hyping up shields and,
and uh,

1411
01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:15.560
that I wasn't talking enough about Cameron.
I think,
you know,

1412
01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.440
I'm a big camp and fancy bullshit.

1413
01:15:17.441 --> 01:15:19.870
You and I were talking about camping at dinner Friday night.
I said to you,

1414
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:24.550
he ain't no joke.
He's from Tennessee cause I see Mike Pyle,

1415
01:15:24.551 --> 01:15:29.320
he talks different bro.
I love Denmark Bro.
I know.
I don't know these things.

1416
01:15:29.321 --> 01:15:33.670
You know he's a bad motherfucker.
Fuck you find the wrong fight in that fight.

1417
01:15:33.671 --> 01:15:37.480
But he could've won that fight.
Jake shields was exhausted,
man.

1418
01:15:37.481 --> 01:15:41.590
He had cut 20 pounds in a day to get down to one 70 cause you know,

1419
01:15:41.591 --> 01:15:44.160
he had been fighting in one 85 in strike force and he put out,

1420
01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:46.900
you said that during the break put on some muscle man.

1421
01:15:46.901 --> 01:15:49.750
He had a real hard time making that one 70 a real hard time.

1422
01:15:49.930 --> 01:15:54.100
He was dead in the water and Cameron just didn't quite,
I was,
you know,

1423
01:15:54.130 --> 01:15:56.640
I was really thinking the Cameron was going to pull it off.
You know,

1424
01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:58.930
I didn't want to say it.
You know,
I didn't want to say before the fight,

1425
01:15:58.931 --> 01:16:01.950
but when I saw what shape Jake was in the,
the,

1426
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:05.440
the Wayans right before we went on,
I was like,
this guy looks like he has aids.

1427
01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:08.130
Like he looks like he's dehydrated.
It looks like you hate about good,

1428
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:12.580
terrible pro.
I was shocked.
Like he looked so terrible that I saw him.

1429
01:16:12.581 --> 01:16:15.460
I shook his hand.
I was like,
whoa.
Like there's some guys that look,

1430
01:16:15.490 --> 01:16:19.450
the worst I ever saw was Travis looter when Travis Luder was going to fight

1431
01:16:19.451 --> 01:16:24.070
Anderson Silva.
Listen man,
he weighed in twice.
I was there for the first way.

1432
01:16:24.071 --> 01:16:28.330
Then he looked terrible.
He had dry chapped lips.
He was gone too,

1433
01:16:28.331 --> 01:16:32.470
is sucked in.
And then he didn't make weight.
And so we had another hour,
I think,

1434
01:16:32.471 --> 01:16:35.230
or two hours to make weight.
Well,
he tried to make,

1435
01:16:35.231 --> 01:16:38.650
wait another 45 minutes and then he shuffled over to this scale.

1436
01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:40.330
He couldn't walk bro.

1437
01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:44.510
He couldn't walk like the Jake had a walk upstairs to get through the,

1438
01:16:44.511 --> 01:16:48.850
the weird stairs was,
and you could see him like as he was walking upstairs,

1439
01:16:48.851 --> 01:16:52.510
it was like,
it was awkward.
It was awkward watching them walk.

1440
01:16:52.511 --> 01:16:56.170
That's how exhausted he was.
And then he got on the scale,
nothing like,

1441
01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:59.020
like what's his face like a Travis looter Travis Luder.

1442
01:16:59.021 --> 01:17:01.900
It looked like he was dead.
He looked that Guy Zombie Bro.

1443
01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.850
He looked like a dead man that was walking.

1444
01:17:03.851 --> 01:17:08.380
He was looked like a guy who had been poisoned and 24 hours after that he was

1445
01:17:08.381 --> 01:17:10.130
supposed to be the baddest

1446
01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:14.390
<v 5>motherfucker on the planet and Anderson Silva in 24 hours and he walks over and</v>

1447
01:17:14.391 --> 01:17:16.730
he still can't make weight.
He's still like a pound and a half off.

1448
01:17:16.731 --> 01:17:19.040
There's no way you can lose it.
He's just fucked.

1449
01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:21.380
He just would just calculated it wrong or you know,

1450
01:17:21.381 --> 01:17:23.660
he didn't lose enough fat or he didn't stick to his diet.

1451
01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:28.470
The weight watchers tell him,
Brian Calvin does fucking points.
These guys are,

1452
01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:31.820
they're there.
This,
they've got it down to a science,
so much fucking weight,

1453
01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.410
cutting 20 pounds,
you know,

1454
01:17:33.411 --> 01:17:36.560
a lot of them are cutting 20 pounds and they do it slowly.

1455
01:17:36.561 --> 01:17:39.340
One of the Dye Doggie Yang,

1456
01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.700
a Korean dude who fought on the card,
he lost a Chris Como Zoo.
Very,

1457
01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:45.320
very close and controversial decision.

1458
01:17:45.330 --> 01:17:49.010
A lot of people thought that he should have won,
but he was at legends on Monday,

1459
01:17:49.011 --> 01:17:52.370
cutting weight on Monday,
on Monday.

1460
01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:54.260
And the fight the Wayne's not until Friday,

1461
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:56.630
but he was at legends cutting weight already on Monday.

1462
01:17:57.170 --> 01:18:00.200
So that motherfucker's losing like probably he's probably losing 20 pounds and

1463
01:18:00.201 --> 01:18:01.790
he's doing it over a course of like five days.

1464
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:05.780
Cause he looked huge when he got into the cage.
The giant musclebound dude,

1465
01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:06.531
you know,

1466
01:18:06.531 --> 01:18:09.890
it's just these guys have it down to a science how to dehydrate yourself and

1467
01:18:09.891 --> 01:18:14.300
then come back.
So that was,
if Kampman had a time,
that was his time,
man,

1468
01:18:14.301 --> 01:18:15.860
he could have,
he could have won that fight,

1469
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:19.970
especially if he pushed away and just started firing on them in the third round.

1470
01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:24.650
Mccammon Saul bad-ass striker,
his fucking striking is clean man.

1471
01:18:24.651 --> 01:18:26.300
If you look at that policy,
I go,
fine.

1472
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:30.920
That's a beautiful representation of his skills because Paul Tiago is like this

1473
01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:35.180
really rough and tumble bad mother fucker and he's got dynamite in his hands,

1474
01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:39.670
knocked out Josh Koscheck and Martin Cameron just picks him apart.

1475
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:44.770
Dude picked him apart standing using his jab and leg kicks and just angles like

1476
01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:48.320
everything you mean?
Paula just got like outclass in the feet.

1477
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:51.500
He swinging these wild.
I mean if they hit you,
you're fucked.

1478
01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:53.000
He's swinging some sledge hammers,

1479
01:18:53.001 --> 01:18:56.210
but he ain't even getting close to hitting Cameron.
And I was like,
man,

1480
01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.870
Kampman skills are so much better than Jake shields as a kickboxer.

1481
01:18:59.871 --> 01:19:03.400
I just don't know why he was trying to engage them in grappling.
You know?

1482
01:19:03.410 --> 01:19:06.920
He came close a couple times,
like I was like,
maybe he's going to prove me wrong.

1483
01:19:06.921 --> 01:19:09.500
It looks like we locked up a couple of jokes almost.
He almost got it.

1484
01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:14.180
But that mother fucker is so hard to tap.
Jake shields is so heart attack.

1485
01:19:14.210 --> 01:19:18.120
May Him almost got him.
May Him had his back.
Yes,
it had it fully locked in May.

1486
01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:21.980
I'm almost got him.
But mom's big ma'ams big as fuck.
You know,

1487
01:19:21.981 --> 01:19:25.760
mayhem is a big one,
80 fiver and he's strong in his Jujitsu's very,

1488
01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:29.230
very underrated.
You know,
I've had two guys that I rolled with,

1489
01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:32.690
just ran right through me mayhem and Jake shields,
both of them,

1490
01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:36.080
both of those guys where I felt like I was help us.
Nothing I could do with them.

1491
01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:39.890
They're just too too goddamn strong.
Jake shields is a bad ass wrestler.

1492
01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:42.590
He's just his grappling and his Jujitsu.
It's just,

1493
01:19:42.591 --> 01:19:44.690
his technique is awesome and he's strong as shit.

1494
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:48.500
He knows what the fuck he's doing and I'm like,
Cameron has disadvantaged there.

1495
01:19:48.501 --> 01:19:50.570
I wonder why he's like engaging this dude.

1496
01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.730
And if Jake wasn't like really beat down,

1497
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:55.700
I mean the fact that Jake was beat down like that and he was still able to get

1498
01:19:55.701 --> 01:19:59.780
takedowns are still able to reverse position at mountain and get some dominant

1499
01:19:59.781 --> 01:20:04.610
spots on shows you how bad asses grappling is.
But kampmanns kickboxing is like,

1500
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.250
like if Jake Shield is like a purple belt.
Kampmanns a fucking straight

1501
01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:12.810
<v 0>black belt in stand up.
His standup is crisp man.
He does everything good.</v>

1502
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.330
Everything perfect the way he moves his footwork.

1503
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:19.230
There's a big gap between him and Jake Shields.
Jake shields is like Plod,
punch,

1504
01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:22.140
punch,
kick.
His Kid,
his body kicks pretty good on his left side.

1505
01:20:22.290 --> 01:20:24.840
He throws good body kicks.
He'll throw some good leg kicks too.

1506
01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:28.380
But really he's just trying to get the clench and take your ass down and if he's

1507
01:20:28.381 --> 01:20:29.310
too tired to do that,

1508
01:20:29.311 --> 01:20:32.460
like in that round with the third round with Kampman and shields,

1509
01:20:32.461 --> 01:20:33.900
I thought I was going to move away.

1510
01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:36.060
I thought why would he grapple with them in this round?

1511
01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:37.530
This is the round where he could jack them.

1512
01:20:37.980 --> 01:20:39.990
Kevin's one of those dudes though it like,

1513
01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:44.400
he's just like just outside the very,
very best.
But he,

1514
01:20:44.401 --> 01:20:48.450
you could see him like launch into the very best like with any one big

1515
01:20:48.451 --> 01:20:52.140
performance.
You know what I'm saying?
My keys.
One of those guys like,

1516
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.700
like Carlos Condit La Carlos condit just leaped into one of the very best when

1517
01:20:56.701 --> 01:21:00.060
he knocked out Dan Hardee when he knocked out Dan Hardee,
I was like,
okay,

1518
01:21:00.061 --> 01:21:02.970
this mother Fucker,
you know,
like everyone knew he was a Badass.

1519
01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:05.490
Everyone knew he had that real close flight with camp in,

1520
01:21:05.491 --> 01:21:06.990
which was a fucking incredible war.

1521
01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:10.830
And then a real close fight with Jake Ellenberger at another fucking animal.

1522
01:21:10.831 --> 01:21:14.820
Ellenberger is a beast.
So you knew that Carlos condit was a bad mother fucker,

1523
01:21:14.821 --> 01:21:17.280
but when he knocked out Dan Hardee it was like,
okay,
this dude is,

1524
01:21:17.460 --> 01:21:20.820
not only is he a bad mother fucker,
but he's like getting better all the time.

1525
01:21:20.821 --> 01:21:24.570
He's like hitting new levels.
He's trained with Jon Jones like every day.

1526
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.440
Bad mother clock I didn't make because you know,

1527
01:21:28.470 --> 01:21:31.070
I would've done it with Eddie and I,
you can't tell the truth.

1528
01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:34.350
Be told the truth that I couldn't have said that.
I like to listen.

1529
01:21:34.351 --> 01:21:36.840
I love Dan Hadi.
I think talent to shit.

1530
01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:39.480
But Carlos conduit I think showed me some of the,

1531
01:21:39.690 --> 01:21:42.920
was that Jake Ellenberger who's getting beat up for the first two rounds and

1532
01:21:42.990 --> 01:21:47.990
came back and said shit to him and it's the silver type elbow from the inside.

1533
01:21:48.940 --> 01:21:53.060
I was like,
that kid's got balls.
He's got mad balls,
balls,

1534
01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:57.110
call Congress.
Carlos hate the mix of that alley with that mother fucker.

1535
01:21:57.150 --> 01:21:59.610
Cause he might turn the lights out on yet permanently.

1536
01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.370
Either the type of guy that might turn them out on your permit.

1537
01:22:02.371 --> 01:22:05.370
He's a bad mother.
Fucks up my bottom scares the shit is getting better.

1538
01:22:05.770 --> 01:22:09.080
He's gotten better.
He's done in one of the best camps in the fucking way.
Yeah.

1539
01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:12.300
Those guys don't fuck around man.
And that Trevor Whitman man,
he,

1540
01:22:12.301 --> 01:22:15.640
that guy is a very good striking cause he is.
He's doing sky.
Yeah.

1541
01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:19.050
I want to give them a shout out.
He's a fucking good guy and he's a,

1542
01:22:19.051 --> 01:22:22.920
he's a bad mother.
Fuck.
I know he works for them.
And then uh,
also um,
fuck.

1543
01:22:22.921 --> 01:22:26.990
What is this an answer?
Pray.
Nope.
Shut up man.
The fuck up man.

1544
01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:33.210
Sorry princess.
Um,
I feel like an asshole for not remembering the guy's name.

1545
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:36.510
Which one?
The Guy who's the main guy at Jackson's.

1546
01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:39.120
That's the mains tracking trainer.
Cause he's a great guy.

1547
01:22:39.540 --> 01:22:43.860
Trevor Whitman is a guy who's had a grudge grudges in Denver,
correct?
Right.

1548
01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:44.881
I'm going to,

1549
01:22:44.881 --> 01:22:47.030
I'm going to have to Google this real quick because I've got to give that guy

1550
01:22:47.031 --> 01:22:51.180
his props cause he's doing an awesome job too.
I want to give a prop to my man,

1551
01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:54.750
Ali Baas,
whatever your name is from Australia on Twitter.

1552
01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:58.730
Always sending me love is shit looking out for all of us.
He had red banded Joe.

1553
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.390
Who's,
who's that?
Oh that's,
that's,

1554
01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:05.100
I didn't know what Joe is looking at that until you put somebody on red band.

1555
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:06.100
What's the matter with you?
You look all

1556
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:08.230
<v 5>fucking this sleepy at what's going on.
She was listening,
you know,</v>

1557
01:23:08.231 --> 01:23:10.200
I thought Jake shields the last that I thought he,

1558
01:23:10.201 --> 01:23:14.260
Jake Shields I thought for sure was pulling for cattlemen with everything I had.

1559
01:23:14.261 --> 01:23:15.610
Cause I,
and I love Jake shields,

1560
01:23:15.611 --> 01:23:19.120
but camping is just this guy that he's right there,
you know.

1561
01:23:19.650 --> 01:23:22.750
Do you remember hanging out with Mike Winkeljohn.
Thank you.
Sorry John.

1562
01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.260
I'm going to drag that.
I smoke too much weed.
I forgot his name,
but he's a,

1563
01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.750
he's a great striking coach.
He's,

1564
01:23:28.751 --> 01:23:32.260
you know what I was really impressed with with Carlos condit and that fight with

1565
01:23:32.261 --> 01:23:34.780
Dan Hardee was the technique that he threw that left hooked with,

1566
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.290
if you look at the both guys throw the punch of the exact same time really,

1567
01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:43.060
but Carlos was was perfect.
Carlos was instead of coming wide,

1568
01:23:43.210 --> 01:23:43.900
he came,

1569
01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:48.700
he came like with a perfect angle to the punch and it was perfect accuracy and

1570
01:23:48.701 --> 01:23:50.380
his other hand was up.
You know,
he,

1571
01:23:50.381 --> 01:23:53.260
he did it with perfect technique and he nailed them.

1572
01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:56.230
He caught him in the exchange and that's like a perfect lesson for people to

1573
01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:58.540
learn.
I keep saying perfect,
but if you,

1574
01:23:58.541 --> 01:24:02.290
if that's one of the most important things is to concentrate on technique.
Yeah,

1575
01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:05.740
you can knock guys out with crazy,
wild,
loopy shit.
You can,

1576
01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:09.040
you can knock guys out with hay makers where you're fucking Chin is down and

1577
01:24:09.041 --> 01:24:10.870
your hands are up.
If you connect,
you can knock them out,

1578
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:12.370
but that's not the best way to do it.

1579
01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:15.190
The best way to do it is to use the proper technique because if you do that,

1580
01:24:15.191 --> 01:24:17.230
you have more of a chance of knocking them out.

1581
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.120
If you have big power into your fast,

1582
01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.730
you can get away with some goofy Shit like Roy Jones did when he was in his

1583
01:24:21.731 --> 01:24:24.550
prime.
But look what happened to Roy Jones once he started to slow down,

1584
01:24:24.670 --> 01:24:26.440
when he didn't have that crazy athleticism.

1585
01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.180
All of a sudden he couldn't pull off what he could.

1586
01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:32.230
But Bernard Hopkins still can.
Bernard Hopkins has perfect technique.

1587
01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:35.140
If Bernard Hopkins had the Athleticism of Roy Jones Jr,

1588
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:38.410
I mean maybe that's why Bernard Hopkins does Bernard Hopkins,
it's like maybe,

1589
01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:39.670
you know like Jujitsu guys,

1590
01:24:39.671 --> 01:24:42.160
they always say the best Jujitsu guys are the guys that aren't physically strong

1591
01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:45.070
because they can't pull off anything else unless they have perfect technique.

1592
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:48.430
You know,
cause it's all leveraged injection.
Yes.
I'm sorry,
say that.
Not Strong.

1593
01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:51.580
Really.
Yeah.
The most technical guys and the guys that aren't physically strong,

1594
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.680
the most technical guys,
if you want to learn Jujitsu,

1595
01:24:53.681 --> 01:24:57.310
you always want to learn from a small guy because big guys have like coolers and

1596
01:24:57.340 --> 01:24:59.410
guillotines.
They do a lot of like power Jujitsu.

1597
01:24:59.450 --> 01:25:02.080
They'll do a lot of things that you can only get away with if you really strong.

1598
01:25:02.290 --> 01:25:05.950
Whereas a small guy has no options other than use perfect leverage and perfect

1599
01:25:05.951 --> 01:25:10.850
technique.
Hmm.
Yeah.
So you should learn you,
you're better off your bed.

1600
01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.630
Motherfucking when you open up your Little Cup full fucking school cops.

1601
01:25:15.370 --> 01:25:17.950
I don't want to teach anybody,
man.
I don't like teaching.
You know?

1602
01:25:17.951 --> 01:25:21.010
It's funny because my daughter,
do you really?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1603
01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.400
I thought you were going to kick back to you saying,
I've,

1604
01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:27.190
I've taught p friends and shit,
but it's,
you know the thing about,
you know,

1605
01:25:27.191 --> 01:25:30.880
if you want to like be a coach like a Winkeljohn or like a Trevor Whitman man,

1606
01:25:30.881 --> 01:25:33.220
that's your life,
dude.
You're dedicating yourself to,

1607
01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:37.390
to these guys and to their progress.
And it's a very fascinating thing,

1608
01:25:37.391 --> 01:25:41.470
but you gotta be willing to dedicate 100% that's the reason why I quit teaching

1609
01:25:41.471 --> 01:25:45.370
taekwondo is because I started doing standup comedy and I realized that I was

1610
01:25:45.371 --> 01:25:47.470
not going to be giving this a hundred percent of my time anymore.

1611
01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:49.660
And I had a bunch of guys that I was leading and tournaments.

1612
01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:51.610
And even though I had stopped fighting,

1613
01:25:51.611 --> 01:25:53.290
talk about no tournament and I was doing kickboxing,

1614
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:56.350
I was still teaching at a taekwondo school and I was still leading people and

1615
01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:57.100
tournaments.

1616
01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:59.610
And so I would have these kids that I've coached and I'd bring them to life,

1617
01:25:59.611 --> 01:26:02.830
these beginner tournament's and I was dedicating a lot of time to it.

1618
01:26:02.831 --> 01:26:06.110
And I had a lot of people that had like 10 guys that were like really

1619
01:26:06.111 --> 01:26:09.860
competitive and a girl who was really competitive and she was really good.

1620
01:26:09.861 --> 01:26:13.190
And I spent a lot of time with them,
like many,
many hours every week,
you know,

1621
01:26:13.210 --> 01:26:16.850
like at least three nights,
four nights a week,
at least two hours a night.

1622
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:21.350
Just dedicated to training with these kids and working with them and I knew that

1623
01:26:21.351 --> 01:26:23.660
once I started doing comedy and I needed my,

1624
01:26:23.661 --> 01:26:27.120
I couldn't be there at nighttime cause I had to go to do a Gig in Connecticut or

1625
01:26:27.121 --> 01:26:29.750
I couldn't be there and I'd have somebody else teaching it for me.
I'm like,

1626
01:26:29.751 --> 01:26:32.360
they're not going to do it the way I do it and this is not going to be the same

1627
01:26:32.361 --> 01:26:33.350
thing and this is not,

1628
01:26:33.351 --> 01:26:37.490
it's not fair and I don't want to half ass it and I don't want to feel shitty

1629
01:26:37.491 --> 01:26:38.151
about that.

1630
01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:41.990
The one thing that it made me feel good about my life ever was martial arts,

1631
01:26:42.110 --> 01:26:44.780
so I was like,
I can't not do this.

1632
01:26:44.781 --> 01:26:49.610
I can't fuck this up because I have to quit.
I can't like do a shit job at this.

1633
01:26:49.611 --> 01:26:53.390
I can't do a shit job at teaching because to me it was like one of the,

1634
01:26:53.391 --> 01:26:56.570
the the the defining moments in my life that I wasn't a loser.

1635
01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:59.660
Like when I was teaching taekwondo at Boston University,
I was like,

1636
01:26:59.661 --> 01:27:02.180
I'm teaching at a like a university.
Like,

1637
01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:04.820
I'm like an expert at something and I'm teaching people that want to learn this,

1638
01:27:04.821 --> 01:27:05.330
how to use it.

1639
01:27:05.330 --> 01:27:08.120
It's like one of the first times in my life I felt like I was worth something,

1640
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:11.750
you know,
so there's no way I could fuck this up theirs.
So I just quit.

1641
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:15.380
I just quit teaching.
And that's how I feel like,
like right now,
like,
you know,

1642
01:27:15.381 --> 01:27:20.180
I get interested in strategy and I,
I get interested when I see guys fight.
Uh,

1643
01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:20.680
what,
uh,

1644
01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:23.540
what I think is a very unintelligent fight and they don't have the proper

1645
01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:27.260
coaching.
They don't have someone who's like really mapped out a game plan.

1646
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:30.260
A lot of these dudes are really good and because they're really good,

1647
01:27:30.261 --> 01:27:32.630
they know what they can do and they know what they want to do.

1648
01:27:32.631 --> 01:27:35.510
And they sorta like plot out their own plan in a fight,

1649
01:27:35.660 --> 01:27:36.890
which is all well and good,

1650
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:40.040
but sometimes you need someone who's also really good,

1651
01:27:40.041 --> 01:27:44.480
also has a really good knowledge of this and is outside of it looking in because

1652
01:27:44.481 --> 01:27:47.270
someone was outside of like a Greg Jackson who's looking in,

1653
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:50.320
there's one of the reasons why,
you know,
like,
like a Dave camp,

1654
01:27:50.321 --> 01:27:53.660
Mario and Bob Cook,
they're outside.
They see the whole thing.

1655
01:27:53.710 --> 01:27:56.210
They're very intelligent and they're very immersed in the game.

1656
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:59.840
Like Bob Cook and Dave Cambria,
they break down fighters,
they spend time,

1657
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:03.710
they go over tapes,
they analyze shit.
And when it comes down to a fight,

1658
01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:05.900
they've got a very intelligent strategy.

1659
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:08.860
And if you listened to that strategy and you follow that game plan,
you're,

1660
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:12.050
you have a very good chance of winning.
You know,
there's going to be variations.

1661
01:28:12.051 --> 01:28:14.630
Shit's gonna happen.
You're gonna have to make adjustments.
But of course you do.

1662
01:28:14.631 --> 01:28:17.270
That's part of the game.
You know there's going to be shit happens.
Okay?

1663
01:28:17.271 --> 01:28:20.540
You can't take them down.
Listen,
you got to kick that motherfucker's legs.
Okay?

1664
01:28:20.541 --> 01:28:22.490
If you can't kick them down and he wants to stand up with you,

1665
01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:25.610
he's open for that inside leg kick and then you have to have a,
you know,

1666
01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:28.850
here's plan B.
Okay,
now we're here.
Okay?
You're,
you think you broke your foot?

1667
01:28:28.851 --> 01:28:31.210
Okay,
stop throwing kicks is what you're gonna do.
You're gonna,

1668
01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.060
you're gonna bait him.

1669
01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:34.880
You going to get him into exchange and fire off the left hook.

1670
01:28:34.881 --> 01:28:36.170
He's opened for a left hook.
You know what I'm saying?

1671
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:39.220
Like they have this all thought out.
They have it thought out like that.

1672
01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:42.890
The guy thought out every 14 plan,
everything.
I mean,

1673
01:28:42.891 --> 01:28:46.280
it's amazing how there's so much more into this than what you would think you

1674
01:28:46.281 --> 01:28:50.420
need fucking
moron and go hit the bag.
You know,

1675
01:28:50.421 --> 01:28:54.110
you have Jujitsu,
you have your strength and conditioning.
It's amazing how,

1676
01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:56.600
you know what I noticed,
and I don't know if you notice,

1677
01:28:56.601 --> 01:28:59.690
I'm going to start doing a column for pro MMA Joe.
Yeah,
yeah.

1678
01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:02.250
Once a week or once a month.
Right.
Just writing

1679
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:05.780
<v 2>something and it's weird.
He goes,
what's your first column going to be about?
And,</v>

1680
01:29:05.781 --> 01:29:08.850
and I and I noticed that the last two years,

1681
01:29:08.851 --> 01:29:10.920
every time I've gone to an MMA event with you,

1682
01:29:11.430 --> 01:29:16.050
somebody else in the UFC division is losing way.
They're trying to get healthy.

1683
01:29:16.770 --> 01:29:19.110
And this last time I went to Austin,
you got Bert,

1684
01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:24.780
Bert lost 50 60 pounds.
Our friend's mom lost a bunch of wages.
Great.

1685
01:29:24.781 --> 01:29:28.470
Now and I seen another guy and then we have our buddy deeper squad who we've

1686
01:29:28.471 --> 01:29:31.050
bumped up,
he's a big cause of the sleep apnea.

1687
01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:33.840
So we and how Emma May affect some people,

1688
01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:37.110
like I was sick and tired of going into those fights are really fat.

1689
01:29:37.111 --> 01:29:38.880
Fuck when you see all those people in shape.

1690
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:41.490
And then when I went through this last year,
I've see,
I heard,

1691
01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.360
I haven't seen that.
They put two different tables at like they put tables,

1692
01:29:45.361 --> 01:29:48.660
we cookies and cakes.
Then they had tables with like healthy snacks.

1693
01:29:48.661 --> 01:29:51.290
And it's so weird like these people when you're around this,

1694
01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:52.710
this is what MMA has done for me.

1695
01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:55.500
I'm not a fighter and I don't want to do Jujitsu with nothing.

1696
01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:58.710
But being around those guys,
you're like,
fuck,
I gotta be healthy.

1697
01:29:58.711 --> 01:30:02.940
Whenever I watched those UFC,
uh,
you know,
24,
seven,
whatever they are like,

1698
01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.490
I think it definitely inspires Pedro's bias.
People every time to,

1699
01:30:06.650 --> 01:30:08.340
every time I go to a UFC event,

1700
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:12.370
somebody else's on a diet or somebody else's getting healthy or somebody else's

1701
01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:15.960
eating healthy,
and that's what I've seen from another man.
It started with me.

1702
01:30:16.170 --> 01:30:18.610
That ultimate fight of the year take was on it.
The,

1703
01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:21.390
the kid that lost a hundred something pounds from doing Jujitsu.

1704
01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.780
He's not in the UFC no more.
But he talked about it and he goes,
you know,

1705
01:30:24.781 --> 01:30:29.040
even if I just final in this,
at least people lose weight and try this.

1706
01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:30.600
I forget what his name was.

1707
01:30:30.601 --> 01:30:34.320
He had like a Mohawk and a kid and he really pushed love for the kid.

1708
01:30:34.321 --> 01:30:38.440
He made a ton of Todd Hays.
Yeah,
he was.
He lost like 130 pounds or something.

1709
01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:43.380
<v 5>He's a bad motherfucker.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Not Todd Hays.
No,
no,
no.
Isn't it Josh?</v>

1710
01:30:43.381 --> 01:30:47.200
Shit.
Josh Hays.
I was at a talk to you about Josh bring their pain.
Hey,

1711
01:30:47.490 --> 01:30:49.260
what the fuck?
I had a kid and he had a Mohawk

1712
01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:52.960
<v 2>blonde hair on that he had and he really loved his wife.</v>

1713
01:30:52.961 --> 01:30:55.660
He seemed like a release and see a guy.
Yeah.
He lost a Shitload,

1714
01:30:55.661 --> 01:30:56.630
a shitload of weight,

1715
01:30:56.631 --> 01:31:00.400
and it's amazingly how every time I go to UFC event now somebody else is on a

1716
01:31:00.401 --> 01:31:01.860
diet.
So he was drinking

1717
01:31:02.210 --> 01:31:04.710
<v 5>the chains.
Josh bring the pain.
Hanes,
sorry.</v>

1718
01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:08.490
It's amazing how it's rubbed off on some pizza.
He was on the same seasons tape.

1719
01:31:08.520 --> 01:31:10.740
Yeah.
I told him saying it was only they would take.

1720
01:31:10.741 --> 01:31:12.810
That's why it was a weird high.

1721
01:31:12.811 --> 01:31:16.110
Every time I go I see somebody and it's just inspiring to me,
you know?

1722
01:31:16.111 --> 01:31:17.220
I don't know.
Yeah,
man.

1723
01:31:17.221 --> 01:31:21.810
I think that's one of the things that I would be interested in doing outside of

1724
01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:26.760
doing comedy outside of like of all the stuff that I get fascinated by pool and

1725
01:31:26.761 --> 01:31:29.760
all that was,
that is one thing that I would get interested in doing.

1726
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:32.610
Opening up a gym training fighters,
but and you know,

1727
01:31:32.611 --> 01:31:35.970
just being like sort of a Greg Jackson type of guy having ideas and strategies

1728
01:31:35.971 --> 01:31:39.120
and helping you know,
people through.
But that would have to be something,

1729
01:31:39.121 --> 01:31:42.600
I'm 100% dedicated.
You can't fuck around with that.
And how fast that man,

1730
01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:46.050
that's not something to have fast.
You know,
you're,
you,

1731
01:31:46.051 --> 01:31:49.590
you are taking people who have a limited window in the sport,
you know,

1732
01:31:49.591 --> 01:31:53.280
a fighter can fight from the time they're 18 till there,
you know,
most guys,

1733
01:31:53.281 --> 01:31:57.990
38 48 48 if you're Randy 38 if you're a normal human,
you know,

1734
01:31:57.991 --> 01:32:01.000
so yeah,
the only,
if,
if you know,
that's,
that's it.

1735
01:32:01.001 --> 01:32:04.360
You got 20 years and during that time if you really ended up a bunch of wars,

1736
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:07.480
cut that time down substantially.
Anytime you have a big war,

1737
01:32:07.481 --> 01:32:09.760
anytime you have a craving,
if that's your style,

1738
01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:11.740
you know you want a Vandelay Silva it like,

1739
01:32:11.770 --> 01:32:14.920
like vandal used to do in the early days.
Well no matter what your you,

1740
01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:16.330
it's going to shorten your career a bit.

1741
01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.460
You're not going to be 48 years old fighting like that.

1742
01:32:18.461 --> 01:32:19.480
That's a different kind of style.

1743
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:22.420
One thing that you've always talked about that is very,

1744
01:32:22.630 --> 01:32:24.790
you see it and find this fridge off the shits loud.

1745
01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:29.760
It's the gyms that have the gym wars,
the camps where they have gym wars.
Yeah.

1746
01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:33.250
You could see those guys that yeah,
there a little seasoned and stuff,

1747
01:32:33.251 --> 01:32:37.270
but they'd been hit in the head a couple more times and regular regular guys.

1748
01:32:37.630 --> 01:32:40.420
As you can really see those gym wars are the ones who were really kill you.
Yeah.

1749
01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:43.720
You have to have guys that you're training with that you trust and you have to

1750
01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:47.050
be careful not to hurt each other.
You know,
guys hurt each other sometimes,

1751
01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:50.740
you know,
it's just,
it's by accident or just because they're training hard.

1752
01:32:50.741 --> 01:32:55.430
I mean that's just a part of the game.
But you gotta be careful with,
uh,

1753
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:59.230
just gyms where they just basically fight every week.

1754
01:32:59.350 --> 01:33:02.080
Like every week you're fighting every week,
two,
three times a week.

1755
01:33:02.081 --> 01:33:04.690
You guys are blasted each other,
you know,
you're fighting,

1756
01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.180
you basically get in the end.
Then one good thing about it,

1757
01:33:07.181 --> 01:33:09.740
as you get used to fighting,
you get used to give me any tag.

1758
01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.350
You get used to being in there in the pocket.

1759
01:33:11.351 --> 01:33:14.380
You're going to be a tough motherfucker to get into the cage with because this

1760
01:33:14.381 --> 01:33:17.380
shit is going down in your life every day you're used to it.

1761
01:33:17.410 --> 01:33:20.830
You're used to full blast blows.
But on the other side,
you know,

1762
01:33:20.831 --> 01:33:24.190
you can only do that for so long.
If you do that in and take big,

1763
01:33:24.191 --> 01:33:26.440
big shots all the time on a regular basis,
your,

1764
01:33:26.441 --> 01:33:30.790
your career gets shortened substantially.
Your brain is only set up,
you know,

1765
01:33:30.791 --> 01:33:34.540
to take a certain amount of abuse before the just way too much damage and all

1766
01:33:34.541 --> 01:33:37.330
this stuff they're finding out now about football players.
You know,

1767
01:33:37.331 --> 01:33:40.300
when they're there,
they're examining their brains after he's died special.

1768
01:33:40.301 --> 01:33:43.660
I told you about the little gap.
Oh yeah.
Very amazing.
Yeah,
Eddie.

1769
01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.660
Eddie told me about that too.
It was very intricate.
That's special.

1770
01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:48.760
Fucking scary shit man.

1771
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:51.250
I watched the other one where it was that football player.
Um,

1772
01:33:51.251 --> 01:33:53.770
I believe he played for Harvard,
uh,

1773
01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:57.160
in college and then after college he became a pro wrestler and he suffered a

1774
01:33:57.161 --> 01:33:58.510
gang of concussions.

1775
01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:01.300
And this is one of the reasons why I brought up the Brock Lesnar situation.

1776
01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:04.240
Cause those guys suffer a lot of concussions a lot.
They get,

1777
01:34:04.241 --> 01:34:07.390
they take a lot of hard shots.
There's a video,
Brock Lesnar,

1778
01:34:07.650 --> 01:34:09.640
Brock Lesnar is on top of the third rope.

1779
01:34:09.641 --> 01:34:11.230
I don't know who he was wrestling against,

1780
01:34:11.620 --> 01:34:15.100
but he was on top of the third rope and he jumps up through the air and does

1781
01:34:15.101 --> 01:34:19.690
like a fucking three flip,
but miscalculates and lands on his head.

1782
01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:23.320
Dude,
he's 300 pounds.
Okay.

1783
01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:28.500
And he throws himself through the air flips and lands on his head.

1784
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:33.550
He should be dead.
He should be dead.

1785
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:36.880
You got to see the video.
Here's the video.
If you watch the video,

1786
01:34:36.881 --> 01:34:39.460
any normal person would be dead.

1787
01:34:40.130 --> 01:34:40.963
<v 6>Okay.</v>

1788
01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:45.660
<v 5>Watch this shit.
Watch this shit.
We're watching on youtube.
Watch this</v>

1789
01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.500
dude.
He landed on his head.

1790
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:53.730
He landed on his fucking head.
Yeah.

1791
01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.120
He completely miscalculated the jump completely.

1792
01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:01.850
Landowners get and still finish the pin.
I'll retweet the link on my Twitter.

1793
01:35:01.851 --> 01:35:04.670
Raise brains.
You want to talk to scrambled eggs?

1794
01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.880
His brains should be a small half cup of oatmeal in the bottom of an empty bowl.

1795
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:16.040
They should be dead.
It should have crushed his whole brain.
I mean,
for me,

1796
01:35:16.041 --> 01:35:19.370
if that was me or you and we did that,
we'd be dead,
but that guy's fine.

1797
01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.990
That's why I said like if that happened during this one that we saw,

1798
01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:27.980
how many times did he accidentally banged his head?
Other times,
I mean,

1799
01:35:27.981 --> 01:35:31.940
they're there.
These guys are gigantic dudes and they're throwing each other.

1800
01:35:31.941 --> 01:35:32.091
I mean,

1801
01:35:32.091 --> 01:35:34.910
people don't realize the abuse that people's bodies take on pro wrestling.

1802
01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.250
The reason why a lot of those guys get hooked on painkillers.

1803
01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:40.790
Pro Wrestling is one of the most difficult things to do in all of show business.

1804
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:44.450
Even in all of sports,
even though it's not really a sport,
I mean per se,

1805
01:35:44.451 --> 01:35:45.830
I mean there's predetermined outcomes.

1806
01:35:46.130 --> 01:35:49.790
It still requires an incredible amount of athleticism and incredible amount of

1807
01:35:49.791 --> 01:35:53.060
work.
These guys are on the road like every night down the road,

1808
01:35:53.061 --> 01:35:56.930
several nights a week,
performing shows,
throwing each other through the air.

1809
01:35:57.020 --> 01:36:00.740
They have to come up with new,
more spectacular moves to satisfy people.

1810
01:36:00.830 --> 01:36:02.060
That's why they're jumping off ropes.

1811
01:36:02.061 --> 01:36:05.450
They're jumping off the top of the fucking cage and they're flipping and doing

1812
01:36:05.451 --> 01:36:05.751
this.

1813
01:36:05.751 --> 01:36:08.810
And you grabbed by ankles and I'm gonna throw you through the air and then you

1814
01:36:08.811 --> 01:36:12.170
land on your back.
And then I jumped through my and I flip and I land on you.

1815
01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:15.020
They fucking bonk heads and shit all the time.

1816
01:36:15.021 --> 01:36:17.870
These guys are getting knocked the fuck out and practice.
What do you do?

1817
01:36:17.871 --> 01:36:20.660
Well and put some ice on it and see tomorrow and tomorrow.

1818
01:36:20.661 --> 01:36:24.080
You better get your fucking moves down.
I just want to keep your WWE contract.

1819
01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:27.590
Did he also play football too?
Yeah,
he,
yeah,
he played.
Um,

1820
01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:29.380
I think he tried out for the Vikings.

1821
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:33.470
Listen to his numbers because this is where it gets really crazy.
Okay.
I mean,

1822
01:36:33.500 --> 01:36:36.860
yeah.
PROC is not like the best MMA fighter.

1823
01:36:36.861 --> 01:36:40.460
He does not have the best striking technique.
He does not have the best Jujitsu.

1824
01:36:40.670 --> 01:36:44.960
But when you talk about just a freak athlete,
his 40 yard sprint,

1825
01:36:45.170 --> 01:36:49.760
4.6 seconds,
225 pound bench press,

1826
01:36:49.820 --> 01:36:54.470
he can do 43 reps,
his vertical jump,

1827
01:36:54.471 --> 01:36:59.210
35 inches,
his broad jump,
10 fucking feet,
10 feet.

1828
01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:03.290
Do you imagine this is at 300 pounds,
310 pounds.

1829
01:37:03.810 --> 01:37:07.370
You imagine a fucking guy,
310 pounds,

1830
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:12.480
throwing himself 10 feet through the air and he still could have stopped at Paj

1831
01:37:12.490 --> 01:37:17.460
was talking and stop came.
So what the fuck?
What are we talking about here?
No,
no.

1832
01:37:17.530 --> 01:37:20.810
Listen.
The ability to him to apply for and it goes down.
I mean,

1833
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:22.280
how long has the ability to move?

1834
01:37:22.281 --> 01:37:25.220
Your body keeps saying that in the podcast about how good he moves.

1835
01:37:25.670 --> 01:37:27.800
All those fucking football players move on.
Yeah.

1836
01:37:28.110 --> 01:37:31.500
Those are the guys that have come online when you see an offensive lineman.

1837
01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.110
Oh yeah,
90 and they super athletes.
These mother fuckers,
they're all like that.

1838
01:37:36.230 --> 01:37:39.320
Could you imagine if a Michael Vick wanted to get into MMA?
Amazing.

1839
01:37:39.321 --> 01:37:42.860
How bad he would fuck people up.
Amazing.
Oh that guy.
If a guy like that,

1840
01:37:42.861 --> 01:37:45.500
that level of athlete dedicated hymns,
I mean there are guys like that.

1841
01:37:45.500 --> 01:37:48.650
There's a few,
there's a few that are in there now.
But these,

1842
01:37:48.651 --> 01:37:51.440
those super athletes like Michael Jordan,
you know,

1843
01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:55.150
if a Michael Jordan decided to,
from the time he was [inaudible] to beat you,

1844
01:37:55.770 --> 01:37:59.760
you'd have to bet on themselves.
Joy would love that.
She would fight.
Listen,

1845
01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:02.820
cause his wife could bet for him.
He can go to Vegas and if he was fighting,

1846
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:06.870
he was like put everything on a thousand people,
Benton photo.
That motherfucker,

1847
01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:10.430
he would beat Ladelle if he'd bet on himself.
Cause he had,
he was,

1848
01:38:10.431 --> 01:38:11.810
he let go with a chair.
Dude,

1849
01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:15.390
he was such an accolade additive motherfucker member.

1850
01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:19.470
How he would when he was the first guy that would literally fly through the

1851
01:38:19.471 --> 01:38:24.030
fucking air slamming in dunks where you would see it on the highlight reels on

1852
01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:24.781
like ESPN.

1853
01:38:24.781 --> 01:38:27.510
You'd see it on the news and people would just be standing there shaking their

1854
01:38:27.511 --> 01:38:32.310
head going,
how the fuck can he do that?
He was flying with his tongue out,

1855
01:38:32.490 --> 01:38:36.090
flying through the air,
smashing that ball through there.
I mean,

1856
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:40.980
I didn't even follow basketball and all I saw was that dude doing these

1857
01:38:40.981 --> 01:38:44.320
superhuman feats of athleticism.
If that guy does sat.

1858
01:38:44.321 --> 01:38:48.600
You mentioned that flying need,
Jordan can hit you with choose Christ.

1859
01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:53.720
Could you imagine the flying doubled me like a fucking Jose Aldo style that

1860
01:38:53.881 --> 01:38:58.050
Michael Jordan could hit you with if Michael Jordan dedicated his time to that

1861
01:38:58.051 --> 01:39:02.190
instead of basketball,
God damn,
he'd be a bad motherfucker.
Those guys are coming,

1862
01:39:02.191 --> 01:39:06.060
man.
Those guys are coming those.
That's the next wave of MMA.

1863
01:39:06.210 --> 01:39:10.230
The next wave of LMA is super athletes.
Show Davis,

1864
01:39:10.990 --> 01:39:13.680
John,
John,
I mean John [inaudible],
Lesnar and Lesnar.
Look,

1865
01:39:13.770 --> 01:39:16.500
he doesn't know the game yet.
He's relatively inexperienced.

1866
01:39:16.501 --> 01:39:20.190
He's only had six fights,
seven fights.
You know,
that's not that many,
man.

1867
01:39:20.191 --> 01:39:22.830
That's not,
that's not enough to be fighting.
What does he,
ah,

1868
01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.470
he fought the Korean gentleman in his UFC debut.

1869
01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:30.620
Then he fought Frank Mir and got leg blocked and then he fought a Keith haring

1870
01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:32.190
and beat him on decision.

1871
01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:37.200
Then he fought a Randy and he beat Randy and got the title and then he fought

1872
01:39:37.670 --> 01:39:40.380
Frank Mir,
Frank Mir again,
that's five.
And then he fought,

1873
01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:44.910
is it just six and then he fought six,
seven,
seven,
eight,

1874
01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:45.870
eight.

1875
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:50.250
Really I counted seven either way it's relatively relatively inexperienced and

1876
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:54.060
right away thrust into the deep end of the throat to the fucking,

1877
01:39:54.061 --> 01:39:57.420
the guy as an NCAA national champion had some serious technique.

1878
01:39:57.421 --> 01:40:00.990
There's no way you become a champion wrestler if you're just wrong because those

1879
01:40:00.991 --> 01:40:04.980
guys are just strong too.
I mean you have to have some serious technique.
So He's,

1880
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:09.390
he can learn,
he just has to be brought up correctly.
Some what he really,

1881
01:40:09.490 --> 01:40:11.580
really should have done with him.
It's hard with heavyweights.

1882
01:40:11.590 --> 01:40:14.100
So cause there's not as many guys that are willing to fight a guy like that.

1883
01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:15.001
You know when you're coming up,

1884
01:40:15.001 --> 01:40:17.610
like who the fuck's gonna fight him in the king of the cage once he going to

1885
01:40:17.611 --> 01:40:20.460
learn out of that,
you know what I mean?
He's gotta be tested somehow.

1886
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:23.610
So there's like a weird middle ground.
Like you got to get 'em in Bella tore.

1887
01:40:23.611 --> 01:40:24.390
You know what I'm saying?

1888
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:28.380
You got to get them to fight guys that are just a hair under strike force level

1889
01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:30.480
just to have,
we'll strike force in the UFC right now.

1890
01:40:30.481 --> 01:40:33.660
They're pretty close with Alastar.
Well starring fatal or and you know,

1891
01:40:33.661 --> 01:40:36.780
for dooms capable of beating anybody if he gets them in the right position.

1892
01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.180
There's,
and Josh Barnett,
he's a dangerous mother fucker.

1893
01:40:39.310 --> 01:40:41.610
There's some dangerous guys.
Antonio de Silva,

1894
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:43.740
you're not quite the same level as UFC.

1895
01:40:43.741 --> 01:40:46.980
But I think that like when a guy comes up that's got that much potential,

1896
01:40:46.981 --> 01:40:50.940
like a Brock Lesnar,
like,
you know,
it's like you gotta,

1897
01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:54.310
you gotta make sure that you take the most advantage

1898
01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:56.380
<v 0>out of these physical gifts.
You know,</v>

1899
01:40:56.381 --> 01:41:00.970
you've got to bring them up the right way or just throw him in like they did
man.

1900
01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:04.390
But like they did,
they made a ton of money.
I mean everybody made a ton of money,

1901
01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:08.470
but I just feel that money they're about to make now with the fucking Mexicans

1902
01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.780
is off the chart.
Jag.
Yeah.
It just opened up that UFC Latino with the paper view.

1903
01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:17.410
This is PR.
They were already it shoot super bowl Sunday in two years.

1904
01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:21.310
They're putting fucking though Santos in this guy up quick Jack.
Are they really?

1905
01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:21.671
Oh yeah.

1906
01:41:21.671 --> 01:41:25.230
This is going to get are going to be Christmas or I'll fucking [inaudible].

1907
01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:28.680
There'd be new year's or it'll be super bowl weekend a for sure to it.

1908
01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:33.510
If it's super bowl weekend,
we're both shit.
It's going to be [inaudible].

1909
01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:37.190
It would be yet just Julia in her chin is going to be

1910
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:43.630
king.
Congress has Godzilla.
Go Santos versus Cain Velasquez might be,

1911
01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:45.220
I might have a fucking heart attack.

1912
01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:48.130
I might not be able to get through the broadcast.
I might.

1913
01:41:48.131 --> 01:41:51.090
I might just shit my pants before we even start.
I might just,

1914
01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:54.370
I might just have uncontrollable diarrhea and bought it for Super Bowl.

1915
01:41:54.371 --> 01:41:57.610
They're not going to lie for why?
Wait,
let's put it up there.

1916
01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:01.270
Santos is coming off a big fight to that Roy Jones slip fight or the Roy Nelson

1917
01:42:01.271 --> 01:42:04.600
fight rather was a real good fight for him because he got pushed and he had a

1918
01:42:04.601 --> 01:42:08.530
work.
He had to work for three hard rounds because Roy Nelson is no joke man.

1919
01:42:08.531 --> 01:42:12.310
Roy Nelson is a powerful motherfucker and he can take it and Dosantos hit him

1920
01:42:12.311 --> 01:42:16.210
with some bombs and he had to go three hard rounds with him.

1921
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:20.410
It was like a real like grueling fight where you know Roy Nelson hit him with

1922
01:42:20.411 --> 01:42:23.820
some shots to,
Nelson was always there and always dangerous.
Who's looking new?

1923
01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:28.770
Used car dog aggression against red head against Frankie.

1924
01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:32.890
A Gray Maynard,
right?
I don't know.
I don't know exactly what's a setup yet.

1925
01:42:32.891 --> 01:42:34.120
I think it's all tentative right now.

1926
01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:38.560
I'm not sure Carl would hurt his back for 25 he did.
Yeah.

1927
01:42:38.561 --> 01:42:41.440
He's head of his next fight.
Really?
When did this happen?

1928
01:42:41.441 --> 01:42:44.050
All those heavyweight scene that fight and fell off their fucking lunch and this

1929
01:42:44.051 --> 01:42:48.640
happened yesterday.
They all did him.
Frank Mir fell off shore car pulled out.

1930
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:51.390
I thought Carla was,
oh no,

1931
01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:55.270
I won't pull that on one 25 that suck.
He hurt his back.
Who else?

1932
01:42:55.271 --> 01:42:57.010
Somebody else pulled out a couple pullouts.

1933
01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:01.020
Really car pulls out of January Cobain.
I hate

1934
01:43:03.070 --> 01:43:07.650
having some back pain and an MRI s did some damage that may require you're

1935
01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:12.490
reading it.
Yeah,
I have some damage that may really require surgery.
Oh No.

1936
01:43:13.150 --> 01:43:16.240
Well you know he had some serious back problems wrestling,
you know,

1937
01:43:16.241 --> 01:43:19.390
when he was wrestling and some serious back problems and it's one of the reasons

1938
01:43:19.391 --> 01:43:23.670
why he um,
I think,
uh,
stop playing football as well because uh,

1939
01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.180
I think he played football for a bit.

1940
01:43:26.110 --> 01:43:31.000
Somebody else's hurt too from one of the cars 24 and cro cop interested in

1941
01:43:31.001 --> 01:43:34.690
replacing Carwyn versus Nelson.
Whoa.
Cro.

1942
01:43:34.691 --> 01:43:36.770
Cop wants to step in and fight Roy Nelson.

1943
01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.660
Roy Nelson might not cro cop the fuck out right out back to Croatia and that

1944
01:43:40.661 --> 01:43:45.450
crazy fucking blanket and not crazy that you would say that.
Crazy,
crazy.

1945
01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:48.880
I'll say that,
but crazy talk.
He might,
you know,
or Cro.

1946
01:43:48.881 --> 01:43:52.310
Cop might just come back with a fucking flurry.
You never know when a guy's

1947
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:55.460
<v 5>done because if you look at it like Alistair Overeem,
a lot of people counted.</v>

1948
01:43:55.461 --> 01:43:57.920
Alistair Overeem out.
A lot of people said,
man,

1949
01:43:57.921 --> 01:44:00.130
this guy just keeps getting knocked out by people.
Surgery.

1950
01:44:00.131 --> 01:44:02.390
Keratan have knocked him out.
Chocolate.
Dell knocked him out.

1951
01:44:02.690 --> 01:44:05.900
I think a shogun stopped him once.
I mean there's just like he got,

1952
01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:09.380
he had all these fights where he's getting beat down and I think a lot of people

1953
01:44:09.381 --> 01:44:10.820
said,
you know what,
this guy is just done.

1954
01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:14.270
And then he went up to heavyweight and then he got all sudden dedicated and then

1955
01:44:14.271 --> 01:44:17.510
all of a sudden he's the baddest mother fucker and k one he's the most dangerous

1956
01:44:17.511 --> 01:44:19.970
guy that's fighting and strike force the most.

1957
01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:22.700
I think he's more dangerous than any of those other Strikeforce guys.

1958
01:44:22.850 --> 01:44:24.470
I know faders a legend.

1959
01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:27.410
I know failure is a bad mother fucker and I'm a fade or fan,

1960
01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:30.110
but I think fatal or stands with Alistair Overeem,

1961
01:44:30.111 --> 01:44:31.700
I think it's night night soldier.

1962
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:33.470
I don't think you can hang in there with that guy.

1963
01:44:33.471 --> 01:44:36.020
I don't think you realize the level of striking that guys on right now.

1964
01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:40.220
He's been training just straight K one for a long time now and competing and

1965
01:44:40.221 --> 01:44:42.010
winning in high end,
you know,

1966
01:44:42.011 --> 01:44:44.900
a high level competition against high level competition,

1967
01:44:45.110 --> 01:44:47.570
beating Peter Arts and shit.
You know,
so there's,

1968
01:44:47.571 --> 01:44:50.720
there's a a gang of those dudes right now that are,
that are,
that are bad.

1969
01:44:50.721 --> 01:44:54.880
Motherfuckers was sub Joe Rogan's dropping,
I'll be his shit.

1970
01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.970
Cro Cop could come back,

1971
01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.690
he could come back if as long as he can still take punishment,
you know,

1972
01:44:59.691 --> 01:45:02.480
I mean the other day with a big knee from big guy,
you know,

1973
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:05.330
but if he could still take punishment and he sued,
you know,

1974
01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:08.720
super dedicated himself to sides.
Fuck this,
I'm coming back.
You know,

1975
01:45:08.721 --> 01:45:11.480
I'm coming back with a vengeance.
Him Against Roy Nelson.
It could be fun.

1976
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:14.410
I'm sitting there the other day watching Tito against Matt Hamill.
What?

1977
01:45:14.420 --> 01:45:17.180
I've always loved apple.
I like his work ethic.

1978
01:45:17.181 --> 01:45:20.060
I always pull from and I'm watching the Tito or whatever.

1979
01:45:20.061 --> 01:45:24.770
I don't thinking about fucking judge Joel to pick this guy up of rule around

1980
01:45:24.771 --> 01:45:27.980
like a fucking rag doll like a rag doll.
I never,

1981
01:45:27.981 --> 01:45:31.580
I was thinking about this this week.
I'm looking at this goal.
This is what's in.

1982
01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:33.620
Let me with John Jones handles dudes,

1983
01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:38.690
it's like you ever seen a leg like a strong bug,
like a beetle.

1984
01:45:38.810 --> 01:45:41.120
Pick another bug up and just kind of toss it around.

1985
01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.600
Like bugs can do crazy shit to each other.
Like ants can just pick other ants.

1986
01:45:44.601 --> 01:45:46.370
I'll bug there nothing and just toss them around.

1987
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:49.580
It doesn't learn either even strain and that's how it looks like when Jon Jones

1988
01:45:49.581 --> 01:45:52.760
chose could go around that.
That gave my heart stop dude.

1989
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:57.140
He fucking stop his lateral drop when he gets those devils double over hooks on

1990
01:45:57.141 --> 01:46:01.580
you that he hit hoody hit with it.
He hit the guy.

1991
01:46:01.581 --> 01:46:05.390
Would that Stephan Bonner,
Stephan Bonner with it.
You hit go smile with it.

1992
01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:07.610
He goes miles.
His first opponent in UFC,

1993
01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:12.170
he a apparently Tait Fletcher told me that he hit it on Keith Jardeen and

1994
01:46:12.171 --> 01:46:15.350
training.
He said,
dude,
you can't even believe it when you see it.
Keith is as big,

1995
01:46:15.351 --> 01:46:19.280
strong,
powerful dude and Jon Jones just launches them through the air,

1996
01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:20.900
flips him over his head.
I mean,

1997
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:24.140
you know a lateral job is you're flipping a guy threw the fucking air,

1998
01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:29.030
feet up to ankles flying and he and he does that to keep charging on a regular.

1999
01:46:29.031 --> 01:46:32.900
He's just that strong eyes.
He just freak strong freak technique.

2000
01:46:33.230 --> 01:46:37.940
Super Smart,
super humble dude.
You know that's,
that's the next level man.

2001
01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:40.610
That level of athleticism that comes with those guys.

2002
01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.260
That's the next level that's coming right now.

2003
01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:45.830
Jon Jones is just like all those other super athletes in other sports.

2004
01:46:45.831 --> 01:46:49.380
Just like a Jordan.
He's just one of these guys.
He's just all bad fucker.

2005
01:46:49.650 --> 01:46:50.400
Bad motherfucker

2006
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.700
<v 0>with his mind.
But that mother Fucker,
we don't have a downfall too.</v>

2007
01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.940
What they also have a,
there's a dark side to the middle.

2008
01:46:56.941 --> 01:46:59.100
We'll have what you were talking about before,
which is technique.

2009
01:46:59.400 --> 01:47:02.880
They relied too much on left lettuces.
Oh Jon Jones has a perfect world.

2010
01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:07.320
It draws as they're more involved in it.
And that's what happens to Michael Vick.

2011
01:47:07.321 --> 01:47:10.770
For example,
Jordan rely on technique.
I don't know much about basketball.
Did He,

2012
01:47:10.771 --> 01:47:14.010
was he a technique guy or was he just an athletic guy?
He was very athletic,

2013
01:47:14.011 --> 01:47:16.530
but he knew the game of basketball and,
and they had to be,

2014
01:47:16.531 --> 01:47:18.060
he was one of the greatest basketball.

2015
01:47:18.061 --> 01:47:19.860
But what I'm saying is we're trying to fighting,

2016
01:47:19.861 --> 01:47:24.560
sometimes people have very fast the hand speed or that good with their legs,

2017
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:25.423
they move good,

2018
01:47:25.650 --> 01:47:30.600
but they just don't for the CISM stops and you flow always lose the technique.

2019
01:47:31.050 --> 01:47:34.340
You know,
like,
like you'll never be a GSP.
He said,

2020
01:47:34.341 --> 01:47:37.800
great athlete become motherfucker.
Got Great techniques,
techniques.
Perfect.

2021
01:47:37.801 --> 01:47:42.090
It's perfect.
You know.
And that's just so John Donner heard the guy who handles,

2022
01:47:42.091 --> 01:47:46.170
uh,
he's,
he does a lot of the training of GSP and a lot of the strategy of GSP.

2023
01:47:46.171 --> 01:47:49.080
And he was brought in to coach with GSP on this season.
The ultimate fighter.

2024
01:47:49.081 --> 01:47:51.810
You saw him?
He is he Australian dude write shorthand.
I'm sorry.

2025
01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:55.100
New New Zealand wasn't there.
He does,
yeah.

2026
01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:58.590
He's like 43 years old and Jujitsu is this guy's life and he's,

2027
01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:00.780
he's a brilliant motherfuckers on his man.

2028
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:03.960
I heard he sleeps on the mat when he takes naps and shit cause he teaches during

2029
01:48:03.961 --> 01:48:08.090
the day.
You know when he's got no classes,
he's just take her naps in.

2030
01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:09.830
Showroom is a fucking man.
Oh really?

2031
01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.900
Where he sleeps in my thing and he's won a lot of legend behind this guy.

2032
01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.530
I heard that like,
he's one of these guys like us,
like you know like as a comic,

2033
01:48:16.531 --> 01:48:20.790
sometimes the best material you get is right about before you close your fucking

2034
01:48:20.791 --> 01:48:22.410
eyes and you have a decision to me.

2035
01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:25.560
Either you could get up and write the joke or you could get up and say to

2036
01:48:25.561 --> 01:48:25.951
yourself,

2037
01:48:25.951 --> 01:48:29.340
I remember the morning and then you don't remember what got in the morning.

2038
01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:31.740
It's this motherfucking tastes it to the next level.

2039
01:48:31.741 --> 01:48:33.150
He's in bed thinking of a move.

2040
01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:35.790
He'll get up at four in the morning to get a job to a rolling,

2041
01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:37.890
start rolling with the fucking,
you know,
whatever.

2042
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:41.610
Just to see if leverage or whatever.
I heard,
he's one of those guys,
you know,

2043
01:48:41.611 --> 01:48:44.220
that they credit him with inventing the Darce choke.
There's a,

2044
01:48:44.330 --> 01:48:46.060
there's a choke that,
uh,
uh,

2045
01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:51.140
Joe DRC is famous for because mayhem Miller got caught in it by Joe DRC and they

2046
01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:54.000
brought it back and they started calling it the Darce choke.

2047
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:55.500
And I talked about it during the podcast,

2048
01:48:55.740 --> 01:48:59.970
but apparently what I've been informed since I said this during the broadcast is

2049
01:48:59.971 --> 01:49:02.500
that Donna her actually invented this choke that he,

2050
01:49:02.501 --> 01:49:05.760
he figured it out and he's the one who showed at the DRC and DRC showed at the

2051
01:49:05.770 --> 01:49:08.370
mayhem.
So Donna,
you know,

2052
01:49:08.430 --> 01:49:11.910
he's a legend in fighting a legend in like,

2053
01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:14.340
he doesn't fight himself cause he's got a fucked up name,

2054
01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:17.310
but he's a legend amongst Jujitsu circles for being like one of the baddest

2055
01:49:17.311 --> 01:49:21.270
motherfuckers to deal with.
Well,
his theories are exactly,

2056
01:49:21.271 --> 01:49:25.470
they mirror my theories when it comes to MMA and it's the theory that they

2057
01:49:25.471 --> 01:49:29.190
espoused when coaching this,
this,
uh,
show the ultimate fighter.
They're like,

2058
01:49:29.370 --> 01:49:32.270
fuck all this.
Trying to be the toughest,
you know,

2059
01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:37.280
guy trying to run up hills the hardest and throw bags of sand around the

2060
01:49:38.371 --> 01:49:41.400
hardest.
No,
what's most important is your technique.

2061
01:49:41.490 --> 01:49:45.270
The technique has to be the most important and it's not mental toughness.

2062
01:49:45.271 --> 01:49:48.030
It's not your ability to,
you know,
hold your breath underwater,

2063
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.460
<v 5>holding onto rocks.
It's technique,
technique and training.
That tech,</v>

2064
01:49:51.490 --> 01:49:55.240
that technique at a furious pace and you'll develop or how to fight you.

2065
01:49:55.800 --> 01:49:59.290
How do you learn?
You learn,
you grow with the Gen tool,

2066
01:49:59.291 --> 01:50:02.110
what you're running up a hill.
That's something I've never,
it's great.

2067
01:50:02.111 --> 01:50:04.750
Conditioning is great.
There's something to strengthen,

2068
01:50:04.751 --> 01:50:07.720
conditioning to prevent injuries and to give you a certain amount of strength to

2069
01:50:07.721 --> 01:50:10.360
a certain amount of power to,
to utilize those techniques.

2070
01:50:10.510 --> 01:50:13.390
But when you get past that technique is the most important time.
So,

2071
01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:15.770
and these guys,
you know,
this Donna,

2072
01:50:15.771 --> 01:50:19.120
her guy like talking to him just reinforces in my eyes the,

2073
01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:23.860
the importance of a super dedicated coach.
Like a guy like him,
you know,

2074
01:50:23.861 --> 01:50:26.340
a guy who camera down like Craig Jackson,
especially Don,
I'm,

2075
01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:28.600
I'm a big fan of his as Anna and Greg's,

2076
01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:32.260
those guys are huge for fighter's career.
You know,

2077
01:50:32.261 --> 01:50:36.460
to find a wise guy who is in that role.
He's not,

2078
01:50:36.490 --> 01:50:40.090
he can't compete.
He's guy.
He was born with a fucked up Nate.
Like he literally,

2079
01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:43.200
he can't like do strength and conditioning shade.
He can't run his,

2080
01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:45.310
his knees fucked up.
You probably can't take kicks in it.

2081
01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:47.020
So he's not going to be fighting.

2082
01:50:47.021 --> 01:50:50.050
But he's fascinated by and he's fascinated by it as a science.

2083
01:50:50.051 --> 01:50:52.890
Just like you'd be fascinated by chess as a science.

2084
01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:54.100
And that's how he breaks it down.

2085
01:50:54.330 --> 01:50:57.400
Say it's not about toughness or ego or any silliness like that.

2086
01:50:57.580 --> 01:51:00.700
It's all just about executing the perfect technique and strategies.

2087
01:51:00.730 --> 01:51:03.010
You watch the ultimate final last week.
Yes.

2088
01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:06.350
They had a knuckle head on there and he walks around and he tough.

2089
01:51:06.351 --> 01:51:09.640
But then the other guy or it'd be says avoid his fucking guilty.
Yep.

2090
01:51:09.940 --> 01:51:14.070
Did you see what [inaudible] just dove in on the fucking Giliad's?
Yeah.
Well,

2091
01:51:14.071 --> 01:51:17.740
it's cause the kid came wild at him and he just forced him into his habits.

2092
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:19.990
Do you think that that kick could beat the fuck out of me,

2093
01:51:20.170 --> 01:51:23.240
that kid with the guillotine because I got kids,
got a nasty guy.

2094
01:51:23.590 --> 01:51:25.810
Well he's got a weird way of holding it to absolutely.

2095
01:51:25.850 --> 01:51:28.090
He doesn't hold it like a normal guy does.

2096
01:51:28.120 --> 01:51:32.650
He like turns it so that the back of the palm is facing the face and he pushes

2097
01:51:32.651 --> 01:51:36.740
down on it and it kind of closes off both sides of the net quicker.
I'm,

2098
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:40.960
I'm fucking around with it.
A lot of guys did.
Nate Diaz did that to um,
uh,

2099
01:51:41.710 --> 01:51:45.950
the fuck did you find God dammit Irish hangry named Marcus Davis.

2100
01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:50.260
He did that same technique to Marcus Davis.
He pushes his knuckles.
It pushes,

2101
01:51:50.261 --> 01:51:53.680
like grabs a hold of his hand and pushes his hand towards the neck and then

2102
01:51:53.681 --> 01:51:56.460
that's how it closes it off.
It's like,
that's the thing about Jujitsu man.

2103
01:51:56.470 --> 01:52:00.130
Car guys are constantly coming up with new variations to techniques,

2104
01:52:00.131 --> 01:52:03.940
constantly adding new ways to do it.
[inaudible] you will have variations.
Yeah,

2105
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:05.830
position's going away.
You can't learn it all man.

2106
01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:08.770
And it's like that's like there's,
every guy has a different kind of style.

2107
01:52:08.771 --> 01:52:10.180
Like some guys always have the newest,

2108
01:52:10.181 --> 01:52:12.940
craziest moves and they have this giant encyclopedia of boobs they can hit you

2109
01:52:12.941 --> 01:52:13.290
with.

2110
01:52:13.290 --> 01:52:16.450
And then there's other guys that only like hit a certain amount of moves all the

2111
01:52:16.451 --> 01:52:17.470
time.
Like they go for arm,

2112
01:52:17.471 --> 01:52:20.380
triangle chokes armbar they have like three or four moves,

2113
01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:23.350
you know that they only go to off their back.
They have like armbar triangle.

2114
01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:26.350
That's it.
There's just only moves they go to.
But they're nasty.
Adam,

2115
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:30.370
you know like Nogueira know Garret doesn't do like crazy wild stuff.

2116
01:52:30.490 --> 01:52:35.110
His Jujitsu is like old school Hicks and Gracie style Jujitsu.

2117
01:52:35.110 --> 01:52:38.920
It's like the real traditional Jujitsu.
But everything he does he does perfect.

2118
01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.620
You know what I'm saying?
Like everything is perfect technique.
Like,

2119
01:52:41.860 --> 01:52:43.740
like I don't see no guera doin,

2120
01:52:43.810 --> 01:52:48.710
you know any crazy like Gogo Plata rubber guard sweep shit.

2121
01:52:48.740 --> 01:52:51.860
Like he's going to just tap you a triangles TAPI with armbars.

2122
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:54.590
You know what I'm saying?
Tap.
You would give teens,
get your back,
choke you out,

2123
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:57.530
all like the standard stuff.
Like how'd your Gracie,
same thing.

2124
01:52:57.531 --> 01:53:01.730
All the standard standard moves.
They just hold them to a science,
you know?

2125
01:53:01.940 --> 01:53:04.730
So there's two schools of thought.
Like Hixon Gracie is a perfect example,

2126
01:53:04.820 --> 01:53:08.450
widely recognized as the greatest Jujitsu guy ever.
Everybody says that,

2127
01:53:08.570 --> 01:53:11.750
but Hixon Gracie's traditional Jujitsu,
that's what he hits you with.

2128
01:53:11.751 --> 01:53:13.940
He doesn't hit you with some crazy moves you never saw before.

2129
01:53:14.120 --> 01:53:18.320
He just goes through remove,
perfect.
He knows everyone,
he knows everything,

2130
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:23.240
but his Jujitsu is all very standard old school Jujitsu.

2131
01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:26.840
He's just perfect at it.
Everything he does is perfect technique,

2132
01:53:26.841 --> 01:53:28.910
perfect position.
He's been there a billion times.

2133
01:53:28.911 --> 01:53:31.880
It's a part of his DNA and everybody says the same thing.

2134
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:34.580
You don't even know what the Fuck Jujitsu is until your role with Hickson.

2135
01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:37.850
They say he just,
he just takes it to another level.
He goes,
it's just,

2136
01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:41.360
you realize like there's levels to this game and you think you know what the

2137
01:53:41.361 --> 01:53:44.180
levels are until you roll with the guy like Hickson and just realize this

2138
01:53:44.181 --> 01:53:47.630
motherfucker.
No,
it's exactly what to do.
Every time you move a certain way,

2139
01:53:47.631 --> 01:53:51.300
he knows exactly how to respond and he does it effortlessly and you,

2140
01:53:51.301 --> 01:53:52.460
you feel like you're a child.

2141
01:53:52.490 --> 01:53:55.170
You feel like you just learn how to do this and you getting strangled me more.

2142
01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:57.980
You've been putting in 10 years,
you've been going to the gym three,

2143
01:53:57.981 --> 01:54:02.240
four days a week for 10 years,
sweating your ass off,
doing fucking running hills,

2144
01:54:02.241 --> 01:54:05.380
doing kettlebell drills.
You're like,
I'm a bad mother fucker.
You're like,

2145
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:08.090
I'm 28 years old.
I did a cycle of antiviral.
Where's Hickson?

2146
01:54:08.420 --> 01:54:11.300
And your role with them and you just kept the rolled around like a little baby,

2147
01:54:11.570 --> 01:54:14.490
like a little baby.
You don't even know what the fuck's going on.
All techniques.

2148
01:54:14.500 --> 01:54:17.150
So say you don't feel any of his strength.
You don't even feel a strength.

2149
01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:17.931
You don't feel it.

2150
01:54:17.931 --> 01:54:20.390
It's just all of sudden he's mounted on you and you can't shake them off and try

2151
01:54:20.391 --> 01:54:21.830
to shake them off.
He counters that shake.

2152
01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.050
He's all of a sudden got an arm trapped and you're trying to fight that arm.

2153
01:54:24.051 --> 01:54:26.990
All of sudden you're in a triangle.
It's like it just boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

2154
01:54:26.991 --> 01:54:27.980
And then he tapped and you're like,

2155
01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:31.670
I don't even feel like he got tired and even break a sweat.
You're exhausted.

2156
01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:36.170
You just fought for your fucking life against some ever,
ever moving anaconda.

2157
01:54:36.171 --> 01:54:39.380
That's figuring out some new way to cut off your blood.
And then boom,

2158
01:54:39.410 --> 01:54:42.680
tap and you have to tap and then you just humiliated and you start back from

2159
01:54:42.681 --> 01:54:43.514
scratch.

2160
01:54:43.770 --> 01:54:47.200
<v 2>Can make tick technique,</v>

2161
01:54:47.230 --> 01:54:51.880
brother technique and your technique.
Never fucking sponsor that.

2162
01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:54.970
Came to the flex flashlight,
flashlight,
flashlight,
flashlight.

2163
01:54:55.060 --> 01:54:56.980
Check him out like I said.

2164
01:54:57.250 --> 01:55:00.160
And when you put ice cubes in there and then you put a little bit of fucking

2165
01:55:00.161 --> 01:55:03.190
common there and then you put up the sauce in this and when you fucking did you

2166
01:55:03.191 --> 01:55:05.180
get the APP,
the Seltzer on your helmet.
Wait a minute,
wait.

2167
01:55:05.181 --> 01:55:07.510
And you get to the ice cube effect from outside your helmet.

2168
01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:11.110
You coming in and then you fucking,
I don't have this in my house,

2169
01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:14.760
I'm just trying to have one for you.
It's a blue one penalty.

2170
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:18.490
I'm not gonna fuck nothing like that.
I don't like bored.
I'm just,

2171
01:55:18.491 --> 01:55:19.291
I just have ideas.

2172
01:55:19.291 --> 01:55:22.540
You still even beat out how often you beat off on a regular basis?
Once a week.

2173
01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:25.360
Once a week.
Really?
That's it.
Wow.

2174
01:55:26.260 --> 01:55:30.820
Why don't you do it more for what Brian wants to,
wants to hear stories now.

2175
01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.440
What did you do at two today?
Digging on the beat on.
Yeah.
Big on it.
No,

2176
01:55:35.710 --> 01:55:39.400
I feel fucking guilty.
It's always a sad feeling.

2177
01:55:39.490 --> 01:55:43.910
It's very sad when you'd beat off the club and make believe this strip is going

2178
01:55:43.911 --> 01:55:44.020
to

2179
01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:46.080
<v 5>meet you at Denny's afterwards.
You know what I'm saying?</v>

2180
01:55:46.081 --> 01:55:48.840
I ain't never going to happen and he never gonna fucking happen.

2181
01:55:48.841 --> 01:55:50.730
You always get that one of the adult in this go to Daddy.

2182
01:55:50.731 --> 01:55:53.940
She said she's going to meet me.
Fuck that little bit again to meet you.

2183
01:55:53.941 --> 01:55:57.630
What's up,
right?
That game son has to get the game.

2184
01:55:57.690 --> 01:56:01.830
Have you ever dated a girl that her phone has emergency porn videos just in case

2185
01:56:01.831 --> 01:56:04.350
that she doesn't have internet and she asked him masturbate?
No,

2186
01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:07.640
that's disgusting.
For real history.
Does that,

2187
01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:12.510
do you think she wants the world to know this?
Oh,
I don't know.
Probably not.
Yeah,

2188
01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:17.480
that seems like you just ratted her out bro.
Wow.

2189
01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:20.250
I got some chicks get crazy with the porn though.
They love it.

2190
01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:22.560
There's other girls that are offended by pouring some chicks,

2191
01:56:22.561 --> 01:56:25.650
get offended some chicks and get crazy with it.
It's a weird thing,
huh?

2192
01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:28.470
It's a weird thing.
Some girls think you need it like,
oh,

2193
01:56:28.471 --> 01:56:29.710
you need it to keep a relationship.

2194
01:56:29.711 --> 01:56:32.940
So there was a girl that I dated in high school and then,
uh,

2195
01:56:32.970 --> 01:56:34.530

Jesus Christ vaporized weed is something so different to me.

2248
01:59:20.411 --> 01:59:24.520
I can't smoke a lot of it.
I,

2249
01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:28.240

2251
01:59:32.621 --> 01:59:36.010
I can't keep up with the thoughts.
It's like they're coming too fast.

2252

it's just moving along too fast.

2257
01:59:54.010 --> 01:59:57.340
It's like there's a river of fish swimming by me and they're all little and I'm

2258
01:59:57.341 --> 01:59:59.440
trying to grab handfuls of them.

I'm writing for Pro mma.com with my med Joe.

2274
02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:52.900
You need to do fuck all this writing.

2275
02:00:52.930 --> 02:00:55.720
They just need to get a camera and turn it on you and have you talk and put it

2276
02:00:55.721 --> 02:00:59.530
on.
But as a video blog,

02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:00.250
Don't worry about,

2278
02:01:00.250 --> 02:01:03.220
I know you love writing the dude to what you've got to do with my life,

2279
02:01:03.221 --> 02:01:06.470
but if they really want to get the most out of this,

2280
02:01:07.160 --> 02:01:11.180
all you got to do is roll that number.
