00:00:00.552 --> 00:00:02.777
- I ordered a portion of the doner.

00:00:02.777 --> 00:00:06.390
Oh and I'm gonna make it
a bite that, that counts.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.109
Ho ho ho ho look at that.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.359
Just get a closeup on that.

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:15.414
Oh wow.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.223
That's like caramelized beef.

00:00:17.223 --> 00:00:19.806
(upbeat music)

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:23.314
Good morning everyone.

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:26.598
It's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com.

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:29.632
Ying and I are riding
in style this morning.

00:00:29.632 --> 00:00:34.145
We ordered an Uber and
this is our last morning.

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:37.078
We are leaving in the
middle of the day to go

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:39.725
to fly to Rome today but
we thought we could fit in

00:00:39.725 --> 00:00:41.253
one last meal.

00:00:41.253 --> 00:00:43.836
(techno music)

00:00:44.697 --> 00:00:47.570
- We've taken Uber a couple
times so far in Istanbul

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.576
and they are really nice vehicles.

00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:52.229
We always have gotten a Mercedes van.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.812
(techno music)

00:00:57.762 --> 00:00:59.230
That thing is the most...

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.063
- Hello.

00:01:01.298 --> 00:01:05.465
(customers chatter in foreign language)

00:01:19.395 --> 00:01:20.563
- We arrived to this restaurant.

00:01:20.563 --> 00:01:21.918
They are now open.

00:01:21.918 --> 00:01:25.323
And a lot of people order
takeaway and just stay downstairs

00:01:25.323 --> 00:01:27.591
and get takeaway but they also
have a dining room up here

00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:29.140
on the second floor.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.240
And I was just watching him carve and work

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.500
that piece of meat, that's okay.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.064
And I was just watching him
downstairs work and carve

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:42.647
that piece, that hunk,
that circle of meat,

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:46.369
and it literally it's
like a merry-go-round

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.836
or a ferris wheel of a doner kebab.

00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:52.336
It's so thick and so gigantic.

00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.679
It's like an entire animal of meat

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.478
or maybe multiple animals of meat

00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:02.046
just rearranged and stacked
in a different shape.

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:03.429
It is literally,

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.363
and I took a really closeup
look at that meat, and...

00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:09.625
If you look at it really closely

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:12.604
because of all the drippings
and all of the juices,

00:02:12.604 --> 00:02:15.897
all of the fats and oils
flowing from the meat,

00:02:15.897 --> 00:02:18.273
it actually looks almost like a cave.

00:02:18.273 --> 00:02:21.800
You can actually see little
stalagmites and stalactites

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.635
comin' off of the doner kebab.

00:02:23.635 --> 00:02:25.759
As I'm sitting here
anticipating that doner

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:28.542
that is just about to arrive to our table,

00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:31.454
I got this recommendation from Tuba.

00:02:31.454 --> 00:02:34.531
She is a blogger over at IstanbulFood.com.

00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:35.918
Check out her blog.

00:02:35.918 --> 00:02:37.466
And also from FoodieHub.

00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:42.092
She's the FoodieHub.tv
representative for Istanbul.

00:02:42.092 --> 00:02:46.406
So she says this is the
absolute best hands down doner

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:47.989
in all of Istanbul.

00:02:48.946 --> 00:02:50.176
Oh here it comes.

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:51.159
- [Waiter] Iskender?

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.018
- Oh Iskender, okay.

00:02:53.018 --> 00:02:54.818
I ordered two different things.

00:02:54.818 --> 00:02:59.318
One is the iskender which
is something beautiful.

00:02:59.318 --> 00:03:02.730
And the other is just a,
I got a plate of doner.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.842
So this is just a plate
of the thinly shaved meat

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:10.015
that he so expertly sliced
off of the merry-go-round.

00:03:10.015 --> 00:03:13.711
And you can see that little
slight char on the outside.

00:03:13.711 --> 00:03:16.228
The thin shavings of meat.

00:03:16.228 --> 00:03:18.427
There's nothing I can
do but just take a bite

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:20.186
and that first bite right there.

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:24.172
Oh and I'm gonna make it
a bite that, that counts.

00:03:24.172 --> 00:03:25.937
Ho ho ho ho look at that.

00:03:25.937 --> 00:03:28.187
Just get a closeup on that.

00:03:38.345 --> 00:03:39.178
Oh yeah.

00:03:41.305 --> 00:03:42.638
That is a doner.

00:03:45.126 --> 00:03:48.406
Oh wow, it's like perfectly salted.

00:03:48.406 --> 00:03:51.489
It is kind of juicy but slightly like

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.985
dry at the same time.

00:03:54.985 --> 00:03:57.874
And that crispy bit on the edge.

00:03:57.874 --> 00:03:59.908
That's like caramelized beef.

00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:02.517
The other dish I wasn't gonna
leave Istanbul without trying.

00:04:02.517 --> 00:04:07.343
This is called iskender and
this is the same doner meat

00:04:07.343 --> 00:04:11.510
but then I think it's tomato
sauce and butter and cream.

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.718
I think those are the
extra ingredients added

00:04:14.718 --> 00:04:16.274
to make things even better.

00:04:16.274 --> 00:04:17.886
So this will be my first time.

00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:21.229
I'll try a little bit
of cream, a bit of meat.

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.969
Oh and there might be some
extra vegetables in here, too?

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:24.820
Maybe?

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.403
Or mostly tomatoes.

00:04:31.827 --> 00:04:32.660
Wow.

00:04:33.908 --> 00:04:35.607
That is rich.

00:04:35.607 --> 00:04:37.088
I didn't notice this at first.

00:04:37.088 --> 00:04:39.082
There's bread on the bottom here, too.

00:04:39.082 --> 00:04:43.094
Which has soaked up all
of that butter and sauce.

00:04:43.094 --> 00:04:46.595
And so it was almost like
a crouton below there.

00:04:46.595 --> 00:04:48.880
And then all the meat is on top.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.579
That extremely good meat.

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:54.836
And then I think that has
a yogurt flavor to it.

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:59.003
It's like sour, creamy and
then with tomato, buttery.

00:04:59.948 --> 00:05:02.973
Wow that's just, that is insane.

00:05:02.973 --> 00:05:06.140
Okay I'm gonna take a sip of my ayran.

00:05:09.044 --> 00:05:11.767
Wow, that tastes almost the same

00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:13.767
as that blob of white...

00:05:15.126 --> 00:05:16.370
Yogurt, I think?

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.999
On top of the iskender.

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:22.427
That is really really thick
and not too salty this time

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:25.116
but it has a sour, a
sour yogurt taste to it.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.177
And this is their specialty bread here

00:05:27.177 --> 00:05:28.689
in the shape of a heart.

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:30.892
This actually, bread looks fantastic.

00:05:30.892 --> 00:05:35.058
Oh wow, yeah that's like
really puffy but you can see

00:05:35.058 --> 00:05:39.761
it's kinda, maybe it will
be kinda gummy as well.

00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:41.511
This meat is amazing.

00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:48.228
Stick it into the center
there with a chili.

00:05:55.007 --> 00:05:57.637
Bread does have a little
bit of a gummy texture to it

00:05:57.637 --> 00:06:00.220
but it's like fluffy and gooey.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.757
I'm going to put some
of this into my bread.

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.177
And with a little bit of that as well.

00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:14.148
Oh I've gotta have that chili.

00:06:14.148 --> 00:06:16.164
Gotta have that chili on there.

00:06:16.164 --> 00:06:17.415
Is this a one biter?

00:06:17.415 --> 00:06:18.998
I think it will be.

00:06:21.753 --> 00:06:24.336
(Ying giggles)

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.924
The best doner I have ever, I've ever had.

00:06:27.924 --> 00:06:28.757
- Okay.

00:06:28.757 --> 00:06:29.757
- Thank you.

00:06:36.204 --> 00:06:37.572
It set the new standard for me.

00:06:37.572 --> 00:06:39.097
I've never had a doner this good.

00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:40.353
It was incredible.

00:06:40.353 --> 00:06:42.924
That merry-go-round of meat

00:06:42.924 --> 00:06:45.275
that you see at the entrance will,

00:06:45.275 --> 00:06:47.623
is the first thing that will impress you.

00:06:47.623 --> 00:06:50.366
And then eating it, it
will just blow your mind.

00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:51.475
It was so good.

00:06:51.475 --> 00:06:53.236
And also the owner,

00:06:53.236 --> 00:06:55.604
and they are really
really nice here as well.

00:06:55.604 --> 00:06:58.321
Friendly and jolly as well.

00:06:58.321 --> 00:06:59.662
That was delicious.

00:06:59.662 --> 00:07:03.617
I am happy this was our
final last meal in Istanbul.

00:07:03.617 --> 00:07:05.276
And also thank you to Tuba.

00:07:05.276 --> 00:07:07.792
(car honks)

00:07:07.792 --> 00:07:08.760
- [Ying] Hello.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.992
- [Mark] Thank you!

00:07:09.992 --> 00:07:12.575
(techno music)

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:16.623
We've packed up all of our stuff

00:07:16.623 --> 00:07:20.040
and we are checking out at the hotel now.

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:23.582
Hello.

00:07:23.582 --> 00:07:24.415
- Hello, sir.

00:07:24.415 --> 00:07:25.248
I'm sorry.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.431
- Alright, okay.

00:07:29.431 --> 00:07:30.264
Ah it's okay I'll hold it.

00:07:30.264 --> 00:07:31.987
So, thank you.

00:07:31.987 --> 00:07:33.654
Thank you very much.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.987
We are in a taxi on our
way to the airport now.

00:07:38.987 --> 00:07:40.319
Thank you to the Ritz-Carlton.

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:41.912
That was a great stay.

00:07:41.912 --> 00:07:45.089
I'm gonna miss that view over
the Bosphorus that's for sure.

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:47.672
(techno music)

00:08:04.292 --> 00:08:05.932
We made it to the airport.

00:08:05.932 --> 00:08:08.805
Now looking for our counter to check in.

00:08:08.805 --> 00:08:11.722
We're flying with Turkish Airlines.

00:08:13.347 --> 00:08:16.479
The lady who just checked us
in was really really nice.

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:19.062
(techno music)

00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:30.313
Okay, we got all checked into our flight.

00:08:30.313 --> 00:08:32.329
We got through Customs and Immigration

00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:35.128
and we have just now checked in

00:08:35.128 --> 00:08:37.637
to the Turkish Airlines lounge.

00:08:37.637 --> 00:08:39.304
This lounge is huge.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.018
What did you get you?

00:08:42.018 --> 00:08:44.028
- Cake chocolate and hot chocolate.

00:08:44.028 --> 00:08:44.861
(giggles)

00:08:44.861 --> 00:08:46.992
(Mark laughs)

00:08:46.992 --> 00:08:49.316
- But the lines at the
airport are really long.

00:08:49.316 --> 00:08:51.611
Security is very very tight.

00:08:51.611 --> 00:08:56.412
And so well of course I'm
excited to fly business class.

00:08:56.412 --> 00:08:59.273
Any, anytime or any chance I have.

00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:02.287
Today it's a really really good thing

00:09:02.287 --> 00:09:05.526
because we just passed
through the fast lane

00:09:05.526 --> 00:09:07.741
and got into the lounge really quickly.

00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:08.624
Thank you very much

00:09:08.624 --> 00:09:12.405
to Star Alliance and Turkish
Airlines for, for this.

00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:14.683
And if you're just joining
me on these videos,

00:09:14.683 --> 00:09:17.505
or about this round the
world trip for food.

00:09:17.505 --> 00:09:21.464
This entire trip was put
together by Star Alliance

00:09:21.464 --> 00:09:23.904
and Star Alliance is
sponsoring this airfare.

00:09:23.904 --> 00:09:27.481
And so we are on our way next to Rome.

00:09:27.481 --> 00:09:30.616
We have a couple hours in
the airline lounge here

00:09:30.616 --> 00:09:32.534
and I'm gonna spend it doin' some work

00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:34.270
but also taking advantage

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.346
of all of the things to eat and drink.

00:09:37.346 --> 00:09:41.631
Oh this is like a racing
game or something.

00:09:41.631 --> 00:09:42.518
Yes, please.

00:09:42.518 --> 00:09:43.351
Manti?

00:09:43.351 --> 00:09:44.642
Is it called Manti?
- Yes, man.

00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:45.475
- [Mark] Yes, please.

00:09:45.475 --> 00:09:46.500
- [Server] Small? (speaks
in foreign language)

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.709
- Ah, just one bowl.

00:09:47.709 --> 00:09:49.209
Nomo bowl is okay.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.833
(dishes clinking)

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.583
Thank you.

00:10:01.577 --> 00:10:04.160
(techno music)

00:10:14.485 --> 00:10:16.272
There are so many things to eat.

00:10:16.272 --> 00:10:17.744
So many little stations.

00:10:17.744 --> 00:10:19.093
So many bars.

00:10:19.093 --> 00:10:21.001
There is one dish that I haven't,

00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:23.090
or a Turkish dish that I
haven't had a chance to try yet

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.173
on this trip.

00:10:24.173 --> 00:10:27.067
And that is Manti, which
is Turkish-style ravioli

00:10:27.067 --> 00:10:29.344
and I also got a selection of drinks.

00:10:29.344 --> 00:10:32.926
So the ravioli are all down
here and then she put on,

00:10:32.926 --> 00:10:36.009
I think it's yogurt and tomato sauce.

00:10:39.664 --> 00:10:42.103
Mmmmmm, that yogurt makes
it really really rich.

00:10:42.103 --> 00:10:44.361
But yeah those are little noodle pockets

00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:47.681
of some kind of minced meat in the middle.

00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:48.537
That is good.

00:10:48.537 --> 00:10:52.120
That, that yogurt though
is extremely rich.

00:10:54.476 --> 00:10:55.309
Okay, coffee?

00:10:55.309 --> 00:10:56.559
Turkish coffee.

00:11:01.206 --> 00:11:04.023
Oh yeah, that's good stuff.

00:11:04.023 --> 00:11:06.690
(soda tab pops)

00:11:08.224 --> 00:11:09.057
Ahhhhhh.

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:16.962
I'm gonna have to admit
to you that I have been,

00:11:16.962 --> 00:11:18.330
well, you've probably already seen

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:21.294
but I've gone pretty
heavy on the meat so far

00:11:21.294 --> 00:11:22.805
since being in Turkey.

00:11:22.805 --> 00:11:26.472
And so, I'm really ready
for a lot of salad.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:29.562
And lentil soup.

00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:37.708
Like I've mentioned this probably
already a couple of times,

00:11:37.708 --> 00:11:41.217
Istanbul is a city that I've
wanted to visit my entire life.

00:11:41.217 --> 00:11:45.339
And despite the circumstances
during this trip,

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:47.527
it was still an amazing trip.

00:11:47.527 --> 00:11:51.545
The history that we got
to see here, the food,

00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:54.573
and then just meeting so
many of the restaurant owners

00:11:54.573 --> 00:11:56.307
and people working at the restaurants

00:11:56.307 --> 00:11:59.279
that we met and interacted with.

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:02.626
That is what I think
traveling is all about.

00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:04.709
And Istanbul was amazing.

00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:08.493
- [Airline Agent] Gate passengers,

00:12:08.493 --> 00:12:12.477
would you please proceed
to gate number 306.

00:12:12.477 --> 00:12:15.060
(techno music)

00:12:24.751 --> 00:12:28.113
- It's gonna be about a two
and a half hour flight to Rome.

00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:29.861
I think I'm gonna watch a movie.

00:12:29.861 --> 00:12:32.444
(techno music)

00:12:40.099 --> 00:12:42.432
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:12:44.445 --> 00:12:45.278
- [Flight Attendant] Enjoy your meal.

00:12:45.278 --> 00:12:46.543
- Thank you.

00:12:46.543 --> 00:12:48.903
It is early dinner time.

00:12:48.903 --> 00:12:52.311
And this is just the first salad course.

00:12:52.311 --> 00:12:53.895
There are tomatoes and mozzarella

00:12:53.895 --> 00:12:57.643
and I think that's some
kind of avocado puree.

00:12:57.643 --> 00:12:59.630
I'm not sure what's on the bottom.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.714
And then a number of different salads.

00:13:02.714 --> 00:13:06.197
Whoa, got a lotta, got a
lotta silverware in here.

00:13:06.197 --> 00:13:08.114
Okay here we go, spoon.

00:13:09.067 --> 00:13:11.658
Let me try some of this avocado.

00:13:11.658 --> 00:13:14.908
Oh I think that's avocado and eggplant.

00:13:16.553 --> 00:13:17.386
Mmmmm.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.658
Yeah, that's avocado and eggplant.

00:13:21.658 --> 00:13:25.491
Tomato and mozzarella,
or some kind of cheese.

00:13:30.004 --> 00:13:32.651
Yeah that's really good.

00:13:32.651 --> 00:13:34.761
The fresh mozzarella.

00:13:34.761 --> 00:13:35.594
Pepper.

00:13:44.284 --> 00:13:48.355
I have to tell you that Ying
ate so much in the lounge

00:13:48.355 --> 00:13:50.271
that she's not hungry at all.

00:13:50.271 --> 00:13:52.259
And so she gave me her entree.

00:13:52.259 --> 00:13:53.399
So I got two entrees here.

00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.356
This one is the poached fish

00:13:55.356 --> 00:13:58.533
and then this one is the adana kebab.

00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:02.103
And so one last kebab
before leaving Turkey.

00:14:02.103 --> 00:14:04.404
Okay I'll start with this fish though.

00:14:04.404 --> 00:14:07.889
Poached fish, there are a
bunch of vegetables down here.

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.806
And eggplant and zucchini, I think.

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:13.289
And tomatoes.

00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:15.368
Oh (laughs) just fell out.

00:14:15.368 --> 00:14:16.201
Okay.

00:14:18.193 --> 00:14:20.613
And the menu says that it's sea bass.

00:14:20.613 --> 00:14:21.993
That is good fish.

00:14:21.993 --> 00:14:23.576
And one last kebab.

00:14:30.313 --> 00:14:35.122
Oh yeah, kebabs are just
definitely a gift to the world.

00:14:35.122 --> 00:14:37.040
- [Chef] Milk and sugar inside?

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.873
- Black coffee.
- Just black.

00:14:37.873 --> 00:14:39.956
- [Mark] Just black, yes.

00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:49.013
- For you, sir, black coffee.

00:14:49.013 --> 00:14:49.894
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:14:49.894 --> 00:14:51.927
- [Chef] Thank you.

00:14:51.927 --> 00:14:53.317
This is your Turkish coffee.

00:14:53.317 --> 00:14:54.315
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:14:54.315 --> 00:14:55.691
- [Chef] And, you're water.

00:14:55.691 --> 00:14:56.925
- [Mark] Oh, yes.

00:14:56.925 --> 00:14:58.103
- [Chef] I'll take this and...

00:14:58.103 --> 00:14:59.103
- Thank you.

00:14:59.964 --> 00:15:00.797
Okay.

00:15:00.797 --> 00:15:03.610
And to end the meal I'm
having two cups of coffee.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.372
Got a regular cup of coffee
and a Turkish coffee.

00:15:07.372 --> 00:15:09.360
Let me start with the Turkish coffee.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.511
Oh, there's a bit of turbulence right now

00:15:11.511 --> 00:15:14.844
so it is, it is a shaking cup of coffee.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.543
Oh yeah.

00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:21.891
Turkish coffee, a fantastic thing.

00:15:21.891 --> 00:15:23.974
The other type of coffee.

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:30.818
Yeah that is just a straight
brewed cup of coffee.

00:15:30.818 --> 00:15:33.805
And also on the Turkish coffee plate

00:15:33.805 --> 00:15:34.735
they gave me a little piece,

00:15:34.735 --> 00:15:36.559
I think this is Turkish Delight,

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:38.781
and I didn't really have a
chance to try Turkish Delight

00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:40.249
when we were in Istanbul.

00:15:40.249 --> 00:15:43.251
We didn't make it to the
famous Turkish Delight place.

00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:44.584
Turkish Delight.

00:15:48.982 --> 00:15:52.560
Yeah, that is very gummy and sweet.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.143
(techno music)

00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:11.868
(flight attendant speaks
in foreign language)

00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:19.284
Thank you very much, Veli.
- Have a good day.

00:16:19.284 --> 00:16:22.099
- Thank you, thank you very much.

00:16:22.099 --> 00:16:24.454
That was a very good flight.

00:16:24.454 --> 00:16:26.793
Thank you very much Turkish Airlines

00:16:26.793 --> 00:16:28.960
and also Veli and Porcini.

00:16:32.231 --> 00:16:35.371
(techno music)

00:16:35.371 --> 00:16:38.322
I love how Turkish Airlines has a chef

00:16:38.322 --> 00:16:41.697
on the business class airplane.

00:16:41.697 --> 00:16:43.604
They have their priorities right.

00:16:43.604 --> 00:16:44.728
Welcome to Italy.

00:16:44.728 --> 00:16:47.311
(techno music)

00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:52.681
Bus station.

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:56.171
We made it through Customs and Immigration

00:16:56.171 --> 00:16:59.067
and got our bags in like record time.

00:16:59.067 --> 00:17:01.218
I think it's only been like ten minutes

00:17:01.218 --> 00:17:02.684
since we got off our flight.

00:17:02.684 --> 00:17:05.629
There are a number of different
ways to get from the airport

00:17:05.629 --> 00:17:07.183
to the center of Rome.

00:17:07.183 --> 00:17:08.767
But I think we're gonna go for the bus.

00:17:08.767 --> 00:17:11.350
(techno music)

00:17:15.922 --> 00:17:17.190
That was fairly simple.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:19.350
You just walk outside of Terminal Three

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.541
and walk all the way
to the right hand side

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.203
and then we just bought our bus ticket.

00:17:24.203 --> 00:17:26.786
(techno music)

00:17:35.998 --> 00:17:38.402
That bus ride just took about 30 minutes.

00:17:38.402 --> 00:17:41.217
We have arrived to Termini Station

00:17:41.217 --> 00:17:44.517
where I think we're gonna
take the Metro two stops

00:17:44.517 --> 00:17:46.887
and that will be closer to
our hotel where we're staying.

00:17:46.887 --> 00:17:49.470
(techno music)

00:18:03.521 --> 00:18:05.783
We are just stepping out of the Metro

00:18:05.783 --> 00:18:08.545
and we're very close to a park.

00:18:08.545 --> 00:18:11.916
And immediately I could just
smell like the aroma of herbs.

00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:14.499
(techno music)

00:18:20.246 --> 00:18:22.460
Whoa, a lot of mirrors.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.466
What's our number?

00:18:23.466 --> 00:18:25.115
- Something high, vee.

00:18:25.115 --> 00:18:26.948
- Oh, it's right here.

00:18:31.265 --> 00:18:32.682
Alright, come in.

00:18:33.844 --> 00:18:35.502
We got all checked in to our hotel.

00:18:35.502 --> 00:18:37.658
We are staying at the Marriott

00:18:37.658 --> 00:18:40.575
and just getting into our room now.

00:18:42.557 --> 00:18:44.974
How do you turn on the light?

00:18:46.912 --> 00:18:47.745
Ohhhhhh.

00:18:52.977 --> 00:18:55.859
Okay Ying I'm gonna do a
quick tour walkthrough.

00:18:55.859 --> 00:18:57.908
It's about 9 p.m. so I
don't think we're gonna

00:18:57.908 --> 00:18:59.661
do anything else for today.

00:18:59.661 --> 00:19:02.199
Probably just gonna call it a night here

00:19:02.199 --> 00:19:04.216
and wake up early tomorrow

00:19:04.216 --> 00:19:06.590
and start a full day
of sightseeing in Rome.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:09.541
But let me just give you a
really quick tour of this room.

00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:12.161
Have a desk over here in this corner.

00:19:12.161 --> 00:19:14.940
The big bed right in the center.

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:16.580
The TV.

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:17.580
The cabinet.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.817
And then moving on over here.

00:19:23.202 --> 00:19:24.202
We got Ying.

00:19:25.808 --> 00:19:27.987
Ying is emptying out the
bag and putting everything

00:19:27.987 --> 00:19:30.444
into the closet like she
always does (Ying giggles)

00:19:30.444 --> 00:19:32.219
whenever we get to a hotel.

00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:34.368
Got the safe over here.

00:19:34.368 --> 00:19:36.476
And some shelving.

00:19:36.476 --> 00:19:38.453
The tea and coffee station.

00:19:38.453 --> 00:19:41.953
And then over here we've got the bathroom.

00:19:44.897 --> 00:19:47.377
I'm gonna end the video
for today right now.

00:19:47.377 --> 00:19:50.491
It was an excellent final day in Istanbul

00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:52.599
and then a good trip here to Rome.

00:19:52.599 --> 00:19:54.299
We have made it safely.

00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:56.037
Thank you all for watching today's video.

00:19:56.037 --> 00:19:58.961
Tomorrow is gonna be a full
day of sightseeing in Rome

00:19:58.961 --> 00:20:01.093
and I have a lot of planning
to do later tonight.

00:20:01.093 --> 00:20:01.926
Or right now.

00:20:01.926 --> 00:20:02.887
If you enjoyed this video

00:20:02.887 --> 00:20:04.649

00:20:11.958 --> 00:20:12.791
(beep)

00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:15.458
I think I'm gonna watch a movie.

00:20:18.477 --> 00:20:19.394
Ying, help?

00:20:21.269 --> 00:20:22.769
No, pull one side.

00:20:24.739 --> 00:20:26.239
Can you put it on?

00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:30.373
Okay.

00:20:30.373 --> 00:20:33.290
(percussion music)
