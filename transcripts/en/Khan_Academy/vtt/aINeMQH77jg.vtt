00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.960
The Karman line is
the point at which

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.620
the Earth's atmosphere ends
and outer space begins.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.050
The Karman line is at 62
miles above sea level.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.760
And any distance from sea level
at the Karman line or above

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.740
is considered outer space.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.470
Set c equals 62 and use
x to represent distance

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.050
from sea level.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.640
Write an inequality
in terms of x and c

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.460
that represents the
distances from sea level that

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.210
are inside Earth's atmosphere.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.320
So we want to write an
inequality in terms of x and c.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.770
And x is the distance
above sea level,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.540
and c is the Karman line.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.060
And we want to
think about things--

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.601
we want to think
about distances that

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:47.170
are inside Earth's atmosphere.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.950
So that's going to be anything
that's below the Karman line.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.340
And so, let's see, I would
write x is less than c,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.530
because they're
telling us c is 62.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.820
Now, I want to make sure.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.170
So they say the Karman line is
the point at which the Earth's

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.480
atmosphere ends and
outer space begins.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.620
So what if we're
right at 62 miles?

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.920
The Karman line is 62
miles above sea level,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.530
and any distance from sea level
at the Karman line or above

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.950
is considered outer space.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.730
OK.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.950
So if I'm at c or above,
I'm in outer space.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.700
So only the things
that are not, I'm sure,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.640
they're strictly below c.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.780
So I'm going to do a less
than, not a less than

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.341
or equal sign right over here.

00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:31.340
All right, got it right.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.400
Let's do another one.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.220
A black hole is a region of
space where the pull of gravity

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.500
is so strong that
nothing can get back out

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.560
once it has fallen inside.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.030
Let's use E to represent
the largest distance

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.910
from the center of the black
hole that pulls objects inside.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.960
If x represents the
distance of an object

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.600
from the center
of the black hole,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.380
write an inequality
for safe distances

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.720
from the center of the black
hole in terms of x and E.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.030
So x is the distance
from the center.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.010
e represents the
largest distance

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.120
from the center of the black
hole that pulls objects inside.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.180
So if you're at
E away or closer,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.669
you're going to
be pulled inside.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.040
But we want to think
about safe distances.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.690
So if you're further away
than E, you should be cool.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.660
And it's strictly greater
than because if you're at E,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.660
that's the largest distance
that you would still

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.300
be pulled inside.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.070
Very good.
