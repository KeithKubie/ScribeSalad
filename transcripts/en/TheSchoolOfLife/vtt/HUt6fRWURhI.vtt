00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
First the good news, you probably won't
be murdered,

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.639
run over by a bus or eaten by a shark.
Murders, transport an animal accidents

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.000
kill just seven percent of people in the
developed world every year.

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.519
Now, the less good news:

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.340
Most people when asked say they would like to die quickly, ideally without warning and in their sleep.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.420
But the reality is that your death will almost certainly be lingering, drawn out
and with plenty of forewarning.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.220
That's because it's likely you will die of a
chronic disease.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.180
Roughly eighty seven percent of deaths
in the developed world are caused by

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.559
non-infectious disease: a condition that
starts deep in the tissues of your own body

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.629
and last a long time,

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.389
slowly and ruthlessly reducing your
ability to lead a full life

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.600
until you die.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.260
This means you will probably die in
hospital; 60 percent of us do

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.780
with 1 in 10 having been there for a month or more.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.980
Just 18 percent of us die in our
own homes, comforted by the sight of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.170
familiar surroundings and possessions.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.150
On the plus side, you will probably not
die in pain. Pain is fully controlled in

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.479
60 to 70 percent of cases of
chronic disease.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.779
Though dying inevitably involves some
neurological and bone pains that are hard to relieve.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.500
That how you die but what exactly will kill you?

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.069
Most likely your heart.  You have a 1 in
3 chance of dying from cardiovascular disease.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.660
That means a failure of your circulatory system.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.780
The system of veins and arteries that is
steadily and rhythmically pumping blood

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.560
around your body at a rate of around 80
beats per minute right now,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.479
as you watch this film.

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.839
12 percent of you will die from a
heart attack and 8 percent from a stroke.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.100
The single biggest risk factor is
something you can do little to prevent:

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.460
high blood pressure.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.540
In over 90 percent of cases the cause of high blood pressure is simply unknown.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.869
The next thing most likely to kill you
is cancer caused when a mutation

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.849
develops in one of your cells and
reproduces uncontrollably.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.700
Cancer is responsible for a quarter of all deaths in the developed world.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.969
Chances are that a cancerous cell has
already developed in your body.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.920
It can take many years for it to divide and
grow

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.300
and form a tumor big enough to cause
symptoms or show up on a scan.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.900
It will probably be in your bowel or lung.
Cancers in those parts of the body are

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.320
the most common making up 13
percent of all new cancer cases.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.459
There are variations due to gender of course: if you're a woman then cancer will most

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.639
likely start in your breast and if
you're a man it will get going in your prostate.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.720
You can reduce the chances of getting some cancers:

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.610
Twenty-two percent of them are
caused by smoking

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.660
but two-thirds of cancers are non preventable.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.670
Which means no change to your lifestyle or diet will ever help.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.620
And by far the biggest risk factor is
the least preventable of all: age.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.190
63 percent of people who get
cancer are over the age of 65.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.720
If cancer doesn't kill you and
cardiovascular disease doesn't either,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.739
then a respiratory disease probably will:
9.4 percent of people who

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.239
died in 2010 died from a condition like
bronchitis or emphysema that affected

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:02.059
their lungs.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.300
And then there are a myriad of lesser courses, chief among them is dementia.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.540
4.3 percent of us will go this way.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.860
Though that's not to say that it's
unlikely you'll get dementia.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.859
Because current estimates suggest a third of people who die of other causes also have dementia.

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.079
What we can say is that when you die you
will almost certainly be old.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.220
By 2030, people over the age of 65 will account for 86 percent of deaths in the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.000
developed world while 44 percent
will be people over 85 which brings us

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.980
to the most pressing question of all:

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.160
When will it happen?

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.520
Probably when you are about 80.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.860
On average, people in the developed world live to be 79.7 years old.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.960
Which means that if you're 15 you have roughly 65 years left and if you're closer to 45 it's more like 35

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.960
and if you're 65 and all goes well you have about 15 years left.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.049
There are variations of course, women
live about 5 years longer than men.

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.620
If you live in Japan you'll probably
live 3 years beyond 80

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.549
whereas living in Hungary or Turkey
might mean you live 5 years less.

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.389
If you're overweight you might lose a year
while being severely obese risk losing

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.040
up to 13 years.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.430
If you had a degree by the time you're
30 you might live 6 years longer than

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.840
someone who didn't.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.340
And if you're in a happy relationship
you might live longer too.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.780
One scientist has likend the effect on your health of companionship

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.400
to that of not smoking.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.920
Though we can never predict the future, these facts and figures can't change one
simple incontrovertible ghastly fact:

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.050
The likelihood that we will all die is 100 percent.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.320
Which is why in the time that remains

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.050
we must be kind especially to those
around us and to ourselves.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.700
We must understand our true talents and
potential and try to put them to use

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.130
and we must appreciate every day aware
that the end might not be so far away.
