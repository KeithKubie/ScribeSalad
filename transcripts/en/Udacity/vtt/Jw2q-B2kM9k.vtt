00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.942
You should be quite proud of what you have accomplished.

00:00:02.942 --> 00:00:08.119
Before D3 and the work of its community to replicate a map like this

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:13.210
in the browser would be quite an arduous process and require many tools, and

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.240
we are now done with the first step of creating our map of the World Cup games.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.070
The next step is to add some context to our map and add in the attendance data

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.610
of each of the World Cups throughout the years plotted on our map.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.720
To do so,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.140
we're going to be plotting circles on each country in which the World Cup

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.330
was held with the radius proportional to the total attendance for that year.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.020
This is often referred to as thematic mapping, which refers to the fact that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.070
maps with such data often represent a specific topic or, you guessed it, theme.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.300
In our case, the theme will be the World Cup.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.060
And thematic maps are often implemented by adding some additional context,

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.069
by leveraging some data plotted on the map.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.800
There's a few common types of thematic maps,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.920
many of which we have covered previously in the lessons.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.030
What we have seen previously are dot maps, which simply plot dots,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.250
potentially of different colors in a map, and can leverage negative space.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.660
Choropleth maps, which color areas such as counties,

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.620
states, or countries, depending on the data they represent.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.710
And a cartogram which distorts area, shapes, and

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.780
sizes, depending on some data value.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.870
And what we will be covering in this class is a graduated symbol map.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.090
It is a symbol map because we place some symbol, in our case circles,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.411
on the map and it is graduated because the area or radius,

00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:58.010
in our case from the symbols varies depending on the data they represent.
