00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.310
At a very high level, the
period between 1915 and 1918

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.682
on the Western Front is usually
considered to be a stalemate.

00:00:08.682 --> 00:00:10.890
It's considered to be a
stalemate because you did not

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.450
have a major movement
on the front.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.329
There were some movement, but
the front pretty much looked

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.680
the way that it looks in
this diagram right over here.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.162
That's not to say that it
was not incredibly bloody.

00:00:22.162 --> 00:00:23.620
In fact, it was so
bloody that some

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.360
of the most famous battles, not
just in World War I history,

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.150
but in world history,
occurred during this period.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.350
And in particular,
they occurred in 1916.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.340
In 1916, the first of
these happened in February,

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.960
where you have the Battle
of Verdun, or "Ver-done".

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.480
Battle of Verdun, where
you have the Germans, who

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.600
want to do an
offensive on the French

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.860
that most historians believe
was intended not to necessarily

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.350
gain this territory, but to
try to make the French put so

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.470
many troops here and inflict so
many casualties on the French

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.619
that they might not be
able to overcome that.

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:05.910
And they might have to throw
the French out of the war.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.000
And they especially thought
this part of the front

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.370
was vulnerable because the
French could be attacked

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.690
from multiple sides, this
little bulge right over here.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.040
And so in February of
1916, they attack primarily

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.710
with artillery.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.620
So they're shelling
the French right

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.120
over here, this whole area.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.330
The French keep bringing
troops into the mix.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.660
And to get a sense of how ugly
and how scary this whole scene

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.930
was, this is a quote from the
journal of a French soldier who

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.850
was serving in Verdun
during the Battle of Verdun,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.605
or serving in the
Battle of Verdun.

00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:39.480
And he wrote-- and he
was unfortunately later

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.570
killed due to artillery
fire-- "Humanity is mad.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.240
It must be mad to
do what it is doing.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.510
What a massacre.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.080
What scenes of
horror and carnage.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.510
I cannot find words to
translate my impressions.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.710
Hell cannot be so terrible.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.300
Men are mad."

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.170
And this battle would continue
through most of the year.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.340
As you go into
the summer, that's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.310
the maximum of the
German offensive.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.139
This is some of the territory
that they are able to capture.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.440
But as you get into the late
summer, in July of 1916,

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.950
the British and
the French decide

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.340
to do an offensive on another
part of the front, right

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.500
over here near the Somme River.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.060
So this right over here
is the Somme River.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.060
So this right over here
is the German offensive.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.004
In July, you have the
Battle of the Somme,

00:02:36.004 --> 00:02:37.420
sometimes referred
to as the Somme

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.630
Offensive, named
after the Somme River.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.180
It occurred where
the Somme River

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.670
intersected with the front.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.720
And this was an Anglo, British
and French, Anglo French

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.670
offensive.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.230
And it's also famous-- both of
these were incredibly bloody.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.050
That's what really
made them noteworthy.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.610
But this was also famous for
the first use of the tanks.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.970
This was a picture of a
British tank at the time.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.910
But both of these were
incredibly bloody.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.262
It was lucky for
the French at Verdun

00:03:10.262 --> 00:03:13.090
that the offensive
at the Somme happened

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.560
because this forced the Germans
to go off of the offensive

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.950
as we get into the
late summer of 1916.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.002
They had to bring troops back
over here to help support it.

00:03:25.002 --> 00:03:26.460
But the end result
of both of these

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.270
is you do not have a major
movement of the front.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.990
In fact, by the end of
1916, because the Germans

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.390
had to go fight at the
Battle of the Somme,

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.890
the French were
able to recapture

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.370
much of this territory.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.051
So the real end result of
both of these offensives,

00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:42.050
one on the German side,
one on the British side,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.750
was just a massive, massive,
massive loss of human life.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.440
Each of them, it's
estimated, had

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.860
on the order of a million
casualties, roughly half

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.727
on each side.

00:03:51.727 --> 00:03:53.810
At Verdun, it was slightly
more on the French side

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.476
than the German.

00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:57.350
But it was roughly 55, 45%.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.140
So a million
casualties in Verdun.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.290
A million casualties on
both sides at the Somme.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.030
I've seen estimates
on the death toll

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.490
being a third of a
million to half a million

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.240
for each of these battles.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.490
So both of these were
incredibly, incredibly ugly

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.959
battles for both sides.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.500
The end result for
the Germans though

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.365
was even more
interesting because you

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:18.740
have to remember what was
happening at the Eastern Front.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:21.380
On the Eastern Front,
1916 was the year

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.760
that the Russians finally were
building up their war machine.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.500
They were finally able to
equip the munitions necessary.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.570
It was also the year
that the Romanians

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.680
joined on side of the Entente
along with the Russians

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.720
on the Eastern Front.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.350
The Austro-Hungarians were
suffering huge losses.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.610
So in 1916 the Germans were
in a very tough situation.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.390
Huge losses at
Verdun, huge losses

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.487
at the Battle of the
Somme, the Russians

00:04:45.487 --> 00:04:47.570
are starting to get more
aggressive on the Eastern

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.520
Front, the Austro-Hungarians
are starting to have trouble.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.460
So they decide to
essentially re-trench.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.410
So they're going to start
bringing more troops back

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.830
to the Eastern Front.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.970
But in order not to
lose too much ground

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.560
on the Western Front,
they essentially

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.050
try to hold a smaller front.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.510
So they back up to this line.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.840
This is the line at the end
of the Battle of the Somme.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.450
The Germans recognize
that they can't

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.300
protect this entire front.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.960
They want to protect
a shorter front.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.927
So they begin preparing to
move back right over here.

00:05:25.927 --> 00:05:27.510
And this line right
over here is named

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.990
after the field marshal
of the German army.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.550
It's called the Hindenburg line.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:38.520
It's no coincidence.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.980
It's the same name
of the zeppelin

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.850
that blew up in the late '30s.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.120
It was actually named after
Field Marshal Hindenburg

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.380
for whom this line is named.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.120
But the Germans do
this in order so

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.220
that they can take more
troops to the Eastern Front

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.000
and hold a shorter line.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.870
So by the end of 1916, they
start making the preparations

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.510
for the Hindenburg line.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.320
And in February of
1917, they actually

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.300
move back to the
Hindenburg line.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:14.080
So this is 1917 February
you have the Germans

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.715
move to the Hindenburg line.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.640
So 1916, incredibly,
incredibly ugly year.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.900
Two million casualties,
not a lot of movement

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.080
of the actual front.
