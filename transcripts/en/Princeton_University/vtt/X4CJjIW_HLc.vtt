ADIN WALKER: We had the opportunity
to do a thesis, which

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.630
can be for directors
directing a production,

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.570
for actors starring
in a production.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.810
So I'll be directing this
production of "Singin'

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.170
in the Rain" as my thesis.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.000
This was sort of a
weird choice for us.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.920
It was -- there was something
exciting about taking

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.960
a musical, that we actually
know more about as a film

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.160
but it exists as a musical, and
something that's so, so iconic.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.590
How can we re-imagine it?

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.090
So it's kind of this ultimate
challenge for all of us,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.170
which was really exciting.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.630
Everyone knows what
the musical is.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.990
Everyone knows it's Gene
Kelly and Donald O'Connor

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.820
and it's him with the
lampposts dancing and tapping

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.400
in the street.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.630
That it's like,
everyone knows it.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.080
How can we then take something
that everyone knows, everyone

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.750
remembers, and present
it in a way that's new,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.450
but it still holds on to
the truth of that film

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.240
that is so beloved?

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.590
