to do that but now on such a small level

things like that I kind of make

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
things like that I kind of make
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.770

and turn a light off or any number of
countless things that's just the example

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590
countless things that's just the example
 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.990
countless things that's just the example
the common example that comes to my mind

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
the common example that comes to my mind
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.820
the common example that comes to my mind
but it's it's neat that there's that

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
but it's it's neat that there's that
 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.730
but it's it's neat that there's that
little bug in your ear now that I think

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740
little bug in your ear now that I think
 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.529
little bug in your ear now that I think
that's really important while the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
that's really important while the
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.609
that's really important while the
world's trying to figure out how to

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
world's trying to figure out how to
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.570
world's trying to figure out how to
solve the problem

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
solve the problem
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.849
solve the problem
awareness is probably the first step to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
awareness is probably the first step to
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.580
awareness is probably the first step to
solving so the fact that you know we're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
solving so the fact that you know we're
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.380
solving so the fact that you know we're
all everyone seems a little bit more

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
all everyone seems a little bit more
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.400
all everyone seems a little bit more
aware about it I know I went back and

things like that and just to see all
generations kind of at least it being in

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649
generations kind of at least it being in
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.470
generations kind of at least it being in
their head a little bit more that's

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
their head a little bit more that's
