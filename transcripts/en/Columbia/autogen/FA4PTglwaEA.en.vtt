00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
countries and in the book I tried to
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.500
countries and in the book I tried to
answer four questions the first question

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510
answer four questions the first question
 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.040
answer four questions the first question
is why is it that some new democracies

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050
is why is it that some new democracies
 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.529
is why is it that some new democracies
are more active than others in

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539
are more active than others in
 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.660
are more active than others in
supporting the democratization of other

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670
supporting the democratization of other
 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.190
supporting the democratization of other
countries then I also asked why is it

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200
countries then I also asked why is it
 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.310
countries then I also asked why is it
that those countries choose as

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320
that those countries choose as
 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.810
that those countries choose as
recipients of particulars and the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820
recipients of particulars and the
 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.320
recipients of particulars and the
countries over others I also look in the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330
countries over others I also look in the
 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.440
countries over others I also look in the
question of why said those democracy

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450
question of why said those democracy
 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.990

support over others and finally I look

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820
support over others and finally I look
 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.640
support over others and finally I look
at the strengths and the mutations of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650
at the strengths and the mutations of
 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.300

these democracy promoters by answering
these questions I look to take part in

these questions I look to take part in
 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.030
these questions I look to take part in

three or other sets of debates in the
literature the first one is about the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160

emergence of a new class of democracy

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:34.730
that their continued vigilance and
 

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.030
that their continued vigilance and
advocacy to the state allowed that

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040
advocacy to the state allowed that
 

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.640
advocacy to the state allowed that
democracy promotion to continue at the

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:39.650
democracy promotion to continue at the
 

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.220
democracy promotion to continue at the
state level even when power turned over

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:42.230
state level even when power turned over
 

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.640
state level even when power turned over
to the previous to the successes of the

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:45.650
to the previous to the successes of the
 

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.250
to the previous to the successes of the
previous illiberal regime and so even

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:48.260
previous illiberal regime and so even
 

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:53.230
previous illiberal regime and so even
under that set of beliefs democracy

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:53.240
under that set of beliefs democracy
 

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.449
under that set of beliefs democracy
promotion continued because civil

00:13:55.449 --> 00:13:55.459
promotion continued because civil
 

00:13:55.459 --> 00:13:56.949

society continues to actively

00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959
society continues to actively
 

00:13:56.959 --> 00:13:59.650
society continues to actively
hard-working which again to me speaks to

00:13:59.650 --> 00:13:59.660
hard-working which again to me speaks to
 

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.180
hard-working which again to me speaks to
the importance of activists and their

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:04.190
the importance of activists and their
 

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:08.470
the importance of activists and their
advocacy for active state policy for his

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.480
advocacy for active state policy for his
 

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.449
advocacy for active state policy for his
support of democracy abroad now allow me

00:14:13.449 --> 00:14:13.459
support of democracy abroad now allow me
 

00:14:13.459 --> 00:14:15.069
support of democracy abroad now allow me
to turn your attention to another

00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079
to turn your attention to another
 

00:14:15.079 --> 00:14:17.440
to turn your attention to another
variation which I discovered and I'd

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:17.450
variation which I discovered and I'd
 

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:22.240
variation which I discovered and I'd
like to explain and that is the

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:22.250
like to explain and that is the
 

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.069
like to explain and that is the
variation in the recipients of these

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079
variation in the recipients of these
 

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:27.490
variation in the recipients of these
living Rypien democracy promotion so

living Rypien democracy promotion so
 

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.400
living Rypien democracy promotion so
what you see this table is again the

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:30.410
what you see this table is again the
 

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.610
what you see this table is again the
Eastern European democracy promoters as

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:33.620
Eastern European democracy promoters as
 

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.790
Eastern European democracy promoters as
well as a range of their priority

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800
well as a range of their priority
 

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.460
well as a range of their priority
recipients the countries with two stars

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:39.470
recipients the countries with two stars
 

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.400
recipients the countries with two stars
are what each of the donors considered

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:42.410
are what each of the donors considered
 

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.949
are what each of the donors considered
to be a parent a recipient whereas the

00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959
to be a parent a recipient whereas the
 

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:46.720
to be a parent a recipient whereas the
country's the recipients marked with one

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:46.730
country's the recipients marked with one
 

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.449
country's the recipients marked with one
star were some of the other recipients

00:14:49.449 --> 00:14:49.459
star were some of the other recipients
 

00:14:49.459 --> 00:14:52.030
star were some of the other recipients
that received support from the Eastern

countries and again as you see there is

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:54.950
countries and again as you see there is
 

00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:57.520
countries and again as you see there is
quite some variation in those recipients

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:57.530
quite some variation in those recipients
 

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.950
quite some variation in those recipients
so of course an interesting question is

00:14:59.950 --> 00:14:59.960
so of course an interesting question is
 

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:06.250
so of course an interesting question is
how can it be explained I found that at

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:06.260
how can it be explained I found that at
 

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.520
how can it be explained I found that at
the level of state efforts there was

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:09.530
the level of state efforts there was
 

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:13.680
the level of state efforts there was
some democracy promotion idealism and

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:13.690
some democracy promotion idealism and
 

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:17.380
some democracy promotion idealism and
they were a number of politicians who

they were a number of politicians who
paid principle attention to the

resulted from these principles efforts

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:28.280
resulted from these principles efforts
 

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:31.330

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:30.020
mutual neighbors with Russia so those
 

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.780

are countries such as Ukraine and

that were those countries democratic

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:39.020

they will also choose their own
 

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.910
they will also choose their own
sovereignty and would then stay away

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:42.920
sovereignty and would then stay away
 

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.440

so again I think what's interesting here

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:57.670
so again I think what's interesting here
 

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.030
so again I think what's interesting here
is that the rationale that was fleshed

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:00.040
is that the rationale that was fleshed
 

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.070
is that the rationale that was fleshed
out with the product of the conversation

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080
out with the product of the conversation
