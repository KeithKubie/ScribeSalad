 Your accent is very sexual.

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:02.435
 Is it a mix of things?

00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:03.269
Is it Australian-Asian?

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:04.470 size:81% position:41%
 Do you know what?

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:05.705 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I don't even feel
 like I have an accent.

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:06.906
 I feel like you're the
 one with the accent.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.075
I'm aware I sound like
a talking sewer cap.

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:12.645 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of that, I just wanted
to know where your accent,

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:13.679 size:88% position:44%
 what it is.

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:15.048
Malaysian, Singapore.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.783 align:start size:88% position:13%
Singapore is a good
place, I like Singapore.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:18.518
Isn't Singapore like if
you throw gum on floor,

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:19.752 size:84% position:42%
  they'll beat your
  ass with bamboo?

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:20.953 size:88% position:44%
 They will cane you.

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:22.355
They'll cane you with
(bleep) panda food.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:23.289 size:88% position:44%
  How weird is that?

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:24.457 size:88% position:44%
 Yeah, that is pretty weird.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.691 align:start size:88% position:13%
 But also, if you
 throw gum on the floor

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:27.427
in any New Yorkers home,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.228
 they'll beat the (bleep) out
 of you as well, so I mean.

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:30.496
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.898 align:start size:88% position:13%
  In Singapore we
  do the same thing,

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
 we just outsource the
 ass-kicking to the government.

 Ronny Chieng:
 International Student,

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:46.712
coming out on the Comedy
Central app August 13th.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.715 size:88% position:44%
 August 13th, it's a
 good day, good day.

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:50.883 size:81% position:41%
 Good day.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.285 size:84% position:42%
 Good day, that's iced tea.

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.555 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Aren't you like a huge
 star in Australia?

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:56.789
I guess I am.

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:58.324 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Well here's the
 first stupid question,

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:00.293 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 do you think Australia is
 too far and Jesus hates it?

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:04.030
 I think it is too far, and
 I think Jesus hates it, yes.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.898 size:88% position:44%
 Yeah, is that why you think
 he pushed it all the way.

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:07.066
How does Australia work, again?

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:08.901 align:start size:88% position:13%
 It's so far we
 can't, first of all,

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.903 align:start size:88% position:13%
 isn't it like 10
 years from now there?

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:11.838 size:88% position:44%
 Yeah, yeah.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.039 size:78% position:39%
  It's not the same time.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:14.307 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Not the same
  time frame at all,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.675 size:88% position:44%
 right there Kennedy
 is still president.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:16.909
Yeah.

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:18.144 size:88% position:44%
  I gotta tell you
  'bout that ending,

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:20.179 size:88% position:44%
 it comes to brutal,
 tell your people.

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:22.081 size:81% position:41%
 Well they don't know yet,
 so don't tell Australia.

00:01:22.114 --> 00:01:23.483
Yeah, it's a shocker.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.184 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 What's your favorite
 state capital?

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:26.018
State capital?

00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:27.453
State capital.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:28.387 align:start position:0%
 Or for you, you know, 'cause
 International Student,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.389
I'll allow this just for today,

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:31.791
 what's your favorite
 international capital?

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.227 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'm a big capital
 guy, Chrisy capitals.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.394
Is Honolulu a capital?

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:36.629
That is the capital of Hawaii.

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:38.064 align:start position:0%
  Yeah.
  You ever been out there?

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
 I've been out there
 twice, love it, love Hawaii.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.768
 It's like what would happen if
 Asian people were in charge.

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.238 size:81% position:41%
  There you go, you picked
  the most Asian capital.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:46.072 size:88% position:44%
 Other than Asia, obviously.

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:47.273
Yeah.

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:48.541 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Hawaii's awesome,
 great weather.

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:49.876
 As soon as you land it
 smells like flowers.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.110
Right.

00:01:51.143 --> 00:01:52.111 size:84% position:42%
 Everyone's polite,
 there's beaches.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:52.945
Yeah.

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:54.213
Food is great.

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:56.149 size:84% position:42%
 I'm a big Pierre,
 South Dakota, guy.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:56.983 size:81% position:41%
  Have you been to Pierre?

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.584
 I've never been, no.

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:00.620
 I've really never been
 outside New Jersey.

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:03.689 align:start size:88% position:13%
This question is really
dumb, just answer.

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:04.991 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  Do you watch porn anymore?

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.192 size:81% position:41%
  I never stopped, really.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:07.627
Right, never stopped.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.662 align:start position:0%
  It's a continuous
  thing that I'm, you know,

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:12.098
 in between this I'm probably
 going to go watch some porn.

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:14.834 size:88% position:44%
  I've been going thoughts
  lately, just all thoughts.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:15.668 size:81% position:41%
  Oh, just memory?

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:16.836
Well not even memory,

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.437 align:start size:88% position:13%
 sometimes I just
 kind of get in a zone

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.439
where my mind is blank,
and then I just jizz.

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:21.374 align:start size:75% position:25%
 Oh, right.
 Yeah.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:24.110
Yeah, that's one way to do it.

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:25.344 size:84% position:42%
 It's a type of meditating.

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:26.913 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That's very zen,
 that's a zen orgasm.

00:02:26.946 --> 00:02:28.347 align:start position:0%
  I started the
  transcendental meditation.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.615
Yeah.

00:02:29.648 --> 00:02:31.083
 And then I notice
 I'm getting in this,

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:33.352 align:start position:0%
 you know, I'm 10, 15 minutes
 in, I have a full boner.

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.754
And then next thing you
know I need a napkin.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.122
I don't know what it is.

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:38.191 align:start position:0%
  No, that's not
  transcendental meditation.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.025 size:88% position:44%
 That's not?

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:39.859
That's something else.

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:41.394 size:88% position:44%
 That's glory holes?

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:44.030 align:start position:0%
 I don't think enlightenment
 ends with an orgasm.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:45.198 size:84% position:42%
 But how great would it be?

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.299 size:84% position:42%
  It should though.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.501
Alright, here's a dumb question.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:49.635 line:0%
 Tell me about your underwear.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:50.937
Thank you for asking.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.205 size:84% position:42%
  Yes, what do you
  got on right now?

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.439 size:78% position:39%
  Dude, I've gone
  through several

00:02:53.472 --> 00:02:54.874 size:88% position:44%
 iterations of this process.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:56.108
Okay.

00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:58.911 align:start size:88% position:13%
First of all, good
underwear, so important.

00:02:58.944 --> 00:02:59.745 size:88% position:44%
 Absolutely.

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:00.513 size:88% position:44%
 Underrated.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:01.747
 Yes.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.481 size:81% position:41%
  Shitty underwear
  ruins your life.

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:03.983 size:88% position:44%
 Absolutely.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:05.484 size:84% position:42%
 And people don't even know
 they have shitty underwear

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:06.419 size:88% position:44%
  because they're so used to
  wearing shitty underwear

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:06.953 size:84% position:42%
  they think that's normal!

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.187
Right.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.422 align:start position:0%
  That pain isn't normal.
  Right.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:10.656 align:start position:0%
  You shouldn't feel pain.
  Right.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.091
 One time I thought I
 had testicular cancer,

00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:12.625 align:start position:0%
 but it was just I was
 wearing the wrong underwear.

00:03:12.658 --> 00:03:13.859
Yeah!

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:15.027 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That's all it was,
 they were nut huggers.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.163 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Now, my whole
 thing, long underwear.

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:18.698 size:81% position:41%
  Wow, old school?

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:19.632
 I'm talking almost to your
 knees, almost to your knees.

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:21.534
Wow, like a 1920 bathing suit.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:22.368 size:81% position:41%
  Yeah, that's exactly it.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:23.269 size:84% position:42%
 Holy crap.

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:24.670 size:88% position:44%
 Because guess what?

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:26.038 align:start position:0%
 When you get that long
 underwear, it never rides up.

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:27.373 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Yeah, and I've
 seen, you're hung too.

00:03:27.406 --> 00:03:28.908 size:81% position:41%
  I'm all the way,

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:31.077 size:84% position:42%
  I'm hung and my underwear
  is long all the way down.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.246 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'm wearing underwear
 to my ankles.

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.447 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Alright Ron, did
 you have a good time?

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.281 size:78% position:39%
  Mm-hmm.

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:36.115 size:78% position:39%
  You really did?

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:36.949 size:88% position:44%
 Yeah, sure.

00:03:36.982 --> 00:03:37.883 size:88% position:44%
 Appreciate it, man.

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.085 size:88% position:44%
  I want to give you a gift.

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:40.586 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Stupid questions, you
 get a stupid gift.

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:41.721 align:start position:0%
  That's very thoughtful
  of you, thank you so much.

00:03:41.754 --> 00:03:42.955 size:81% position:41%
  So you're a guy,

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:45.658
you sell socks on your
website ronnychieng.com.

00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:46.592
 Yup.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.160
So I wanted to give you socks

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:51.297 align:start size:88% position:13%
 with my face and
 name on it backwards

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.531
because I didn't realize

00:03:52.564 --> 00:03:53.399
 that when you send it
 to the sock company,

00:03:53.432 --> 00:03:55.034
they reverse the image.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:58.504 align:start position:0%
  So it's my face, but it's
  my name is backwards.

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:00.039
 These are something.

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.040 size:81% position:41%
 Absolutely, yeah.

00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:02.541
 And I got my face right there.

00:04:02.574 --> 00:04:04.644 size:84% position:42%
  Also did you get these
  in size 12, what is this?

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:06.178
Yeah.

00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:07.513
 And then you got your socks
 with your face on it, right?

00:04:07.546 --> 00:04:09.048
[Ronny] Yeah.

00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:10.283 size:88% position:44%
 Why don't you show us your
 socks and that flexibility?

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.083 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Thank God I got
 master flexibility.

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:11.451 size:84% position:42%
 [Chris] Could you?

00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:15.121 align:start size:88% position:13%
 No don't, you
 might hurt yourself.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:16.956 size:84% position:42%
  I should send you
  some of my socks.

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.358
 That's why I kind of did it,
 if I'm being honest with you,

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.827
 I didn't do it for you, I
 did it kind of cross for me.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.396
 So I'd appreciate some socks.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:24.230 size:81% position:41%
  [Ronny] No problem, man.

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:25.164
Now put that leg down.
