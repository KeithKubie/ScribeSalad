[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.988 --> 00:00:08.360
JEREMY: Thank you again
for coming on out.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.020
My name's Jeremy, and I lead
up the Asian Google Network

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.930
here in our Los Angeles office.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.440
We do events revolving around
professional development,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.880
community service.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.800
And this week, we're
focusing on race affairs.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.740
So this talk today is part of
a series of different events

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.930
that we're hosting,
so if you want

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.380
to find out more about what it
means to be AAPI, please visit

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.620
our [? GoLink, ?] go/aapi.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.900
So without further ado, I'm
going to go ahead and start off

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.770
our panel today.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.515
We have with us today "Asian
AF," or "Asian as Beep."

00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:47.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.774
KEIKO AGENA: Can we not swear?

00:00:49.774 --> 00:00:50.690
JEREMY: Um.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:51.870
AUDIENCE: Yes, you can.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.810
Yes, it's fine.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.170
KIM COOPER: He said it's fine.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.172
KEIKO AGENA: I don't know
who that gentleman is.

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:57.255
KIM COOPER: That's Google.

00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:59.040
That's Google right there.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.014
AUDIENCE: You guys totally
can, but Jeremy's at work.

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:04.002
[? PANEL: ?] Oh.

00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:04.760
JEREMY: Feel free.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.660
You are my guests.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.210
So-- I don't need a censor.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.770
So I'm going to
read a brief intro.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.117
So "Asian AF" is the hit
Asian American variety show

00:01:18.117 --> 00:01:20.270
based in Los
Angeles and features

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.560
exclusively Asian
American performers.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.040
The group made headlines earlier
this year for their efforts

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.430
to fight against damaging
Asian stereotypes through humor

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.160
and their viral T-shirt poking
fun of Hollywood whitewashing,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.830
pictured right there.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.740
Join us right now
for this panel,

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.025
and we'll talk about
Asian representation

00:01:43.025 --> 00:01:45.910
in media and entertainment.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.910
So what we'll do right now is
I'd love to get some intros.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.972
Please introduce
yourself, your name,

00:01:51.972 --> 00:01:53.430
give us a little
bit of background,

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.110
and what brought you to comedy.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.931
ZAC OYAMA: Hi, I'm Zac Oyama.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.610
I work at College Humor
as a writer and actor

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.790
there, and make videos for them.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.169
What brought me to comedy?

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.130
I guess I don't know.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.980
I just have always enjoyed
it and use it as a way

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.930
to just, from a
young age, trying

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.010
to win over friends by trying
to be funny or whatever.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.980
And yeah, that's where
it probably started.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.596
Yeah.

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:26.038
WILL CHOI: Hi, I'm Will Choi.

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:28.480
I'm the creator of "Asian AF"
and also another show comedy

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.080
show at the UCB Theater called
"Scarlett Johansson Presents."

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.600
And I got into comedy
a few years ago

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.900
after watching an improv show.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.670
And yeah, that's basically it.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.560
I just saw improv, and
I fell in love with it,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.846
and then that's what
brought me here.

00:02:50.846 --> 00:02:51.970
KEIKO AGENA: Hi, everybody.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.560
My name's Keiko Agena,
and I'm an actress.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.935
I'm a cohost of "Asian AF."

00:02:57.935 --> 00:03:00.540
And I've been acting
for a long time.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.992
And some of the roles
are comedic or dramedy,

00:03:02.992 --> 00:03:04.640
and things like that.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.940
I was on a show called "Gilmore
Girls" for seven years,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.860
and then I did their
reboot of that.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.740
And I guess, if we're talking
about strictly comedy,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.569
I came into it because
I love to laugh,

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:20.610
and I'm obsessed with it.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.910
And improv is some of
the best entertainment

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.880
I've ever experienced.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.610
It's the thing that makes
me laugh the hardest.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.100
So it's the thing that
I'm the most obsessed

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.465
with in trying to
perfect because I

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:35.630
feel like it's this puzzle
that never can be solved.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.502
And so it's tickling
to my brain,

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:39.460
and so that's why I can
never get enough of it,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.750
and I love the show.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.690
KIM COOPER: Hi, I'm Kim Cooper,
and I'm an actress as well.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.395
And I came to comedy
because I grew up in Iowa.

00:03:52.395 --> 00:03:53.390
I'm adopted.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.444
And so I grew up
in a place where

00:03:55.444 --> 00:03:56.610
I didn't feel like I fit in.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.016
And I felt like I often times--
as a lot of people do who come

00:04:01.016 --> 00:04:01.515
to comedy--

00:04:01.515 --> 00:04:04.132
I came to comedy because
I was like, oh, I

00:04:04.132 --> 00:04:08.320
need a way to figure out how
to cope with feeling different

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.860
and, in a way, make fun of
myself before other people can.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.390
And so that's how I
ended up doing that.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.420
And then improv,
specifically, I came to

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.800
because it's something
where people can't tell you

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.680
that who you are,
what you look like,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.860
means you have to be
something specific.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.780
In improv, it's all
made up on the fly.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.520
So it's like, hey, right now,
I'm going to be the president,

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.770
and that's just how it is.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.061
The president's an Asian woman.

00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:37.018
That's what it is.

00:04:37.018 --> 00:04:40.580
And so that's why
I really like that.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.174
KAY KAANAPU: Hello, my
name is Kay Kaanapu.

00:04:44.174 --> 00:04:45.840
I'm originally from
Northern California,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.766
small town named Gilroy,
known for garlic,

00:04:48.766 --> 00:04:51.820
so that's where I came from.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.875
I first got into comedy
when I saw an improv show

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.740
at my freshman dorm orientation.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.657
It was short form,
and I just thought

00:04:59.657 --> 00:05:00.930
it was the coolest thing.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.578
And I was like Liz Lemon.

00:05:02.578 --> 00:05:04.410
I was like, I want
to go to there.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.740
And then after that, I started
writing, and just continuing

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.985
doing improv, and
pursuing comedy writing.

00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:16.497
I currently work for
a TV writer/novelist.

00:05:16.497 --> 00:05:17.988
JEREMY: All right,
thanks everyone.

00:05:17.988 --> 00:05:18.485
[MIC FEEDBACK]

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.976
KIM COOPER: Oh, it
doesn't like it.

00:05:19.976 --> 00:05:22.960
JEREMY: Oh.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.930
All right, so my next
question is directed at Will.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.540
We want to know,
how did you come up

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.642
with the concept for
the show, "Asian AF"?

00:05:33.642 --> 00:05:34.510
WILL CHOI: Yeah.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:41.210
So it's a little bit of a
story because the first show

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.760
before "Asian AF" was
"Scarlett Johansson Presents--

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.530
AAPI Heritage Month."

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.450
And it was the first
Asian American improv

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.110
show at the UCB Theater in LA.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.280
And that happened in response
to "Ghost in the Shell"

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.440
and a lot of these
other movies that

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.420
have to do with whitewashing
and all that good stuff.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.670
And so the show was
very successful.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.830
It was the very first
Asian American-themed show

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.060
at the theater.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.620
And because of the
huge success of that,

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.230
UCB gave me "Asian AF,"
which is a variety show.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.220
So it features sketch,
stand up, improv, music,

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.095
and different things.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.590
And that show,
"Asian AF," is more

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.140
of a celebration of
Asian American performers

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:40.050
doing comedy, where it's not
so much about the whitewashing

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.150
controversy and stuff like that.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.860
So it started in
November of 2016.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.970
And because of how successful
the show has been going--

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:54.810
we sell out shows
in, literally, a day.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.170
So because of how
successful it is,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.885
we were able to move it
over to New York as well.

00:07:00.885 --> 00:07:08.331
And so in June of 2017 was the
first New York "Asian AF Show."

00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:08.830
Yeah.

00:07:11.334 --> 00:07:13.750
JEREMY: I'm just turning the
mic on and off just because--

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.884
I think it's me.

00:07:14.884 --> 00:07:16.692
WILL CHOI: Oh.

00:07:16.692 --> 00:07:17.596
Oh, OK.

00:07:17.596 --> 00:07:19.190
Glad we figured that out.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.192
JEREMY: Yeah.

00:07:20.192 --> 00:07:22.500
So I know you mentioned
"Ghost in the Shell."

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.300
And earlier, we were talking
about some news about "Hellboy"

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.239
and the reason why--

00:07:28.239 --> 00:07:29.217
KEIKO AGENA: Ugh.

00:07:29.217 --> 00:07:30.684
JEREMY: Oh, I know, I know.

00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:31.662
KEIKO AGENA: Why?

00:07:31.662 --> 00:07:33.620
JEREMY: [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.695
So for those of you
that don't know,

00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:38.470
they made some casting
decisions for the reboot

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.790
of the movie, "Hellboy,"
which is based on a comic book

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.540
character.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:48.060
And there is another case of
some Hollywood whitewashing.

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:50.130
So I want to bring
your attention

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:51.870
to Keiko's shirt over here.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:56.430
So "Scarlett, and Emma,
and Tilda, and Matt."

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.090
And this shirt made a lot
of headlines last year.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.640
So we wanted to know, what
was the response like to that?

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.950
Did you get a lot of praise?

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:08.720
Did you get any backlash?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.274
Please tell us a little
bit about that story.

00:08:11.274 --> 00:08:11.940
WILL CHOI: Yeah.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.220
So this shirt was made--

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.920
we made, like, 50 shirts.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.350
We were trying to raise
some money for the show.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.520
And it just so happened
that Michele Selene Ang,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.350
who is on "13 Reasons Why,"
she happened to see this shirt

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.590
and wore it.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.870
And that's how it
exploded on the internet.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:42.390
And the response has been,
or had been, pretty positive.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:46.150
I think it just resonated
with a lot of people.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.870
I think a lot of people
were feeling frustrated

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.460
with a lot of that stuff.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:59.440
So yeah, generally, people liked
it a lot, and people wear it.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:03.340
I see people wear it all the
time, and it's really cool.

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:03.840
Yeah.

00:09:08.057 --> 00:09:09.640
ZAC OYAMA: What were
we talking about?

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.409
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.350
JEREMY: So now that
we're all warmed up--

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.600
KIM COOPER: We stay warmed up.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.740
JEREMY: I'm going to
jump to our next question

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.790
and talk about some of
the challenges of being

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.466
Asian in comedy,
in entertainment.

00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:35.700
Could you share some of those
stories, maybe some challenges

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.380
you've experienced, and
how you've overcome them?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.704
ZAC OYAMA: For me, I think
I've noticed it's just-- well,

00:09:44.704 --> 00:09:46.620
everyone probably has
an experience with this.

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:53.730
But a lot of Asian roles when
I was growing up, less so now,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.345
but the punch line is
that the person's Asian.

00:09:56.345 --> 00:10:01.080
And there's very few
instances of characters

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.780
that they're just a funny
person, or the role is funny,

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.180
and they just
happen to be Asian.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:14.935
So that's the first
thing that comes to mind.

00:10:14.935 --> 00:10:18.270
KAY KAANAPU: I think,
also, it's having

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.080
to be the one
person to represent

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.960
your ethnicity in the group.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.970
A lot of times, when
you're in a class, or maybe

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:30.700
put on an improv team
for a theater company,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.880
you're usually the one
Asian, or sometimes,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.420
the only one person of color.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:40.640
So whenever it comes to
references or fun things

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.400
that you might
want to talk about,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.130
you're not really pulling from
your personal experiences,

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.930
but you're definitely
having to default and adapt

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:53.130
to the group's
personal experiences.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.920
So a lot of times, when I
perform with these people

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.670
or with "Asian AF"
performers, you

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:05.111
have this relief that goes over
you because you're just like, I

00:11:05.111 --> 00:11:06.236
can talk about [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:06.236 --> 00:11:12.210
I can talk about these personal
things that I know in my life

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.370
and not feel like I'm
having to train someone

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.780
to be like, it's OK,
this is my experience,

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.840
or move my comedy towards
their point of view

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.319
because that's their reference,
and that's their perspective.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.565
WILL CHOI: In terms
of comedy, yeah--

00:11:35.565 --> 00:11:36.430
I don't know.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.540
I'm trying to think about a
specific instance which is not

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:48.850
coming to my head at the moment,
but in terms of just seeing

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.650
some stuff on the page of--

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.660
OK, so I just thought
of something right now.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:58.270
There was a short sketch that
someone asked me to be in,

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:04.360
and she was like, hey, we
want you to do this character.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.130
It's a comedic sketch.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.970
The only thing is
we'd like you to do

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.280
a stereotypical Asian accent.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.880
And the fact that she said
"stereotypical Asian accent"

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.520
was one thing, but I was
just like, I'm sorry.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.450
I can't do that.

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.160
And she was like, oh, OK,
let me talk to my director,

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.070
and I'll call you back.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:28.990
And so she calls me
back 10 minutes later,

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.312
and she's like, hey,
talked to my director,

00:12:31.312 --> 00:12:35.086
we talked about
it, and we're not

00:12:35.086 --> 00:12:37.285
going to do an Asian
accent, realized

00:12:37.285 --> 00:12:39.843
that it didn't take away
from any of the comedy,

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:41.860
so you could just do it.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.280
And I was like, cool, I
hope you learned something.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.940
You know what I mean?

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:51.030
So there is the layer of the
comedy itself and the words,

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:55.730
and then they wanted to just
put up the accent aspect of it

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:57.490
to heighten it, I guess.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.160
But it doesn't do
anything for it.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:03.820
It actually makes it
worse, in a sense.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.280
So I was pretty proud of
myself to stand up to that,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.850
even though it was just
a quick, short sketch.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:17.450
But that is
essentially what a lot

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:19.250
of people who are
in the industry

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:25.340
are dealing with when it comes
to accents and stuff like that.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.220
KIM COOPER: Yeah.

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.840
It feels like a lot of the
things that I get sent out for

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.070
are specifically
something, dash, ethnic.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:38.630
It's like, "friend, dash,
ethnic," not just "friend."

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:46.050
And yeah, that is a hard, weird
thing, because you're like,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.970
well, I'm more than ethnic.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:51.082
I can just be a friend too.

00:13:51.082 --> 00:13:53.540
And I think that, especially
in Hollywood, something that's

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.340
interesting that I've noticed
too is a lot of things

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.110
that I get sent out
for, they specifically

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.650
are looking for an Asian
person or an ethnic person.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:05.920
But then the lead of that
show is still a white person.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.370
And so that propagates
this idea that people

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.690
of color or Asian people
only populate a world that

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.720
centers around white people.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.460
And so sometimes, that just
feels like a hard thing

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.770
to be having to consider
when you go on an audition,

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:28.050
or you get sent on an
audition, and if you get it,

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:29.890
and you're like, oh,
thank god, they're

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:31.810
not asking my to do an
accent, which I'm also

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:33.250
very uncomfortable doing.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.095
I'm from Iowa.

00:14:34.095 --> 00:14:35.512
My parents are white.

00:14:35.512 --> 00:14:36.011
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:39.060
I have a very Midwestern
life experience.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:42.364
But then on top of that,
it's like, aw, man, yeah,

00:14:42.364 --> 00:14:43.030
that's a bummer.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.740
Just a reminder, again,
that this is not my world.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.460
I just am also
here, dash, ethnic.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.540
KEIKO AGENA: Also, if you
asked us to go down the line

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.226
and do our Asian accents,
we all suck at them.

00:14:57.226 --> 00:14:59.580
I guarantee it.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.420
WILL CHOI: Guaranteed.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.740
KEIKO AGENA: I think I only
can do stereotypical Asian, not

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.686
country-specific.

00:15:06.686 --> 00:15:11.170
I'm like, [? that-- ?] what
are you going for, Keiko?

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.670
It's not good.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.170
What are we doing?

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:19.170
I'm sick, so I'm going to be
asking that every five minutes.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:22.078
WILL CHOI: Keiko is sick, so
we're happy that she's here.

00:15:22.078 --> 00:15:24.320
KEIKO AGENA: Too much honesty.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.120
JEREMY: Well, thanks
for still joining us.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.240
And honesty always
is appreciated.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.610
All right.

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.410
I think that's good.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:38.500
So speaking of
these stereotypes,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.090
how do you feel that your
comedy helps to address it

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:46.613
or to help combat that issue?

00:15:46.613 --> 00:15:50.920
WILL CHOI: I mean, we have a
lot of very talented writers

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.507
and performers at our show.

00:15:52.507 --> 00:15:53.590
Kay is one of the writers.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.070
KEIKO AGENA: I
love Kay's writing.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:16:00.010
WILL CHOI: And a lot of our
sketches that we do actually

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.330
have to do with race,
but some of them do.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:06.230
And the ones that deal with
race in a very smart way

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:08.590
are the ones that I
gravitate towards.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:16.020
And they'll address it, and I
can't even really explain it.

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:21.340
But they'll find ways
to kind of flip things

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:23.480
on its head a little bit.

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:26.380
And, yeah, I don't
know, that's the stuff

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.952
that I really like a lot.

00:16:28.952 --> 00:16:32.620
You know, it's not just
people doing bad accents

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.835
and being weird or
anything like that.

00:16:34.835 --> 00:16:35.660
It's smart.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:37.340
It's really smart comedy.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.730
And Zac's a writer too.

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:40.561
ZAC OYAMA: Yeah.

00:16:40.561 --> 00:16:41.060
Oh, hey.

00:16:44.695 --> 00:16:47.430
You know, most of
us up here do improv

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:54.160
and almost never it comes up
in shows I do that I'm Asian.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.610
I just like to do
what I think is funny

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:01.090
and usually almost never
have to comment on it.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.109
And, you know,
comedically, I think

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.970
just being a funny person
is what I gravitate to,

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.345
trying to do.

00:17:11.345 --> 00:17:13.045
And then, yeah,
like talking about,

00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:15.876
like, I usually won't
write a sketch that

00:17:15.876 --> 00:17:17.625
has to do with being
Asian, unless there's

00:17:17.625 --> 00:17:19.160
like an actual point to it.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.339
Like you were saying
when me and a coworker

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.273
wrote a sketch that was like--

00:17:24.273 --> 00:17:26.560
I forget like the
exact title, but it's

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.200
like am I Asian enough?

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.910
And there's like this panel
talking to a guy who's

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.962
like an eighth Asian.

00:17:32.962 --> 00:17:34.420
And he's like trying
to figure out,

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.000
can I say the three Korean
phrases I know or does

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.990
that seem racist?

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:43.630
Can I-- you know, like asking
sort of stereotypical questions

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.880
about being Asian
just because like,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.570
you know, there is sort of a
weirdness to being half or part

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.670
Asian, like what is OK?

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.150
Is that question weird?

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.050
What is OK?

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.680
Because it is like
who you are too.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.560
KAY KAANAPU: Yeah, and I think
when it comes to writing, just

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.160
the fact that you
can write a character

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.730
and then not refer
to their culture

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.655
or make the story
about their culture

00:18:15.655 --> 00:18:17.735
or their ethnic
experience and they still

00:18:17.735 --> 00:18:18.850
can be an ethnic person.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:22.980
Like, I have written
a bunch of TV pilots.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.280
And whenever I table
read them, I always

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.910
have like 100% diverse cast.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.970
And the only time that I
will change a description

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.890
to put that they're actually
ethnic in the description

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.050
is when I send it out
to readers so they

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.770
know I expect a person of
color to be in that part.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.040
But the actual
story and dialogue

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.400
has nothing to do
with their ethnicity.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.580
So for me the whole idea
is like you can just

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.750
write about people, and
you can just cast people.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:59.770
You don't have to default
into, like, OK, it

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.090
didn't say an ethnicity here
so they must be Caucasian.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:06.050
KEIKO AGENA: Default
Caucasian [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:09.640
KIM COOPER: Yeah, my friend
and I wrote a web series.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.840
And she's black and I'm Asian.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.120
And our aim was not, like,
to make it about that.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:19.954
We were like, we are women
of color living in this world

00:19:19.954 --> 00:19:20.620
that we live in.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.480
So, of course, some
of our experiences

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.700
do have to do with that.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.350
Some of the experiences
in all of our lives

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:28.990
do have to do with
our experiences

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.050
as Asian-American
people, but that's

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.060
not the totality
of our experiences.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.380
And that's not the
totality of we are.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.710
And I think it's
really important--

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.305
and that's what is also great
about like, for example, shows

00:19:41.305 --> 00:19:42.526
like "Fresh Off The Boat."

00:19:42.526 --> 00:19:43.950
Like, not everything
in that show

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:46.240
is about them being
Chinese immigrants.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.400
Like, there are
things in that show

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.484
that's just like, the mom
doesn't want one of the kids

00:19:52.484 --> 00:19:53.825
to eat a bunch of sugar.

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:55.986
Like, all y'all know about that.

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:57.970
Like, that happens to all of us.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.760
Like, that's not an
exclusively Asian-American

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.796
or Asian or immigrant
or Taiwanese experience.

00:20:04.796 --> 00:20:06.670
Like that's something
that's still relatable.

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.220
And I think that
for me when I write

00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.510
is really like what I think
is great is like, you know,

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:15.330
it is important
to me to represent

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:18.099
for Asian-American people
and to share the experiences

00:20:18.099 --> 00:20:18.640
that we have.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:21.248
But it's also important to be
like, hey, remember that thing?

00:20:21.248 --> 00:20:23.456
Sometimes you put on your
pants, and they don't quite

00:20:23.456 --> 00:20:24.469
fit right, right?

00:20:24.469 --> 00:20:26.260
Sometimes you can't
find an outfit to wear.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.170
Sometimes you get
a bad haircut too.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.340
Those are the things
that make us all people.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.990
WILL CHOI: At our recent show,
Eugene Cordero was originally

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:41.040
supposed to be here, he showed
a short film that he wrote.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.560
And the short was about--

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.560
he's Filipino, and it was
about, like, this Filipino like

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.590
folklore thing about like
this monster that eats babies,

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.510
right?

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.610
And so like even
that kind of stuff,

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.430
and to be able to show
that at "Asian AF,"

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.420
it's like informative,
but funny.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.470
You know, and it's like
I learned something

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.840
about Filipino
culture that night.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.640
You know?

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.760
It's just like a really
cool, like I said,

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.420
it's a celebration of
Asian cultures and stuff.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:18.580
So that's-- I think that's
how we combat a stereotypical

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:23.720
Asian, like the stereotypes when
it comes to Asians and comedy.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.630
It's like the way
that we're doing

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:30.410
it is just like showing
the audience like,

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.040
this is what is funny.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.710
It has nothing to do with
like stereotypical stuff.

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.179
But it still has to do
with Asian culture, which

00:21:39.179 --> 00:21:39.804
is really cool.

00:21:39.804 --> 00:21:42.640
KEIKO AGENA: [INAUDIBLE]
Oh yeah, one more thing

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:48.020
is that as far as like combating
these issues through comedy,

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.200
I don't know what everybody's
experience of this is,

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.110
but I do know that
sometimes in the past,

00:21:53.110 --> 00:22:00.400
there have been Asian projects
that come out that maybe don't

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.970
make you laugh or aren't good.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:06.482
And then you feel like
you have to support it.

00:22:06.482 --> 00:22:07.690
And I was never good at that.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.040
I don't really like to
do that, unfortunately.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.800
So that's what was
fun about "Asian AF,"

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:23.680
and I think that's always the
goal is that nobody gets pass.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.680
Do you know what I mean?

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.960
Like, I'm not going to just--

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:30.000
we're not going to like it just
because it's Asian and say, oh,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.320
isn't this great and pat
each other on the back.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.180
I mean, it still
has to be funny.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.250
It has to be genuinely funny.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:39.130
Otherwise, I wouldn't
be a part of it.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:45.571
And I think that's
what I appreciate

00:22:45.571 --> 00:22:46.770
about the other people.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:48.340
And the UCB too,
I mean, the reason

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:53.710
why it's got a home at the UCB
is that the standards of UCB

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:54.800
are very high.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.050
And that's why, you
know, part of why

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.800
we're in there and learning
and getting better.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.900
And these are people who
get to perform there.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.140
So that was just important
to me as far as someone

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.660
coming to a project like this.

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.640
And I think also it's
funny because sometimes

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.030
that's the first thing
people think when they hear,

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.035
oh, it's an Asian show.

00:23:14.035 --> 00:23:16.394
Oh, it's probably just eh.

00:23:16.394 --> 00:23:17.339
You know?

00:23:17.339 --> 00:23:18.880
Like, you almost,
yeah, that's right.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.890
That's what I used to think.

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:21.550
That's why I used to
think, oh, they're

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.664
probably just giving a pass to
a bunch of sketches that are

00:23:24.664 --> 00:23:26.440
just like, you know, only OK.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.092
And so that's why--

00:23:28.092 --> 00:23:30.300
I forget that because now
it's been going for so long

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.466
that I go, no, that's great.

00:23:31.466 --> 00:23:33.811
I love the show.

00:23:33.811 --> 00:23:34.686
What as the question?

00:23:34.686 --> 00:23:37.797
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:37.797 --> 00:23:39.672
JEREMY: All right, so
I'm going to open it up

00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:42.580
to the floor for any
questions you might have.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.790
But I do have one more
question before I throw it out

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.340
to your all.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:49.500
So in the show
particularly, what

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.880
are some of your favorite
jokes or sketches

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.139
that have come out of it?

00:23:56.139 --> 00:23:57.555
KAY KAANAPU: "Ghost
in the Shell--

00:23:57.555 --> 00:24:02.460
The Musical" where they--

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.978
Will, you wrote it with Mike?

00:24:03.978 --> 00:24:07.500
WILL CHOI: Yeah, I wrote it
with Mike Lane and Tess Paras.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.780
KAY KAANAPU: Yeah, it's
pretty much "Wizard of Oz,"

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.425
but yeah, with
"Ghost in the Shell"

00:24:13.425 --> 00:24:17.162
and all these people,
Tilda and Matt and--

00:24:17.162 --> 00:24:18.870
KEIKO AGENA: They all
make an appearance.

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:19.450
KAY KAANAPU: They all
make an appearance.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.408
KEIKO AGENA: It's so nice
of them to come down.

00:24:21.408 --> 00:24:23.295
WILL CHOI: Yeah,
it was very nice.

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:26.280
It was right when
the movie came out.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.870
And Mike, Tess, and I, we
had not watched the movie

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.710
or knew anything
about the anime.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.740
So we just wrote a
musical based off what

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.350
we thought the movie was about.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.967
And so it was about
like these characters.

00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:43.092
KEIKO AGENA: So close, too.

00:24:43.092 --> 00:24:43.588
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:43.588 --> 00:24:45.504
WILL CHOI: It was really
accurately, actually.

00:24:45.504 --> 00:24:49.020
And it's these four
characters, and they're looking

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.370
for the ghost in the shell.

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:53.255
And they have to take the
yellow face road to get there.

00:24:53.255 --> 00:24:58.440
And it was-- it went
over really well.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.100
But, yeah, it's--

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:07.140
I can't say if there was any
specific moment or joke--

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:08.310
KAY KAANAPU: I have one.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:09.101
WILL CHOI: --that--

00:25:09.101 --> 00:25:11.460
KEIKO AGENA: Go [? Kay. ?]

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.190
KIM COOPER: One of
the funniest things

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:20.095
I feel like I have seen at
UCB was [? Gibonnie. ?] Shout

00:25:20.095 --> 00:25:22.770
out to [? Gibonnie. ?] She did--

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.491
she did a character that was
one of the-- what, was a plate?

00:25:26.491 --> 00:25:27.615
WILL CHOI: She was a plate.

00:25:27.615 --> 00:25:29.830
KIM COOPER: She was a plate
from "Beauty and the Beast"

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:30.770
from the "Be Our
Guest," you know,

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.400
when all the plates are dancing.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.655
This is a plate.

00:25:33.655 --> 00:25:34.530
This is a plate also.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:37.188
So like, who's to say?

00:25:37.188 --> 00:25:39.718
Who's to say what
race this plate is?

00:25:39.718 --> 00:25:40.984
But she-- it was so funny.

00:25:40.984 --> 00:25:42.900
It didn't have nothing
to do with race at all.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:48.720
But it was this plate that like
was like lamenting how strict

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.266
and how hard it was to be
a plate living in "Beauty

00:25:52.266 --> 00:25:54.890
and the Beast" and like all the
training they had to go through

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.625
to learn this dance,
[? like, you need therapy. ?]

00:25:56.625 --> 00:25:57.916
KEIKO AGENA: --fucking nut job.

00:25:57.916 --> 00:26:00.880
KIM COOPER: Yeah, and it
was so-- like I had tears.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.133
It was so funny.

00:26:02.133 --> 00:26:05.080
And it was also like,
yeah, it had nothing at all

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:07.320
to do with race
and [? Gibonnie ?]

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.466
is just a very smart,
[INAUDIBLE] woman.

00:26:09.466 --> 00:26:10.695
KEIKO AGENA: She's also
a special performer.

00:26:10.695 --> 00:26:11.200
She's so good.

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.780
KIM COOPER: Yeah,
she's very, very good.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.405
It was amazing.

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:15.500
Shout out to you,
[? Gibonnie. ?]

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:19.116
WILL CHOI: Yeah, I
mean, like for me,

00:26:19.116 --> 00:26:21.490
there's so many great moments
that we've had in the show,

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:24.660
and the improv is
great and sketches

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:25.810
and stand-up and stuff.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:31.676
But for me when I look at
the totality of the show,

00:26:31.676 --> 00:26:34.590
the thing that I like
the most is the diversity

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:38.670
amongst the Asian community
that's in both the audience

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.630
and on stage.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:44.880
Because you see these performers
do improv together or sketch

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.120
together, and it's like East
Asian, and Southeast Asian,

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.910
South Asian, mixed
race, you know,

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.040
our show features
majority women, you know.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.910
And it's like such a cool
experience to see that on stage

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.030
and see how much
diversity there is

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.820
within the
Asian-American community.

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.360
And so yeah, it's so
hard for me to say

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.130
which specific moment there is.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.070
But when I just look
up on that stage

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.350
and I see how different
everyone looks,

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.770
yet, we're all under
the same umbrella.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:26.131
It makes me very
happy to see that.

00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:28.380
ZAC OYAMA: How many times
have you guys heard the word

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.205
totality in the last two days?

00:27:30.205 --> 00:27:31.075
WILL CHOI: Oh, yeah.

00:27:31.075 --> 00:27:31.575
Oh, yeah.

00:27:31.575 --> 00:27:33.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.890
ZAC OYAMA: Yeah,
similarly, like it's

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:39.060
hard to describe improv scenes
without sounding insane.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.139
KEIKO AGENA: I know.

00:27:40.139 --> 00:27:41.055
[? The ?] [? worst. ?]

00:27:41.055 --> 00:27:43.260
ZAC OYAMA: I mean, you have
very funny improv shows,

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.615
to me, if I were to--
it'd be like, I was a cat,

00:27:46.615 --> 00:27:48.820
and then there were eagles.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:51.000
It doesn't translate
in this conversation.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.400
But they're very fun.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.680
And what you're saying
about like the difference

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.860
of like Asian
experiences, I feel

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.480
like that's been like
such a fun challenge

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.440
and thing to figure
out with these shows

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.555
is like, we're all coming
from such different places.

00:28:05.555 --> 00:28:09.980
And there's maybe not as
much shared language there,

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:15.513
so to speak, that lends itself
to being on the same page,

00:28:15.513 --> 00:28:16.670
copy wise.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:19.670
But like, that is something
that we're actively

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:21.506
learning from and figuring out.

00:28:21.506 --> 00:28:24.654
It's been fun.

00:28:24.654 --> 00:28:25.320
JEREMY: Awesome.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:25.820
Thank you.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.531
ZAC OYAMA: What were
we talking about?

00:28:27.531 --> 00:28:30.020
KIM COOPER: What
was the question?

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.684
JEREMY: All right, let's go
to open it up to the floor.

00:28:33.684 --> 00:28:37.058
Anybody have any
questions. [? Liliana? ?]

00:28:37.058 --> 00:28:38.986
AUDIENCE: Yeah, do I
need a mic, I mean?

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:43.507 --> 00:28:44.840
KIM COOPER: Gmail, are you here?

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.380
KEIKO AGENA: Gmail?

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:48.420
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.795
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:28:49.795 --> 00:28:53.420
So with so much great talent
and all of the great writers,

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.210
how does it work?

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.107
Do you have like a
testing lab or like

00:28:57.107 --> 00:28:59.440
do you just present in front
of each other all the jokes

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.240
and then figure out which one
is actually going into the show?

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.790
How do you see all
the goodness that's

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:06.864
going into each of the shows?

00:29:06.864 --> 00:29:08.530
KIM COOPER: A testing
lab would be cool.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:09.420
We should get that.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.818
WILL CHOI: Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:10.818 --> 00:29:12.682
KEIKO AGENA: Can we be here?

00:29:12.682 --> 00:29:17.140
WILL CHOI: Yeah, can we figure
out how to do that here?

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:21.200
No, you know,
actually, the process

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.930
is people, when it
comes to sketches,

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:25.820
they'll write
their own sketches.

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.340
Or they have done sketches
in previous shows,

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.830
and they'll submit it to us.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.530
Keiko and I, we are the
ones that are producing,

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:37.670
so we'll read them, and we'll
kind of like see if, you know,

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:42.420
it hits a certain
standard that we like.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.920
And so that's how
the sketches work.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.370
With the improv, we
have one improv team

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.690
called [? Goldtron ?] which
Zac and Kim are both on.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.940
And they're all
Asian-American UCB performers.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:01.140
And that improv is
made up on the fly.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.932
So there's no rehearsing there.

00:30:02.932 --> 00:30:05.015
KIM COOPER: There's no way
to know what we'll say.

00:30:05.015 --> 00:30:07.306
WILL CHOI: Yeah, you never
know what's going to happen,

00:30:07.306 --> 00:30:08.906
but they--

00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:12.320
"Asian AF" is their
monthly slot to perform.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.710
And then with
stand-ups, it's usually,

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:23.450
you know, it's people submitting
it like this one kid I saw,

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.510
he's a half-Chinese,
half-black comedian.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.625
And he's still in college.

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:30.020
And I saw him do a
three-minute open mic.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:32.210
And I was like, I have to
get this guy on the show.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.130
He was solid.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:34.664
And he killed it.

00:30:34.664 --> 00:30:36.830
KIM COOPER: Wasn't he here
on his like summer break?

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:37.292
KEIKO AGENA: Yes.

00:30:37.292 --> 00:30:38.680
WILL CHOI: He was here for
summer break for college.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.770
KEIKO AGENA: Yes, he's too
young and too good, man.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:41.900
WILL CHOI: But, yeah,
there's different

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.941
kind of ways to kind of--
some people will submit

00:30:43.941 --> 00:30:47.340
and they'll show me
their stand-up set

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.370
and so I'll be like,
great, I want this person

00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:53.630
or [? recommendations. ?]
And then there's just

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:57.780
other various ways of people
to like get on to the show,

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:01.140
whether it's we just ask them
to do a favor and be like,

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.000
hey, you're a dancer, can you do
this dancing thing or whatever?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.440
So it's a little
hodge-podgy in terms

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.450
of getting a show
together, but usually it

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:16.299
comes together very nicely once
the night of the show happens.

00:31:16.299 --> 00:31:18.840
KEIKO AGENA: And I was going to
add one thing really quickly.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.423
Will is really good
about reaching out

00:31:20.423 --> 00:31:22.490
to people in the
Asian-American community that

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:25.750
are in the entertainment world,
even if he doesn't know them.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:29.540
And so we've gotten,
like, Margaret Cho's

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.920
been on the show
and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:33.937
I mean, that part has
been part of it too.

00:31:33.937 --> 00:31:35.520
WILL CHOI: Yeah,
yeah, just the people

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.140
who have been interested
in being on this show

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.220
has kind raised the
level of "Asian AF,"

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:47.351
like so Margaret Cho, Sheng
Wang, Aparna Nancherla,

00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:49.660
Joel Kim Booster.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.150
And just so many great
actors have been a part of it

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.900
and want to be in
the show as well.

00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:56.770
And we just haven't
had the scheduling

00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:58.280
yet for them to come on.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.696
KEIKO AGENA: Yeah,
there are a lot

00:31:59.696 --> 00:32:02.130
of people that are in the
"as soon as time permits,"

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.600
they'll get on the show.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.058
WILL CHOI: And it's
really exciting

00:32:04.058 --> 00:32:07.840
because we have great guests
lined up in future months

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.580
that I can't announce just yet.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:12.806
But we can also announce
that Ronny Chieng, who

00:32:12.806 --> 00:32:14.180
is from "The Daily
Show" is going

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:18.350
to be doing stand-up at Asian
AF New York next month, which

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.520
is very exciting.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.600
But yeah, it's a
really cool thing

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.740
to see how excited everyone
is, not just audience members,

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:31.530
but also performers and
kind of well-known people

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:35.200
who want to be a part of
this thing that we're doing.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.310
And we're seeing it in LA,
both in LA and New York.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:43.060
Dan Lee and Alex
Song are the hosts

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.770
in New York,
producers in New York.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.985
And they're doing a great
job at kind of building

00:32:46.985 --> 00:32:50.516
that community out there too.

00:32:50.516 --> 00:32:52.709
I feel like I talked a lot.

00:32:52.709 --> 00:32:54.917
KEIKO AGENA: No, that's
good. [? That was a good-- ?]

00:32:54.917 --> 00:32:57.851
[? that was the question. ?]

00:32:57.851 --> 00:32:59.807
JEREMY: Any-- oh,
any other questions?

00:32:59.807 --> 00:33:01.274
ZAC OYAMA: Any other questions?

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.120
AUDIENCE: So when you're
coming up with humor,

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:11.524
how do you decide sort
of what is allowed?

00:33:11.524 --> 00:33:13.315
Because whenever you
make a joke, you know,

00:33:13.315 --> 00:33:15.070
there's obviously
a tension making

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:16.695
people feel a little
bit uncomfortable,

00:33:16.695 --> 00:33:18.194
but then at the
same time, you don't

00:33:18.194 --> 00:33:19.950
want to cross the
line wherever that is.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.150
So like as an Asian
person, sometimes I'll

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.130
tell a joke in front
of my white friends.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:26.037
And then I'll say,
wait, but I don't

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:28.422
want you to think that
you're allowed to say that.

00:33:28.422 --> 00:33:30.330
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:33.580
So, you know, if you don't
know them especially.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.367
So how do you balance that?

00:33:37.367 --> 00:33:38.408
KEIKO AGENA: She's ready.

00:33:38.408 --> 00:33:39.910
She's ready.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:40.770
Kim is ready.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:42.014
KIM COOPER: Oh no, I just--

00:33:42.014 --> 00:33:45.190
I want to share from
my own experience,

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.350
because I have run into
that a lot in my life too.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:50.307
And like I mentioned
before, a lot

00:33:50.307 --> 00:33:53.690
of how I ended up coming to
comedy when I was younger

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.930
was making jokes
about being Asian

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.660
and at the expense of my being
Asian which, as an adult,

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.880
I'm like, hey man, wish
you hadn't done that.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.520
But I think it is hard
sometimes for people

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:12.139
to know that it's like, oh
yeah, you can't do that too.

00:34:12.139 --> 00:34:16.424
But for us-- and I'll only
speak for myself here--

00:34:16.424 --> 00:34:20.710
in our adult lives, I
was at a show recently.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.500
We have the unique
experience that most

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:27.699
of the time, our audience
is a lot of Asian people,

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.610
a lot of Asian-American people.

00:34:29.610 --> 00:34:31.370
And so that gives
us, I think, a luxury

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:33.800
that we don't have all
the time to do stuff

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:37.909
that feels like it
would maybe not hit

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.159
if it was a different crowd.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:45.889
We did a show recently,
all Asian people.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:49.400
And the suggestion
was banana, which

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.895
like, at least in
my experience, is

00:34:52.895 --> 00:34:56.600
something people call an
East Asian person when

00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.480
they are yellow on the outside
and white on the inside.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.940
And when we got the
suggestion, I was like banana!

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.320
And then I was like,
if I do this right now,

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.850
it might alienate the
audience who is mostly white.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.830
And I was like, I don't want
them to feel like they messed

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:13.880
up or that they said--
because they didn't--

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:15.755
I'm sure that person,
whoever suggested that,

00:35:15.755 --> 00:35:19.014
didn't mean it as
like, you're a banana.

00:35:19.014 --> 00:35:21.156
KEIKO AGENA: They were
just thinking of a banana.

00:35:21.156 --> 00:35:23.156
KIM COOPER: They were
just like, I love bananas.

00:35:23.156 --> 00:35:25.231
It's my favorite fruit, snack.

00:35:25.231 --> 00:35:27.596
It's healthy for
you, love potassium.

00:35:27.596 --> 00:35:29.980
And it was like one
of those situations

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.709
where I was like,
not exactly, oh,

00:35:31.709 --> 00:35:34.250
making sure that they can't say
that as well, but like making

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.800
sure that like I
didn't want to like

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.330
alienate people in that moment.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.943
So I was like, I want you guys
to still like laugh and have

00:35:41.943 --> 00:35:44.151
a good time at this improv
show, not feel like you're

00:35:44.151 --> 00:35:45.290
being chastised for that.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:48.938
That was like a really
interesting thing.

00:35:48.938 --> 00:35:51.400
ZAC OYAMA: I feel
like, yeah, like

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.040
as far as like making a joke
about myself, I can do that.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.190
Like, I usually don't,
but if something comes up

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.630
where it's like--

00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:05.100
you know, people want to get
food or something and I'm like,

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.342
I want to get ramen or whatever
and there's a joke there,

00:36:08.342 --> 00:36:10.697
maybe I'll make it.

00:36:10.697 --> 00:36:12.615
But if I'm in a
situation where it's

00:36:12.615 --> 00:36:16.910
like we're trying to parse
out if like a white person can

00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:20.616
make the joke at me, the
answer is almost always no.

00:36:20.616 --> 00:36:23.670
And so like, it's
not really on you.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.630
They should know that.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.830
It should be obvious.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:32.055
And I think people can do a
better job of calling people

00:36:32.055 --> 00:36:32.760
out on that.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.302
I don't know.

00:36:33.302 --> 00:36:34.176
[? AUDIENCE: ?] Yeah.

00:36:34.176 --> 00:36:35.100
ZAC OYAMA: Yeah.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.950
So just be really
mean to your friends.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:41.570
[? AUDIENCE: ?] Don't be
mean, they're friends.

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.159
WILL CHOI: Best advice,
best advice of the day.

00:36:44.159 --> 00:36:46.405
KEIKO AGENA: Is that
how we're wrapping?

00:36:46.405 --> 00:36:47.902
KIM COOPER: Alienate
your friends.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.460
AUDIENCE: So my question
is around content

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.200
created by people of color.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.780
What are some of your
recommendations for podcasts,

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:01.100
movies, film, comedy
that you particularly

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:03.920
like that are created
by people of color?

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.295
KEIKO AGENA: Oh,
that's good one.

00:37:11.325 --> 00:37:13.200
ZAC OYAMA: [? I'll ?]
[? think about this. ?]

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.406
WILL CHOI: Collegehumor.com.

00:37:14.406 --> 00:37:15.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:19.372
KIM COOPER: The guy
who called Zac Oyama.

00:37:19.372 --> 00:37:22.820
He loves ramen.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.170
Needs help with his Gmail?

00:37:27.495 --> 00:37:29.700
ZAC OYAMA: I mean,
this is just--

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.285
no one is-- this is a
kind of an obvious one.

00:37:33.285 --> 00:37:35.890
I used work on the
show "Key &amp; Peele."

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:40.405
And I felt like the
ways in which they

00:37:40.405 --> 00:37:42.530
were able to comment on
race and not comment on it,

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:46.210
and like the amount of
material they were able to mine

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:51.950
from specific, you know,
racially-charged scenarios

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.490
I found very inspiring
for sketch comedy

00:37:55.490 --> 00:38:01.090
and have since been trying
to apply it when I can.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:02.920
WILL CHOI: In terms
of podcasts, there's

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:08.320
a podcast collective called
the "Potluck Podcast," which

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:15.640
is maybe like eight or 10
Asian-American hosted podcasts

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:20.560
that, you know, cover a
range of different topics.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:24.670
Keiko and I have a podcast
that is a part of that.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.880
And, yeah, if you
check that out, there's

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:33.556
just a lot of different
podcasts that you could

00:38:33.556 --> 00:38:36.400
see that have Asian-American
hosts, which, I think,

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.610
in the podcast world, it's
pretty white-dominated,

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:42.580
at least the popular ones are.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.510
So it's just one resource.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:49.350
I'm sure there are also others,
but that's just one resource

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.030
that people can
look up podcasts.

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:54.600
"Potluck Podcast,"
that's what it's called.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:57.400
KEIKO AGENA: This is not
controversial or helpful

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.550
at all, but this is honest.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.193
"So You Think You Can Dance--"

00:39:01.193 --> 00:39:02.026
[? AUDIENCE: ?] Woo.

00:39:02.026 --> 00:39:03.276
KEIKO AGENA: --is like-- what?

00:39:03.276 --> 00:39:06.210
It's like one of
my favorite shows.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.450
I watch it all the time.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:10.010
There's so many friggin'
Asian people show right now.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.977
There's Lex Ishimoto.

00:39:10.977 --> 00:39:11.560
There's Dassy.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.930
There's Koi-nay.

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:15.460
There's Marko.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:18.960
It's like half Asian, I think.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:22.840
And then there's other
diversity on there too.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.823
Damn, I love dance.

00:39:26.823 --> 00:39:30.760
Oh, you already had it too.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.650
KIM COOPER: I would say
my favorite ones are

00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:35.964
very obvious and not
controversial at all also.

00:39:35.964 --> 00:39:38.380
I think Aziz Ansari is a genius.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.950
I think that Mindy
Kaling is a genius.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:43.030
I think that Ali
Wong is a genius.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:47.555
And I think it's really
important when people-- like,

00:39:47.555 --> 00:39:48.580
I'm so annoying.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.740
Whenever my friends bring
up one of those people,

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.490
I'm like, yeah,
and they're Asian.

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:59.620
Like, note it's not like
about them being Asian.

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.920
But note that you--

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.350
this is like me talking to
like a white person-- like,

00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:08.590
note that you as a white
person still like their comedy.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.483
And sometimes it is--
this is the same thing

00:40:11.483 --> 00:40:12.340
that I said before.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:17.026
Sometimes-- I think Aziz does
a really good job of this,

00:40:17.026 --> 00:40:18.900
like, you know, talks
about like being Muslim

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.510
and his experiences with
his parents finding out

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.780
that he eats bacon and eats
pork and stuff like that,

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:28.349
but then also being like,
hey, I like this girl.

00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:30.390
She doesn't like me back,
or she has a boyfriend.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.930
That's hard.

00:40:30.930 --> 00:40:36.480
And using those as like
opportunities to like learn.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.195
And yeah whenever people
are like Ali Wong's

00:40:39.195 --> 00:40:41.070
stand-up special is so
funny, I'm like, yeah,

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.240
it's great how she could
talk about, you know,

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.030
her experiences
as an Asian woman

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.630
and also talk about
her experiences

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:51.150
as a woman and mainstreaming
things like her pregnancy

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.770
and miscarriage and like other
things like that and then

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:58.810
also just be like one of
the stand-ups of all time.

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.010
Oh, you don't want to?

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.510
OK.

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.460
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.060
KAY KAANAPU: You
guys took all mine.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:12.940
But I did actually just see
Hasan Minhaj's Netflix comedy

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.290
special and man, that was good.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:18.280
Like, not just like
comedically, but the drama

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:22.510
that he had talking about like
his family and his experience

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.500
and then being able
to flip like getting

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:30.106
laughs off of like moments where
he was almost close to tears.

00:41:30.106 --> 00:41:32.210
I also have to
say "Key &amp; Peele."

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.420
Like, I loved "Key &amp; Peele."

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.935
Stuff like that makes
me feel like gooey

00:41:36.935 --> 00:41:39.520
and warm inside because
it just feels so funny

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.900
and like cathartic.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:45.620
I once saw Keegan Michael
Key in an improv show

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.640
at [? IOS ?] like years ago.

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.590
And the range of
characters that he did just

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:55.490
like in one 15-minute
set, it was just amazing.

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:59.139
So yeah, so Keegan Michael Key
and Hasan Minhaj is what I got.

00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:00.430
KIM COOPER: Can I say one more?

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.240
KEIKO AGENA: "Insecure"
is great too.

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.560
KIM COOPER: Yeah and also--

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.300
truly, this is not
a plug for the show,

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.550
but it is a plug for the show.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.850
Like, a lot of the people
that have been on the show

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:15.130
and come through the
show, especially people

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.820
who are not as well known
or who are like newer

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.410
in their careers, it's
really cool and inspiring

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:26.904
to see them and like--

00:42:26.904 --> 00:42:27.945
ZAC OYAMA: At "Asian AF"?

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:30.236
KIM COOPER: Yeah, at "Asian
AF at the Upright Citizens'

00:42:30.236 --> 00:42:31.964
Brigade Theatre on
Sunset Boulevard.

00:42:31.964 --> 00:42:33.420
But it's just really cool.

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.950
And you'd see so much talent.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.370
And you're like, hey, why
aren't you on a TV show?

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:41.375
Hey, why don't you have an
hour special on Comedy Central

00:42:41.375 --> 00:42:43.900
or wherever they have
stand-up shows, on Netflix.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.108
KEIKO AGENA: I have two more.

00:42:45.108 --> 00:42:45.970
This is a like--

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.692
"Superstore" does a great job.

00:42:47.692 --> 00:42:49.400
I like all the characters
on "Superstore"

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.740
as far as the comedy.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.780
I'll give a shout-out
to "13 Reasons Why,"

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:54.019
which I got to be a part of.

00:42:54.019 --> 00:42:55.060
It's kind of a dark show.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:57.190
But the way that
that show was cast,

00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:59.034
it was based upon
the book, and it

00:42:59.034 --> 00:43:00.950
wasn't written necessarily
ethnically diverse,

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:04.090
but the way that cast it was.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:06.191
And it's doing really well.

00:43:06.191 --> 00:43:07.125
KAY KAANAPU: Oh wait.

00:43:07.125 --> 00:43:11.650
And-- "Black-ish," "Black-ish"
and "Fresh Off The Boat,"

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:14.300
awesome shows, especially
because it's like that,

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.270
you know, classic
family experience.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:18.831
So like, what, you
don't like these shows?

00:43:18.831 --> 00:43:20.080
What, you don't like families?

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:20.698
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:21.166
KIM COOPER: You hate families?

00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:23.506
KEIKO AGENA: [? We're ?]
against families, man.

00:43:23.506 --> 00:43:26.270
KAY KAANAPU: There's families
everywhere, so, yeah.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.962
WILL CHOI: Yeah, one
show that I really

00:43:27.962 --> 00:43:31.790
loved this past season was
"The Good Place" on NBC,

00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.570
a very diverse cast.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:38.300
And Manny Jacinto who
is Filipino-Chinese

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.400
is one of the main characters
of that show and actually

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.966
the "Asian AF" last
month, I think?

00:43:43.966 --> 00:43:44.716
KEIKO AGENA: Yeah.

00:43:44.716 --> 00:43:46.900
WILL CHOI: Last month
or two months ago.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:50.082
And yeah, I mean, it's--

00:43:50.082 --> 00:43:54.450
you know, lots of good
content out there now

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:59.890
that are trying to, you know,
work harder at being more

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.710
inclusive and more diverse.

00:44:01.710 --> 00:44:04.450
And just like,
lastly, "Asian AF,"

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:08.125
you see all these
great, great people who

00:44:08.125 --> 00:44:13.260
are on stage and who
are, like I said,

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.700
South Asian, Southeast Asian.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:19.772
We've had East
Asian and mixed race

00:44:19.772 --> 00:44:24.010
and, you know, all come from
a very different experience.

00:44:24.010 --> 00:44:29.383
And that's a great place to kind
of feel a sense of community,

00:44:29.383 --> 00:44:30.796
immediate community.

00:44:34.397 --> 00:44:36.230
JEREMY: Yeah, one last
question, [? Phil. ?]

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:37.938
KEIKO AGENA: Four
minutes, three minutes.

00:44:37.938 --> 00:44:40.450
AUDIENCE: [? Sorry ?] [? for ?]
[? jumping in. ?] So I was

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:43.210
wondering, like, what are some
ways beyond coming to the show

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:48.075
that we can support people who
are in the [INAUDIBLE]---- oh,

00:44:48.075 --> 00:44:48.682
for sure.

00:44:48.682 --> 00:44:50.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:52.710
KEIKO AGENA: Do you
like our PayPal?

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:53.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.560
KIM COOPER: [INAUDIBLE]
Zac's email.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.486
AUDIENCE: Yeah, well, I work
on YouTube so, unfortunately,

00:44:58.486 --> 00:45:00.320
[INAUDIBLE].

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:05.070
For people like us who are
at home with two small kids,

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.188
it's hard for us to get out.

00:45:07.188 --> 00:45:09.438
I mean, you can follow
people's Facebooks, Instagrams.

00:45:09.438 --> 00:45:11.074
I've heard casting
directors will

00:45:11.074 --> 00:45:12.804
look at people's
Instagrams to see

00:45:12.804 --> 00:45:14.512
how many followers
[? in the community ?]

00:45:14.512 --> 00:45:15.011
subscribe.

00:45:15.011 --> 00:45:18.500
Are there kinds of things
that we could possibly do?

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:21.100
KEIKO AGENA: Sign
those kids up too.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.375
Have them follow us.

00:45:22.375 --> 00:45:23.000
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.100
ZAC OYAMA: I think you
hit on a lot of it,

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:25.480
like, the idea of
supporting people online.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.670
If you can't make it out
to a show, like, obviously,

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:31.394
support people's Twitter
and Instagram and stuff.

00:45:31.394 --> 00:45:34.760
It feels funny to be
like, hey, follow me.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.760
But, yeah.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.760
Add Zac Oyama.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.620
And yeah, for "Asian AF" in
particular, I know Will--

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:46.940
I know they spend a lot of
money to try to make sure

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:50.920
that the show is recorded
in a way that looks good

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.695
and take pictures
that look good.

00:45:52.695 --> 00:45:53.960
And that costs money.

00:45:53.960 --> 00:46:00.530
And is it a Kickstarter or
some kind of thing that like--

00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:04.436
there's ways to support
financially if you want.

00:46:04.436 --> 00:46:06.890
And like, you know,
even just like if you

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:10.719
see something you like that
has Asian talent in it,

00:46:10.719 --> 00:46:11.510
you can share that.

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:14.146
You know, if you know,
you're not the type of person

00:46:14.146 --> 00:46:15.770
to share things
online, like, you know,

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:18.270
maybe support that in that way.

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:21.260
WILL CHOI: Yeah, in terms of
like the show specifically,

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:25.220
we haven't put any of our
content online just yet,

00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:26.160
hopefully soon.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:31.310
But we do have a PayPal
that is accepting donations

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:33.950
if you go to
asianafshow.com, you

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:37.611
can always let us rent
this space for free.

00:46:37.611 --> 00:46:38.593
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:38.593 --> 00:46:40.557
You guys have so much room here.

00:46:40.557 --> 00:46:41.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:42.330
But--

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.290
KIM COOPER: [? We need room ?]
for an idea lab.

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:47.109
KEIKO AGENA: Yeah,
where's our idea lab?

00:46:47.109 --> 00:46:48.400
We need to workshop some stuff.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.400
ZAC OYAMA: We're just
trying to figure out.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:52.041
Like, it would be helpful
if we could all surf today.

00:46:52.041 --> 00:46:52.983
KEIKO AGENA: Yeah.

00:46:52.983 --> 00:46:55.165
WILL CHOI: Guys, you
have the resources.

00:46:55.165 --> 00:46:56.280
Let us use it.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.910
KEIKO AGENA: You
have everything.

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:00.170
WILL CHOI: No, but,
yeah, there is--

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:05.330
you know, yeah, donations are
a great way for us to kind

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:06.310
keep the show alive.

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:10.800
And the donations that we've
gotten also pay for New York

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.770
too.

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:16.850
And shout out to Google New
York for letting us kind of--

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:18.550
we were just in
New York last week,

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:20.720
and they showed us
around, and they're

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.950
very supportive of the show.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:25.420
And they came out to the "Asian
AF" New York show and stuff,

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:25.920
so.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:33.000
But yeah, you know, hopefully
we'll get more content out

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.270
in the internet, but--

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:40.030
KIM COOPER: I would say also,
like, this is a little bit more

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:44.630
involved, but like if
you do see-- like on TV,

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:47.320
you're watching TV and like
a co-star or a guest star

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.750
is an Asian person, person of
color that you think is funny,

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:51.665
look them up.

00:47:51.665 --> 00:47:54.350
Look them up on IMDb,
then by their YouTube.com,

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:55.636
their social media.

00:47:55.636 --> 00:47:57.220
Find them on there.

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.750
But like a lot of people
create their own content.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:01.969
So although you might
see them from a TV show,

00:48:01.969 --> 00:48:03.385
you might see them
on YouTube, you

00:48:03.385 --> 00:48:06.960
might see them listed even
just on a lineup for "Asian

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:10.120
AF" or something like
that, so often they

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.600
have their own content.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:17.320
And I think it's important
to support that, share that,

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.410
truly the internet, Google.com.

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:21.740
It's good.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.074
WILL CHOI: Yeah.

00:48:24.074 --> 00:48:25.562
Yeah.

00:48:25.562 --> 00:48:26.612
Is there anyone?

00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:28.070
KAY KAANAPU: I
think also-- and you

00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:29.600
said you're a father, right?

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:33.080
So just, you know, allowing
like maybe your kids

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:36.430
just to like, you know,
support them and be-- let them

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.380
be creative in their own voice.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:43.920
Maybe even reach out to
your local Asian community.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:49.690
I know we've done the Comedy
Comedy Festival that Will also

00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:53.320
helps produce, and that's
an all-Asian comedy festival

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.570
they've had a couple of years.

00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:57.490
That was at the
Japanese-American Cultural

00:48:57.490 --> 00:48:58.396
Center.

00:48:58.396 --> 00:49:00.260
Like, reach out to
those communities

00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:06.680
and be involved with them,
and give the young people

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:10.940
the freedom to express their
voice as an Asian, as a person,

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:12.510
as a person of color.

00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:15.200
You know just allowing them
to be like, you fit in,

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.770
you belong here, you may not
see yourself up there yet,

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:23.081
but you are here, so you do
exist and help them be seen.

00:49:23.081 --> 00:49:25.069
KEIKO AGENA: So can
we get a commitment

00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:26.680
from you that you
will [INAUDIBLE]??

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.346
KAY KAANAPU: This
like our [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:28.346 --> 00:49:31.730
KEIKO AGENA: [INAUDIBLE] Oh OK.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:33.146
KIM COOPER: We've got two more.

00:49:33.146 --> 00:49:34.562
KEIKO AGENA: Two more.

00:49:34.562 --> 00:49:35.978
WILL CHOI: Two more, well--

00:49:35.978 --> 00:49:38.338
KEIKO AGENA: "Asian AF," 2032.

00:49:38.338 --> 00:49:42.230
WILL CHOI: But the most serious
thing that really, though, is

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:45.670
we want to use this space.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:50.320
So someone here--
someone here must

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.600
have some power to do this.

00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:54.524
Let's talk after this.

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:56.448
KIM COOPER: Throw
any [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:56.448 --> 00:49:58.749
WILL CHOI: Because
then we'll practice,

00:49:58.749 --> 00:49:59.915
and we'll do our shows here.

00:49:59.915 --> 00:50:01.930
And then you guys can
just watch it for free.

00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:02.680
KEIKO AGENA: Yeah.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:05.986
And we know at Google, you
want everything to come to you.

00:50:05.986 --> 00:50:06.652
WILL CHOI: Yeah.

00:50:06.652 --> 00:50:09.616
KEIKO AGENA: So we'll
bring the show here.

00:50:09.616 --> 00:50:11.715
WILL CHOI: But first,
we need to figure out

00:50:11.715 --> 00:50:12.631
Zac's Gmail situation.

00:50:12.631 --> 00:50:14.270
ZAC OYAMA: I'm all lost.

00:50:14.270 --> 00:50:15.270
KIM COOPER: Gmail.com.

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:16.464
WILL CHOI: Yeah.

00:50:16.464 --> 00:50:17.880
JEREMY: All right,
well, thank you

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.770
so much, Kay, Kim,
Keiko, Will, Zac,

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.290
thank you so much for coming
to speak with us today.

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:25.331
Let's go ahead and give
them a round of applause.

00:50:25.331 --> 00:50:26.940
[APPLAUSE]
