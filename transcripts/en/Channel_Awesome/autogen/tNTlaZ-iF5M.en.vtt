00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.660 align:start position:0%
lot of these elements that are here but
it<00:16:00.110><c> would</c><00:16:00.170><c> be</c><00:16:00.319><c> way</c><00:16:00.560><c> more</c><00:16:00.589><c> organized</c><00:16:01.310><c> and</c><00:16:01.579><c> it</c>

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:01.670 align:start position:0%
it would be way more organized and it
 

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.120 align:start position:0%
it would be way more organized and it
would<00:16:01.760><c> give</c><00:16:02.000><c> at</c><00:16:02.269><c> a</c><00:16:02.300><c> good</c><00:16:02.510><c> pace</c><00:16:02.720><c> and</c><00:16:02.779><c> like</c><00:16:03.529><c> yeah</c>

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.570 align:start position:0%
this one it's a new villain every season
it's<00:17:38.080><c> like</c><00:17:38.170><c> monster</c><00:17:38.740><c> in</c><00:17:38.830><c> a</c><00:17:38.890><c> week</c><00:17:39.040><c> or</c><00:17:39.190><c> something</c>

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:39.580 align:start position:0%
it's like monster in a week or something
 

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's like monster in a week or something
I<00:17:39.730><c> wouldn't</c><00:17:39.910><c> mind</c><00:17:40.090><c> seeing</c><00:17:40.300><c> them</c><00:17:40.480><c> do</c><00:17:40.570><c> count</c>

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.660 align:start position:0%
like what they're doing the Bioshock

but you know these two different worlds
 

00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:50.070 align:start position:0%
but you know these two different worlds
that<00:17:48.760><c> really</c><00:17:49.240><c> didn't</c><00:17:49.480><c> seem</c><00:17:49.630><c> to</c><00:17:49.750><c> connect</c>

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:55.450 align:start position:0%
if I forget Bioshock and then BioShock

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:56.950 align:start position:0%
Infinite you know it's like okay and
 

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
Infinite you know it's like okay and
that<00:17:57.070><c> was</c><00:17:57.160><c> kind</c><00:17:57.310><c> of</c><00:17:57.340><c> like</c><00:17:57.400><c> there's</c><00:17:57.640><c> one</c><00:17:57.850><c> song</c>

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.090 align:start position:0%
that was kind of like there's one song
 

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
that was kind of like there's one song
whatever<00:17:58.270><c> and</c><00:17:58.540><c> then</c><00:17:58.630><c> they</c><00:17:58.720><c> had</c><00:17:58.900><c> these</c>

00:17:59.040 --> 00:17:59.050 align:start position:0%
whatever and then they had these
 

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
whatever and then they had these
spin-off<00:17:59.500><c> games</c><00:17:59.800><c> where</c><00:18:00.550><c> they</c><00:18:00.850><c> very</c><00:18:01.390><c> nicely</c>

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:01.690 align:start position:0%
spin-off games where they very nicely
 

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
spin-off games where they very nicely
tied<00:18:02.200><c> them</c><00:18:02.410><c> together</c><00:18:02.530><c> and</c><00:18:02.920><c> I'm</c><00:18:03.100><c> sure</c><00:18:03.340><c> they</c>

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:04.270 align:start position:0%
tied them together and I'm sure they
 

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.030 align:start position:0%
tied them together and I'm sure they
didn't<00:18:04.600><c> think</c><00:18:04.780><c> of</c><00:18:04.900><c> how</c><00:18:05.050><c> these</c><00:18:05.380><c> two</c><00:18:05.440><c> worlds</c>

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
didn't think of how these two worlds
 

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
didn't think of how these two worlds
would<00:18:06.160><c> tie</c><00:18:06.340><c> together</c><00:18:06.520><c> but</c><00:18:06.940><c> they</c><00:18:07.030><c> nice</c><00:18:07.240><c> know</c>

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:07.570 align:start position:0%
would tie together but they nice know
 

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.870 align:start position:0%
would tie together but they nice know
they<00:18:07.750><c> reckoned</c><00:18:08.230><c> that</c><00:18:08.560><c> it</c><00:18:08.800><c> brilliantly</c><00:18:09.429><c> -</c><00:18:09.670><c> yeah</c>

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
they reckoned that it brilliantly - yeah
 

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.180 align:start position:0%
they reckoned that it brilliantly - yeah
exactly<00:18:10.570><c> and</c><00:18:11.170><c> this</c><00:18:11.440><c> obviously</c><00:18:11.650><c> wasn't</c><00:18:12.070><c> the</c>

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:12.190 align:start position:0%
exactly and this obviously wasn't the
 

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
exactly and this obviously wasn't the
plan<00:18:12.460><c> but</c><00:18:12.520><c> well</c><00:18:12.940><c> play</c><00:18:13.179><c> it</c><00:18:13.510><c> be</c><00:18:13.660><c> nice</c><00:18:13.960><c> to</c><00:18:14.290><c> see</c>

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:14.530 align:start position:0%
plan but well play it be nice to see
 

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.350 align:start position:0%
plan but well play it be nice to see
because<00:18:15.130><c> they're</c><00:18:15.310><c> really</c><00:18:15.550><c> good</c><00:18:15.700><c> writers</c><00:18:16.210><c> it</c>

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
because they're really good writers it
 

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.030 align:start position:0%
because they're really good writers it
would<00:18:16.510><c> be</c><00:18:16.630><c> nice</c><00:18:16.810><c> to</c><00:18:16.840><c> see</c><00:18:17.230><c> if</c><00:18:17.440><c> they</c><00:18:17.560><c> can</c><00:18:17.620><c> tie</c>

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
would be nice to see if they can tie
 

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
would be nice to see if they can tie
these<00:18:18.100><c> all</c><00:18:18.460><c> together</c><00:18:18.640><c> I</c><00:18:19.210><c> think</c><00:18:19.870><c> they're</c>

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:20.350 align:start position:0%
these all together I think they're
 

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
these all together I think they're
trying<00:18:20.790><c> but</c><00:18:21.790><c> I</c><00:18:22.000><c> here's</c><00:18:22.900><c> my</c><00:18:23.050><c> theory</c><00:18:23.500><c> I</c><00:18:23.860><c> think</c>

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:24.790 align:start position:0%
trying but I here's my theory I think
 

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.810 align:start position:0%
trying but I here's my theory I think
they're<00:18:25.270><c> trying</c><00:18:25.750><c> to</c><00:18:25.900><c> do</c><00:18:26.230><c> that</c><00:18:26.260><c> but</c><00:18:26.560><c> I</c><00:18:26.800><c> think</c><00:18:26.860><c> I</c>

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:27.820 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do that but I think I
 

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.970 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do that but I think I
could<00:18:28.300><c> be</c><00:18:28.420><c> totally</c><00:18:28.810><c> wrong</c><00:18:28.840><c> maybe</c><00:18:29.290><c> Walt</c><00:18:29.650><c> ugly</c>

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:29.980 align:start position:0%
could be totally wrong maybe Walt ugly
 

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
could be totally wrong maybe Walt ugly
but<00:18:30.130><c> I</c><00:18:30.160><c> think</c><00:18:30.490><c> at</c><00:18:30.580><c> this</c><00:18:30.730><c> point</c><00:18:30.940><c> they</c><00:18:31.150><c> have</c>

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:31.270 align:start position:0%
but I think at this point they have
 

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
but I think at this point they have
written<00:18:31.480><c> off</c><00:18:31.690><c> season</c><00:18:32.140><c> 1</c><00:18:32.520><c> that</c><00:18:33.520><c> they're</c><00:18:33.760><c> just</c>

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:33.910 align:start position:0%
written off season 1 that they're just
 

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.290 align:start position:0%
written off season 1 that they're just
like<00:18:34.030><c> okay</c><00:18:34.150><c> season</c><00:18:34.660><c> 1</c><00:18:34.810><c> is</c><00:18:34.929><c> its</c><00:18:35.110><c> own</c><00:18:35.320><c> like</c><00:18:35.770><c> weird</c>

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:36.300 align:start position:0%
like okay season 1 is its own like weird
 

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
like okay season 1 is its own like weird
odd<00:18:37.300><c> like</c><00:18:37.570><c> but</c><00:18:38.350><c> I</c><00:18:38.380><c> think</c><00:18:38.679><c> they're</c><00:18:38.800><c> trying</c><00:18:39.070><c> to</c>

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.190 align:start position:0%
odd like but I think they're trying to
 

00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
odd like but I think they're trying to
tie<00:18:39.490><c> at</c><00:18:39.670><c> least</c><00:18:39.850><c> 2</c><00:18:40.150><c> 3</c><00:18:40.420><c> &amp;</c><00:18:40.540><c> 4</c><00:18:40.600><c> together</c><00:18:41.190><c> that's</c><00:18:42.190><c> my</c>

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:42.370 align:start position:0%
tie at least 2 3 &amp; 4 together that's my
 

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.610 align:start position:0%
tie at least 2 3 &amp; 4 together that's my
guess<00:18:42.610><c> but</c><00:18:42.940><c> how</c><00:18:43.330><c> it</c><00:18:43.510><c> ties</c><00:18:43.720><c> to</c><00:18:43.960><c> season</c><00:18:44.290><c> 1</c><00:18:44.440><c> I</c><00:18:44.470><c> just</c>

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:44.620 align:start position:0%
guess but how it ties to season 1 I just
 

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
guess but how it ties to season 1 I just
can't<00:18:45.280><c> think</c><00:18:45.520><c> of</c><00:18:45.610><c> anything</c><00:18:45.790><c> I'm</c><00:18:46.060><c> like</c><00:18:46.210><c> there</c>

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:46.390 align:start position:0%
can't think of anything I'm like there
 

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.590 align:start position:0%
can't think of anything I'm like there
really<00:18:46.570><c> wasn't</c><00:18:46.810><c> much</c><00:18:47.160><c> held</c><00:18:48.160><c> over</c><00:18:48.550><c> hmm</c><00:18:49.210><c> from</c>

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
really wasn't much held over hmm from
 

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.970 align:start position:0%
really wasn't much held over hmm from
season<00:18:50.050><c> 1</c><00:18:50.140><c> so</c><00:18:50.290><c> maybe</c><00:18:50.470><c> they're</c><00:18:50.650><c> just</c><00:18:50.679><c> like</c><00:18:50.890><c> you</c>

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:50.980 align:start position:0%
