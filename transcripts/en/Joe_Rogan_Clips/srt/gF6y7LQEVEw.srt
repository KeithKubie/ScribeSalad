1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,090
Really? That's interesting. It is.

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,100
Have you been invited? No. No.
That's fucked up. I don't want to go.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,370
I ain't going to anybody's fucking island.
But about my rule Ronson,

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,770
somebody wants to ask Monson,
the Virgin Dude,

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,350
Richard Bronson or whatever his name is,
Branson.

6
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,050
Branson Yank on his fucking island.
I want to hang out and skate with Branson.

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,510
Why? Why? When I could jet ski with
Chewy is, listen, I ain't, I don't know.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,200
Hanging out with any dude who as
an island, get the fuck Outta here.

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,890
Mccone or island because they always want
you to go to the islands. Like, bitch,

10
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:34,490
I ain't going to your island or
whatever. Just go to the diner. No,

11
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,220
a little awhile. Who? Who's that? Eddie
Murphy. Eddie Murphy as an island.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,170
What would you get a photo daddies? I
might go daddy's. You got it. Got It.

13
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:47,850
I like Getty. I met Eddie and I was good
friends with his brother and good guy.

14
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,910
Charlie was the best. Charlie was the
greatest guy of all time. Yeah. Uh,

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,450
I met Eddie when,
when I met Eddie Murphy,

16
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:59,250
I met Eddie Murphy and Maui and he'd go
it first words out of his mind. He goes,

17
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,640
you are funny motherfucker.
I was like, God damn. Yes,

18
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:07,390
this is recently now years ago.
Maybe more than 10 years ago. Yeah.

19
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:10,200
That's like 2007.
Something like that would be unreal.

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,240
And I worked crazy funny in a Hoodie
with my family. I'll say thank you.

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,590
Like, what do you say when Eddie Murphy
says you're funny motherfucker. I'm like,

22
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:23,910
Holy Shit. Wow. Felt great. You know,

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,060
she look at your wife and be like,
see chuckle every once in awhile.

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,530
But
honestly at home I'm not that funny.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,500
My wife cracks most of the jokes.
Really? Yeah. I don't know.

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,610
I don't have to be funny. Like
I don't need it, you know,

27
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,550
it's one of the reasons why I like to
hang around with Joey Diaz cause he's

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,170
always funny and he's always the
funny guy. You know? I like it.

29
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,550
It's uh, you know, I like being
around funny people, man. I'm not,

30
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,680
the thing about comics, especially the
needy, annoying ones in the early days,

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,750
like early days of your career, they
have to be the center of attention. Yeah.

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,680
That shit is really annoying.
Yeah,

33
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,090
and one of the things that you learned
for sure about hosting a podcast is you

34
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,100
don't really want to be
the center of attention.

35
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,290
You just want to facilitate
a conversation. Right.
