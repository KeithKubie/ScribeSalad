&gt;&gt;Announcer on video: In order to identify
and empower such individuals, I

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.169
am proud to announce that my Aunt Doris Buffett
is

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.290
committing $10 million to endow Learning by
Giving, a

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.959
foundation that will be central to the development
of

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.180
the social value investment model by fueling
a pipeline

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.060
of young leaders who will identify and fund
the most

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.910
impactful projects across America. The premise
is

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.320
simple: The foundation partners with universities
to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.880
create courses in philanthropy and nonprofit
studies.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.390
Each class at each school is then given a
$10,000 grant

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.750
and students collaborate to identify the best
allocation

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.220
for those funds in their local communities.
The

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.260
students prepare reports on what they've done
and share

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.800
them on LearningByGivingFoundation.org, an
online

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.610
resource where coursework is made available
to everyone on

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.340
the planet. The web site was built using Google
tools

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.040
and resources, and with the generous support
of Google's director

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.570
of university relations and many of their
employees.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.591
LivingByGivingFoundation.org is going live
today, and I

00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:10.684
encourage every one of you to use it and to
share it. [voice fades]

00:01:10.684 --> 00:01:14.170
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: And we welcome &gt;&gt;DORIS Buffett
with us today.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.340
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Thank you.
[Clapping]

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.829
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I'm very happy to be here. This is
been quite an experience you know.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.090
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Well, we hope you've enjoyed it.
For those of you that don't know me, I'm Jennifer

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.579
Barth,
and I work here, recently in the engineering

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.840
office and
now in the office of the executive chairman.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.030
So that
keeps me little busy on the side.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.719
&gt;&gt;DORIS: It would.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: But this is way more fun today,

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.030
I
want you to know. [giggles]

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.130
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Good.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: So I have to say, in looking at

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.450
all
of my research, you've led a pretty interesting

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.819
life.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Yes. I think so. It's had its ups

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.359
and downs and I'm a late bloomer, but I'm
having a lot of fun

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.140
now.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Hey, that's right. That's right.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.859
I mean, your father was a Congressman?
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Yes.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.679
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Your brother's a little famous.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Yes.

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:59.299
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Just a little. You've obviously
had some relationship -- tumultuous relationship

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.429
history
with your mother that you talk about a lot

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.859
in your book.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Oh, yes. That's true.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.070
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Millionairess.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Yes.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.350
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Not once, but twice.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Right.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.611
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: So --
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Lost it all the first time.

00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:15.130
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Yes. And to bad luck; not to
anything that you cover done differently?

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.000
&gt;&gt;DORIS: No. Considering all the circumstances
it probably was inevitable.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.330
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: So I think it's interesting you
didn't necessarily want to tell the whole

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.350
story in your
book, Giving It All Away. Not initially.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.770
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well, no. It's painful, but in order
to get the whole picture, you have to know

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.440
the whole
story. So we went ahead and did it, and as

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.250
my brother
said, it's a very honest book.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.600
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Mm hmm.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So if nothing else, it's an honest

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.080
book.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: So what changed your mind?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.340
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well, my brother did. We were on
a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.040
plane and she said, "Doris, you've got a write
a book

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.650
about what you're doing." I said, "Oh, for
heaven's

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.370
sakes. I don't know anything about that."
He said,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.900
"Well, you've really got to." I said, "Well,
it's

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.090
all -- it's all anecdotal." He said, "That's
what

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.180
people love." I said, "Well, I don't know
how to

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.480
write." He said, "I'll get you a ghost writer."
So

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.001
he's rather persuasive and I actually went
back to my

00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:04.380
seat and I thought, well, I've got the title,
and that

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.510
would be Here's the Deal because everything
we do is

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.740
'here's the deal'. It involves collaboration.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Mm hmm.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.200
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So they voted that out so that was
too

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200
bad.
[Laughing]

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.330
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And then Bono actually advised me
to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.170
do it. How about that.
[Laughing]

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.120
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So that was very persuasive.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: I bet so.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.950
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So that's how it came to be, and

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.460
I
knew a fellow in Fredericksburg, who was a

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.540
wonderful
writer and worked for the Freelance Star,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.040
and he was
eager to do it. So we just got together and

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.120
I just went
on, and on, and on, and he was game to take

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.800
it it all
down and I was very happy with the result.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.210
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: It's fascinating. I am curious
because you've come from so many different

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.480
highs and
lows. How did you know you could do this?

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.960
I mean,
you've been -- I'm the mom of a four-year-old,

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.330
full-time
career at times, you know, you struggle. I

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.890
was an actor
at one time so I know some way of feast or

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.890
famine.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Yeah.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.069
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: How'd you know you could do this?
I mean, you've got philanthropy and organizations

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.980
touching lives on a one-to-one basis.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well, that's what we try to do. First

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.390
of
all, that was my aim. I wasn't going to go

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.049
into more
esoteric things. I wanted -- I had the money

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.240
and I was
very lucky to have that, and it fit into who

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.190
I am. I'm
not a saint, I'm not saying that, but I have

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.800
always
been aware of other people's needs and wished

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.151
to help
them, and now I can just go full gun. I was

00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:37.569
-- it was
wonderful. I was all ready to go. I already

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:40.870
had a
501(3) when my mother died, so I was out of

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.870
the starting
gate.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.590
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Mm hmm.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I made a few mistakes in the beginning,

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.689
but
not many, because I had a wonderful group

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:50.729
of people were
working with me who were very bright, and

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.210
that was our
aim and has remained our aim, and we just

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.370
keep on doing
it as long as the money holds out.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.879
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Eventually the last check will bounce

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.069
and then I'm out of business.
[Laughing]

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.639
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Let's hope not. I'm curious. Can
you recall that first instance where you wrote

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.330
that
first really large check or you got that first

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.990
letter
back from someone that you made a difference

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.389
in their
lives? Can you recount something like that?

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:19.870
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well, I know that -- I know the very
first thing we did was to offer scholarships

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.870
for
women -- and that's after everybody else had

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.009
turned them
down -- so we took the losers -- and all of

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.370
them
graduated, just one didn't. So that was very

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.090
successful
because I had a marvelous young woman who

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.360
said she never
wanted any children and now she had 135.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.120
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And she rose to the occasion, and

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.740
she's a mother hen so that worked really well.
And then

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.629
the next thing was to educate battered women
-- formerly

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.240
battered women. So that's worked out fairly
-- when you

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.719
change a life like that, it's really dramatic.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Sure.

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:54.401
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So then I thought up this, the
Learning by Giving --

00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:55.860
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: That's right.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: -- and thought why am I doing this

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.539
all
by myself? [chuckles] So here we have a whole

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:04.430
generation of
extremely bright and energetic people and

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.659
they're
idealistic, and they're hard working, so why

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:11.699
not get
them in on the game. So that's how we first

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.569
started with
this, which has become a really big deal across

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:18.169
the
country. I'm so old that I remember when Communists

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.409
were a big threat, and I remember that they
used to go

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.319
to universities and colleges and pick off
the 5 percent

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.279
that were the most compassionate and the brightest
and

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:34.839
recruit them. So I thought, well, it worked
for them,

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:37.219
you know, so I think I'll try that, too. So
that's what

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:38.849
we try to do.
[Laughing]

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.770
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And it has worked. It is working
as

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.591
we speak.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Right. So it appears that your

00:06:43.591 --> 00:06:48.919
brother and Bono were right.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well, I'd like to think so.

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:51.389
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: I want to know, you mentioned

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.809
one
time about growing up in the childhood you

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:58.789
had, and the
education you learned through life experience

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.770
about a
fairy god mother. What's your idea of a fairy

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:02.770
god
mother?

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.330
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Me [chuckles] now.
[Laughing]

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.201
&gt;&gt;DORIS: No. I always wished -- I was in a
very difficult situation and I always wished

00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:12.119
there was a
fairy god mother would come along and just

00:07:12.119 --> 00:07:16.219
kidnap me, or
take me away, or straighten it out or show

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:18.719
me some
sympathy, whatever it was, but that never

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:22.669
happened so
then I'm now becoming my own. And I'm making

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:26.630
myself
happy doing this, and then thousands of people.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.719
Literally thousands of people and I don't
want to sound

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:32.059
braggadocio, but it has changed their lives.
Their

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:35.210
letters are magnificent. I have a whole stack,
and that

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.339
represents 1/100ths, probably. But these are
the most

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:40.699
touched by it and their lives are really changed
and

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:42.900
they're so grateful, and their children are
doing well

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.219
by it. Everybody's doing well by it.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Do you think if you hadn't had

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:50.710
your
own misfortune that you would feel to this

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:52.699
extent to do
what you do?

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:56.810
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I think I'm a little weird. I don't
think probably -- you know, what I look at

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.889
my
generation, I don't think so. I mean, I do

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:02.659
know --
well, I shouldn't be so hard on myself. I

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:06.509
always find
people who I felt needed some help and tried

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:11.379
to do, you
know, in my own little teenybopper way, something

00:08:11.379 --> 00:08:14.562
to
help out. But what can you do? I mean, I was

00:08:14.562 --> 00:08:17.839
bound by
the family rules. To begin with, I was living

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.199
under
their roof, and "When you're living under

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:21.159
this roof you
will obey the rules," that kind of thing.

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:23.009
And so I
didn't have a lot, and I didn't have any money

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:25.039
except
what I made babysitting.

00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:27.210
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Mm hmm.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: You --

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.449
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: You've come a long way.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: What's so funny about that?

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:34.060
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So yeah. But I was always aware.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.270
I
always was aware. When I was in high school

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.710
I did have
one of those 'Save the Children' kids from

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:41.770
World War II,
and I don't know of anybody else that did

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.140
that. So
yeah. It was there. It was in place and all

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.480
it needed
was some money.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.740
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And maybe some wisdom. Yeah.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:56.540
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Well, you had the Sunshine Lady
Foundation, which has helped countless women,

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.810
as you've
said; and then also you've helped those in

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.190
prison to get
educated and turn themselves around.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.450
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Mm hmm
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Tell me about the transition from

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.200
the Sunshine Lady Foundation to the Learning
by Giving

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.650
foundation.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well, we used to have something called

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.810
Sunbeams, and they were people aged 8 to 80
who would

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.950
help me get rid of the money in a meaningful
way. I

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.670
don't mean to stand on the corner or anything.
And we

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:28.690
had a couple of them who were students actually,
and

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:32.200
they were over at Davidson College in western
North

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:34.810
Carolina, and they were just so busy thinking
up things

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:38.990
to spend money on around there to make things
better over there and

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.320
after -- I'm not -- I can't exactly remember
this, but I

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.480
do know my grandson, Alexander and I, stopped
at

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.330
Davidson coming home from Omaha, and they
put on sort of

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:53.960
a presentation to show me what they were doing,
and it

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.900
was so good that both the professor and the
two of us

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:02.340
thought it might be -- turn it into a course.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Mm hmm.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.090
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So he was the first one, and from
then

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:09.180
on it has spread. There's one in my hometown
now,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.840
Fredericksburg, Virginia, and the professor
there

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.430
mirrors every other professor that's involved
with this.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.330
They love the course because they get engaged
students,

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.140
you know, you're not fighting somebody typing
all the

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.840
time or whatever it is they have to put up
with. They

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.530
just adore it. It's always oversubscribed
in every

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:32.340
school where we've presented it, and the kids
get pretty

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.880
emotional about the one -- you know, they
go out and

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.450
look at local --
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Mm hmm.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.930
&gt;&gt;DORIS: -- we don't go sending it off to
Bangkok

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.890
because we want them to really feel and way
the know you

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:46.380
do it. And so they go out in teams and they
decide

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.740
which ones they've interviewed looked the
best to them,

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.520
and then that director comes in and speaks
to the class.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.620
There may be four more steps, I don't know,
but I do

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.340
know they end up arguing, and that's what
they like the

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.750
best. They really -- they pick their favorites,
and boy

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.640
do they stand up for them. So that's a good
exercise.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.050
We don't tell them where to spend the money.
They can

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.640
divide it up ten different ways or give it
all to

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.020
one place, but they've never been able to
do that.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.860
They can't agree on that. So it has benefit.
And as I

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.160
said, I don't have anything to say about where
it goes

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.420
except it has to be local because that's how
you learn

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.030
what your community's like and when you're
high above

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:27.420
Cuyahoga's waters, you may not know what's
going on

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.420
below.
[Laughing]

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:35.780
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So it's been very exciting because
we're creating a whole army of knowledgeable,

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.610
bright,
energetic kids. Pardon if I shouldn't say

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.460
kids. Young
people? That makes me old people. I don't

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:44.460
like "young
people".

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.690
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: It's fine.
[Laughing]

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:48.040
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So they're out there, and they've
done

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.590
things already that are amazing. There's one
fellow

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.580
from the class in Fredericksburg and he went
down to

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.320
Honduras and he's building a village and the
schools.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.280
He was one of the heroes of CNN I think couple
of years

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.050
ago. And I mean that's the first thing but
we've seen

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.990
many other things. And if they can't do it
now, they'll

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.660
do it later because they've been inoculated
with the

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.770
idea. And it's a good feeling when you know
you can

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:16.560
affect somebody's life it's just thrilling.
It's

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.550
absolutely thrilling.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Since you've mentioned the course,

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.970
we've got a clip of the Learning by Giving
Foundation

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:25.590
clip that I'd like to show for just a minute
to show our

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:36.610
audience a little bit more about the foundation.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Okay.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:39.920
[pause]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Oh.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:45.860
&gt;&gt;Male announcer: What class at UNO has been
going above and beyond normal class work [students

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.410
giggle] and for a
good cause? The UNO Honors program and school

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.780
and
public administration teamed up to offer a

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:57.620
class called
philanthropy and democracy. The goal: To award

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:02.350
$10,000
to a local non- profit. The award later doubled

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.340
thanks
to a generous donation by Buffett. And, so

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.100
by the
end of the class, two organizations were chosen,

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.960
City
Sprouts and the Building Bright Futures D2

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.920
program.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: So that's just an example of how

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.720
the foundation runs.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Yes. They're a really incredible

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.240
group. All of them are, I should say that,
and they're

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.540
so bright, and they're just so interested
in it, you

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.230
know, and it hits them where they live. They
were so

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.160
cute in the way -- I shouldn't use the word
"cute".

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.560
They were so adept at what they did, and,
umm --

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.450
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: -- I was impressed by them, so in

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.710
a
spontaneous manner I said, "I'll double it."

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.610
Which I'd
never done before. And then one started to

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:46.930
cry. You
know, they're really engaged. They care about

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.240
it. So
they had a lot of good ideas, and I've heard

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.070
from quite
of number of them. If they're not ready to

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.780
do it now,
they'll be ready to do it some other time.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.040
And it isn't
just a matter of doing good. It's a matter

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.050
of doing it
smart. And a lot of time that gets lost, and

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.810
every once
in a while you'll see in the paper where some

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.370
foundation
has really been misusing the donations and

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:12.390
I come down
pretty hard on that because I -- if we can't

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.240
have
integrity here, where are we going to have

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.920
it? So they
learn some lessons -- I hope they learn those

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.241
lessons.
I'm in there punching for it. But they're

00:14:21.241 --> 00:14:23.870
very bright,
and you get the cream of the crop.

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:29.460
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: So your brother talks about his
version of philanthropy, which is to write

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:30.460
one big
check --

00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.460
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: -- and let it sail.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.800
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Wholesale philanthropy.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: And what does he call your version?

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:35.800
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Retail philanthropy.
[Laughing]

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.520
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I love retail philanthropy because
you

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.830
know where it goes, and what it does, and
you can stop

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:46.060
it in a minute if it's not working. Umm, it's
vital, I

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:50.380
think, to be involved in it. I -- you mention
the

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.420
prison programs -- I'm only going to say a
word about

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.450
that, but I go to the prisons and I meet the
prisoners.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:15:00.870
And as much as the school, they're getting
hope, and the

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.000
fact that somebody believes in them. I know
that sounds

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.770
a little sappy, but it really does work that
way.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:08.670
Because that's what they lack; I can sort
of fill that

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.060
need. And they, of course, are the same sort
of avid

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.620
students that we have in these classes. They
want to

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.140
learn; they want to learn this -- of course
in the

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.100
Learning by Giving--, this particular subject.
So we

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.160
don't have a trouble with people not showing
up for

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.490
class or anything like that.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: No. And in fact I will quote in

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.510
your Charlie Rose interview, which was last
year --

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:31.980
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Yeah. Last year.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Umm, you were talking about the

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.830
recidivism rate for Sing Sing and it's --
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Oh, boy. Well, you have to first

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.460
of
all know, I am from the Midwest. I am a product

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.460
of
the Midwest, and that's a little different

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:43.640
other places
in the country, maybe southern California

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.201
or someplace
and so I'm not wasting this money; that's

00:15:47.201 --> 00:15:50.680
not in the
Buffett DNA. We just don't do that. I mean,

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:53.340
I did it
once, but I'm not doing it again. [laughter]

00:15:53.340 --> 00:16:00.550
Let's put it that
way. And so we try not to make mistakes. But

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:04.910
yeah.
Recidivism rate across the country in state

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:10.880
prisons runs
about 63 percent that's coast-to-coast, and

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.920
it means
that the person in prison who's released returns

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.630
in
three years, and it's just a cycle and it's

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:22.010
depressing. We
found that -- I started at Sing Sing, and

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:24.780
we've -- and
the record at Sing Sing is -- now remember,

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.670
I said
63 percent everywhere. Well, our record at

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.880
sing sipping
is zero. They don't come back. They go back

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:36.690
and they
become tax-paying citizens, and they are fathers

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:41.130
in a
fatherless family, and they can add a lot

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.390
to our
society. And I think that's a remarkable thing.

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.070
And I
like that payoff, and I like the payoff here.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.160
I can't
see it as quickly, but I know it's going to

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.000
happen
because there's so much -- well, they just

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.640
get turned
on, and they have the energy to follow through,

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.440
and when
you get the wonderful letters or see what

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.590
happens when
somebody goes to the Wharton School of Finance,

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:06.980
who was
just living, you know, in a trailer or something,

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.970
you
know that they've succeeded and their lives

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:11.180
will be
changed, and that's what I'm interested in;

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.020
changed
lives. So this army that we're sending out

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.880
now, it's
getting bigger by the moment. We just had

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.190
an enormous
number of schools. And when I realized that

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.320
it was
getting that big then I thought, well, since

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.650
I'm not in
the business of building an empire -- which

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.930
a lot of
people are, I might tell you -- but that doesn't

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:34.900
appeal
to me at all, so I turned it over to my grandson

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.760
and a
bunch of his smart, energetic pals, friends,

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.990
cohorts,
buddies, and they're doing a bang-up job.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:48.680
And then, low
and behold, Google steps in, and now we are

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.620
working with
Google and we are thrilled to death. I mean,

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.790
this
boggles my mind. I mentioned that. I was a

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.020
little
older than you are. Well, I cannot even -- this

00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:00.021
is a
different world. I can't even comprehend it,

00:18:00.021 --> 00:18:01.990
except
that actually it looks like a lot of fun.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.940
I like those little
scooters.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.220
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And the food everywhere. But imagine

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:11.180
what the combination can do. It's just endless.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: That's right. And I think it's

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.920
--
you know, I was going to ask, you know, how

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:18.140
do you
inspire young people, kids? I mean, it's different

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:20.580
when
you've been down on your luck, or your trying

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.350
to fight
for someone who doesn't have a home or what

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.410
have you, or you are
a parent. It's different when you're a young

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.260
kid, and
you're already in college. And how do you

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.620
engage them
with the Learning by Giving Foundation to

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.620
really want to
persons that one-on-one retail ther -- excuse

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.870
me.
Retail therapy.

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:43.851
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Retail philanthropy moment, you

00:18:43.851 --> 00:18:47.280
know, where they really get that -- where
they really

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.090
catch the bug, you know, to do something?
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I think it's the same if it's a prison

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.880
or a -- wherever you're working. If you just
give them

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.540
hope, and tell them you're confident they
can do it and

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:06.120
applaud them when they do. I know in scholarship
programs we have gotten remarkable results,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.540
but it --
and the first letters that came in and they

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.420
continue to
this day they say it's because you have faith

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:14.290
in me.
And so I thought, what's happened to all the

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.280
faith in
this country, because that's what I heard

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.810
over, and
over, and over, and that's true whether it's

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.580
this
program, or that program, or wherever. You

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.800
just -- you
get up there and you're obviously grandma

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.000
and everybody
loves their grandmother generally, I think,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.070
so I don't
have to overcome the mother thing --

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:34.180
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: -- or the teacher thing. So yeah.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.490
I
think -- and I feel that way. Wholeheartedly

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.360
it isn't an
act; I have a lot of faith in them because

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.180
they're
there, because they're listening, and because

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:43.641
I think
you can spark them. It's there if you just

00:19:43.641 --> 00:19:46.920
give it a
little help. So that's what I do across the

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.660
board. It
pays off. Someday I'm going to have to hire

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.300
someone who
has a big smile, and send them out to be the

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.460
Sunshine
Lady because I can't do them all, you know.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:59.010
[chuckles] Just that's
all they have to do is qualify.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.670
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: That's what we call "scaling".
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Oh, is that right? Okay, I must

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.150
remember that. Scaling. There's a whole new
vocabulary.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:09.350
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: It is indeed, trust me.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And there's a lot of people that

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.280
talk
a lot and don't do anything. This is the antidote

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.429
to
that. I went to a meeting at a nameless place

00:20:15.429 --> 00:20:17.484
in this
big city and I was just appalled, you know,

00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:20.560
they're
talking about the landscape, and the this

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.559
-- and
scaling, probably, which I didn't understand,

00:20:23.559 --> 00:20:26.400
and about
20 other words that were totally new to me,

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.961
but they
weren't doing anything; in the end they were

00:20:28.961 --> 00:20:31.470
just
talking. And we're putting out the money,

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.710
we're
developing the programs, we're recruiting

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.460
everywhere we
can, and now a lot of the work's taken off

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:39.450
me because
we have this crew here today that really know

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:40.450
what
they're doing.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:46.570
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Well, I think it is a natural
partnership because we at Google, I mean,

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.780
you're sitting
here, this is a roomful of people, of the

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.570
employees that
I get the pleasure of working with every day,

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.370
who are
passionate about what they do, they're smart,

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:59.520
they're no
nonsense, they believe in integrity, they

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.730
believe in
transparency.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.990
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And they also have a sense of humor,
I

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.990
might add.
[Laughing]

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:05.710
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Absolutely.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I noticed that everywhere.

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:08.981
&gt;[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Absolutely. And so if you have

00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:11.809
us
here, you know, and you're just -- there's

00:21:11.809 --> 00:21:15.381
something you
haven't yet scratched the surface on, what

00:21:15.381 --> 00:21:18.780
-- is there
something you could think of to tell us, hey,

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.720
I mean, think out of
the box?

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.210
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I'm afraid of what's in the box.
I

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.220
really believe in the --
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: I gotta tell you, you're out of

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.590
the
box.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.080
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well, just old-fashioned virtues

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.570
is
all I can come up with, plus the enormous

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.710
jump in IQ
that I see between the generations, and the

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:43.450
energy. If
you just put it to work, let 'em go, who know

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.210
-- I mean,
who would have imagined this building? Not

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.150
me, I tell
you in a million years. I think I'm in another

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:53.760
world.
And so I'm going to live a long, long time

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.130
so I can see
what happens because I think great things

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.730
are going to
come out of this friendship and collaboration.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.230
Couldn't
ask for anything more.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:01.990
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Well, we certainly hope so, and
we

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:05.080
have, you know, great faith in Maggie Johnson
and our --

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.240
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: -- team out in Mountain View.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:11.060
I
have a personal pride for Maggie because she's

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.052
part of
the research team which we represent out here

00:22:13.052 --> 00:22:14.052
in New
York, as well.

00:22:14.052 --> 00:22:17.760
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well, you have some wonderful people
in your organization. The more I hear, the

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.420
more I learn
how many there are, probably about nine -- a

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.840
hundred and
12 percent. It's just amazing. Anybody that

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.750
has the
imagination to put this place together and

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.840
do what you
are doing. Now, I confess, I do not know how

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.100
to
turn on a computer so you see I'm illiterate,

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:36.990
ignorant.
How'd I ever get to be in MENSA? But I'm awed

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:37.990
by
what you're doing.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.240
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Well, that's the collaboration.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: That is the collaboration. What could

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.490
be better? I think I'm coming out the big
winner

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.980
because I'm enjoying it so much.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Well, we have today, too. And

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.820
I
wanted to invite the audience to ask questions.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.330
Anybody
wanted to -- feel free to walk up and ask

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:58.860
anything you'd
like to. Talk to me a little bit more about

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:03.740
specifically since we mentioned Maggie, Stanford's
philanthropy and civil society.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:09.190
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Yes. Oh, yes. Stanford's coming on
board; we're really thrilled about that. And

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.809
I think --
I can't recite the rest of them because I

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:14.400
know where
we've started and I know where I've been,

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.710
but it's
growing so fast. It's -- I feel like we caught

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.990
a wave,
I really do. And with all the other troubles

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:25.380
that are
going on everywhere, this is one white hope

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:30.510
to do, you
know, to do good and smart, not dumb.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:38.870
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Mm hmm.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And, and befriend people, I think,

00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:40.720
and collaborate. Collaborate's a big deal.
I'm dealing

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.080
with somebody, I'll say here's what we'll
do, and maybe

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:47.000
you can do this. Then it doesn't demean them.
That's

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.900
the really important thing. It's not like
handouts.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.140
Don't do handouts. We do hand-ups, and we
are very

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.580
serious about that. So that sort of keeps
you in line.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.420
Well, we can start a class right here today
I suppose,

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.160
but I don't want to keep everybody from their
roller

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.300
skating or whatever it is they're out there
--

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.200
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I expect we're going to have a lot

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.200
of
fun.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.080
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Yes.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And we're going to be terribly proud

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.980
of the product. And just imagine setting all
those

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:16.660
people out to do whatever they're going to
do in their

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:19.221
lives. As I say, it may not be for 30 years,
but they

00:24:19.221 --> 00:24:22.890
will know how to do it, and they won't get
fleeced, and

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.330
that's very important to me. We're both doing
our thing

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:31.390
in our own way, but I think I'm probably getting
more

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.800
fun out of it than just turning it over to
-- you know.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.730
I'm not speaking of the living -- Learning
by Giving,

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:40.870
I'm just talking in general. All the proposals
that

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.220
come my way.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Oh, sure. And if someone wanted

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.809
to
get a proposal to you, or if we had friends

00:24:45.809 --> 00:24:47.960
that -- how
would we go about doing that?

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.660
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well, you just send it to our office,
and just look at our web site, okay --

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.050
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Look at you promoting the Internet.
[Laughing]

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.480
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I'm so proud of myself.
[Laughing]

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:08.820
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And they'll get all the information
they need, and we will take it under consideration.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:13.370
And
it's really a pleasure being here. Just a

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:16.180
tremendous
pleasure. I'm going to leave here with one

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.750
of those --
what do you call it? Scooters.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:21.870
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Yes.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: No. I'll have to steal it I guess.

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.740
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: That wouldn't be a good example at

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.880
all, but I think that's so clever.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Trust me, it comes in very handy.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.110
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I'm sure it does. You're in a hurry.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Exactly. Or there's a really long

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:34.679
floor to try to get across to.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Yeah! This building's enormous.

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:36.750
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: It is. It's a rather large
footprint here for--.

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:42.090
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well, you've got a great thing here,
an amazing thing. We're glad to be associated

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.660
with you,
just tickled to death because that just -- imagine

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.350
how
that expands the kind of work you can do.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:49.510
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Absolutely.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: It's wonderful.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.679
&gt;&gt;Female#1: We have a question here
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Hi, Doris . I'm just wondering

00:25:52.679 --> 00:25:55.080
if you can
share the story of the person you helped that

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.940
touched
you the most.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:05.840
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Oh, my gosh. Oh. Well... uh, first
of all, when we're doing individual things,

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.299
we do people
who have bad luck, not people who have made

00:26:08.299 --> 00:26:14.100
wrong
choices because it bothers you for sort of

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.360
paying them
off for making a dumb decision. I've made

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:20.360
some, so I
can refer to it that way. So I'll just take

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.280
the most
recent one because I don't, there are hundreds

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:27.020
and
hundreds of them now, I'm telling you. Umm...

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:31.780
I got two
recently and -- just the other day. One was

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.500
a -- I have
a crew up in Maine that handles individual

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:39.580
cases, and my
brother pays for that part, so he's involved.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:44.440
And this
woman had written in and I can't remember

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.770
the illness
she had because we were in the mall, but she

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:52.100
had a
motorized wheelchair and to get to the bus

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:57.020
stop she had
to go a mile, and whether snow, sleet, rain,

00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:00.090
mud, the
whole thing, and I don't even remember her

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.140
illness, but
I'll tell you, MS is a big illness in this

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:06.040
country today
because we've helped more people that have

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:10.070
MS than I can
imagine. So she needed a van, something that

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.850
would
handle the wheelchair and get her where she

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.760
was going.
So our rule up in Maine is if it comes in

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.550
at 5,000 or
less they can go ahead and use their own judgment

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:22.220
because they're all smart and they're in the
-- in the

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:24.730
deal. They understand it. So this would take
a little

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:26.640
more. We never buy new ones; we always buy
used ones,

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.490
but we know every used van dealer in the country.
[Laughing]

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:36.101
&gt;&gt;DORIS: They are so knowledgeable up there.
And so I said, well, go ahead. And then a

00:27:36.101 --> 00:27:39.000
few days
later, the girl who was handling the program

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.640
called me
what she said -- it was just amazing. She

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.880
called the
lady back and said she was going to get her

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.179
van, when
she said there was this long silence and then

00:27:47.179 --> 00:27:51.860
uncontrollable weeping. And it just made all
the -- and

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.890
it was -- once again, it gets back to the
thing about

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:57.280
having a personal connection. It wasn't just
the van;

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:00.460
she made that clear. It was the fact that
someone,

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:05.221
somewhere, recognized her and wanted to help
her. These

00:28:05.221 --> 00:28:08.980
are invisible people in many cases, and as
these legions

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.280
go forth from these programs, think how many
more we can

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:17.890
help with that. That happens oh, gosh, I can't
-- oh,

00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:21.049
and then another thing we stress is paying
it forward

00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:25.250
in every one. I was up in Maine a year ago
and the

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.750
phone rang, and a woman called -- said, my
name is

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.810
Susan. I can't remember her last name. She
said, you

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.860
saved our family a year ago. She said, we
still don't

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:36.500
have much money, but I have collected over
4,000 pairs

00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:40.150
of shoes and they're going to Haiti. Now,
I love that

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:44.370
story; that's true. And it shows it's a catching
thing.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:50.860
If you do it on a very kindly, caring, reasonable
basis,

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:53.840
and it isn't as they say a handout -- that's
money

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:57.480
wasted. So that's going on all over the country
and

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.870
when we turn this group loose, I mean really,
it's going

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:05.280
to be monumental.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Another question here.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.820
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Thank you so much for coming
today. One

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:13.950
of the questions I had was you make the distinction
between those who've had poor luck and poor

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.700
circumstance, and those who've possibly made
bad

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:19.530
choices. Those so often go hand in hand that
bad

00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.651
circumstances often lead to bad choices, and
I was

00:29:21.651 --> 00:29:23.970
wondering how your organization makes the
distinction.

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:29.230
I'm sure it's a many-layered question, but--
&gt;&gt;DORIS: It's a many-layered answer, too,

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.540
as a
matter of fact. In some cases, yes, you can

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.690
see it, but
you try to balance it out. But other cases

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.960
are so
unmistakably bad luck. Nobody did anything

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.170
wrong. Can
I tell one more?

00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:45.240
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Of course.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Okay. I got a letter from a woman,

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.370
a
nurse, she was a nurse by occupation, lived

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:52.760
in Arapaho,
Colorado, and she had a twin sister who lived

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:56.600
in
Memphis, Tennessee. Both of these sisters,

00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:01.919
twins, had
girls the same age, ten years old, so nothing

00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:06.370
followed
this. So the ten-year-old from Memphis, Tennessee,

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.750
probably got on a gray hound bus and went
to visit her

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.780
cousin of the same age on a cool Colorado
one summer,

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:16.030
and presumably had a wonderful time, and then
she went

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.650
back home. Now, her mother in Tennessee was
divorced

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:23.840
and she was working two jobs, and keeping
her children

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.340
going and so on. She had no health insurance,
of

00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:30.040
course. And when this little girl got back
there, she

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.030
had a spot under her left eye, and it didn't
seem to go

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:36.760
away so her mother took her to a hospital,
the emergency

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.990
room, and they gave her Noxema or something
and sent

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.940
them home. Then they went back a second time
a few

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:45.160
weeks later because it wasn't having any effect
on this

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.420
place, and then the third time they went in,
they saw a

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.970
doctor, and he did a biopsy and sent it off
to some

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:57.240
really good places. When it came back, she
had a

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:01.799
disease -- what is that? What do you call
that? It's

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:04.940
creepy kind of thing. What is it in fungus.
Yeah. It

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:10.750
was a fungal infection or condition, and there
were two

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:13.429
people in this country that had it and 43
that had it in

00:31:13.429 --> 00:31:18.721
Bangladesh. I mean, it's just -- how would
you ever get

00:31:18.721 --> 00:31:21.600
that? She went on the bus, she had a good
time, she

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.160
came home on the bus, and now by time I heard
from them,

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:28.330
I then contacted the mother, and she was at
that point

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:31.680
working nights so she could be with her daughter
in the

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.980
daytime in the hospital, and the girl had
been in

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.809
intensive care at different times, and it
was spreading,

00:31:36.809 --> 00:31:40.450
and she was blind in one eye. And she could
go home for

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:42.679
a while, but she was terrified to go home
for fear her

00:31:42.679 --> 00:31:44.610
friends would make fun of her, you know, because
her

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:48.020
face was mixed up. So we were able -- the
woman sounded

00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:51.610
like death warmed over and so I said how are
you getting

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:53.900
along financially? She said well, I'm going
to lose my

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.559
car, I'm going to lose my home and so on.
I said, well,

00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:59.320
send me your bills. Now, I don't usually do
impulsive

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:02.580
things like that, but this had to be addressed.
So we

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:07.460
were able to do that for her, and I mean,
that's my idea

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.270
of bad luck. It's pretty high standard. And
then

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.770
you'll have some dilettante calling you and
saying, "I

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:18.809
owe $80,000 in credit cards and my husband
told me if I

00:32:18.809 --> 00:32:22.000
did this again he's going to divorce me."
And in the

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.230
end we talked about things she might do. There
were

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.600
some avenues to get through this. She had
a different

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.130
mailbox for all the bills that came in. I
mean, she was

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:33.650
good at this. [laughter] But it was 80,000
she had done it before

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:36.250
as I say. Unfortunately, they were going to
build a new

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.380
house -- buy a new house, and they were going
to check

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.559
the credit and she was in trouble. So she
said, well,

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:43.320
what do you think I ought to do? That I said
well --

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.789
she told me that she had had a small inheritance
from --

00:32:45.789 --> 00:32:51.400
I said I'd apply that to the debt, and so
-- and then in

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.419
the end she said, you mean, you aren't going
to help me?

00:32:54.419 --> 00:32:57.330
And I said no, we're not, because this doesn't
meet our

00:32:57.330 --> 00:32:58.440
criteria.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Sure.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.330
&gt;&gt;DORIS: But those are -- they're not as -- and
then there are the crazy ones. These are always

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:05.220
really
interesting. I heard from the Virgin Mary,

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.419
folks, and
they may not have happened to any of you,

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:09.419
and I --
[Laughing]

00:33:09.419 --> 00:33:13.040
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I'm very sad to have to tell you,
she's not a very nice person.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:16.090
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So once in a while we get somebody

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:19.179
that gives us a laugh. But anybody that works
--

00:33:19.179 --> 00:33:21.860
anybody that's involved in charity of this
kind is going

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:24.310
to be having a wonderful life; I can tell
you that. And

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:26.931
it makes changes in your own personality sometimes.
You

00:33:26.931 --> 00:33:29.309
know, they don't -- aren't quite as self-centered
and

00:33:29.309 --> 00:33:31.860
don't think they're as poor as they're putting
on.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:34.240
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Well, what I -- I think one of
the

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.240
things that I was curious about is I'm sure
you have a

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.790
lot of people ask you what it's like to have
Warren as a

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:43.550
brother, but I --
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I can tell ya.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.740
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Well, okay.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.920
&gt;&gt;DORIS: It's great.
[Laughing]

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.789
&gt;&gt;DORIS: We really do have a lot in common
now

00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:54.840
and he's -- well, he urged me to write the
book; that

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.940
was his idea, and --
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Did he write the forward as well?

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.809
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Yeah. He wrote the forward without
reading the book. He likes the book enormously.

00:34:00.809 --> 00:34:04.800
He
sent it to everybody he knows because it's

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.250
an honest
book. I mean, you could write and not tell

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:11.840
anything
about that event in 1987, and the things that

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.190
followed
it. But it wouldn't be true. It wouldn't tell

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:17.770
the
whole thing so he admired that because a lot

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:21.780
of people
don't do that. So it was a -- actually, it

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:27.129
was a great
healing thing for the two of us and so -- I

00:34:27.129 --> 00:34:29.169
send him
some of the more outrageous things and some

00:34:29.169 --> 00:34:32.780
of the thank
yous. Do you know what? A lady saw that show

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.540
you're
speaking of, Charlie Rose --

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:37.909
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Mm hmm.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: -- in California, and she sent me

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.230
a
letter and she said I've saved up money during

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:43.090
my
lifetime to help other people, but she liked

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.470
the way we
were doing it and and she said I'd like to

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:49.060
give you that
savings thing. And so I thought well, we had

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:51.119
our
lawyer -- we have a pro bono lawyer. There's

00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:53.750
some
things that go with this, kids. If they know

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:55.250
you're
doing the right things, they want to help

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:58.270
you. We get a
hot of things like that. But he's probably

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:02.860
the best.
So he wrote and you have to contact the lawyer,

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:04.500
and I
didn't think that it'd ever work out because

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.390
it was
maybe just some kind of a spontaneous thing.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:11.119
Well, we
got a check for $187,000. So people -- you

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:15.570
know, they may engage with you on you know
for a quarter

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:18.240
or something, but some little act of kindness
and

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.560
goodness, and then this woman -- I mean, I'm
just

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:24.050
astounded. That was a real vote of confidence.
So we

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.090
felt good about that. And we're going to put
it in some

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:31.000
very special cause, you know.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Absolutely. Well, between the

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.840
Learning from Giving Foundation.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: You see, everybody feels good. The

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.160
person who is empowered by what we do -- I'm
going to

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.600
tell one more, and then I promise to stop.
This is one

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.900
of the first ones, and it was a woman who
wrote to us

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.510
from South Carolina, and she had been a nurse
in a

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:50.790
doctor's office. This all panned out. We check
everything. And then she got arthritis and

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:53.020
she couldn't
do it any longer. So I said, well, Willie

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.780
Mae -- that
was actually her name -- Willie Mae, is there

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.630
anybody
else in your home now? And she said yes, my

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:03.000
husband,
and we always check it. It's usually a family

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.630
situation. It's going to take the whole family
to pull

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:08.520
it together. So I said well, is he working
now? She

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:11.080
said well, no. He was driving a truck and
he didn't

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:15.220
care for his -- you know, the route, and so
he's at home.

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.830
I had visions of him sitting in a Barcalounger
at that

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:23.380
moment. And so I said, well, tell him that
if -- when

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.820
he -- if he gets a job -- when he gets a job,
that we

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.540
will match his check until -- from now until
Christmas.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.300
She said the house was tumbling down and the
furnace

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.540
wasn't going to work. And so one week later,
we got a

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.740
copy of a check where he was raking pine needles,
the

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:42.480
next week he was working at Lowe's Hardware.
We want

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.690
cooperation, collaboration. That's probably
a little

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:47.180
different than what other people do. Because
it's

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.510
private money; we don't have to give it unless
we want

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.300
to, and they don't have to take it unless
they're happy

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:56.910
with it. So it works out equitably.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: So I think my last question, we

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:58.360
obviously know what it's like to have Warren
-- oh, we

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.070
have one more question, but I was going to
ask, what's

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.160
it like to have Doris Buffett as a sister?
What would

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:09.650
Warren say?
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I hadn't really thought about that.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:11.820
I
know he's very proud of me. I do know that,

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.580
and that
feels good. Everybody feels good when they're

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:17.220
appreciated. And we'd come from a rocky place
so that

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:24.010
was especially dear to my heart. We're living
out what

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:27.190
I think my father taught us. We were very,
very lucky

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.220
to have an outstanding dad who was a member
of Congress,

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:34.960
but I don't want you to get upset about that.
He was

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.790
not the -- not who we're dealing with now.
And in fact

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:41.330
when he died, the Omaha World-Herald wrote
and editorial that said he was known

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.120
for his blazing integrity. So you can't beat
that. And

00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:48.590
he was very kind and all that, too. So we
share that

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:54.290
and -- in a big way, and he set the markers
for us and

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.020
it's great to be able to do something about
it. So

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.700
I'm -- of course I'm grateful that he had
a bright idea.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:04.010
So did somebody in Google. You know, it really
is

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:07.110
magic. It happens fast, and it's wonderful
if you do

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:09.140
the right stuff with it.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: And then it multiplies.

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.100
&gt;&gt;DORIS: And then it multiplies. That's right.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: We'll take our last question.

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.090
&gt;&gt;Female #4: Hello. Thank you so much for
coming. I

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:17.230
was just wondering if you could talk a little
bit about

00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:20.990
the process that goes into selecting the schools
chosen

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:25.330
for the Learning by Giving program. How do
you pick?

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:30.210
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Well. I think we announce that the
course is available because there's always

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:33.891
some
professor, a professor, maybe more, that is

00:38:33.891 --> 00:38:35.900
very
enthusiastic about it. Then right away we

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.140
got the right
person teaching the course because it's something

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:41.140
they
believe in. And I think they announce it and

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.290
it's like,
build a field and they will come. Because

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.680
they all show
up, and they're passionate about it. We like

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.300
passion
because it really moves them forward with

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.140
a little
control and --

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.190
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;DORIS: So it's very simple. Everything we

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:01.290
do
is really simple, you know. There's nothing

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:05.260
convoluted.
We don't have to be contracts with people

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.560
-- we just --
we operate with kindness, and compassion,

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.530
and common
sense, and the only thing we ask is collaboration.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:18.010
Because then we're part of a team, you know.
It isn't

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:20.750
somebody dipping into their basket and handing
out

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:24.480
hundred dollar bills it's not that at all.
And they go

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:29.430
forward with it. It's really exciting.
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: Well, thank you so much for coming

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:32.320
and visiting with us today. I know you're
staying for

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.840
lunch, so enjoy.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: I'm sure I will.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.840
[Laughing]
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: I believe we have a few books

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.830
if
I'm not mistaken here and so if you want to

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.270
stay after
and get a book, I think we have some here.

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:45.670
And thank
you again for coming. We really appreciate

00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:46.670
it.
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Oh, it was a joy.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:47.670
[Clapping]
&gt;&gt;JENNIFER: And we look forward to working

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:48.670
with
you.

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.676
&gt;&gt;DORIS: Thank you very much.
