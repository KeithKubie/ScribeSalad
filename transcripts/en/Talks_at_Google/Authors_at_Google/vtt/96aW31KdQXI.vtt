MICHAEL TAFT: Hi.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.960
So this is a talk called
Mindfulness and Emotional

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.211
Intelligence, which is largely
out of "The Mindful Geek" book.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:12.710
OK?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.130
So we'll go into how
mindfulness can help you cope

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.700
with emotions in this talk.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.210
It's an iconic moment.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.650
The Rebel Alliance is
making a desperate attack

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.340
on the Death Star.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.010
As Luke Skywalker roles
has X-Wing Fighter

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.900
in towards the surface
of the battle station,

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.690
the voice of Obi
Wan Kenobi speaks

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.380
into his head saying,
"Luke trust your feelings."

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.550
At first, Luke is
confused, thinking

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.850
he must be hearing voices.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.060
But he sees the other pilots
failing to hit the mark.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.990
And at the same
time, Obi Wan keeps

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.790
whispering in his ear
saying, "Use the Force

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.040
and trust your feelings."

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.340
So finally Luke folds away
his targeting computer

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.280
and, in fact, uses his
feelings to make the shot.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.360
And as we all know, he
scores a hole in one,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.140
destroying the Empire's
shiny new weapon.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.700
Thus, the timeless
wisdom of "Star Wars"

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.440
teaches us that trusting our
feelings is a good thing.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.590
But is that really true?

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.094
And what does it even mean
to trust your feelings?

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:22.760
And how can you know
what you're feeling

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.870
and what those feelings signify?

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.900
In this talk we'll
look at emotions,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.300
emotional intelligence, and
how mindfulness meditation can

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.730
help you cope much more
effectively with your feelings

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.960
in order to get
more out of life.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.350
Along the way you'll learn
why meditation won't turn you

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.710
into a Teletubbie, how sitting
alone in your room meditating

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.680
can actually make you more
adept in social situations,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.100
and how Botox injections can
actually reduce your ability

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.572
to connect with other people.

00:01:52.572 --> 00:01:54.280
And we'll do this from
a perspective that

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.090
is interested in and
grounded by science, what I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.385
would call a geeky perspective.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.850
So as Van mentioned, my
name is Michael Taft.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.080
And I got into
meditation early in life.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.150
When I was a teenager,
I was experiencing

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.690
debilitating anxiety,
super bad anxiety attacks.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.590
The kind where you sometimes
can't even leave your room.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.800
And I didn't really know
what to do about it.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.094
And there wasn't any help
available that I could find.

00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:25.510
But I had read
some books and they

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.940
said that there was this
thing called meditation

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.130
and that it could help you
to relax and calm down.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.690
And so even though I
didn't have a teacher

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.450
and they didn't really describe
very much how to do it,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.540
I just gave it a try on my own.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.310
And voila, it helped me
to feel better right away.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.540
So after that I was hooked.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.150
And I've been meditating for
more than 35 years since then.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.620
I've sat in both Buddhist
and Hindu traditions

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.230
all around Asia in monasteries
and temples and retreat

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.530
centers, and learned from
some of the greatest teachers

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.490
there are.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.850
And although I have
all this experience

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.860
in religious traditions
around meditation,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.010
I recently published a book
entitled "The Mindful Geek,"

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.140
which is all about learning
mindfulness meditation

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.550
in a completely secular,
non-religious and

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.160
scientifically-oriented way.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.340
So how'd I get from A to B?

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.970
From reciting mantras in Indian
temple caves to penning a book

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.100
that's loaded with,
like, research and "Star

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.150
Wars" references?

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.060
It really began
in the 2000s, when

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.660
I was working with
the Bauman Foundation

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.660
to write books and create the
Being Human initiative-- you

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.610
may have seen the big
conferences that we did

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.510
in San Francisco--
and to do other fun

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.280
and fascinating projects.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.520
And a big part of that work was
to go meet with neuroscientists

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.470
and psychologists in their labs
and to talk with scientists

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.500
and philosophers, and
just looking into tons

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.890
of research for many years.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.710
And the result after decades
of that, doing meditation,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.680
the result was that
I was compelled

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.540
to reevaluate the entire
field of meditation

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.810
in the light of all this
cutting-edge science.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.690
The good news is that
the value of meditation

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.140
held up quite well
under this scrutiny.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.420
The better news is that the
research contributed vastly

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.200
to my understanding of how
meditation actually functions

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.270
and what types of meditation
are most effective for what

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.850
outcomes we're
looking for, and how

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.860
meditation can be
taught in entirely

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.700
new and innovative ways.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.740
So it really completely
revolutionized

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.090
my viewpoint of what's
going on in meditation

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.450
and how we approach
the whole field.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.030
I realize that for many
people, the spiritual context

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.030
of meditation-- with
beliefs and hierarchies

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.890
and maybe claims--
was something that

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.580
was getting in the
way of them being

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.260
interested in learning it.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.510
Lots of people who are modern
and secular and scientifically

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.290
oriented just don't relate to
that way of thinking at all.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.890
And it became
stunningly clear to me

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.810
that meditation, and
especially mindfulness,

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.080
is something that can
be taught perfectly well

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.740
outside of a spiritual context.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.800
For those interested in
the spiritual context,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.320
that will always be there.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.730
That's available for
anyone who wants it.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.712
But for those who are turned
off by that sort of thing,

00:05:23.712 --> 00:05:25.170
there's a different
way of learning

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.140
that is not only possible but
which actually, in my opinion,

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.270
offers a large
number of advantages.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.320
So that's how I ended up writing
a book called "The Mindful

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.020
Geek," and ended up
here talking you to you

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.380
today at Google, about
mindfulness, meditation

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.310
and emotions.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.300
So just to bring
everybody up to speed,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.392
let's define what we're
actually talking about.

00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:52.070
What is mindfulness?

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:56.700
Well, the classic standard
card-carrying mindfulness

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.680
teacher definition that
we all have to know

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.030
comes from a giant in the
field named Jon Kabat-Zinn.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.250
He was the first guy that
began to introduce mindfulness

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.120
into the medical community.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.650
And to do this, he had to dress
like the MIT-trained professor

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.877
of medicine that he is.

00:06:13.877 --> 00:06:15.585
Up until that point
in American history--

00:06:15.585 --> 00:06:17.290
and we're talking
about, essentially,

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.930
the mid '80s--
meditaters were seen

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.140
as hippies with long
beards and long robes

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.760
and long strings of beads
and people who are chanting

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.290
and with candles and incense.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.850
And I used to be
one of those people.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.610
I like those people.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.320
And then along comes
Jon Kabat-Zinn.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.620
And he's sitting there
in a three-piece suit

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.160
with a haircut and a neck tie.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.990
And it just kind of
blew everybody's mind.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.330
Because it was so different
than what we had seen before,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.460
what anyone had done before.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.990
It was totally different
than the cultural image

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.260
of a meditater.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.630
And as part of his drive to
bring this mindfulness practice

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.020
into hospitals, into
the medical community,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.170
he had to come up with a really
concise and precise definition.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.140
And it's pretty
different than the way it

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.270
had been talked about before.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.995
And his definition
goes like this.

00:07:07.995 --> 00:07:12.650
"Mindfulness is paying
attention on purpose,

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.980
in the present moment,
nonjudgmentally,

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.780
to the unfolding of
experience moment by moment."

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.540
So it's a pretty
complicated definition.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.000
So I'll just say
it one more time.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.990
"Mindfulness is paying
attention on purpose,

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.700
in the present moment,
nonjudgmentally,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.210
to the unfolding of
experience moment to moment."

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:38.760
So this has become the
standard one-line definition

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.050
that every mindfulness
teacher is forced to memorize.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.410
Or the mindfulness police
come and you take away

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.150
your meditation cushion.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:51.060
You just, like, have to be able
to reel that off from memory.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.490
And if you want to know the
difference between mindfulness

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.250
and meditation, the
answer is simply

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.170
that mindfulness is
a kind of meditation.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.044
So it's a subset of
the greater field

00:08:02.044 --> 00:08:04.585
of meditation practice, which
includes a lot of other things.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.240
So what about all this
emotional intelligence

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.690
stuff that I was
saying we'd talk about?

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:17.150
Well, mindfulness meditation
has been proven over and over

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.190
to enhance your life in a
whole bunch of different ways.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:23.480
This is all the research
I keep talking about.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.800
It's been shown that if
you practice regularly,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.780
you can expect improvement in
areas such as concentration,

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:33.520
creativity, memory retention,
reduce stress, and a lot more

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.770
than that.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.240
But for my money,
probably the most powerful

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.169
and interesting and
useful and life-changing

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.740
way that mindfulness can
improve your well being

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.490
is in the realm of emotions.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.480
This is where it really, really
starts to change your life.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.030
It's funny, but
emotions or "feelings"--

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.070
in the words of Obi Wan--
are maybe humanity's biggest

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.540
problem.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.670
We're destroying the
planet because we can't

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.730
handle our feelings of greed.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:04.940
We cause havoc and murder
and destruction with war

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.240
because we can't handle our
feelings of fear and hatred.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.440
But it's more personal
than that too.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.840
Virtually everything
you do every day,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.530
you do in order to
feel good emotionally.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.830
You're just trying to make
your feelings feel good.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.130
You date your partner to
be in a relationship that

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.560
makes you feel good.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.770
You work out so you'll lose
weight and not feel bad.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:31.150
You earn money in order to
not feel afraid of starving

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.420
or to feel happy about
the shiny products you

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.070
line your nest with, and so on.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.950
So emotions rule your life.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.570
And based on that fact alone,
understanding the background

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.740
and function of emotions is
clearly of supreme importance.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.330
The clearer picture you
have of your emotions

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.600
the clearer picture you
have of your entire life.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.060
And mindfulness meditation
is a very effective method

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.540
for getting clarity and
insight about your emotions

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.350
and enhancing your emotional
skills dramatically.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.820
Or to put it in
the current jargon,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.105
mindfulness boosts your
emotional intelligence.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.740
So I say that a lot
to people, mindfulness

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:12.310
boosts your emotional
intelligence.

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:14.680
And what people hear
me say is something

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.820
like mindfulness will make
you happy all the time.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.380
But that's not what I'm saying.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.100
Rest assured,
mindfulness will not

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.740
make you happy all the time.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.900
The practice will greatly
increase your well being

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.870
and enhance your
life in many ways.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.720
But it won't make you
happy every minute.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.590
It won't turn you
into a Teletubbie,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.390
dancing without a care in the
world or a thought in its head.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:40.260
No matter what's going on,
everything's just great.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.890
Instead, mindfulness
will allow you

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.300
to feel your feelings with
much greater sensitivity,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:49.740
and also cope with those
feelings much more effectively.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:52.370
It's not about so
much changing them

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.230
as changing your
relationship to them.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.990
But let's get a little more
fundamental here, go back

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:00.210
to first principles.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:04.650
And ask the question, what are
emotions in the first place?

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:07.352
Where did we get them
and what are they for?

00:11:07.352 --> 00:11:13.480
Well, evolution created emotions
in animals as guidance systems.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.160
Emotions are
mechanisms that tell

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.910
you what to do in order
to stay fed, safe,

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.770
and to spread your genes
into the next generations.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:25.810
So just for example, fear makes
total sense in this context.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:29.500
It's like, hey, that one
watering hole over there,

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.080
over the next hill,
always has a lot

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.870
of predators lurking around it.

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:34.120
So let's stay away from that.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:34.620
Right?

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.180
We're afraid of
that watering hole.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.370
Because that's a bad place.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:42.750
Or anger turns on when you're
cornered and you can't get away

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.610
and you have to
fight your way out.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.840
Angers evolve for
situations like that.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.360
So this is how emotions
are guidance systems.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:54.280
They're there to
motivate and direct

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.730
your behavior, what to do next.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.400
So emotions in
human beings evolved

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.930
to do something very similar.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.520
They act as a behavioral
guidance system for our lives.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.640
Or at least that's
what they're ideally

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.570
meant to do in an
ancient ancestor of ours

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.910
living in a small group on a
savanna a million years ago.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.290
They're a little
out of date now.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.920
And many of our reactions
don't make perfect sense

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.540
in a modern environment.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.220
One example is the fact that
almost throughout almost all

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.530
of human and pre-human
history, a person

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.580
lived in a tiny band of
maybe 25 to 50 people.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.620
So you just saw the
same 35 faces day in

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.400
and day out for
your entire life.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.190
Meeting new people,
especially unexpectedly,

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.140
was almost always
a really bad thing.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.710
So we contend to get triggered
and anxious around strangers.

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:54.040
Because our biology
was evolved to tell us

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.810
that strangers are bad.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.040
And yet, today, if you go
for a little stroll down

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.250
the street in New York City,
or sit in a baseball stadium

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.010
anywhere, you can find
yourself surrounded

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.720
by thousands and thousands of
faces you've never seen before,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.610
instantly.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.310
So this produces anxiety
because of the hard wiring

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.990
of our brain, which
tells us to get worried

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:18.842
when strangers are present.

00:13:18.842 --> 00:13:20.300
So that's just one
of the many ways

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.758
their our emotional guidance
system is a little out of date

00:13:22.758 --> 00:13:24.000
and needs some help.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.700
For example, with
mindfulness meditation

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.050
to cope with our
current environment.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:30.860
So the thing about
a guidance system

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:36.180
is it works best if it has both
negative and positive feedback.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.650
So you have to have both
positive and negative.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.440
I mean, imagine a
compass needle that's

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.470
only stuck in one place
or a maps application

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.530
on your phone that just
told you to turn right

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.160
at every intersection.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:51.250
It wouldn't work, obviously.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.780
You need both a North and a
South, a right and a left,

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:56.840
for a guidance system
to function optimally.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:01.310
And the same thing is true of
your emotional guidance system.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.860
It won't work unless it has
both the positive emotions

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.050
and negative emotions with which
to motivate and direct you.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:13.590
There's certain things that
you shouldn't do or shouldn't

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:14.230
do again.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.605
You should know
that they're bad.

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:18.120
So it's like do
this, don't do that,

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:21.150
is what emotions are
trying to tell you.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.050
So you need both of
them if the system

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.510
is going to function properly.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:27.120
And so having a
clear understanding

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.890
that both positive and
negative emotions are

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.630
natural and adaptive
and useful will

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:36.180
go a long way towards
both understanding

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.810
why you're feeling something.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.060
But more importantly, to
cope with what you're feeling

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.850
and accept it, which
is what mindfulness

00:14:43.850 --> 00:14:46.800
is going to help you to do.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.830
And again, when I
tell people this,

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.150
there's this sense of like,
you know, that's fine.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.410
And that makes sense.

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:54.966
And I understand
the evolution of it.

00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:57.090
But really, I just want to
feel happy all the time.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.110
Can't we do that?

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.090
But honestly, even
if you could do that,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.280
even if you can feel
happy every minute,

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.770
you actually wouldn't like it.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.860
It would be a bad thing.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.310
And just for example,
there are people

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.060
born with a gene that makes
it impossible to feel pain.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.062
Wouldn't that be great?

00:15:16.062 --> 00:15:17.020
Wouldn't you like that?

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.700
You'd never feel pain.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.910
It sounds great.

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.040
But these people who literally
can't feel anything negative

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:29.460
have very serious
difficulties in life.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.450
They're constantly
injuring themselves

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:33.020
and breaking their
limbs and burning

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.240
their skin and other things.

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.200
And they never know it.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.820
They only find out when
they see it or someone else

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.800
tells them it's going on.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.187
And so even the tiniest things
are tremendously dangerous.

00:15:47.187 --> 00:15:49.270
And so most people who
have this condition-- which

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.720
is known as congenital
insensitivity

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.740
to pain with anhydrous--
don't live long lives.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:00.530
It's just too dangerous
to never feel any pain.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.030
And so with emotions,
it's something similar.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.020
Just like pleasure and pain
are a kind of guidance system,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.510
positive and negative
emotions are a similar sort

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.060
of guidance system.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.710
And in human
beings, the activity

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.520
of that guidance
system, your emotions,

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.560
is called decision making.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:20.110
And all of us have a lot of
decisions to make each day.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:23.040
And it turns out that our
ability to feel these emotions

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.050
are central to that process
of making decisions.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:28.980
That's right.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.520
We use our emotions
to make decisions.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.120
We know this to be
true because there

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.230
are certain unfortunate
individuals who,

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.220
either through
disease or injury,

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.370
lose the parts of
their brain that

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:42.990
allows them to feel emotions.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:45.822
So we have examples of
people who never feel any.

00:16:45.822 --> 00:16:47.280
And one of these
people is referred

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.810
to in the medical
literature simply

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.970
as "Elliot," like
it's a pseudonym.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.890
He had lost parts of
his prefrontal cortex

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.230
by having a brain tumor removed.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:00.460
And afterwards, he
seemed completely normal.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.842
He was super intelligent.

00:17:01.842 --> 00:17:02.675
And he was charming.

00:17:02.675 --> 00:17:04.849
And he was well informed.

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:08.560
But he had lost this connection
to his emotional guidance

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:09.770
system.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:14.490
And had lost, therefore, the
ability to make good decisions.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.310
He'd agonize endlessly over,
like, what TV show to watch.

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:20.250
He couldn't decide.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:23.560
And then sometimes
rush headlong and half

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.079
cocked into these big
important life decisions.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.550
And so he lost his job.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:30.480
And he lost all
his money by making

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.140
these crazy financial
speculations

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.840
and eighty-sixed his marriage.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.520
And his children went away.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.240
And eventually, due to the
loss of his emotional guidance

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.760
system, his life was ruined.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.490
And this is actually
typical for people who

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.340
have this kind of brain damage.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.660
They're completely brilliant.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.310
They have all the
logical, rational ability

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.770
that you think would allow
them to make decisions.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:01.070
But because they can't contact
their emotional guidance system

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.430
nothing works right.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.370
So in the prefrontal
cortex-- which

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.910
is the part that
Elliott had removed--

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.040
connects many different
areas of the brain,

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.240
including those that are
concerned with reasoning,

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.720
to those that are
concerned with sensing,

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.060
the feeling state of the body.

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:21.250
So it's like a place where
the reasoning and the feeling

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:22.940
come together.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.170
And so when human beings
go about making a decision

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.960
they do the reasoning part,
collecting all the data

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.480
about the subject, all this
kind of external, concrete,

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.790
cost-benefit-analysis
type stuff.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.700
But that's not the whole story.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:40.280
We also consult physical
somatic memories

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.530
of our past emotional states.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.420
Noticing how we felt
as the result of making

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.290
similar decisions in the past.

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.050
How did I feel last time
I did something like that?

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.380
And most or all of
this consideration

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.960
goes on underneath
conscious awareness.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.360
But eventually, the process
gives rise to the feeling

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.310
that one of the choices
is better than the rest.

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.910
And noticing this
requires the ability

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.440
to sense the
feelings in your body

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.140
and to coordinate
those sensations

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:11.830
with the
decision-making function

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:14.070
of your prefrontal cortex.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.980
So you're doing this, like,
how did that feel last time?

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.740
Sort of thing.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:21.480
And you have to be able to
feel your feelings to do that.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:26.230
So for most of us that
goes on under the hood.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:28.160
But the gist of all
this is that emotions

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.110
are central to us
making good decisions.

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.960
And as such, we
might like to imagine

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.950
that we're completely calm
and Spock-like in our choices,

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.320
totally rational and analytical.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:45.230
But this is literally
almost never the case.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:48.460
Although economic theory
asserts that human beings are

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.640
the sorts of rational actors,
studies have shown repeatedly

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.930
that we are anything but that.

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:56.170
And somewhere under
the hood, our emotions

00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:00.310
are playing a key role in every
single decision that we make.

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:06.220
So a writer and a neuroscientist
that I really like,

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:10.360
Antonio Damasio, calls
his idea about how

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:15.480
this works the "Somatic
Marker Hypothesis," or SMH.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.350
To understand the
SMH, you first have

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:22.950
to understand that emotions
are primarily somatic events.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.310
You know you're having
an emotion because you're

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.220
feeling it in your body.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.590
And this idea is usually a
little weird for Westerners

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:33.180
to accept.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.010
Because after 50 years of
behavioral and cognitive

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.470
psychology, we have
this idea that emotions

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:40.390
are mental events.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.700
Like, we think about emotions.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.470
And it's true that the brain
is in charge of deciding,

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.420
for example, that we should
be afraid if we see a train

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:51.560
or whatever.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.510
But it's usually making
that decision far

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.580
below the level of
conscious awareness.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.010
And more importantly, once
it makes that decision,

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.960
like, hey it's
time to be afraid.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:05.570
Then that triggers a whole
series of changes in the body,

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:08.860
like a faster heart rate
and faster breathing

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.540
and sweaty palms.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.890
And your muscles in your legs
get all pumped up and energized

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.940
and ready to run, and so on.

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:20.970
And these characterize the
feeling of being afraid.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.790
So even though emotions
may be orchestrated

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.135
in the deep unconscious,
it's upon the soma.

00:21:27.135 --> 00:21:30.210
It's upon your physical
body that their symphony

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.280
is played out.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:31.780
Right?

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.810
So the brain decides
it's time to be afraid.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:37.390
But then the body
is the expression.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.410
And one of the ways that
we can understand that

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.440
is that our emotional
responses evolved

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.900
from similar emotional
responses in animals.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.060
Who, presumably, aren't
making a whole bunch

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:53.600
of long, logical, rational,
cognitive decisions

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:54.540
about emotions.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.540
It's something you
feel that motivates

00:21:56.540 --> 00:22:00.530
you to behave in a certain way.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:04.700
So trying an experiment
with me right now.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:08.500
It's going to make you
a little uncomfortable.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.440
I want you to think
about all the things

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.890
that make you anxious.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:16.440
Whatever you're most worried
about in the world right now,

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.500
really bring your fears to mind.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.990
And if you want me to
just help you with this,

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.880
you can think about global
warming and rising income

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.890
inequality and the fact that
a reality TV star could soon

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.301
be our president.

00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:32.800
And you could throw
in the knowledge

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.060
that you're going
to die someday.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.340
Just actually get yourself
worked up over your fears.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.970
Please do that for me right now.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:41.090
We won't do it for long.

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:45.060
But to do this well, you
actually have to try.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.820
And so do this for a moment
till you notice you're

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:49.750
feeling a little bit anxious.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.150
OK.

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:52.700
So raise your hand
if you actually

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:54.490
notice that thinking
about that stuff

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.695
is making you
slightly revved up.

00:22:57.695 --> 00:22:58.930
A couple people?

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.950
OK.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:01.520
Good.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.520
Then ask yourself how do
you know you're anxious?

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.180
What do you feel in your body?

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.140
Is your stomach area tight?

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:14.070
Or maybe you feel a little
nausea or your chest

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:18.170
could feel tighter or your
breathing has sped up.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:19.260
What sensations?

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.020
So just close your
eyes and explore.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:24.450
What sensations in your
body feel like the feelings

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:26.690
of anxiety to you?

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:28.100
It's OK if you're not sure.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.660
Just notice whatever you notice.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.100
And remember that.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.300
And then the next time you get
anxious at home or at work,

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.840
or out in the world or whatever,
tune into your body again.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.110
And see if the
anxiety is expressing

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:47.590
with those same sensations
that you noticed just now.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:50.520
It's a lot easier when
you're not making it up.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.080
Out there, and you notice
you're feeling real anxiety,

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:53.740
check it out.

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.982
But see if they're
the same sensations.

00:23:56.982 --> 00:23:58.690
But of course, I'm
not going to leave you

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:00.680
all revved up and anxious.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.450
So let's go ahead
and do the opposite.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:08.640
So again, this time, think
of the people and animals

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:13.530
that you love the most, somebody
that you really care about.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.090
And see them in your mind's
eye having the greatest

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.090
day of their life,
feeling super happy

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:21.360
and doing things
they really enjoy.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.680
And picture them
laughing and joyous.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.120
So really do this right now, OK?

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.620
Close your eyes
and picture this.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.870
And just see them having a
great time in your imagination.

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:33.240
And picture it as clearly
as you can over and over.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.030
See them smiling and happy
and just having a great time.

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:41.130
And do this until you notice
that you feel just a little bit

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:42.150
of happiness somehow.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.387
And raise your hand if you
feel just a tiny bit happy.

00:24:49.387 --> 00:24:52.010
OK.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:57.260
Now, ask yourself, how do you
know you're feeling happy?

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.520
How do you know?

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:01.190
Where are you sensing
it in your body?

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.700
Maybe you notice some
activation in the muscles

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:07.130
around your mouth and cheeks,
kind of a ghost of a smile.

00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:08.680
You might not
actually be smiling.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.630
But you start to feel that
it might want to do that.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:16.430
Or you can feel the
sensation of like, upliftment

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:18.240
or rising in your
chest, or like,

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.580
your heart expanding if
the happiness gets big.

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.680
But you feel it in
your actual chest.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.930
So these are some of the
body sensations of happiness.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.140
And hopefully they replaced
any sensations of anxiety

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.340
we brought up.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.340
And the next time you get
slammed with happiness

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.120
out there in the
world, remind yourself

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.990
to contact these sensations
of happiness in your body.

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:43.260
And notice that the
details of what it feels

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.030
like, physically, to feel happy.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.930
And just take a moment
when you do that to, like,

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.980
enjoy and relish
those sensations.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:55.980
Like, allow yourself to
really experience the pleasure

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.480
of happiness in your body.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.400
So what we just did right
there is a mindfulness

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.405
of emotions exercise.

00:26:03.405 --> 00:26:06.940
It's a very typical
exercise of beginning

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:11.070
to notice the sensations
in your body of emotions.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.210
And there are a
lot of other ones.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.160
The one thing to
get out of it is

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.670
that the experience
of your emotions

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.800
is largely in your body.

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.850
You may have thoughts
about an emotion.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:26.800
But the emotion itself
is in the flesh.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.190
So then, going back to the
Somatic Marker Hypothesis--

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:35.290
remember it says, somatic, which
means embodied-- Damasio says

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:37.560
that the brain uses
these emotional body

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.980
sensations like the ones
you were just feeling.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.360
And it uses those to assist
it in making decisions.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.044
Those are the somatic markers.

00:26:46.044 --> 00:26:47.710
When you're trying
to make the decision,

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:49.590
you unconsciously
recall memories

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.840
of previous similar situations
and remember those feelings

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.877
that you had in your
body about the outcome.

00:26:57.877 --> 00:26:59.460
And as an example,
imagine that you're

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.050
trying to decide whether to
buy a lottery ticket or not.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:05.980
Which, rationally,
is always a bad idea.

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.270
You may feel very excited
about the possibility

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.680
of winning-- like, wow, I could
win-- since the jackpot happens

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.025
to be unusually huge this month.

00:27:15.025 --> 00:27:18.060
Yet consciously or
not, you also remember

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:20.830
how you felt--
disappointed and downcast--

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:24.100
in your previous attempts
at buying lottery tickets.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.310
You're remembering those
feelings in your body.

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.320
And those emotional tones
serve as somatic markers

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.446
that guide you away.

00:27:31.446 --> 00:27:32.820
Remember, it's a
guidance system.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.420
Those remembered feelings of
like, wow, last time I bought

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.750
those tickets I felt bad.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.430
That guides you away from
buying a ticket this time.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.190
So that's how
somatic markers work.

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.300
And that's how
emotions guide you.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.900
So researchers devised
a fascinating experiment

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:51.800
to test the Somatic
Marker Hypothesis.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.780
They created a game involving
four decks of cards.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:00.050
And the participants in
the game were given money

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:00.990
by the researcher.

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:02.910
So they all start out
with a pile of money.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:06.100
And each of the decks
are made of cards

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:07.870
that either take
money from your pile

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.050
or give you more
money into your pile.

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.290
And so two of the decks
were completely random.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.846
They had an equal
number of cards

00:28:15.846 --> 00:28:17.970
that took away money and
cards that gave you money.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.360
So they were fair.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.950
Those were fair decks.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.140
But secretly, the
other two decks we're

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.040
rigged to have a lot
more negative cards.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.970
They were cards that
would steal your money.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.850
They were totally unfair.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.300
And this meant that
those decks were "bad."

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.580
And so they have
these participants

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.970
play this game, where they're
taking cards and giving cards

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:40.480
back.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:44.180
And it turns out that
healthy participants

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:48.320
began noticing that those
unfair decks were unfair,

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.920
after about 40 turns.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.270
It took them about 40
turns to figure out

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.410
that those decks weren't random.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.610
And they just would never
choose from them again.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:04.290
But intriguingly, their bodies
showed measurable stress

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.480
after only 10 turns.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.940
So in body sensation
terms, they already

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.390
knew they were bad
after only 10 turns,

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.280
suggesting that their
unconscious brain was

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.220
already aware that the
decks were no good.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.510
And in fact, if they were better
at feeling their own feelings--

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.900
like you'd get from
mindfulness meditation--

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.880
they would have stopped drawing
the bad cards a lot earlier.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:30.370
Because sensing the body
sensations of emotions

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.580
is how intuition works.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.610
But what's interesting
is people with damage

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.500
to the prefrontal cortex,
these people who couldn't feel

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.550
their emotions, just kept
drawing from the bad decks

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.169
for the whole game.

00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.960
They never stopped.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:45.220
They never caught on.

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.380
So they went bankrupt.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:47.838
And they had to
beg the researchers

00:29:47.838 --> 00:29:49.830
for additional funds
to keep playing.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.620
And they never had
a stress response.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.500
You know, hooked up
to the same machinery,

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:59.840
their bodies didn't know
that the game was bad.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.060
So they couldn't
feel their emotions.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.760
They couldn't make
good decisions.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:12.330
So feeling our emotions is a
big deal in having a good life.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.530
So this biological and
evolutionary background

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:18.340
of emotions leads us
to one big conclusion.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.860
It's a good idea to
feel your feelings

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.770
and accept them just
the way they are.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.440
Remember that official
definition of mindfulness?

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.096
That I already said
twice out loud,

00:30:29.096 --> 00:30:30.990
I'll say it one more time.

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:33.210
"Mindfulness is paying
attention on purpose,

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:35.310
in the present moment,
nonjudgmentally,

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:39.130
to the unfolding of
experience moment to moment."

00:30:39.130 --> 00:30:43.560
So you might notice it includes
that word, nonjudgmentally.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.400
And that means, in this
case, accepting your emotions

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.540
just the way they are.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:50.150
And it helps if
you will recognize

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:51.930
that human emotions
are responses

00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:54.360
that were programmed into
our biology over millions

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.600
and millions of years.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.270
We like to think
that our emotions are

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:03.400
personal and intimate and
special things about us.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.570
And this is the Doctor McCoy
theory of human existence.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.070
We're always hearing "Bones"
passionately assert something

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.170
about the value of
squishy human feelings

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.610
in the face of cold,
rational logic.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.720
But seen from an
evolutionary perspective,

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.550
our emotions are a
little bit mechanistic.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:23.800
And sure, the reasons you
have for your emotions

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.770
are very unique.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:29.120
And human beings are so complex
that our emotional responses

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.480
are very unpredictable
and individual.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.590
But the emotional
responses themselves

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:40.150
are not necessarily "yours,"
as much as they are a reaction.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:44.980
And recognizing that is really
helpful in coping with them.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.870
Admitting this means that
you can stop taking so much

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:50.580
personal responsibility
for every little thing

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:53.910
that you're feeling, which
is usually a big relief.

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:57.070
Not every emotion you're having
is one that you consciously

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.080
decided to have.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.540
Despite what all the new-age
memes in your Facebook feed

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.810
are telling you, you
don't have total control

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.840
over your feelings.

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:09.420
Taking personal responsibility
for each emotion

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.350
makes about as much sense as
taking personal responsibility

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.630
for your liver function.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:18.740
Instead, accept that you're
feeling however you're feeling.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.270
If you want to change that
later, you can try to do that.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.630
And you don't have to
express that feeling

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.560
or do anything about it.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.420
And if you want to
change the feeling later,

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.930
you can try to do that too.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.960
But beating yourself up for
how you're feeling emotionally

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:35.650
at any moment is very
counterproductive.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.070
And it just doesn't work.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.850
The system is doing
what it's doing.

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.150
And in mindfulness we
want to remember that.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.200
And particularly, feeling
bad doesn't always

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.950
mean that there's
something wrong.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:51.850
You might have perfectly
good reasons for feeling bad.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:55.600
As a society, we're really
intolerant for the presence

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.780
of unpleasant emotions.

00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:01.730
Sorrow or anything like that,
we don't like having it.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:03.700
And we rush to fix
it or change it

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.520
immediately even when the
emotion makes perfect sense.

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.230
So for example, some
people take antidepressants

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.060
after the death of a loved one.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:14.990
Because the grief
can be so intense.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:18.450
And I'm not judging
that one way or another.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:22.280
And during the recent
updating of the DSM-IV-- which

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.530
is the Diagnostical
and Statistical Manual

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:30.010
that psychiatrists use
to diagnose patients--

00:33:30.010 --> 00:33:34.650
the committee in charge of
that wanted to categorize grief

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:36.890
as a mental illness.

00:33:36.890 --> 00:33:39.980
So just feeling bad about
somebody dying and feeling

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.200
grief, they were to say,
well, that's mental illness.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.700
Why?

00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.310
Because it feels bad.

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:46.320
People don't like it.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.420
And so you know, this suggestion
was vetoed, thankfully.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:53.740
They didn't end up putting that
in there as a mental illness.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:55.020
And you know, it's true.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.810
Grief feels really unpleasant.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.930
But wouldn't it be strange
to respond to, for example,

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:01.940
the death of a loved
one by feeling happy

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.350
or nothing at all?

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:06.630
It's a natural response.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.960
So when you see emotions
in the light of acceptance,

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:12.909
you can begin to have an
entirely different relationship

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:14.389
to them.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:16.460
You begin to understand
that they are simply

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:20.170
happening, like your
heartbeat or your breathing.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.040
And a full range of
emotions, including

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.250
positive and negative,
indicates that you're

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:27.770
a healthy, functioning organism.

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.690
Your emotions are there
to guide your behavior,

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.850
not to make you feel good.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.319
So now, I just have to make
a little public service

00:34:36.319 --> 00:34:36.860
announcement.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.969
Because people can
take this too far.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:42.710
If you're experiencing something
like clinical depression

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:47.110
or a clinical anxiety
disorder, taking

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.050
a psycho-pharmacological
medication

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.330
could be an important
step in your return

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:54.000
to well being, not
just acceptance.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Getting your emotional system in
good working order is crucial.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.940
And sometimes the
process requires

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.730
things like medicine
and psychotherapy

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.380
and other end of interventions,
before you kind of get back

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.960
on track.

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.540
So in mindfulness
meditation, you

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.234
learn to accept your emotions.

00:35:09.234 --> 00:35:10.400
You don't have to like them.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.840
And you don't have to want them.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.790
But you will have a much
better experience each day

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:18.890
by letting them just be the way
they are and not fighting it.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.790
If you do this day in and day
out, both in formal practice

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.480
and in life, after
a while you'll

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.520
notice something really,
really interesting happening.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.660
It's really worth it.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.050
So probably many of you
have heard this quote.

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:34.160
But Viktor Frankl, the
neurologist and psychologist

00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:36.510
who was a survivor
of Auschwitz--

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.610
the most egregious
concentration camp of them

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:44.520
all-- once wrote that
"Between stimulus and response

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.150
there's a space.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:50.970
And in that space is our
power to choose our response.

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:54.400
In our response lies our
growth and our freedom."

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.150
So this brilliant
quote points to one

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.510
of the deepest and most
important benefits derived

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.830
from mindfulness of emotions.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.880
And that is it increases
your behavioral flexibility.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.370
It gives you more choices
about your response.

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.540
Human beings display
a surprising amount

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.160
of automaticity in our behavior.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:13.870
That is, under the
same conditions

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:17.160
we tend to do the same
things over and over again.

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.300
Stimulus, response,
stimulus, response.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.860
Same conditions, same response.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.440
And I know what you're
thinking, which is that that's

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:26.260
the definition of insanity.

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:29.540
But really, it's just
part of being human.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.080
Regardless of
whether the behavior

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.680
is effective or
desirable or not,

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.580
we automatically
repeat it with a kind

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.460
of mechanical predictability.

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.080
To put it in
Frankl's terms, there

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.980
isn't any distance between
the stimulus and the response.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:46.560
We just feel the
feeling and then act.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:48.220
And if you do
that, you just keep

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:52.827
getting the same
result every time,

00:36:52.827 --> 00:36:53.910
under the same conditions.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:59.930
So earlier we did a body
sensation meditation.

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:02.000
But you can go deeper
and just meditate

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.750
on emotional-type
body sensations,

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:06.250
like that feeling in
your face of being happy

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.680
or some of those
feelings of anxiety.

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:11.690
By meditating in that way,
with an emphasis on accepting

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:15.700
the feelings however they are,
does something really cool.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.690
Which is it builds a
gap where the "space"--

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:21.490
that Frankl's talking about--
between the stimulus--

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.320
which is the emotion--
and the response--

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.750
which is what you do
about the emotion.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:28.210
So there's a gap in there.

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:29.800
And by cultivating
this space, you

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:32.560
gain something every human
being ever born has wanted,

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.590
which is the ability to
choose whether to respond

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.110
to this emotional urge or not.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:41.470
And if you do decide
to respond, you

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.490
can choose how you
want to respond.

00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:45.940
It's not just a
reaction anymore.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:47.980
The emotions themselves
haven't changed.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.410
You're accepting
however you feel.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:54.220
You're not, like, submerging
yourself in a sea of bliss.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:57.120
It's not all happy,
happy, joy, joy.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.790
Instead you're going to feel
your emotions very keenly.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:03.620
But you develop the
ability to not act on them

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.610
if you don't want to.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.520
Because you cultivate
this kind of acceptance.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.750
And this can save you,
and those around you,

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:12.979
a lot of trouble and pain.

00:38:12.979 --> 00:38:15.020
Think of all the times
you've done something rash

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.050
and regretted it afterwards.

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:20.250
Like you've said something
out of rage or spite

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:23.010
that should never
have been spoken.

00:38:23.010 --> 00:38:25.760
Think of all the urges or
compulsions or even addictions

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:27.750
that you automatically
respond to,

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.380
even when you don't want to.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.380
You know they're bad.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.240
But the feeling comes
up and you just do it.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:36.010
Mindfulness of
emotion allows you

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.550
to gain some measure
of control over that,

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:41.020
and maybe even a kind
of wisdom, with respect

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.710
to the expression
of these emotions.

00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:46.610
You're able to respond
intelligently rather than

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.840
simply react.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:49.760
So it's interesting.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:52.240
Because, like, ancient
philosophers and theologians

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.020
from every culture were
almost uniformly negative

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.590
about emotions, which
they called something

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.470
like "the passions."

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:03.100
And it's because of this
feature that human beings

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.710
can do something
terrible and irreversible

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.064
in a moment of
emotional intensity

00:39:08.064 --> 00:39:09.980
and then regret it for
the rest of their lives

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.063
and cause a lot of damage.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:16.150
But meditation on emotion,
mindfulness of emotion,

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:20.060
can help you to make sure that
you think before you act and do

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.700
the intelligent thing.

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.340
And you should check out
the groundbreaking addiction

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.700
research and treatments
done by my friend,

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:33.662
Judson Brewer-- he's an
Ph.D, M.D. From Yale--

00:39:33.662 --> 00:39:35.370
If you want to learn
more about the power

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:36.410
of this way of working.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.250
Because the kind of
results you could

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:43.780
get from meditating on, say,
urges of addiction or emotional

00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:46.810
urges is amazing.

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:51.625
It's getting amazing results
in double-blind studies.

00:39:51.625 --> 00:39:53.490
OK.

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:55.930
So once you're accepting the
emotions that you're feeling,

00:39:55.930 --> 00:39:59.410
but not necessarily acting
upon them, what next?

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:01.830
How can you use that
time between the stimulus

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:03.050
and the response?

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.000
Between the time you
start feeling the emotion

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.030
in your body and the time
you do something about it?

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.370
The answer is you can
meditate upon the body

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.910
sensation of the emotion with
as much clarity as possible.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.780
You want to have clarity.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.676
And what do I mean by clarity?

00:40:19.676 --> 00:40:21.050
Well, you can
think of meditation

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.950
as a kind of
awareness-extending technology,

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:26.800
like a telescope
or a microscope.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.550
When you begin the
practice of mindfulness

00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:31.160
you're training your
awareness on present moment

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.090
sensory experiences.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.550
And at first, that'll
feel pretty normal.

00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:39.120
But after a while, you notice
an increase in your ability

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.270
to detect finer and finer
qualities of sensation

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:44.840
at smaller and smaller scales.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.760
Your brain just gets
better at detecting

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:50.970
the different sensations in
nearby areas of the body.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:53.570
This aspect of meditation
is called sensory clarity,

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:56.360
where you use your
awareness like a telescope

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.570
or a microscope to "see"
smaller and subtler

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:02.050
sensory experiences.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.190
Sensory clarity takes
a while to develop.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.280
And it requires that
you attempt to make

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:12.090
these really fine distinctions
in your meditation practice.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.280
So it's not just about
feeling your body.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:15.890
It's about getting
good at feeling

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:18.760
the details of your body.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.900
For example, if I asked
you to concentrate

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.790
on the bodily sensations
currently present

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:26.130
in your right foot--
which we did earlier.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:27.090
So do that now.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:30.860
Feel your right foot--
what do you feel?

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.610
Most people, with no
mindfulness training,

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.160
report basically feeling
their entire foot.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.010
It's as if the
sensations can only

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:40.650
be experienced as a few
big pixels of information.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.140
It's just a foot.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.690
Because we're not
used to zeroing in.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:51.230
Or maybe you have a little
efficacy or a little clarity.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:53.324
And you might call it
"sensory resolution."

00:41:53.324 --> 00:41:54.740
Maybe you have a
little resolution

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.030
on your body sensation.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.640
And you can feel
for nine big pixels

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:03.600
of feeling there, feeling
data in your foot.

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.490
But with mindfulness
practice, the resolution

00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:09.160
of the sensory data in your
foot can get a lot bigger,

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:13.430
like 128 pixels of
feeling in your foot.

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.770
And eventually-- and it
won't take that long,

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:18.640
like six months-- you'll
be able to effortlessly

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.600
feel pixels as small
as a grain of sand

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.750
everywhere in your foot.

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.120
The surface, inside,
all through it,

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:29.280
you can just pick out each
little spot individually.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.150
And you can just
take my word for it.

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.850
But there's science about this.

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.400
One study found that
meditaters were not only able

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.540
to focus much better
than controls--

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.100
this is after only
four days of practice--

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:44.340
but that they increased
the depth of "information

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.764
processing" on their
body sensation as well.

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:48.180
And that's what
I'm talking about,

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.980
the depth of
information processing.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.320
So there's more
pixels of data there.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.130
Another study focusing
on tactile sensations

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.780
looked at a number of objective
and subjective measures

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:02.240
of sensitivity in
experienced meditaters.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.930
And they found that
the measured area

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:09.530
of the cortex of their brain
dedicated to tactile sensation

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.620
was bigger.

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.960
The researchers found
that meditation enhances

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:17.040
introspective accuracy
for bodily sensations,

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:18.830
meaning that the
practitioners don't just

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.970
think they have greater
sensation or greater

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:23.020
sensory clarity
than non-meditaters.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:29.850
They actually have much more
resources, much more neurons

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.370
dedicated to the task
of body sensations

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:34.090
than people who don't meditate.

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:37.705
So you grow this really
high-quality sensory

00:43:37.705 --> 00:43:38.205
resolution.

00:43:40.832 --> 00:43:42.540
And it doesn't have
to be just your body.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:46.160
It can be on all your
other senses also.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.040
So in the case of
emotions, you learn

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.340
to be very precise and detailed
and specific with regards

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.130
to emotional body sensations.

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:55.640
Meditating on
emotions in the body

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.390
will develop the part
of your brain called

00:43:57.390 --> 00:44:00.020
the insula, which is the
part of the brain associated

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.300
with the feeling of
internal sensations.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.210
And doing this will
help you get better

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.880
at noticing these fine
degrees of sensation,

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:14.300
which my teacher, Shinzen
Young, calls "skill at feeling."

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:17.600
Skill at feeling has a
number of important benefits.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.090
One is that it will allow
you to know more about how

00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:21.950
you're feeling.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.140
Many people have a difficult
time describing or even knowing

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:28.120
what emotions they're
actually having right now.

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:30.000
It's not so much a
lack of vocabulary,

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.920
but a lack of the ability to
contact emotional sensations

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.350
with clarity.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:37.720
They just know they're
feeling something.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.830
But by developing the skill at
feeling through mindfulness,

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:44.860
you'll have a much better idea
of what you're experiencing

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.310
emotionally, moment by moment.

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.450
And given that these
little feelings

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:51.330
are so important
in decision making,

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:53.680
like, remember that
game where people

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:58.220
could have chosen the cards
instead of after 40 turns,

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:01.930
after only 10 turns, presumably,
if they had been able to feel

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.730
their emotions better.

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:09.370
It's a really important
thing to be able to do.

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:10.950
So it's clearly very helpful.

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:13.710
And it's almost like
growing better and better

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.990
at having intuition.

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:18.730
But there's even
more to it than that.

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.830
There are even bigger
and better benefits

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:24.336
to practicing
mindfulness of emotions.

00:45:24.336 --> 00:45:25.210
You know, it's funny.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:26.793
When you tell your
friends that you're

00:45:26.793 --> 00:45:29.050
going to spend the next 10
minutes or 30 minutes off

00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:31.584
in your room, meditating,
if they're cool

00:45:31.584 --> 00:45:32.500
they'll be supportive.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.550
But I've often heard
people say that it's

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:35.660
a "selfish" thing to do.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:39.330
Or that meditation like
that is self indulgent.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:42.890
And you know, I can see
why they would think that.

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:44.410
You're sitting
alone in your room,

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:47.519
paying close attention to your
body sensations, for example.

00:45:47.519 --> 00:45:49.060
And that can sound
like a really sort

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:52.310
of precious and
self-absorbed activity.

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:54.280
But the really
fascinating thing is

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.790
this-- sitting
alone in your room,

00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:00.590
meditating on your feelings
of emotions in your body,

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:03.020
can actually make
you better at knowing

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.650
what other people are feeling.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:07.240
And that, of course,
is the opposite

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:08.750
of being self-absorbed.

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:11.810
It can actually make
you much more empathic.

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.590
It turns out that human beings
tune into other people's

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:17.490
feelings by subtly
mimicking the other person's

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:20.890
expressions in their own faces.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:23.630
And these are known
as micro expressions.

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:26.900
These are just very tiny,
almost unconscious versions

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.450
of normal expressions.

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:32.190
So if the person across
from you has a big smile,

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.190
you have this micro
expression smile

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.730
that can't be seen
with a camera,

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:39.660
but can be detected
with electrodes.

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:43.790
And that's just part of our
built-in evolutionary mechanism

00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:48.090
that helps us cooperate with
a group of other people, which

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.840
is what we evolved to do.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.630
Meditating on
emotional sensations

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.990
begins to slowly
make these feelings

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:59.230
of these micro expressions
a lot more noticeable.

00:46:59.230 --> 00:47:02.899
So most of the time, they're
going on unconsciously.

00:47:02.899 --> 00:47:04.440
You're making these
micro expressions

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.190
to understand other
people's feelings.

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.440
But you don't really
know you're doing it.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:10.470
But meditating on them
makes it so you can

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:11.960
feel those micro expressions.

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:14.540
And that's a crucial skill
for deepening connection

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:15.830
with other people.

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:17.860
And that builds
better relationships.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:22.980
You just get better at people.

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.670
Again, there's some
really compelling evidence

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:27.980
to show that this is the case.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.220
So how can we actually
prove that people really

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.740
do get this empathic
information from mimicking

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.510
others' expressions?

00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:36.650
Most of us aren't even
aware that we're doing it.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:38.840
So self reports wouldn't help.

00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.850
What if we could somehow
freeze people's facial muscles

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:46.100
so they were actually physically
prevented from mimicking

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:47.130
others?

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.810
Is there a population of
people readily available

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.790
who have frozen facial muscles?

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.000
Yes.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.340
And they're called people
who get Botox injections.

00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.350
So researchers
Neil and Chartrand

00:48:00.350 --> 00:48:02.920
gave a standard empathy
test to a group of women who

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:05.400
had received Botox injections.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.610
The test involves looking
at pictures of people's eyes

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:11.744
and then determining what
emotion they're feeling.

00:48:11.744 --> 00:48:13.910
So you look at all these
different pictures of eyes.

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:15.368
And you're like,
this person scared

00:48:15.368 --> 00:48:16.760
or this person's
happy, whatever.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.340
And then they
compared these results

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:23.510
to another group of women
who had gotten injections

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:26.880
of a dermal filler, which is
another kind of cosmetic thing.

00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:31.100
But it doesn't impair your
muscles, your facial muscles.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:31.800
And it's clever.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.200
Because that group of
women were very similar

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.010
in terms of age
and income and all

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:37.430
these other
demographic features.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.110
So the groups were
really similar,

00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:41.370
except one group's facial
muscles were frozen

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:44.310
and the other's weren't.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:47.210
The result was that the
Botox women were greatly

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:50.970
reduced in their ability
to empathize with others.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:54.470
They couldn't guess properly
what other people were feeling.

00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:57.230
And it's because they couldn't
move their own facial muscles

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:00.980
and couldn't tune into
their own micro expressions.

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.920
So they lost this
ability to connect.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.990
And so just to prove
the point, to make

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:08.540
sure this wasn't some
statistical anomaly

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:11.319
or something, the
researchers did something

00:49:11.319 --> 00:49:12.610
that I thought was really cool.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:16.560
Which is they did the
entire experiment again.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:19.620
But this time, instead
of the Botox group,

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:22.912
they gave a group of women
a kind of stiffening gel

00:49:22.912 --> 00:49:23.495
on their face.

00:49:23.495 --> 00:49:25.960
It made their skin really stiff.

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.490
And all that did was make
their muscles work a lot harder

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:30.100
to move.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.690
They didn't freeze the
muscles or stop them.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.509
But they made it harder to move.

00:49:35.509 --> 00:49:37.300
And because the muscles
had to work harder,

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.710
it made those micro
expressions easier to feel.

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:42.180
That's the important part.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.450
They could feel the
micro expressions.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:48.150
And as expected, those
women got much higher scores

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:51.840
on the empathy test than the
people with the dermal filler.

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:55.650
So mindfulness does something
very similar to this stiffening

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:56.600
gel.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.650
Over time, your
insula-- which is

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:02.320
the thing that allows you to
feel your body-- gets bigger.

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:06.600
And so your ability to feel
these micro expressions

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:07.470
gets heightened.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:09.750
And because you can
feel it more clearly,

00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:12.970
you can tune to other people
are much more effectively.

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:15.090
And that's how sitting
alone in your room

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:18.250
can make you more empathic
and even do better

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:22.020
in your relationships
and social situations.

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:25.240
So these are the basics
behind using mindfulness

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.900
to increase your
emotional intelligence.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.310
You accept the emotions
you're feeling.

00:50:30.310 --> 00:50:33.830
You notice that those emotions
are embodied experiences.

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:36.610
And you zero in on
the physical details

00:50:36.610 --> 00:50:40.570
of each emotional body sensation
with as much clarity as

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:42.400
possible.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.830
"Trust your feelings, Luke."

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:46.510
With daily practice
over time, you'll

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:49.910
notice a positive revolution
in your experience

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:53.460
of your own inner life, your
interactions and relationships

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:58.450
with other people, and even your
satisfaction with existence.

00:50:58.450 --> 00:50:59.890
Thanks.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:01.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.980
AUDIENCE: So mostly what
we covered right now

00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:11.041
was how the science works.

00:51:11.041 --> 00:51:11.790
MICHAEL TAFT: Yes.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:13.720
AUDIENCE: In terms
of implementation,

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.170
do you suggest something
done differently?

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:18.720
So mindfulness
meditation mostly, today,

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.000
focuses on the
breath or something

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.106
that you can just
pay attention to.

00:51:23.106 --> 00:51:23.980
MICHAEL TAFT: Uh-huh.

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:27.290
AUDIENCE: Given that there is
an emotional context to it now,

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.180
is there something else
you suggest or propose?

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:30.930
MICHAEL TAFT: Yes.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:34.280
So honestly, the
only different thing

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.840
is that instead of the emotional
body sensations associated

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:42.090
with breathing, or the emotional
body sensations of a body scan,

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:46.284
you're picking out the
sensations of emotion.

00:51:46.284 --> 00:51:48.450
And that's why I had you
do the thing of bringing up

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:51.260
the anxiety or bringing
up the happiness

00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:56.060
so that you could learn to feel
what an emotional sensation

00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.156
feels like.

00:51:57.156 --> 00:51:59.030
And then I was saying,
out in the world, when

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:02.640
you have those emotions,
let's say you get really happy

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.410
one day.

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:04.290
You're super happy.

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:06.490
Just spend five
minutes or one minute

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:10.010
or even 30 seconds and
tune into the feelings

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:11.290
of the happiness in your body.

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:15.910
So you begin to learn what
an emotion feels like.

00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:19.480
But then, after that,
you're doing the same things

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:21.800
that you would do in any
other mindfulness, which

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:25.120
is you accept those feelings
just the way they are.

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:27.130
You don't try to change them.

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:29.340
And as I mentioned,
you zero in really

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:32.080
specifically on the
details of the feeling.

00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.710
So you would do that in a breath
meditation or a body sensation

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:37.020
meditation anyway, right?

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.380
You're going to
accept the feelings.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:41.620
And you're going to get
into the subtleties.

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:44.460
You want to notice the fine
details, and in this case,

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:47.990
the fine details of
emotions in your body.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:49.480
That's all it takes.

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.110
Because after awhile, you'll
start feeling your feelings,

00:52:52.110 --> 00:52:55.060
like, a week before you
would have felt them before,

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:58.190
or 10 minutes before you would
have noticed them before.

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:00.530
And that makes all
the difference.

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:03.530
That's building that gap
between stimulus and response.

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:08.730
Suddenly, it's like, how those
people could have potentially

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:11.090
noticed the bad decks earlier.

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:12.380
Their body was noticing it.

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:14.200
They're having a
stress response.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.910
If you know how to feel a
stress response, than you could,

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:20.410
presumably, notice that
the decks were bad earlier.

00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:23.320
So just getting really good
at feeling the feelings

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.080
and not trying to change them,
getting into the details,

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:29.496
getting all sensitive,
changes your life.

00:53:29.496 --> 00:53:30.700
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.650
Are you familiar with
trapped emotions?

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:37.417
And can you give me an
insight in how mindful can

00:53:37.417 --> 00:53:38.805
help release a trapped emotion?

00:53:38.805 --> 00:53:40.180
MICHAEL TAFT: So
what do you mean

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:41.670
by the term trapped emotion?

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.170
AUDIENCE: Trapped
emotion is emotion

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:45.770
that is physically
trapped in the human flesh

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:48.570
by not dealing with it in time.

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:50.510
And over time it
just gets trapped.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.110
I know for a fact that
that's a condition

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:55.707
that we all are affected by.

00:53:55.707 --> 00:53:58.165
If you are familiar with that
or not, what you can tell me.

00:53:58.165 --> 00:53:59.030
MICHAEL TAFT: Yeah.

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:03.370
What I would say is that
the main thing to do

00:54:03.370 --> 00:54:06.730
there is the acceptance piece.

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:08.740
Because for something,
for an emotion

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:11.460
to stay suppressed like
that, or stay trapped,

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.190
it has to have a force
keeping it in there.

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:17.020
It's being suppressed in
some way psychologically.

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:19.030
But if you, over time--
through meditation

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:20.880
and through mindfulness--
are reversing

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:25.820
that psychological stance, and
accepting over and over what

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.960
you're feeling, it might
be that you don't even

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.400
feel that trapped
emotion for a long time.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.622
But then one day, because
you're insula's growing

00:54:32.622 --> 00:54:35.080
and you're getting much more
sensitive, much more detailed.

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.209
You notice, hey, I'm
feeling something in there.

00:54:37.209 --> 00:54:38.500
I'm feeling something in there.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.210
And it might not feel very good.

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:40.710
Right?

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.335
There's a reason
you're suppressing it.

00:54:42.335 --> 00:54:44.720
It might feel really awful.

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.790
But you just keep accepting
it and accepting it.

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:50.530
And eventually, it
will start to express.

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:53.300
It's why you have to have
this stance of acceptance.

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.830
Because you want those
kind of suppressed emotions

00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:58.770
to express and
then be done with.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.320
Be done with them.

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.900
AUDIENCE: So I do
a lot of training

00:55:02.900 --> 00:55:04.760
on my team around feedback.

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.180
And when I say that
word, everyone's

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.095
like, morale just
drops considerably.

00:55:09.095 --> 00:55:12.601
It has a very visceral,
emotional response.

00:55:12.601 --> 00:55:14.850
And I train them using almost
the exact same technique

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.040
that you did
around, like, almost

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.230
like immunizing yourself.

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:19.749
So I'm going to
purposely apply pressure

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:21.790
so that you can feel what
this feels like, to get

00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:22.998
like the worst possible news.

00:55:22.998 --> 00:55:24.900
So if you see it again
you won't feel as bad.

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:25.780
MICHAEL TAFT: Yeah.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.370
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any other suggestions

00:55:27.370 --> 00:55:29.180
I can give my teammates
when I train them

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.190
on this kind of
behavioral response?

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.220
MICHAEL TAFT: Suggestions
for making it--

00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:36.430
AUDIENCE: I guess, bearable?

00:55:36.430 --> 00:55:37.220
Tolerable.

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.780
It's a painful process,
especially here.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.220
Feedback can be really intense.

00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.053
MICHAEL TAFT: Right.

00:55:42.053 --> 00:55:43.650
So I'm sure, as
you already know,

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:46.560
starting out with small emotions
is better than starting out

00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.590
with big ones.

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:48.090
Right?

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:50.510
Little tiny discomforts,
emotionally,

00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:52.200
are much easier to work with.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:55.330
The other one is-- and I
mean, this is not necessarily

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:58.970
making it easier--
but you know, it's

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:02.400
different in your
lab or your office

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.780
than it is out in the world.

00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:07.600
And so it's something
you can give them

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.410
on the first day is
just to say, hey,

00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:12.710
we're not going to trigger
you emotionally here.

00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:15.060
But between the
time you see me now

00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:18.860
and the time you see me next,
when something triggers you

00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:22.350
and you feel bad emotionally,
here's what you do.

00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:26.620
So that it's allowing
the world to give them

00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:28.125
the difficult experience.

00:56:28.125 --> 00:56:29.500
But now you've
given them the way

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.250
to work with it, to
begin working with it.

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.450
And then when they come
back the next to the office,

00:56:33.450 --> 00:56:37.020
they have material that you've
already given them a tool

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:39.422
to help them cope with that

00:56:39.422 --> 00:56:42.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:44.030
MICHAEL TAFT: So thank
you all very much.

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:47.390
And hope to speak to you again.

00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:49.840
