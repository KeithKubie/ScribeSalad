00:00:00.486 --> 00:00:01.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Guys, I know, I know.

00:00:01.926 --> 00:00:03.026
Just take a deep breath, you guys.

00:00:03.276 --> 00:00:04.036
Give us a few minutes, okay?

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:05.346
Justin, can you stop, please?

00:00:05.996 --> 00:00:06.836
Ladies and gentlemen--

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:09.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Having trouble
managing your classroom?

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:12.716
Here are some of our
favorite Tricks of the Trade.

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:16.906
&gt;&gt;Student: I want my mamma.

00:00:16.906 --> 00:00:17.976
&gt;&gt;Felipe: You want your mamma?

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:21.796
Why don't you go get a Kleenex,
so we can blow your nose.

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:23.456
Come on, let's go.

00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:25.726
&gt;&gt;It's kind of like a magician.

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:26.706
You redirect.

00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:28.506
You know, they're focused
on one thing,

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:32.796
and then you just get a Kleenex, that
was a redirection, then it's just--

00:00:32.846 --> 00:00:39.196
they just need that little focus
to get back, and then it's over.

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Share one of your tricks
with fellow teachers on Edutopia.
