00:00:00.837 --> 00:00:02.524
- [Instructor] Welcome to the Khan Academy

00:00:02.524 --> 00:00:04.107
2016 Annual Report.

00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:06.321
In the actual text of the report,

00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:08.090
we're going to go into a lot more detail

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.133
on the financials and other things

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.032
but I'm hoping here to
give you an overview.

00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:17.199
Big picture 2016 was a
great year for Khan Academy.

00:00:18.347 --> 00:00:20.962
The impact has continued to grow

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:24.148
in the double digit percentages
and is accelerating.

00:00:24.148 --> 00:00:27.622
Over a 100 million people
used our platform last year,

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:30.599
people from almost every
country in the world

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.766
and they spent an aggregate
of 5.6 billion total minutes.

00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:38.611
So one of the areas that
we've really started

00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:42.988
to accelerate in 2016 was
in content development.

00:00:42.988 --> 00:00:45.767
Many people associate Khan
Academy with mathematics

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:47.468
but what we've really been investing in

00:00:47.468 --> 00:00:49.181
is going beyond mathematics.

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:52.028
We really wanna cover all of
the core academic subjects

00:00:52.028 --> 00:00:54.081
that you consider to be
part of your education

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.622
all the way through the core of college

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:57.950
and it's not just videos.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.241
We're doing a lot on practice

00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.937
and we're doing a lot of written articles.

00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:04.492
2016 was a very big deal

00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:07.439
in terms of a partnership
with the College Board.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.846
A few years ago, they
reached out to us, said,

00:01:09.846 --> 00:01:11.809
we are going to revamp the SAT

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:14.175
and as part of that, we want to address

00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:15.728
at least the perception of inequity

00:01:15.728 --> 00:01:17.402
that's been around for decades

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:19.901
and the reason why they wanted
to partner with Khan Academy

00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:23.576
is traditional test prep was
associated with gaming an exam.

00:01:23.576 --> 00:01:25.215
It wasn't about real learning

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:27.836
but they saw that we were
focused on filling in gaps

00:01:27.836 --> 00:01:29.454
in students' understanding.

00:01:29.454 --> 00:01:31.397
So we launched with the College Board

00:01:31.397 --> 00:01:33.243
and what we've seen over
the course of the year

00:01:33.243 --> 00:01:35.488
is Khan Academy is now used more

00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:38.275
than all of paid test prep combined

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:42.069
and we're seeing that usage
very broad and very deep

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.659
and what's been even more exciting

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.175
is the PSAT which is taken
in 10th or 11th grade

00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:50.558
by 80% of American high school students,

00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:53.509
in the past, that was just a
random practice test you took

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.374
but now it acts as a
diagnostic for Khan Academy.

00:01:56.374 --> 00:01:58.135
You can take your PSAT scores,

00:01:58.135 --> 00:01:59.972
give permission to Khan Academy

00:01:59.972 --> 00:02:01.407
and then Khan Academy's software

00:02:01.407 --> 00:02:02.755
knows your strengths and weaknesses,

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:05.777
not just in math but in
reading and writing as well

00:02:05.777 --> 00:02:08.046
and can immediately
give you practice items

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:10.117
that are essentially weak point training

00:02:10.117 --> 00:02:11.306
and even more powerful,

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:14.777
we've been able to follow
students from that PSAT

00:02:14.777 --> 00:02:16.766
through their work on Khan Academy

00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:18.616
to eventually taking the SAT

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:22.726
to understand the efficacy
of this entire ecosystem

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.730
and what you see here on the slide

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.756
is some of the preliminary
results for arguably the largest

00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:30.336
personalized learning
study ever conducted.

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:32.337
With over 300,000 students,

00:02:32.337 --> 00:02:35.277
we saw that those who
prepared on Khan Academy

00:02:35.277 --> 00:02:37.155
for at least 20 hours

00:02:37.155 --> 00:02:40.508
saw twice the growth
from the PSAT to the SAT

00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:42.166
than they would typically see

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.720
and this is just the beginning.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.679
We're working with the
College Board very closely

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:47.437
to do even further studies

00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:50.585
and we've also seen that it
doesn't stop at 20 hours.

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:52.836
The more time that
students put in practice,

00:02:52.836 --> 00:02:54.961
the more gains we're seeing.

00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:58.073
Another really exciting event in 2016

00:02:58.073 --> 00:03:01.101
is that Duck Duck Moose
became part of Khan Academy.

00:03:01.101 --> 00:03:03.226
Duck Duck Moose, I would argue,

00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:06.048
was the best early learning
app company out there.

00:03:06.048 --> 00:03:08.620
In 2016, the founding team

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.565
said we would rather see our
work having a social mission

00:03:11.565 --> 00:03:13.564
and reaching as many students as possible

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:16.590
especially those that are most in need

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.367
and so they became part
of our team in 2016

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:20.477
and going forward,

00:03:20.477 --> 00:03:23.050
we're going to be working
on early learning apps

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.787
that holistically approach
reading, writing, mathematics

00:03:26.787 --> 00:03:28.586
starting at pre-kindergarten

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:32.675
and then taking students
through early elementary school.

00:03:32.675 --> 00:03:35.319
International continues
to be a very big part

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.278
of Khan Academy where
roughly 1/3 of our usage

00:03:38.278 --> 00:03:40.682
is outside of the United States.

00:03:40.682 --> 00:03:45.297
We have increased our focus
on India, Mexico and Brazil

00:03:45.297 --> 00:03:48.361
and going forward, we're
building tools and platforms

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:51.547
to allow each geography
to be even more localized

00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:53.790
to their specific needs

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.059
and going forward, there's
a lot of exciting things.

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:58.464
What you see here is a screenshot

00:03:58.464 --> 00:04:02.655
for the student facing experience
for back to school 2017

00:04:02.655 --> 00:04:04.451
where students can tell Khan Academy

00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:07.519
what classes they're taking,
what grade they're in

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.015
and then Khan Academy
can personalize to them

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:11.973
and also have game mechanics

00:04:11.973 --> 00:04:15.034
so that the students are
motivated to move forward.

00:04:15.034 --> 00:04:16.912
You can see that right over here

00:04:16.912 --> 00:04:19.616
once you get into a unit page.

00:04:19.616 --> 00:04:21.419
Of course, you see the videos,

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.297
you see the practice items here

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:26.199
but we are also adding diagnostic quizzes

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.772
and unit tests as well.

00:04:28.772 --> 00:04:31.220
What you see here is our
assignments functionality

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.754
where a teacher can assign
any piece of content

00:04:33.754 --> 00:04:34.734
on Khan Academy.

00:04:34.734 --> 00:04:37.562
This is a teacher assigning
some practice content.

00:04:37.562 --> 00:04:39.036
They can assign it to particular students

00:04:39.036 --> 00:04:40.313
in a particular class.

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:42.679
They can set a due date.

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:44.026
They can then see a readout

00:04:44.026 --> 00:04:47.776
of which students
completed which assignments

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:51.425
and then they can see which items

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:53.347
gave the students the most difficulty

00:04:53.347 --> 00:04:56.535
so that they can review
it in class the next day.

00:04:56.535 --> 00:04:57.680
On top of all of this,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.892
we have a program called LearnStorm

00:04:59.892 --> 00:05:01.300
which is a learning challenge

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.975
that schools, teachers,
students participate in

00:05:03.975 --> 00:05:06.146
that celebrate the growth mindset.

00:05:06.146 --> 00:05:08.562
The more students can
show grit, perseverance

00:05:08.562 --> 00:05:11.058
as they work through
practice on Khan Academy,

00:05:11.058 --> 00:05:13.888
the more awards and
recognition the students,

00:05:13.888 --> 00:05:16.758
their classrooms, their teachers
and their schools will get.

00:05:16.758 --> 00:05:19.414
We've piloted it in several
geographies in the past

00:05:19.414 --> 00:05:21.622
and 2017 is gonna be the first time

00:05:21.622 --> 00:05:24.846
that we do this on a nationwide scale.

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:26.930
So there's a lot going on at Khan Academy.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.164
What I just covered is
really just a sample of it

00:05:30.164 --> 00:05:33.344
but we're really grateful
for your support.

00:05:33.344 --> 00:05:34.734
We have a big mission.

00:05:34.734 --> 00:05:38.370
A free, world-class education
for anyone, anywhere

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.093
and some of y'all have been
with us for many years.

00:05:42.093 --> 00:05:46.632
When we were just starting in
2007 out of a walk-in closet,

00:05:46.632 --> 00:05:50.083
this type of a mission would
have seemed frankly delusional

00:05:50.083 --> 00:05:52.941
but because of your
support, your partnership,

00:05:52.941 --> 00:05:55.025
all of the work that we've
been able to do together

00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:57.517
with governments, with
teachers, with students,

00:05:57.517 --> 00:05:59.719
it's no longer just a dream.

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.110
It's really happening

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.890
and the momentum that we've
built together in 2016

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.997
is continuing to accelerate into 2017

00:06:06.997 --> 00:06:10.516
and I expect it's going to
accelerate in 2018 and beyond

00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:13.465
so that as we look back
in a decade or two,

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:16.077
we'll say, how could
we ever imagine a world

00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:19.252
where there wasn't a free
world-class education

00:06:19.252 --> 00:06:21.002
for anyone, anywhere?
