00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.170
&gt;&gt; So Matt, we've had a chance to look at your overall ancestry

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.730
by looking at your DNA on chromosomes one to 22 and the X.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.324
&gt;&gt; hmm.

00:00:07.324 --> 00:00:09.500
&gt;&gt; and that gives us a good overview.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.200
But, specifically, we'd like to look at your

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.870
maternal ancestry, that is, going through your mother,

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.950
and her mother, and your mother's mother's mother.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.100
&gt;&gt; hmm.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.538
&gt;&gt; And we can do that by looking at a very specific subset of the SNVs.

00:00:20.538 --> 00:00:22.750
&gt;&gt; Okay and, I think we're going to learn a little bit more about that

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.000
in lesson 11 of the course. But for right now can you tell us what's

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.770
the only chromosome that's passed from mother to all of her

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.950
children and through which we can actually trace our maternal lineage?
