00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.780
While the metaphor of paper and

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.680
ink are useful, we'll still
designing for digital medium.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.110
So we shouldn't be limited by those
pesky rules of physics like their real

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.680
world equivalents.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.250
Material surfaces have some unique
properties that bring them to life, and

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.900
let your applications
connect with users.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.600
Material surfaces can be created and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.960
destroyed, they can change shape,
split apart or rejoin like this example.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.600
Similarly, a section of the surface
that is ink components can lift out and

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.400
form their own surface.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.070
You can see this happening in
this parent to child example.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.725
Where a list item lifts out and
expands to become the detail screen.

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:41.465
These material properties can help you
to create immersive applications that

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:45.265
respond to interaction,
rather than jumping into new states,

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:47.065
making them easier to comprehend.

00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:49.385
We'll expand on using
motion in lesson four.
