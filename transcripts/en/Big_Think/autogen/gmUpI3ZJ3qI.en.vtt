disorders this is just Alzheimer's if we
 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.239
disorders this is just Alzheimer's if we
look at those costs direct and indirect

the Spanish flu we'll have three years
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.100
the Spanish flu we'll have three years
in a row of decreasing longevity in the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110
in a row of decreasing longevity in the
 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.670
in a row of decreasing longevity in the
United States we will live less long

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680
United States we will live less long
 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.320
United States we will live less long
three years in a row less long than ever

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330
three years in a row less long than ever
 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.180
three years in a row less long than ever
and everybody else believes that we're

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190
and everybody else believes that we're
 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.350
and everybody else believes that we're
living longer and longer and longer it's

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
living longer and longer and longer it's
 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.960
living longer and longer and longer it's
it's it's it's driven primarily by two

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
it's it's it's driven primarily by two
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.210
it's it's it's driven primarily by two
things and primarily Alzheimer's is the

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
things and primarily Alzheimer's is the
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.100
things and primarily Alzheimer's is the
number one driver in this and the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110
number one driver in this and the
 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.910
number one driver in this and the
secondary driver unfortunately is is

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920
secondary driver unfortunately is is
 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.500
secondary driver unfortunately is is
drug overdoses and suicides it's it's

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510
drug overdoses and suicides it's it's
 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.360
drug overdoses and suicides it's it's
it's related to the opioid epidemic

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370
it's related to the opioid epidemic
 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.920
it's related to the opioid epidemic
we're actually developing products for

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
we're actually developing products for
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.810
we're actually developing products for
both of those primary problems for both

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
both of those primary problems for both
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.240
both of those primary problems for both
of those decreases in longevity so we're

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
of those decreases in longevity so we're
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.040
of those decreases in longevity so we're
working on a suite of non opioid pain

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050
working on a suite of non opioid pain
 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.990
working on a suite of non opioid pain
alternatives but our lead compound is a

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
alternatives but our lead compound is a
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.270
alternatives but our lead compound is a
vaccine for Alzheimer's and what that

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280
vaccine for Alzheimer's and what that
 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.520
vaccine for Alzheimer's and what that
does is it means that we can we can

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
does is it means that we can we can
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.649
does is it means that we can we can
really turn on the body's immune system

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659
really turn on the body's immune system
 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.609
really turn on the body's immune system
and ill it and enable it to fight toxic

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
and ill it and enable it to fight toxic
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.550
and ill it and enable it to fight toxic
proteins that it's generating itself and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560
proteins that it's generating itself and
 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.640
proteins that it's generating itself and
what

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
what
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.059
what
special about that to me is that the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069
special about that to me is that the
 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.649
special about that to me is that the
largest gains back to this longevity

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659
largest gains back to this longevity
 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.660
largest gains back to this longevity
idea the largest gains in human

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670
idea the largest gains in human
 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.569
idea the largest gains in human
longevity ever are debatably attributed

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579
longevity ever are debatably attributed
 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.080
longevity ever are debatably attributed
to vaccine technology now some people

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090
to vaccine technology now some people
 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.300
to vaccine technology now some people
you can also the sanitation was very

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
you can also the sanitation was very
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.809
you can also the sanitation was very
important the antibiotic revolution was

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819
important the antibiotic revolution was
 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.420
important the antibiotic revolution was
very important but vaccine technologies

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
very important but vaccine technologies
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.539
very important but vaccine technologies
currently over 6.2 billion people in the

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549
currently over 6.2 billion people in the
 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.160
currently over 6.2 billion people in the
world have been vaccinated right now

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
world have been vaccinated right now
 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.440
world have been vaccinated right now
these are the most widely distributed

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450
these are the most widely distributed
 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.030
these are the most widely distributed
medications and solutions that have ever

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040
medications and solutions that have ever
 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.339
medications and solutions that have ever
been brought to mankind and the

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349
been brought to mankind and the
 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:47.690
been brought to mankind and the
consequence was that we really

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
consequence was that we really
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.190
consequence was that we really
dramatically improved our quality of

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
dramatically improved our quality of
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.559
dramatically improved our quality of
life and our longevity we gave people

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569
life and our longevity we gave people
 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.059
life and our longevity we gave people
better healthier longer lives and now

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069
better healthier longer lives and now
 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.220
better healthier longer lives and now
the big problem with vaccines is that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
the big problem with vaccines is that
 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.099
the big problem with vaccines is that
you could never use them against non

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109
you could never use them against non
 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.500
you could never use them against non
external targets so they worked great

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510
external targets so they worked great
 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.179
external targets so they worked great
with viruses whether it was Ebola or

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189
with viruses whether it was Ebola or
 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.869

Zika polio smallpox you know we actually

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879
Zika polio smallpox you know we actually
 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.000
Zika polio smallpox you know we actually
can solve those problems pretty fast for

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010
can solve those problems pretty fast for
 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.610
can solve those problems pretty fast for
the external targets but now what's

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620
the external targets but now what's
 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.410
the external targets but now what's
killing us more than everything external

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420
killing us more than everything external
 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.149
killing us more than everything external
are actually for the first time this

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159
are actually for the first time this
 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.670
are actually for the first time this
year the bark rust and internal things

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680
year the bark rust and internal things
 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.409
year the bark rust and internal things
are killing us more so the agents of

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419
are killing us more so the agents of
 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.390
are killing us more so the agents of
chronic illness so it's no longer

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400
chronic illness so it's no longer
 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.789
chronic illness so it's no longer
fighting bacteria and viruses and these

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799
fighting bacteria and viruses and these
 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.479
fighting bacteria and viruses and these
other external causes of death or causes

heart disease and stroke things that are
 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.699
heart disease and stroke things that are
causing cancers things that are causing

diabetes Alzheimer's Parkinson's all of

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409
diabetes Alzheimer's Parkinson's all of
 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.740
diabetes Alzheimer's Parkinson's all of
these different chronic illnesses now

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
these different chronic illnesses now
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.809
these different chronic illnesses now
why don't we vaccinate against chronic

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819
why don't we vaccinate against chronic
 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.119
why don't we vaccinate against chronic
illness well the idea is that you be

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129
illness well the idea is that you be
 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.830
illness well the idea is that you be
fundamentally targeting something that's

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840
fundamentally targeting something that's
 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.839
fundamentally targeting something that's
in your own body right like you'd be

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849
in your own body right like you'd be
 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.309
in your own body right like you'd be
targeting something your body was making

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319
targeting something your body was making
 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.229
targeting something your body was making
and so what's what does that sound like

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239
and so what's what does that sound like
 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.240
and so what's what does that sound like
it sounds like an autoimmune disease it

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250
it sounds like an autoimmune disease it
 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.830
it sounds like an autoimmune disease it
sounds like if you made your body do

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840
sounds like if you made your body do
 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.539
sounds like if you made your body do
that it could trigger an autoimmune

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549
that it could trigger an autoimmune
 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.699
that it could trigger an autoimmune
disease and it turns out that that's one

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709
disease and it turns out that that's one
 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.059
disease and it turns out that that's one
of the big challenges in making vaccines

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069
of the big challenges in making vaccines
 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.530
of the big challenges in making vaccines
against things your body generates and

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540
against things your body generates and
 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.479
against things your body generates and
they call that the self barrier or

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489
they call that the self barrier or
 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.969
they call that the self barrier or
breaking self tolerance or all of these

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979
breaking self tolerance or all of these
 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:16.670
breaking self tolerance or all of these
like different things that describe this

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680
like different things that describe this
 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.379
like different things that describe this
phenomena but the bottom line is the

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389
phenomena but the bottom line is the
 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.060
phenomena but the bottom line is the
body does not like to attack itself and

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070
body does not like to attack itself and
 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.310
body does not like to attack itself and
it's trying not to and for millions of

it's trying not to and for millions of
 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.320
it's trying not to and for millions of
years our immune systems have evolved so

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330
years our immune systems have evolved so
 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.810
years our immune systems have evolved so
that we don't do exactly that

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820
that we don't do exactly that
 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.490
that we don't do exactly that
now what's awesome is that our

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500
now what's awesome is that our
 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.140
now what's awesome is that our
technology platform has been able to do

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150
technology platform has been able to do
 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.120
technology platform has been able to do
it and do it safely and we've been able

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130
it and do it safely and we've been able
 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.760
it and do it safely and we've been able
to do it in in a lot of applications so

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770
to do it in in a lot of applications so
 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.100
to do it in in a lot of applications so
to me this is our Sputnik moment right

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110
to me this is our Sputnik moment right
 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.590

doesn't work so when we go after things
 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.370
doesn't work so when we go after things
that are that are really big goals and

that are that are really big goals and
 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.920
that are that are really big goals and
when we go after huge problems it's that

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930
when we go after huge problems it's that

it and and and I really have a firm

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010
it and and and I really have a firm
 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.550
it and and and I really have a firm
belief that this is like the greatest

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560
belief that this is like the greatest
 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.380
belief that this is like the greatest
time that we could possibly be alive and

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390
time that we could possibly be alive and
 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.020
time that we could possibly be alive and
and solving these problems it are some

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030
and solving these problems it are some
 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.730
and solving these problems it are some
of the greatest problems facing mankind

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740
of the greatest problems facing mankind
 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.220
of the greatest problems facing mankind
but they're also you know we've never

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230
but they're also you know we've never
 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.160
but they're also you know we've never
been we've never had a better chance of

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170
been we've never had a better chance of
 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.020
been we've never had a better chance of
solving them you know so I feel like

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030
solving them you know so I feel like
 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.480
solving them you know so I feel like
it's a really great time

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490
it's a really great time
 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.740
