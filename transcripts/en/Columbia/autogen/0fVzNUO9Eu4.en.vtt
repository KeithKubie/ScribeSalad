okay so ah how to think about a risk

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:41.710
okay so ah how to think about a risk
 

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:46.330
okay so ah how to think about a risk
that's low probability or uncertain

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:51.450

trend lines are running in the opposite
 

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.290

four or five elements but the crux of it

would be first a principle of nuclear

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:14.550

and all nuclear materials would be
 

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.849
and all nuclear materials would be
secured to a gold standard that is as

secured to a gold standard that is as
 

00:50:22.859 --> 00:50:26.720
secured to a gold standard that is as
good as gold in Fort Knox and would be

that's the principle of assured nuclear
 

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:37.040
that's the principle of assured nuclear
security and then the second principle

security and then the second principle
 

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.590
security and then the second principle
would be nuclear accountability

00:50:40.590 --> 00:50:40.600
would be nuclear accountability
 

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.800
would be nuclear accountability
in which if you made it you're going to

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:43.810
in which if you made it you're going to
 

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:45.750
in which if you made it you're going to
be held accountable in a strict

then figuring out exactly what means
responsible and accountable that's

it's good question and I think that the

question is on a lot of effort is being
focused on nuclear non-proliferation in

00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:05.390
focused on nuclear non-proliferation in
 

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:07.569
focused on nuclear non-proliferation in
counterterrorism and I'm afraid it's at

00:56:07.569 --> 00:56:07.579
counterterrorism and I'm afraid it's at
 

00:56:07.579 --> 00:56:09.609
counterterrorism and I'm afraid it's at
the expense of nuclear disarmament

00:56:09.609 --> 00:56:09.619
the expense of nuclear disarmament
 

00:56:09.619 --> 00:56:15.880
the expense of nuclear disarmament
nuclear disarmament um what I'm thinking

00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:15.890
nuclear disarmament um what I'm thinking
 

00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:19.479
nuclear disarmament um what I'm thinking
is that um how you define a problem

00:56:19.479 --> 00:56:19.489
is that um how you define a problem
 

00:56:19.489 --> 00:56:21.759
is that um how you define a problem
pretty much determines how you solve

00:56:21.759 --> 00:56:21.769
pretty much determines how you solve
 

00:56:21.769 --> 00:56:24.969
pretty much determines how you solve
that problem in this case the way this

00:56:24.969 --> 00:56:24.979
that problem in this case the way this
 

00:56:24.979 --> 00:56:28.449
that problem in this case the way this
problem is being defined is that nuclear

00:56:28.449 --> 00:56:28.459
problem is being defined is that nuclear
 

00:56:28.459 --> 00:56:30.870
problem is being defined is that nuclear
weapons in the hands of the wrong people

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880
weapons in the hands of the wrong people
 

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:33.579
weapons in the hands of the wrong people
well i think that the real problem is

00:56:33.579 --> 00:56:33.589
well i think that the real problem is
 

00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:35.589
well i think that the real problem is
the nuclear weapons themselves and not

00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599
the nuclear weapons themselves and not
 

00:56:35.599 --> 00:56:37.089
the nuclear weapons themselves and not
the weapons getting into the hands of

00:56:37.089 --> 00:56:37.099
the weapons getting into the hands of
 

00:56:37.099 --> 00:56:39.640
the weapons getting into the hands of
the wrong people and so um my question

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:39.650
the wrong people and so um my question
 

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:42.130
the wrong people and so um my question
to you is that what are the obstacles so

00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:42.140
to you is that what are the obstacles so
 

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.749
to you is that what are the obstacles so
actually sitting down and talking

00:56:43.749 --> 00:56:43.759
actually sitting down and talking
 

00:56:43.759 --> 00:56:45.759
actually sitting down and talking
seriously about these are my men rather

00:56:45.759 --> 00:56:45.769
seriously about these are my men rather
 

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.019
seriously about these are my men rather
than non-proliferation and

00:56:47.019 --> 00:56:47.029
than non-proliferation and
 

00:56:47.029 --> 00:56:48.729
than non-proliferation and
counterterrorism because if you don't

00:56:48.729 --> 00:56:48.739
counterterrorism because if you don't
 

00:56:48.739 --> 00:56:50.319
counterterrorism because if you don't
have the weapons then you don't have to

00:56:50.319 --> 00:56:50.329
have the weapons then you don't have to
 

00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:51.789
have the weapons then you don't have to
worry about the weapons getting into the

00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799
worry about the weapons getting into the
 

00:56:51.799 --> 00:56:53.769
worry about the weapons getting into the
wrong hands project a very good question

00:56:53.769 --> 00:56:53.779
wrong hands project a very good question
 

00:56:53.779 --> 00:56:58.359
wrong hands project a very good question
it see it's the year I guess the tip of

00:56:58.359 --> 00:56:58.369
it see it's the year I guess the tip of
 

00:56:58.369 --> 00:57:00.819
it see it's the year I guess the tip of
an iceberg of a raven bigger question so

00:57:00.819 --> 00:57:00.829
an iceberg of a raven bigger question so
 

00:57:00.829 --> 00:57:05.499
an iceberg of a raven bigger question so
the NPT this bargain commits the nuclear

00:57:05.499 --> 00:57:05.509
the NPT this bargain commits the nuclear
 

00:57:05.509 --> 00:57:09.099
the NPT this bargain commits the nuclear
weapon States to disarmament so that's

00:57:09.099 --> 00:57:09.109
weapon States to disarmament so that's
 

00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:11.499
weapon States to disarmament so that's
no question about this you look at the

00:57:11.499 --> 00:57:11.509
no question about this you look at the
 

00:57:11.509 --> 00:57:13.479
no question about this you look at the
treaty we did carefully look at that

00:57:13.479 --> 00:57:13.489
treaty we did carefully look at that
 

00:57:13.489 --> 00:57:16.029
treaty we did carefully look at that
look at the history so what was said the

00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039
look at the history so what was said the
 

00:57:16.039 --> 00:57:19.120
look at the history so what was said the

then in the force in 1970 is I have

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880
then in the force in 1970 is I have
 

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.390
then in the force in 1970 is I have

towards the ultimate elimination so

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:36.230
towards the ultimate elimination so
 

00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:38.860
towards the ultimate elimination so
that's the theory of the case now then

00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:38.870
that's the theory of the case now then
 

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:41.050
that's the theory of the case now then
you have the Cold War so at the peak of

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:41.060
you have the Cold War so at the peak of
 

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:43.180
you have the Cold War so at the peak of
the Cold War how many how many nuclear

how grotesque is that you want to get

00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960
how grotesque is that you want to get
 

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.840
how grotesque is that you want to get
you want to affect you if you're doing

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:52.850
you want to affect you if you're doing
 

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:54.640
you want to affect you if you're doing
your history part you want to kind of a

long-term obstacles here well I would
 

00:59:03.830 --> 00:59:06.490

invent nuclear weapons so if we took all

00:59:17.830 --> 00:59:17.840
invent nuclear weapons so if we took all
 

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.210
invent nuclear weapons so if we took all
the nuclear weapons in the world today

00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:19.220
the nuclear weapons in the world today

and eliminate them what about if

00:59:22.690 --> 00:59:22.700
and eliminate them what about if

somewhere in the US or in Russia would

be difficult not impossible so we're

00:59:56.450 --> 00:59:56.460
be difficult not impossible so we're
 

00:59:56.460 --> 00:59:58.400
be difficult not impossible so we're
just understanding that the challenges

00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:58.410
just understanding that the challenges
 

00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:04.220
just understanding that the challenges
and then uh maybe that's enough to do to

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:04.230
and then uh maybe that's enough to do to
 

01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:06.050
and then uh maybe that's enough to do to
see why it's hard that doesn't mean that

see why it's hard that doesn't mean that
 

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.270
see why it's hard that doesn't mean that
it's needs to be given up and I think in

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:08.280
it's needs to be given up and I think in
 

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.930
it's needs to be given up and I think in
the dynamic the non-nuclear weapon

01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:11.940

and the escalator may be speeding up so
 

01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:01.940
and the escalator may be speeding up so
we can work very hard but I think North
