I said before that we were going to want to compare our two earthquakes. But in

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.600
order to do that we really need them in one equation together. To make that

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.760
happen, I'm going to suggest that we subtract one of these equations from the

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.085
other. Now we're allowed to do that because we have equal quantities lining up

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:24.080
with one another. let's see what happens. So please carry out the subtraction.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.990
Subtracting the entire California equation from the entire Japan equation. Now

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.710
make sure that you let this negative sign distribute to every term we have

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.140
here. What equation do we end up with?
