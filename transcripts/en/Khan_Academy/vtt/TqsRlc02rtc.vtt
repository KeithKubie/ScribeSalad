00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.640
We're asked to graph the
solution set for this system.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.260
So we have two inequalities
here, so this is a system of

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.750
inequalities, and we know how
to graph them independently.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.430
And so when you graph the
system, you want to find the

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.030
set of coordinates in the
coordinate plane that satisfy

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.940
both of these inequalities.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.290
So we essentially want to
find out where these two

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.845
inequalities overlap.

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:25.450
So let's graph this first
one over here.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.830
I'll rewrite it in magenta.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.400
y is greater than x minus 8.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.290
So the way to think about this,
let's think about y is

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.020
equal x minus 8, but we're going
to be greater than that,

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.130
so we're going to draw
a dotted line at y is

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.880
equal x minus 8.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.970
So if you think about x minus 8,
the y-intercept is negative

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.260
8, so it's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.890
That is negative
8 right there.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.880
This, of course,
is the y-axis.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.360
That is the x-axis.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.500
And the graph of y equals
x minus 8 has

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.090
a slope of 1, right?

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.190
There's 1 times this
x right here.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.420
So every time you move in the
positive x-direction, you move

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.730
1 in the positive y-direction.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.170
If you move 2, you get 2 in
the positive y-direction.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.290
If you moved 3, you would
go up 3 in the positive

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.300
y-direction.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.530
And likewise, if you went in
the negative x-direction.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.180
You'd also go in the negative
y-direction by 1.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.810
So this line, if you said y is
equal to x minus 8, it would

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.170
be a line just like that.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.330
But since we're not going to
include it in this set, we

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.100
have to be greater
than that line.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.072
I'll do a dotted line here.

00:01:28.072 --> 00:01:31.930
Let me do my best to draw
a dotted line, which is

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.980
surprisingly easier to draw
that a non-dotted line.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.640
So that is essentially a dotted
line version of y is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.030
equal to x minus 8.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.290
But we're going to be
greater than that.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.050
So for any x, x minus 8 is going
to be on that line, but

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.560
the y is going to be all the
values greater than that.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.115
So you pick any x, this is x
minus 8, the y-value is going

00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:52.910
to be all the y's greater
than that for that x.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.850
So the solution set for y is
greater than x minus 8 is all

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.750
of the area above this line
and it doesn't include it.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.370
And that's why I put a
dotted line there.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.260
So let me do that in
a lighter color.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.780
So literally, all of this area
up here is the solution set

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.820
for this first inequality.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.170
Now, let's do the second
inequality.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.150
I'll do it in another
dark color.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.550
We have y is less than 5 minus
x, or we could write that as

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.360
negative x plus 5, so it looks
a little bit more like our

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.240
slope-intercept form.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.530
Now, if we were just to graph y
is equal to negative x plus

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.210
5, it would look like this.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.910
We would go in the positive
y-direction one, two, three,

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.100
four, five.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.560
That is the y-intercept
right there.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.710
And it has a slope
of negative 1.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.180
So if we move 1 in the
x-direction, we move down 1.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.900
It we move 3 in the x-direction,
we're going to

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.030
move down 3.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.650
If we move back 3 in the
x-direction, we're

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.320
going to move up 3.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.280
So this line is going
to look like this.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.080
And I'm to do it in a dotted
line because we're not

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.600
including it.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.760
It's not less than or equal.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.960
It's just strictly less than, so
it won't include the line.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.875
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:06.491
I'll try my best to draw it
as neatly as possible.

00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.810
I think that is a
respectable job.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.960
This is the dotted line version
of y is equal to

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.430
negative x plus 5.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.320
It's dotted because we're
not including it.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.800
Now, for any x, you pick an x,
let's say x is equal to one,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.250
negative x plus 5 is going
to get on to that line.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.870
But for that x, we only care
about the y's that are less

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.110
than that value.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.970
So it's going to be all the
values below this line.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.950
So if you look at the solution
set for this second

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.900
inequality, it will
look like this.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.360
I'll do it in this
light blue color.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.160
It will be all of the area
below this blue line.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.400
Now, what we care about is the
set of coordinates that

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.960
satisfy both of these
inequalities.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.180
Now, in order to satisfy both
inequalities, it has to be the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.140
overlap of the solution sets.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.590
And the overlap of the solution
sets, where the blue

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.930
is overlapping with the yellow
in this case, is everything

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.230
that is above this line and
everything that's below that

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.840
line, so it's all of
this area here.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.250
So let me color that in
a little bit bolder.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.160
So it's all of this below
the blue line and

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.250
above the red line.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.250
This is the overlap.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.570
All of this area, all of that
area right there is the

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.610
solution set for this system.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.670
And you can verify it.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.140
Pick a random point in this
area and see it'll satisfy

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.670
both points.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.260
And a really easy one is x is
equal to 0, y is equal to 0.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.880
That's part of our
solution set.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.340
Let's try it out.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.250
If y is 0, 0 is greater
than 0 minus 8.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.710
That's true.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.380
0 is greater than negative 8.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.410
If you do the second equation,
0 is less than 5 minus 0.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.970
That's true.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.160
0 is less than 5.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.810
And you could try that
with any points here.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.940
This orange area is
our solution set.
