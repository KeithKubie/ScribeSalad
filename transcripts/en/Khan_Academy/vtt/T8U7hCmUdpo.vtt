00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:04.112
- [Voiceover] You have two
fractions, 1/4 and 5/6,

00:00:04.112 --> 00:00:05.374
and you want to rewrite them

00:00:05.374 --> 00:00:07.978
so they have the same denominator

00:00:07.978 --> 00:00:10.853
and have whole number numerators.

00:00:10.853 --> 00:00:13.909
What numbers could you
use for the denominator?

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.629
So here's our fractions,
1/4 and 5/6, and we want

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:22.471
to rewrite these fractions
to have new denominators.

00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:26.264
So we currently have a four
and a six as our denominator,

00:00:26.264 --> 00:00:28.808
and could we just pick any
new thing, like maybe five?

00:00:28.808 --> 00:00:30.652
Could we say, "Let's change
them both to have five

00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:32.172
"as the denominator?"

00:00:32.172 --> 00:00:33.620
The answer is no.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.947
We have to pick a multiple
of four and six, a multiple,

00:00:37.947 --> 00:00:41.730
some number that we can multiply four

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.185
and get this number as an answer.

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:49.185
So for example, for four,
some multiples of four

00:00:50.427 --> 00:00:53.752
would be four times one is four,

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.958
four times two is eight,

00:00:55.958 --> 00:00:58.771
four times three is 12, and so on.

00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:01.104
Those are multiples of four.

00:01:02.684 --> 00:01:04.912
And let's just pause here
and look at why we have

00:01:04.912 --> 00:01:07.957
to pick a multiple of four and six,

00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:09.828
why we can't just pick any number

00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:14.703
but we have to pick a
multiple of our denominators.

00:01:14.703 --> 00:01:17.044
So the fraction we were
just talking about was 1/4.

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:20.569
We could look at either
one, but let's look at 1/4.

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:23.819
Here we have a picture showing fourths.

00:01:24.788 --> 00:01:26.019
And to show 1/4,

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:29.769
we shade one of these
four equal-size pieces.

00:01:31.384 --> 00:01:33.699
Maybe I wanna change this and I wanna say,

00:01:33.699 --> 00:01:36.979
"I want two, I want two as my numerator."

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.479
So to have a numerator of two,

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.320
I'm gonna need to split this
fourth up here into two pieces.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.424
Now I have two shaded pieces.

00:01:47.424 --> 00:01:50.703
So can I say this is two, one, two,

00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:54.170
out of one, two, three, four, five pieces?

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.111
It's not 2/5 because these
are not equal-size pieces.

00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.904
So if I split this fourth
right here in half,

00:02:00.904 --> 00:02:03.124
I need to split all of them in half.

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:05.624
And what I'm doing is doubling

00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:08.356
the amount of pieces.

00:02:10.143 --> 00:02:14.281
So now this is two pieces,
this is two, and this is two,

00:02:14.281 --> 00:02:16.934
because we need equal-size pieces.

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:20.561
So now, this is one, two
pieces out of one, two,

00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:24.604
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight equal-size pieces.

00:02:24.604 --> 00:02:26.104
So 2/8.

00:02:27.078 --> 00:02:30.186
And you can see, eight
is a multiple of four

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:32.535
because we multiplied by
two, and that's what we did.

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:36.609
We multiplied each of our pieces by two.

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.734
We also multiplied our numerator by two

00:02:38.734 --> 00:02:40.631
because that was also doubled.

00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:42.689
The amount of shaded pieces doubled

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.610
when the entire amount of pieces doubled.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.387
Now, we don't have to
do this just with two.

00:02:47.387 --> 00:02:49.052
We could do any multiple of four.

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:52.135
For example, we can do one more here.

00:02:54.927 --> 00:02:58.859
If we, again, let's shade 1/4,

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.544
one of the four pieces.

00:03:01.544 --> 00:03:03.241
And maybe this time we wanna split it

00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:05.658
into three equal-size pieces.

00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:10.516
So to have a new numerator of three,

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:13.452
and these should be equal-sized,

00:03:13.452 --> 00:03:15.785
here's a numerator of three.

00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:20.680
But we can't do our denominator yet

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.365
because we don't have equal-size pieces.

00:03:23.365 --> 00:03:25.751
So to get equal-size pieces we'll need

00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:29.251
to split each of these fourths into three.

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:34.398
So we are tripling the amount of pieces.

00:03:36.902 --> 00:03:40.350
So now we have three shaded
pieces out of a total

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.557
of one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:44.974
nine, 10, 11, 12,

00:03:46.714 --> 00:03:48.027
out of 12.

00:03:48.027 --> 00:03:50.117
And I could have figured that
out without even counting

00:03:50.117 --> 00:03:53.372
because I knew that we tripled.

00:03:53.372 --> 00:03:55.289
This time we multiplied

00:03:57.637 --> 00:04:00.741
our original denominator
times three, we tripled.

00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:05.086
And we also multiplied
our numerator times three.

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:08.738
So these are the multiples,
eight, 12, and so on,

00:04:08.738 --> 00:04:10.957
and so those are the
denominators we can pick,

00:04:10.957 --> 00:04:15.008
something that we can
multiply our denominator by

00:04:15.008 --> 00:04:18.925
so we can multiply the
entire amount of pieces.

00:04:20.478 --> 00:04:24.571
And again, so this is super
clear, 1/4 and 2/8 and 3/12,

00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:27.234
they all represent the same amount,

00:04:27.234 --> 00:04:30.827
whether we had 1/4, the
original, here's 2/8, 3/12,

00:04:30.827 --> 00:04:32.716
they're all equivalent.

00:04:32.716 --> 00:04:34.900
They all represent the same amount.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.472
They're just different ways
of writing the same number.

00:04:39.472 --> 00:04:41.107
Back to our original question,

00:04:41.107 --> 00:04:45.274
what denominators can we use
for fourths and for sixths?

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:48.600
We know we need to use multiples,

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.401
so let's look at the multiples.

00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:53.764
For four, we've already
gone through some of these.

00:04:53.764 --> 00:04:55.929
The first multiple of
four is four times one,

00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:57.715
which is four.

00:04:57.715 --> 00:04:59.790
Second multiple of four is eight.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.041
Four times two is eight, so
we could split our fourths

00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:04.041
in half and get eighths.

00:05:04.934 --> 00:05:08.751
Or we could say four times three is 12,

00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:10.784
which we showed again
where we split our fourths,

00:05:10.784 --> 00:05:14.020
each fourth into three equal pieces.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.395
Or we could do four
times four which is 16.

00:05:17.395 --> 00:05:19.784
Four times five is 20,

00:05:19.784 --> 00:05:22.451
four times six is 24, and so on.

00:05:24.126 --> 00:05:26.711
The reason I'm stopping
at 24 is I've looked

00:05:26.711 --> 00:05:30.330
at my answer choices and I
can see the largest possible

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.020
answer is 24, so I don't need

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.161
to write any larger multiples.

00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:37.061
There are many, many, many
more multiples of four,

00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:38.701
but we don't need to list them all

00:05:38.701 --> 00:05:40.883
'cause the largest number we're gonna have

00:05:40.883 --> 00:05:42.383
to consider is 24.

00:05:43.404 --> 00:05:45.637
Let's do the same for sixths.

00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:48.783
We could leave our sixths
alone, six times one,

00:05:48.783 --> 00:05:50.485
and keep six pieces.

00:05:50.485 --> 00:05:52.196
Or we could double our sixths.

00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:53.669
Six times two would be 12,

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.977
if we doubled the pieces
we would have 12 pieces.

00:05:56.977 --> 00:05:59.871
We could say six times three, which is 18,

00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:01.608
or six times four, we could divide each

00:06:01.608 --> 00:06:03.999
of our sixths into four pieces,

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:08.166
and we'd have six times
four which is 24 or 24ths.

00:06:09.218 --> 00:06:11.751
And so on, again, I'll stop at 24

00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:15.878
since it's the largest
number we need to consider.

00:06:15.878 --> 00:06:17.919
So down to our answer choices,

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.132
what numbers could we
use for the denominator?

00:06:20.132 --> 00:06:21.454
Could we use eight?

00:06:21.454 --> 00:06:23.570
Let's look at these lists.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.470
Eight is a multiple of four,
so we could definitely split

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.730
fourths into eighths, but
eight is not a multiple of six,

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.067
so we can not split sixths into eighths.

00:06:35.067 --> 00:06:36.484
So...

00:06:36.484 --> 00:06:40.651
Eight will not work as a
denominator for both fractions.

00:06:42.314 --> 00:06:43.397
How about 12?

00:06:44.803 --> 00:06:47.845
12 we can see is a multiple
of four, and we showed that,

00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:49.361
we drew that already.

00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:51.017
And 12 is a multiple of six,

00:06:51.017 --> 00:06:53.466
we could split our sixths
into two equal pieces each

00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:55.559
and we would have 12ths.

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:59.264
So 12 does work, 12 is a denominator,

00:06:59.264 --> 00:07:02.931
a common denominator
for fourths and sixths.

00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:06.832
18, 18 is here on the sixths.

00:07:06.832 --> 00:07:08.795
We could split sixths into 18

00:07:08.795 --> 00:07:10.735
because 18 is a multiple of six,

00:07:10.735 --> 00:07:13.874
but it is not a multiple of four.

00:07:13.874 --> 00:07:17.883
So we can rule out 18, 18
is not a common denominator.

00:07:17.883 --> 00:07:21.121
And 24, you may remember,
was the last number

00:07:21.121 --> 00:07:22.858
we wrote on both of them.

00:07:22.858 --> 00:07:25.608
So yes, 24 could be a denominator

00:07:26.685 --> 00:07:28.696
for fourths and sixths.

00:07:28.696 --> 00:07:31.405
So we could use either 12 or 24,

00:07:31.405 --> 00:07:33.606
and there's a lot more
numbers we could use too

00:07:33.606 --> 00:07:36.365
as common denominators,
but from these choices

00:07:36.365 --> 00:07:40.069
we could use 12 or 24
as a common denominator

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:41.986
for fourths and sixths.

00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:45.313
And just a note, lots of times people like

00:07:45.313 --> 00:07:48.565
to use the smallest one, the
least common denominator,

00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:50.264
which in this case is 12.

00:07:50.264 --> 00:07:52.517
And it makes a lot of
sense because it's easier

00:07:52.517 --> 00:07:54.753
to do computation with smaller numbers,

00:07:54.753 --> 00:07:58.453
but you don't absolutely
have to use the smallest one.

00:07:58.453 --> 00:08:02.359
You could use 12ths or 24ths
or lots of other options.

00:08:02.359 --> 00:08:05.634
But again, 12ths is
probably the simplest one

00:08:05.634 --> 00:08:07.935
to work with just 'cause
generally it's easier

00:08:07.935 --> 00:08:10.149
to work with smaller numbers.

00:08:10.149 --> 00:08:12.654
But for this question,
the common denominators

00:08:12.654 --> 00:08:14.369
we can use from these choices

00:08:14.369 --> 00:08:17.452
for fourths and sixths are 12 and 24.
