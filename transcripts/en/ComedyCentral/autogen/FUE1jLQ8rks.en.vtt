00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:03.035
Jay showed me one of
my favorite videos

00:00:03.035 --> 00:00:04.303
that I've only watched five
seconds of up in the office.

00:00:04.303 --> 00:00:05.772
Yeah, we both had to be like ...

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.407
Yeah, it's just too good
for the show,

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:10.810
that he found
on World Star Uncut.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.478
Well, that's what World Star
takes it to

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:14.713
when it's a not safe
for work video.

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:19.518
Got it. You all know, if you're
loyal campers, this is a big ...

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:23.256
well, this is a room divided
into being into titty fucking

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:24.890
and not being
into titty fucking.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.561
We even named a new sex act
the Alabama Caesar.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:31.864
That's when
you're tit fucking and-

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:33.433
Reverse direction.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.668
... reverse direction
and then the girl eats butt.

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.172
We were up in the office
before the show.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.041
I asked Black Lou. I was like,
"Did you get some Red Dead in,"

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.109
because you got into it,
but you're not into it?

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:45.878
No.
Red Dead Redemption 2.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:47.647
You're just not into it.
I don't dislike it at all.

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:50.450
It's just I feel like
I'm watching a movie

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.885
that I can't interact
with enough.

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.354
Even though Jay's side piece,
Shane,

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:57.123
criticized me
for Nightfall's name.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:58.824
Nightfall's doing very well.
I want everyone to know that.

00:00:58.824 --> 00:00:59.992
Is he really?

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:01.493
And Justin came over and it-

00:01:01.493 --> 00:01:03.762
I named mine Dangler.
... Yeah. Hell yeah.

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.264
That's what I named him,
Dangler.

00:01:05.264 --> 00:01:06.632
I got it today.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:07.633
Yeah. Dangler?

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:09.402
Got a horse and I named Dangler.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:10.870
It's pretty good.
Does it have a dangler?

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.771
No. You know what?
This game's so smart.

00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:15.074
None of the other cowboys seem
to get it, how funny it was.

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:17.543
The guy who I bought it from,
who I had to name it

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:19.112
before I took it from him,

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.746
you think he would have been
like good night, man.

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:21.948
Oh, he does.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:23.115
Dangler. Look at that."

00:01:23.115 --> 00:01:24.784
Hey. He does have a giant dick.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.785
That's balls on the wall humor,
son.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.722
Yeah. If you could put the dirty
jokes in Arthur Morgan's mouth.

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:32.958
Yeah. He really does have
a giant old dick.

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:34.594
But I asked Black Lou.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.262
I was like, "Did you play
Red Dead Redemption 2?"

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.231
He was like, "Nah man."
Was it all in-laws all weekend?

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.599
Yeah. The in-laws came up.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.667
Oh, shit.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.302
We had a nice
New York City weekend.

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:44.204
Yeah. You went and saw
Harry Potter.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.639
Yeah. Harry Potter
was a marathon.

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:49.075
That's not how
you want to be told ...

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.976
As they say man,
all Broadway shows are ...

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.745
They're not sprints man.
They're marathons.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.480
Isn't that what they say
about Broadway shows?

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.550
Yeah. I think that's exactly
what they say.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.185
How long was it?
The total runtime?

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.486
Total runtime, I think,
was like five and a half-

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:01.687
Get the fuck out of here.

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:03.088
I'm dead serious. Hell yeah.

00:02:03.088 --> 00:02:04.256
Five and a half hours?

00:02:04.256 --> 00:02:05.457
Five and a half hours?
No.

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:06.626
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:08.327
How much do you have ...

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:10.630
You have to really love Harry
Potter and let me just say-

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.832
Is it all fucking nine books?
... Is it the full story?

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:15.969
I've never seen
any Harry Potters.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.870
Dude, if I went to a Harry
Potter play and they go,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.473
"On the day he was born,
Harry Potter got ..."

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.742
Ah, we're going back to born?
I'm out.

00:02:22.742 --> 00:02:25.978
I need this kid around
middle school at least.

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:29.882
When does he start wizarding?
And they go, "I don't know. 15?"

00:02:29.882 --> 00:02:31.617
You go, "Fast forward"

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:33.386
I want to see when he gets
that crack in the head

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:35.421
that makes him with the thing.

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.689
What gives him his powers.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.458
Yeah. What gives him his powers

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:40.859
and then a fucking owl
better come through the window.

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.795
I've never seen
any Harry Potter.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:45.698
I don't know the story at all,
so I want to go in blind.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:47.867
I've just been waiting
for this moment.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.169
Fuck the movies. Fuck the books.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.603
I got one day this-

00:02:51.603 --> 00:02:53.039
I have to ingest this
as a Broadway show.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.807
... I need musical breaks
in order

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.809
to really let it soak in.
I need them.

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.711
If that doesn't become a thing
that when you can remember

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.280
to say to people
when someone goes,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.048
"Did you read the book?"

00:03:02.048 --> 00:03:03.515
He goes, "Nah. I'm waiting
for the Broadway musical."

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:04.950
Whatever they say.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.652
At whatever age they decide
to make it

00:03:06.652 --> 00:03:08.421
because they're
popping up now.

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:12.724
Rocky? Didn't care for it.
Then saw the musical. Loved it.

00:03:12.724 --> 00:03:14.560
He goes, "Did you read that book
that John McCain

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.161
wrote before he died?"

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:17.863
Then he goes, "Oh.
I'm waiting for the musical."

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:19.732
I heard American Sniper
is going to previewed

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.834
on the Chris Kyle story.
I'm excited to read it.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.469
They're having
a lot of problems.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.270
There's a lot of harness
work in this.

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.373
Didn't even care for Spiderman
until the Broadway musical.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.907
It was worth it.

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:30.876
The hell is Spiderman?
Oh, Spiderman is a superhero.

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:32.045
Oh my God.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.579
Thank you Bono and Edge.

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.149
Thanks for scoring it.
How long was the intermission?

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:38.985
Intermission was two hours.

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:40.686
What?
What the fuck?

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:44.556
What? Do you go home and shower
and fucking call your family?

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:46.059
You were seven hours there?

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:47.260
Yeah.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.861
You change uniforms?

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:51.397
They go, "You are now allowed
to change your diapers

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.399
after watching us
prance around."

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.100
Dude, fuck Harry Potter.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.970
I suggest going outside
and punching each other's legs

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.706
to wake them back up.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.541
You should all march somewhere.
Get the blood down to your feet.

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:04.010
Two-hour intermission?

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.444
Yeah. So it went to first-

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:06.412
That's a workday.
Yeah. A workday.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.946
... Basically, yeah.

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:09.281
You should have robbed a bank
and had an alibi.

00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:10.683
You really do.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:12.084
But we had a little
10-minute break

00:04:12.084 --> 00:04:15.020
in between the first
and second part

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.689
and then there was
a two-hour intermission

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.724
and then we had to come back
and do that

00:04:18.724 --> 00:04:20.592
and then there was
another 10-minute intermission,

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:21.961
then close it out.

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:23.162
Was it worth it?

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.964
Was it your in-laws
the entire trip?

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:26.132
Yeah.

00:04:26.132 --> 00:04:27.733
Was it the entire time
they were here?

00:04:27.733 --> 00:04:29.268
They go, "We landed in LaGuardia
at 8:25.

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:31.937
We feel like we can get
to Harry Potter 9 AM."

00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:34.974
Yeah. Harry Potter is as long
as an Indian wedding.

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:36.909
Yeah.

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.978
But yeah.
The show was pretty good.

00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:42.548
It's basically Harry's kids.
All the kids having kids now.

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.817
It's not even the fucking
H man himself?

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:47.787
Nah, dude. You think HP is
showing up for Broadway dude?

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:51.156
Wow. When Harry Potter
was question, he said,

00:04:51.156 --> 00:04:55.127
"Broadway? Sounds pretty gay."
Potter. Potter.

00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:56.662
Mr. Potter.

00:04:56.662 --> 00:04:58.063
I think he comes back
in the Bruce Springsteen way.

00:04:58.063 --> 00:05:00.266
Oh, it is now a feminist
at Hogwarts.

00:05:00.266 --> 00:05:01.601
I don't know the terminology.

00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:03.869
What do you call them?
Lady boys?

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:07.339
Hogwarts was different
when I was there.

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.642
He's become an old salty
fucking wizard.

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:13.012
Hey. Wizards. That's for queers.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.582
Sound like a regular old
confused Johnathan.

00:05:17.549 --> 00:05:19.886
You sound like a scared Timothy.

00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:23.889
I don't understand.

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.126
It's two and a half hours
the first part of the play,

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:28.961
then you take a two-hour break

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:30.830
and then you come back for
another two and a half hours?

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.665
Yeah. Do you compress?
Do you go to therapy?

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:34.633
What's the fucking ticket cost?

00:05:35.268 --> 00:05:37.002
It was up there.

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:39.638
Really?
Are you willing to divulge?

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:41.206
Honestly, because we had
to get them like a-

00:05:41.206 --> 00:05:42.375
Hundreds a piece?

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:43.542
Yes.
A piece?

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.044
Yes.
Hundreds a piece?

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:47.346
100% hundreds a piece.
You fucking magic nerds.

00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:49.915
Take it as someone that's
never watched Harry Potter.

00:05:49.915 --> 00:05:52.885
That shit's dumb
and I like wrestling.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:55.521
You should have went to McKamey
Manor for that kind of money.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:56.955
You would have much
more of an experience.

00:05:56.955 --> 00:05:58.590
Yeah. You get an inbred guy
yelling at you

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.192
while you eat fucking goat.

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:02.028
Yeah. It's less torturous
for them to stuff you

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.163
inside of a dead yak
than it would be for this.

00:06:04.163 --> 00:06:06.332
Yeah. I would rather be brought
to hallucinations

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:07.499
than watch that ...

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:09.268
Is there a trailer for this?

00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:11.704
There's also options
for the tickets,

00:06:11.704 --> 00:06:13.272
so you can buy part one
and two together

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:15.141
and go on the same day
or consecutive days.

00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:17.476
How about they sit in the
sucker section where Lou went.

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:19.712
Or the people go separately too.

00:06:20.179 --> 00:06:23.349
You go day one and then fucking
go home and really decompress,

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:25.851
have a bottle of wine,
talk about what you saw.

00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:27.687
oh my God.
Part one and two together.

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:29.088
That's what you did.
Yeah.

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:30.356
That's what I did.
Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:30.356 --> 00:06:31.724
Man.

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.025
What'd you do
when you went home?

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:34.793
Just yell into a pillow?
Ah!

00:06:35.227 --> 00:06:38.964
He was like,
"I fucking can't take it!"

00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:40.966
Your wife should have blown you
in intermission

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:43.735
for doing with her family.
Here's the trailer. Yes, please.

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:46.972
Yeah, let's go. Harry.
Harry Potter.

00:06:46.972 --> 00:06:48.273
Is it singing?

00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:49.374
There is no singing.
I wouldn't have gone.

00:06:49.374 --> 00:06:50.876
No singing.

00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:51.878
I would not have gone.
I don't do musicals.

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:53.346
It's not a musical.

00:06:53.346 --> 00:06:55.080
Well then, it's not
Broadway friend.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.049
It's nothing
that's ever arrived.

00:06:57.049 --> 00:06:58.851
You're going to see the part
that really threw me off.

00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:00.886
There's a lot of dancing.

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:02.321
If I could say it real quick.

00:07:02.321 --> 00:07:04.023
Listen, I'm all
for the betterment

00:07:04.023 --> 00:07:06.191
of my fellow
African-Americans

00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:09.095
doing well as far as
Hollywood is concerned.

00:07:10.396 --> 00:07:12.965
I think it's great that they had
an African-American woman

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:14.500
and child in here.
That's fantastic.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.701
What?

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.603
But, they took Hermione,

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:21.840
which was one of the main
characters from the original ...

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.642
It was a white girl
and now she's like-

00:07:23.642 --> 00:07:25.344
Emma something.

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:29.781
... an older black woman and I
could not catch up to that shit.

00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:32.051
I couldn't wrap
my head around it.

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:34.319
So every time she was
in a scene, I got lost.

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:36.688
Would you accept it
if they wrote dialogue

00:07:36.688 --> 00:07:38.190
to it where they were like,

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.961
"Oh, you did the old spell
of black sassy.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:45.831
You can make delicious
fried things now."

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.367
And I'm waiting for it
to wear off,

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:51.170
so I can get back
to my ginger ass self.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.339
One of them
cracka ass Slytherins.

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.207
I'll tell you what happened
Harry.

00:07:55.207 --> 00:07:59.111
One of these young wizard
mother fuckers come done along

00:07:59.111 --> 00:08:00.712
and turned me
into an old black woman.

00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:02.381
I swear to god.

00:08:02.381 --> 00:08:06.451
Everyone knows Hermione.
Hermione got the curse of Madea.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:09.221
She got it and then is now
an old black woman.

00:08:09.221 --> 00:08:13.192
Where my family? Where that
no good Harry Potter at?

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.861
Running around
with his nonsense.

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:17.395
Got a tattoo on his forehead.

00:08:17.395 --> 00:08:22.635
Crazy white boy shit.
Flying around on a broomstick.

00:08:22.635 --> 00:08:24.604
You know I love you Hermione.

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:27.106
I know you do Harry.

00:08:27.106 --> 00:08:29.374
Get over here.
Give your bear some sugar.

00:08:29.908 --> 00:08:32.144
I know you meant well.
You one of the good ones.

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:34.312
Bring that pink wand ass
over here.

00:08:35.347 --> 00:08:37.116
So, it fucked you up
when you saw it?

00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:39.785
It really fucked me up
and I wanted to be so proud.

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:43.422
She acted her ass off.
She was fantastic, I tell you.

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:44.923
It just threw you off that ...

00:08:44.923 --> 00:08:46.859
Yeah because she's married
to Ron Weasley

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:49.428
and then they're daughter ...
Ron's a redhead in the play

00:08:49.428 --> 00:08:52.130
and then they're daughter
is darker than I.

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:55.000
She looks like she was adopted
just by the mom,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.569
like they got together after ...

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:58.370
And they're fucking the
[Darryl 00:08:56].

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.538
Fucking Ron Weasley
is not asking any questions.

00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:01.173
He's Ron Weasley.

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:02.808
He's just accepting it like
Me, Myself and Irene.

00:09:02.808 --> 00:09:04.176
Ron Weasley is like,
"I just love her.

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:05.978
I love her
and she stays with me."

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:07.646
Well, if she says it's mine,
it's mine

00:09:07.646 --> 00:09:09.014
because I don't know man,
we're all magic.

00:09:09.014 --> 00:09:10.449
Probably that can happen.

00:09:10.449 --> 00:09:12.551
It's that guy on that
World Star clip

00:09:12.551 --> 00:09:15.020
I was trying to show you,
where the guy gets cheated on

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.355
and he just keeps
just fucking taking it.

00:09:17.355 --> 00:09:19.157
Just goes complete ...

00:09:19.157 --> 00:09:20.792
He was like, "I came back a day
early, she's cheating on me

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:22.828
and she apologized
and I accepted it."

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:26.532
Oh, no. No. Ron Weasley.

00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:29.635
Weasley. Man, that's
a real commitment.

00:09:30.136 --> 00:09:33.906
Did you wife do horrible,
awful, wonderfully,

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:36.041
gross sexual things
with you after that, for that?

00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:38.210
Who pushed it though?
Whose idea was it?

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.578
No?

00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:42.514
No. It was her.
She's a big Harry Potter fan.

00:09:42.981 --> 00:09:44.483
She's a Harry Potter head?

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:45.885
Big time. Yeah.

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.853
She's a potter head?

00:09:50.723 --> 00:09:53.392
Really? She did nothing after
putting you through that?

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.993
Yeah. I didn't ...

00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:56.428
I sat through a Florence
and the Machine concert.

00:09:56.428 --> 00:09:58.063
I've been trying
to make Christine

00:09:58.063 --> 00:10:02.033
take a fist for two weeks.
She owes me.

00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:03.669
Oh. This is the guy
where he explains

00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:05.137
that how he's still with his-

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:06.871
What'd you do in
between the thing?

00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:08.273
Start a new life?

00:10:08.273 --> 00:10:09.541
Basically, yeah.
Just went to dinner.

00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:11.410
We had a full french dinner.

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:12.878
French dinner.

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:14.446
In between the show?
In between the show.

00:10:14.446 --> 00:10:16.382
He goes, "One of the most
complicated cuisines

00:10:16.382 --> 00:10:19.018
that needs to be explained.
Actually, we had one of those."

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:20.920
Sir, the souffle is going
to take 45 minutes.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.822
He goes, "I hope
because you know what?

00:10:22.822 --> 00:10:23.989
I'll take mine well done."

00:10:23.989 --> 00:10:25.290
He goes, "Well, I don't know.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.259
Harry Potter
and his old black wife

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:29.228
aren't going to be back
til 9:00."

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:31.263
Lou's talking like that.

00:10:31.263 --> 00:10:33.065
Then, he's like,
"I do not understand.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.333
Shouldn't you be happy
for the diversity in Broadway?

00:10:35.767 --> 00:10:37.669
A classically racist place.

00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:40.740
It is nice that another
black woman gets work."

00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:42.307
No?

00:10:42.307 --> 00:10:44.443
It's good. I don't know.

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:46.378
The frog legs will be right out.

00:10:46.378 --> 00:10:48.748
Can we tease things we're going
to talk about tomorrow?

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:51.016
Tomorrow, Autumn Rowe
is on Dr. Phil.

00:10:51.016 --> 00:10:52.617
Today and tomorrow

00:10:52.617 --> 00:10:55.287
and that's going to be
a whole fucking episode

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:57.555
because by the way,
it's out there

00:10:57.555 --> 00:11:00.559
and then you see the boyfriend,
you see her dad.

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.194
You watched a little bit of it?

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:03.762
Yeah. Well, of course,
we're talking about Autumn Rowe

00:11:03.762 --> 00:11:05.297
who's the girl
that keyed the car

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:07.099
and who said my Dr. Phil
impression is trash,

00:11:07.099 --> 00:11:09.000
so she is an enemy of the state.
Nah, it's trash.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.702
We can tease this for tomorrow.

00:11:10.702 --> 00:11:12.337
We only have about 10 minutes.
Bring up the Autumn Rowe video.

00:11:12.337 --> 00:11:14.139
The original.
Bring up the original video.

00:11:14.139 --> 00:11:15.708
Dude, you know this.
If we open a bag of this ...

00:11:15.708 --> 00:11:16.909
No, the original video.

00:11:16.909 --> 00:11:18.343
The original video.

00:11:18.343 --> 00:11:19.845
Oh, she's talking
about the abuse?

00:11:19.845 --> 00:11:20.812
No.
Oh, of her keying the car.

00:11:20.812 --> 00:11:21.914
I've lost my mind!

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:23.048
Yeah.
I lost my mind!

00:11:23.048 --> 00:11:24.516
Yeah. I lost my mind!

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:25.684
Lost my mind.

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:27.385
Oh, there she is.

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:29.888
We could take gambles here on
how we think this Dr. Phil goes.

00:11:29.888 --> 00:11:31.656
I think Dr. Phil ...

00:11:32.457 --> 00:11:34.259
Obviously, the boyfriend's
the bad guy

00:11:34.259 --> 00:11:35.827
because we already know she-

00:11:35.827 --> 00:11:37.862
Let me leave.
You're kidnapping me.

00:11:37.862 --> 00:11:39.464
Bruh. Dude, how great.

00:11:39.464 --> 00:11:41.867
Can we match up him
with the titty fucking girl?

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.702
Can we match up
that audio of him?

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:46.037
You're kidnapping me.
She's like, "Let me up."

00:11:46.037 --> 00:11:47.640
Let me leave.
You're kidnapping me.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.408
They're taking my car.

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:52.378
I lost my mind!

00:11:52.378 --> 00:11:54.379
I don't give a fuck.
I lost my mind.

00:11:54.379 --> 00:11:56.849
Yeah. She's on Dr. Phil.
It's a two-parter, right?

00:11:56.849 --> 00:11:58.651
It's Monday and Tuesday.
She's called in.

00:11:58.651 --> 00:11:59.818
Really?

00:11:59.818 --> 00:12:01.587
Yeah. We got the exclusive.

00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:04.690
They interview her,
they interview her dad,

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.257
they interview her boyfriend.

00:12:06.257 --> 00:12:08.227
What's her dad say?
What about the car?

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.895
Oh, yeah. She's a real dip.
Do they interview the guy

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.497
that was working at enterprise
that was running the car?

00:12:11.497 --> 00:12:13.198
He goes, "Well, it was
a long Thursday.

00:12:13.198 --> 00:12:15.100
We got it back all keyed up."

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:16.668
It was not a touch-up
paint situation.

00:12:16.668 --> 00:12:18.970
This thing had to go back in
on a real panel.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:25.677
As you know, we only charge you
when it's golf ball sized damage

00:12:25.677 --> 00:12:27.713
and this had a lot of it.

00:12:27.713 --> 00:12:30.983
There's no bad press
because she called Lou

00:12:30.983 --> 00:12:33.786
or texted Lou
just to say my Dr. Phil's on.

00:12:33.786 --> 00:12:35.287
Yeah. It's pretty crazy.

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:36.955
It's pretty crazy
that she is like ...

00:12:36.955 --> 00:12:38.190
She better learn how to rap.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:39.658
Yeah. Dude, if she's rapping,

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:41.627
she's about to take off
Bhad Bhabie.

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:43.662
She get some sick ass lyrics
behind her. She's a cute girl.

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:45.230
She goes, "Do you got bars?

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:49.001
And we're going to be
right back on Dr. Phil."

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:50.936
Next one is called
I'm Losing My Mind.

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:52.537
I'm fucking losing my mind.

00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:53.739
I'm losing my mind.
I'm losing my mind.

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:55.273
I'm losing my mind.

00:12:55.273 --> 00:12:56.708
All right. All right.
I can see you being a singer.

00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:58.877
Would you want to be
in a five-part harmony

00:12:58.877 --> 00:13:00.446
I'm putting together.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:04.216
I got a bunch of girls
that are basically feral animals

00:13:04.216 --> 00:13:05.684
and I'm going to put them
in a girl group

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:08.086
and I feel like you
could be the head.

00:13:08.086 --> 00:13:09.722
You're Dr. Phil's trash.

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:13.158
Oh, I love that fighting spirit.
You're nuts, huh?

00:13:13.158 --> 00:13:14.493
I do want a taste.

00:13:14.493 --> 00:13:16.061
Go to the beginning.

00:13:16.795 --> 00:13:20.231
There it is. There she is.
That's our angel.

00:13:20.231 --> 00:13:22.501
Hi.
I'm Dr. Phil and I didn't know

00:13:22.501 --> 00:13:25.871
that this summer was going to be
the weirdest summer of my life.

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:29.607
Him doing fun
teenage video voiceovers.

00:13:29.607 --> 00:13:31.209
Stop right there.

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:33.045
Yeah, I'm giving you
the Deadpool treatment.

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:34.780
I'm Dr. Phil.

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:39.885
She said her dad's a racist,
so we know how A got to B.

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:43.822
He goes, "If you put
your foot down,

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:46.425
they run right into
the arms of a guy that ..."

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:48.827
Yeah. And her dad
does look like a racist.

00:13:49.294 --> 00:13:50.863
Just the way he looks.

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:52.130
Man, we're going to need
a six-hour episode

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.665
to get through this.

00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:55.100
Can we get the full episodes?
Can you just pull it?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.768
Yeah. Hey Lou?

00:13:56.768 --> 00:13:59.204
Black Lou, you want to get
your in-laws for this one?

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:02.207
They go, "I won't listen
to the radio show."

00:14:02.207 --> 00:14:03.875
He goes, "What if I told you
it had a seven

00:14:03.875 --> 00:14:06.545
and a half hour episode
with this french meal in there."

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:09.381
We get to break for a little
French meal in between.

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:12.250
A little croissant.
A little croissant.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.052
Maybe some Poulet.

00:14:14.052 --> 00:14:15.787
Some La Petite Filet.

00:14:15.787 --> 00:14:18.924
Ah, that beef steak. Here we go.

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:20.659
That one's on me.

00:14:20.659 --> 00:14:24.597
I would like to see a seven-hour
Broadway play about a magic boy.

00:14:27.232 --> 00:14:30.368
A magic boy who has married
to an old black woman.

00:14:30.368 --> 00:14:34.340
Both taste and I am just
lonely restaurant owner.

00:14:35.907 --> 00:14:38.676
When we break, I take you
to a little café for a

00:14:38.676 --> 00:14:40.412
[inaudible 00:14:38].

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:44.316
But I like to know that the
mixed family go to see the play.

00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:47.486
This man is a very
punchable fellow.

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:49.988
I don't know.

00:14:49.988 --> 00:14:54.459
If I'm met a man as foolish,
it is damn kissable.

00:14:54.459 --> 00:14:56.228
Say what? Hold on, sir?
You want me to kiss you?

00:14:56.228 --> 00:14:57.996
I want to kiss you right here.

00:14:57.996 --> 00:14:59.131
You want to kiss me right here?
That'd be a great thing.

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:00.799
In front of my wife.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:02.167
Then, she comes out and starts
rapping in the background.

00:15:02.167 --> 00:15:03.836
Aw.
Two mother kisses.

00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:05.870
I lost my fucking mind.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.239
I lost my fucking mind.
I lost my fucking mind.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:08.674
I lost my fucking mind.

00:15:08.674 --> 00:15:09.875
I lost my fucking mind.

00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.309
All right y'all!

00:15:11.309 --> 00:15:13.012
Y'all losing your minds
out there!

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.615
Hey. What.
What. What.

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:19.017
I am a music mogul.

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.286
He's the new Lou Pearlman.

00:15:21.286 --> 00:15:23.522
I put 'em together.
You buy the albums.
