1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,680
You're listening to radio lab
from New York public radio,

2
00:00:06,681 --> 00:00:11,681
public radio W and Y C o n n p,

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,383
ah,

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,420
are live at the Fitzgerald
Theater and shape.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,623
Paul, Minnesota.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,730
October 30th, 1938

7
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,131
on that night,

8
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:39,131
the United States experienced a kind
of mass hysteria the we'd never seen

9
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:40,094
before.

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,440
And the reason which today sounds
almost comical was a radio play

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,990
tell me I did say to him was that Orson
wells and the mercury set her on the air

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,640
and the water of the world.

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:56,630
[inaudible]

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,720
around 12 million people were
listening. Most got the joke.

15
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,250
It was Halloween after all.

16
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,020
But if you consider that about one out
of every 12 people didn't get the joke.

17
00:01:06,021 --> 00:01:10,040
That's what surveys found afterwards
about one out of every 12 people who heard

18
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:14,480
the broadcast thought it was true and
that some percentage of that 1 million

19
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:18,860
people ran out of their homes, towels
over their faces, clutching children,

20
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:21,590
tripping, breaking limbs will.

21
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:24,560
That constitutes a major freak out.

22
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,730
[inaudible] and in this,

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,560
our first ever live hour on
radio lab here at Saint Paul,

24
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:33,560
Minnesota at the Fitzgerald
Theater. We ask why,

25
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,650
why do people panic? And of course
we'll ask the big question as well,

26
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:40,660
which is Canaan happened again.

27
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,030
I'm Jad I've been rod,
thank you all for coming in.

28
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,120
Where is my coat?

29
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,550
So let me, let me just say at the outset,

30
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:58,950
I'm just a tiny bit of puzzle
before you do it, just tell it.

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,560
Tell everyone who you
are. I, yeah, I'm Robert.

32
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,840
Can you just say Robert Krulwich,
which is my name. And uh, uh,

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,220
with all due respect,

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,740
I mean if we had any number of things
we could have done in the hour and could

35
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,670
have done sex lives of watermelons
or something interesting about

36
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:12,481
chrysanthemums,

37
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:17,481
I don't know why choose a Martian
invasion radio show from 1938 old,

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,220
old, old. I'm thinking, I can't believe
you wait till now to ask me a question.

39
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,330
I'm just thinking. So some of them
might be thinking, you know, old, old,

40
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,020
no, I'm gay. Well, I guess it's a
valid question you ask. Truth is,

41
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:36,170
I actually only discovered the war of the
worlds recently in a 2001 kind of late

42
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:41,901
2001 actually not long after that day
in 2001 and it just really struck me and

43
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:50,640
it wasn't so much that the broadcast had
a kind of end of the World Nis that I

44
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:52,560
guess we were all feeling
in real life at that moment,

45
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,660
but it was more just the way that the,

46
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:59,950
the story unfolded step by step by step
and how in the broadcast you feel like

47
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:06,260
you were lost inside a newscast, which
is not unlike what it was like. Yeah,

48
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,330
we were all glued to the TV and real
life grasping at these pieces of news,

49
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,300
trying to figure out what was
going on. And that was very much,

50
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,750
I think what they were trying to
create in the broadcast. But now,

51
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:20,470
many years later, what I'm really
left with is a question, what?

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:21,970
Well,

53
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,970
if I were alive in 1938 in front of
the radio and I heard this sounds,

54
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,960
what would I have thought would I have
believed it would have not believed?

55
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,050
I mean, I don't know. What about you? I
don't really know. I don't really know.

56
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,720
I Dunno. Okay, let's do
something. Just start us off here.

57
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:42,520
Let's actually go back to 1938 and see
if we can figure out how these sounds

58
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:45,800
landed on people's ears and what
information they had in their heads. So,

59
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,420
and I need your help with this.
How would I help with that?

60
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,960
I want you to go over to that
seat right there. That's,

61
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,830
we're going to call that seat in
1938 all right. There Nike. Okay.

62
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:01,450
Now just, let's just all imagine
there you are on your easy chair.

63
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,030
You're maybe drinking a cream soda.

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,660
Let's tune the dial. Okay.

65
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,080
Trying to find something here.

66
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,373
[inaudible]

67
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,800
Raymond Ruck. Hello, who is Rick Mark,

68
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,940
you know a Raymond ruck. Hello.

69
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,480
The thoughts of the Fetish Raymont
recolor lead dog with lower cupboard.

70
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:47,260
You don't know that there's no
such person as Ramon Rick. Hello.

71
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,540
And that it's just a record in a CBS
studio, but it sounds professional enough.

72
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:53,530
So you sit back, you relax. But then later

73
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,331
we're not.

74
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:19,920
We're telling you to the music of Ramrod
Kelo playing for you in the Meridian

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,840
Room or the Park Plaza Hotel
situated in downtown New York.

76
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,470
So at this point you think

77
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,590
I'm thinking explosions on Mars,
hydrogen gas moving towards earth.

78
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,221
A little strange,

79
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:39,480
but how could it be so bad if I still get
to listen to the fabulous nodes at the

80
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:41,250
lovely Raymond that color

81
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,720
and he does continue to play
for another minute, 34 seconds.

82
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,560
But then it happens again. Ladies
and gentleman following on the news,

83
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:50,090
given an odd bullet in the moment of golf,

84
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,060
the government media or logical
bureau has requested the Lord.

85
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,980
No. Before we go any further there
for, are we going to get further?

86
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:01,190
Let me ask a really basic question
here. I mean, we're dealing with a play,

87
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,660
a radio play. Yeah.

88
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,310
Why would Orson wells in his posse of of
troubadours start their play this way?

89
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,480
The original hg wells story was written
in 1898 so it was really an old book at

90
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:17,080
the time. And there, there is no reporter
character in the book. By the way,

91
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,110
does everybody know this word? The
world story. And most people do.

92
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,230
The story basically is this little green
creatures from Mars for a number of

93
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,760
reasons having to do
with thirst or something,

94
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,560
have to leave their planet and they come
to Earth. They're not very nice people.

95
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,580
They invade, they destroy
quite a number of us.

96
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:37,810
And then ironically in the end
they get killed by little viruses,

97
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:40,810
our smallest inhabitants of our
planet, bite them and destroy them.

98
00:06:40,811 --> 00:06:45,010
And it's science fiction of course.
But in 1938 most kids knew this story.

99
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,170
It was very popular. So I don't see why.

100
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,330
Right? And in fact,

101
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:51,720
let me bring in a clip from a Orson wells
producer at the time, John Houseman,

102
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,860
uh, Austin and I chose it.
We decided the time had come,

103
00:06:55,861 --> 00:07:00,690
we should be doing a science fiction
show. I'm so, we tried a few of that one.

104
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:01,524
Very easy to do,

105
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,140
do in just a few days before they
had to be on the air with their next

106
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:04,951
installment.

107
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:09,240
John Houseman pulls that book off the
shelf to shows it to o w says, Hey,

108
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:12,990
what about this? And
Orson Welles says this,

109
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,520
you want me to do this?

110
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,320
Well, he, uh, had trouble in what
sense? In the sense of the design,

111
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,530
you said it was dough. No,
he told it he was boring. Uh,

112
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,760
if it was something that
happened 50 years ago,

113
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,200
everybody knows it didn't happen.
So, uh, who the hell care, right?

114
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,510
If we're going to make people
care about this old story,

115
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:36,530
we've got updated not 18, 98 and 1938.

116
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,230
And it just so happened
that one month prior,

117
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:43,460
something had happened that
forever changed the world.

118
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,050
Ban The news. The wall was that
we'll begin with the, this,

119
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,253
the, my, my

120
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:54,870
[inaudible] [inaudible]

121
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,240
Hitler was threatening
Europe first, Austria,

122
00:07:57,241 --> 00:08:01,710
then Czechoslovakia World War Two was
right around the corner and cvs sent a

123
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:04,110
team of guys to cover
the story among them.

124
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,050
Columbia continues with expensive
coverage of the European cartoons

125
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,660
and in September,

126
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,580
Moreau and his CBS producers did something
with the news that was kind of novel.

127
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,360
The broke in.

128
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,930
We interrupt this program of music by
Harry James and his orchestra to bring you

129
00:08:19,931 --> 00:08:22,450
a bullet in just received.
And the w o r new is wrong.

130
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,370
No, this had happened before but never
quite liked this with live reports,

131
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,770
eye witness accounts,
and never quite so much

132
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,120
square up in broadcast and bring it up
in part in the [inaudible] night of prep

133
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,800
in just one month. These bulletins
have become so numerous. Yeah,

134
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,110
interrupt our program to
bring you a special broadcast.

135
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,810
That bulletins were practically
interrupting bulletin.

136
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,320
We interrupted program to bring
you with Special Brighton guys.

137
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,850
We interrupt this broadcast and to bring
her this important bulletin from the

138
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:45,480
United

139
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,730
we interrupt this program to
take you to the NBC News Room.

140
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,810
Here is a special [inaudible] on the NBC.

141
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,750
So after weeks and weeks of hearing
these constant interruptions,

142
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,500
it's easy to understand
why this [inaudible]

143
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,600
the gentleman following on the news given
an odd bullet in the moment of goal,

144
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,420
didn't sound like a play,
but government media a lot.

145
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:12,700
We have arranged an interview with
another astronomer, Professor Pierson.

146
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,260
I don't know whether I need
anymore. Raymond. Marcelo,

147
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:30,170
I need to know a little more
about this Martian, uh, thing.

148
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,050
Just seeing how slowly it
starts. And by the way, um,

149
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,810
what time do you got on your, uh,
your, uh, fucker watch their, uh,

150
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,270
the pocket watch says eight
Oh four, eight oh four.

151
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,010
Tell me when it gets to eight oh
five to what? Eight oh five to eight.

152
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:51,480
Oh five, eight oh five.
You know, just let me know.

153
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,990
[inaudible] no. Okay. It'll five.

154
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,350
This is my favorite minute
in understanding one of the
greatest media hoaxes of

155
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:04,360
all times. Cause the thing that's
interesting is that at this moment in, uh,

156
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,860
October of 1938, art,

157
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,570
Orson wills and the mercury theater
of the air were not that popular.

158
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,680
They had a tiny, tiny
slice of the audience.

159
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,520
And so not too many people were
listening. Certainly not at the beginning.

160
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:22,521
From eight o'clock to eight Oh four and
so not too many people heard this very

161
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:23,700
important introduction,

162
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,010
the Columbia Broadcasting System
and the affiliated station.

163
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,620
Was that the war of
the world by h g wells?

164
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, what, wait, why
didn't they hear that? Well,

165
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,080
cause at that very same moment,

166
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,170
the majority of people
listening were tuned into this

167
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:41,740
[inaudible]

168
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:45,850
the makers of Jason Sad barn copied is
the power of Glam. You know, it's fresh.

169
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,710
Resent the chase in San Bono,

170
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,530
um, that chase and Sandborne hour. Now
that that was good. That was Ed Bergen.

171
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:56,880
It had the puppet Charlie McCarthy
who, who, who liked girls. It was,

172
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:59,840
this was rainy. It was the most popular
show at the time, right opposite

173
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,520
three. Theater Theater
had 10 times the audience.

174
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:07,521
But at eight oh five host Don Ameche
introduces and not so popular singer

175
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,220
and it's the rousing rip roaring
song of Vagabond from the Vagabond J.

176
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,920
Aw, you're the Megan [inaudible].

177
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,880
And yesterday moment, thousands, hundreds.

178
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,370
We don't know how many
listeners started to dial surf.

179
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,010
Where are they landed on the mercury
theater of the air already in progress

180
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:37,143
where they stayed.

181
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,330
We are ready now to take your to the
principle observatory at Princeton

182
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,220
because by then a
strange meteor had landed

183
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,150
where Carl Phillips, our commentator
will interview Professor Richard Pearson,

184
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,090
famous astronomer. That's it.

185
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,970
The IB cannot question at any
time but better. No Piping.

186
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,960
Typically Mr Product Guy cannot
account for it. I just know.

187
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:11,851
Yeah,

188
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:14,550
we've had four interruptions now at this
point you've called your whole family

189
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,523
into the room.

190
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,690
Marge on media is on Mars, March.

191
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,320
Meteors what meteors on Mars

192
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,110
and just as you are utterly confused.
Along comes the expert, you know,

193
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:31,200
people surveyed afterwards said,
I didn't believe this thing.

194
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:35,840
I thought it was all baloney until I heard
that government official guy or the a

195
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,120
Princeton professor and this script
is chocked full of believable experts.

196
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,533
Great. Or

197
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,820
the Natural History Museum
Professor Endoscopists of
the California Astronomical

198
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:46,950
Society. There are General
Montgomery Smith, Capitan,

199
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,210
Lansing of the signal card.

200
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,830
Maybe subconsciously that had an effect
to convince people that something was in

201
00:12:51,831 --> 00:12:52,664
fact happening.

202
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,020
A feeling furthered a moment
later when the professor and uh,

203
00:12:57,021 --> 00:13:00,710
the reporter Carl Phillips go live
to that field in Grovers mill,

204
00:13:00,711 --> 00:13:03,320
New Jersey with that media,
right. Or whatever it is.

205
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,170
It's landed metal casing is definitely,

206
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,810
yeah. Great. The mouth, that's
kind of be shape. What's the lie,

207
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:07,100
but dripping sweat. I hate
reenlist lips. Actually

208
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,510
now before we get too far into this,
see, let me play you a another clip,

209
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,760
right? You're providing majestically
Prada like them. Great. Better,

210
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,390
no doubt. [inaudible] a little bit more

211
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,670
lining the windows. Looking
down the road ahead of him.

212
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,560
[inaudible] it's my editor. Oh
my. Get out of the way, please.

213
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,160
If Bernie bursting into flames and
it's falling on the mornings, that

214
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,060
all the humanity and
all the Freebie garage,

215
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,860
this is tape of the Hindenburg crash.
Sure. It's still fresh in people's minds.

216
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:43,420
Happened one year before the broadcast,

217
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,800
before going on the air that night after
Frank Reddick who played that reporter,

218
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,960
Carl Phillips in the field,
he went to the library,

219
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,590
dug up this old tape or not so
old and played it to himself.

220
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:54,971
Oh,

221
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:59,971
the humanity and all the managing
all the humanity and all that bad,

222
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,780
maybe karate of the humanity
and all that faceted. Maybe

223
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:10,110
get himself in the right frame of mind
for that now famous attack scene in that

224
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:11,230
field in New Jersey,

225
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,090
the transmission cuts off.

226
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,460
Okay.

227
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,030
12 million people have just
heard slithery green aliens.

228
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:56,500
He visceral policemen, farmers
and reporters followed by

229
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,313
nothing.

230
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,090
Ladies and gentlemen, due to
circumstances beyond our control,

231
00:16:03,091 --> 00:16:05,760
we are unable to continue the
broadcast from Grovers mill.

232
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,780
Evidently there is some difficulty
with our field transmission. However,

233
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,450
we will return to that point
at the earliest opportunity

234
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,251
and when they do return,

235
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:16,520
what you learn is that that grounded
flying saucer that just zapped all those

236
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:18,980
men has now stood up. It's grown legs,

237
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,650
it's as tall as a tree and it is marching

238
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,900
through the countryside,
stopping everything in its path.

239
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:29,930
And then we are taken to
field reports, bleive battles,

240
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:34,850
scenes between militia and paws. But
before we do, let me play one more clip.

241
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:35,460
This one is real.

242
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,460
If you ran and one of the
areas you mentioned or like
a child of school age and

243
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:41,940
where did you have an evacuated,

244
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,480
you should send him to school tomorrow
Friday with hand luggage containing the

245
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,020
child's gas mask, a
change of under clothing.

246
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,950
This is Edward r Murrow reporting
from London. Same time period.

247
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,180
Just to give you a sense of how scary it
was to be alive at this moment in time,

248
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,200
kids in England were being told
to take gas masks to school,

249
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,700
all of which would have made the
following dramatize battle scenes.

250
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,950
Thank you. Now to the field
headquarters of the state military,

251
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,010
there's Broberg now New Jersey,

252
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,350
all the more real

253
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,640
37 degree up

254
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,480
here. The New Jersey militia
fire on a fleet of marsh and pods

255
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,903
to no avail.

256
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:37,560
Their sales bounce right off in the
Martians in retaliation release a cloud of

257
00:17:37,561 --> 00:17:42,340
poisonous gas, which slowly
overtake the soldiers

258
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,850
he meet us. He touched you.

259
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:52,470
[inaudible]

260
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,340
ladies and gentlemen,

261
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:57,090
I have a grave announcement to
make incredible as it may seem,

262
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:01,230
both the observations of science and
the evidence of our eyes lead to the

263
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:04,590
inescapable assumption that that was
strange beings who landed in the Jersey

264
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,060
farmland tonight are the vanguard of
an invading army from the planet Mars.

265
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,220
The Battle of which took place tonight
at Grove of mills has ended in one of the

266
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:17,950
most stopping the feet ever
suffered by an army in modern times.

267
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:23,050
7,000 men armed with rifles and machine
gun pit it against the single fighting

268
00:18:23,051 --> 00:18:27,130
machine of the invaders
from Mile 129 survivors.

269
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,090
One moment please. Ladies and gentleman
now the Bolton from Langenfeld,

270
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,003
Virginia.

271
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,550
The monster is not in control of the
Middle Section of New Jersey and has

272
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:40,220
effectively cut the state through its
center highways to the north, south,

273
00:18:40,221 --> 00:18:42,270
and West. The clot with
frantic human track lease,

274
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,750
not army reserves are unable to control
the med flight communication lines are

275
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:47,680
down from Pennsylvania
to the radio tracks.

276
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:50,930
The tone and service just continue
to prevail throughout New Jersey.

277
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:53,630
In eastern Pennsylvania. The Bolton
cutting planes report enemy machines.

278
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,890
Now three numbers increasing speed north
when kicking over house at the same

279
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,270
time we take you to Washington,
hit the sun was up a nation,

280
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,560
the secretary of the interior,

281
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,760
I shall not try to conceal the
gravitate bullet in it handed me.

282
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,400
Pick your way from the
doctrine. Doesn't do that

283
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,270
with a cup at the end
now, no more defense.

284
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,950
Everything wiped out.

285
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:37,690
[inaudible] [inaudible]

286
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,620
we don't know exactly how many people
panic that night. Here's what we do now.

287
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,770
The Trenton Police Department got
2000 calls in under two hours.

288
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,460
The New York Times switchboard received
875 calls alone from people wanting to

289
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:54,970
know where they'd be safer

290
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,840
on the roof or in the gas
rate shelter in the cellar.

291
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,010
We're lucky we do have transcripts of
what happened on the other side of radios

292
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:04,431
that night.

293
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:08,420
Thanks to a Princeton sociologist who
went out and conducted a series of

294
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:12,650
interviews after the broadcast and
what's amazing is how effective that

295
00:20:12,651 --> 00:20:13,580
broadcast was.

296
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:18,581
Some listeners said they actually
felt like they were choking.

297
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,460
Others reported to police that
they saw with their own eyes.

298
00:20:22,461 --> 00:20:23,750
As they looked at the Manhattan skyline,

299
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:27,500
they saw a thin veil of smoke
from the battle over the city.

300
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,880
Some said they saw marsh and machine's
high stepping their way down the palace

301
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,240
aide, splash, splash,
splash. Uh, and many people,

302
00:20:35,241 --> 00:20:38,120
when they called operators or
police, they didn't say, oh my God,

303
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:41,810
we're being invaded by
Martians. They said, oh my God,

304
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:44,600
we're being invaded by Germans.

305
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,030
Here are some of the
literal transcriptions.

306
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,900
This is what real people
actually said. Everybody ready?

307
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,080
I knew it was some Germans
trying to gas us all,

308
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,470
but when the announcer kept on
calling them people from Mars,

309
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,910
I just thought he was ignorant.

310
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:01,480
I immediately called up the Maplewood
police and asked if there was anything

311
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:03,970
wrong. They answered, we
know as much as you do,

312
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,550
keep your radio tuned in and
follow the announcer's advice.

313
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,740
I called into my husband, Dan,
why don't you get dressed?

314
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,050
You don't want to die
in your working clothes.

315
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,300
I looked in his box and saw some chicken
left from Sunday dinner that I was

316
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:21,570
saving for Monday night
dinner, said to my nephew,

317
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,830
we may as well eat this chicken.
We walked in here in the morning.

318
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,360
This is Austin Wells,
ladies and gentlemen,

319
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,790
out of character to assure you that
the war of the world has no further

320
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,540
significant and at the holiday
offering it was intended to be.

321
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,250
We are not related the world before
your very ears and utterly destroyed the

322
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,860
CBS. You will be relieved.

323
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:54,540
I hope to learn that we didn't mean it
and that both institutions are still open

324
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:55,374
for business.

325
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,010
That was how Orson wells concluded the
war of the worlds broadcast with those

326
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:04,480
words. Basically it was a joke. Gotcha.

327
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,580
But it was only after he and his producer
John has been left and read the papers

328
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:12,920
the next day and they understood
just how much trouble they had caused

329
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:18,970
[inaudible] because of for at least a
couple of hours we believe we were mass

330
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,253
murder.

331
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,910
Extremely surprised to learn that I story,

332
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:29,780
which is become familiar to children
through the medium of comic strips and a

333
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,380
this as well as in the press
conference. That following day,

334
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:38,040
mini succeeding novels and adventure
stories should have had such an immediate

335
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:42,700
and profound effect upon radio listeners.

336
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,480
So immediate and so profound that
the FCC Commissioner of the time,

337
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,080
George Henry Payne, labeled
the Mercury theater of the air,

338
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,080
get this terrorists

339
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,590
[inaudible]

340
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,730
radio terrorists.

341
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:03,650
But there is one thing we must not overlap
all this took place in 1938 and our

342
00:23:03,661 --> 00:23:08,661
less sophisticated yesterday that did not
know the atom bomb guided missiles and

343
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:11,960
rockets that may shortly
fly to the Moon Edward

344
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,510
r Murrow in 1957 was he
correct when he said that?

345
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,830
Where are we really so
on sophisticated in 1938

346
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,230
I mean, it's so different
from now. Well, let's see.

347
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,720
Stay with US folks. I'm Robert
Krulwich and Jana boom rod.

348
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,900
We're alive at the Fitzgerald
Theater in Saint Paul,

349
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:33,360
Minnesota radio lab will continue.

350
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,080
Just a moment [inaudible].
