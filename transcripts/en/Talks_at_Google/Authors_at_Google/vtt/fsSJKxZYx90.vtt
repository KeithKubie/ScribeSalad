00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:02.390
HAL BAILEY: Hello.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.300
My name's Hal Bailey.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.430
And I'm excited today.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.530
Kal and I met several years
ago in San Francisco.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.550
And I'm thrilled today to
have him here at Google.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.770
We've been talking about
this many years.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.860
Two of the things that I think
will resonate with most people

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.630
here about Kal and his work are
one, he spends a lot of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.930
time and effort thinking about
the digital revolution.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.110
How the digital revolution is
changing both books, but also

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.550
art in general.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.960
And then also, he's been very
vocal about freedom of

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.980
expression, not just in the
United States and the United

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.000
Kingdom, where it's easy
to do that, but around

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.390
the world as well.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.960
So he's got lots of interesting

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:48.870
stories to tell us.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.990
And I'll hand it over to him.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.380
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Great.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.610
Thank you very much.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.920
Thank you, Hal.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.405
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.405 --> 00:00:55.375
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Thanks,
everyone.

00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:55.860
Good to see you.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.280
Thank you.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.670
Thank you all for
coming today.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.590
We're going to have some fun
today, partly because we're

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.920
going to be talking
a little bit about

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.760
the world of cartoons.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.530
Political cartoons, which
innately should be fun.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.640
But also, I'm going to have a
little bit of fun because the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.010
world of cartoons has been
shrinking of late.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.220
And what I mean is the
traditional cartoon that

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.190
everyone knows about appears
in a newspaper.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.580
And soon, we may be saying,
what was the newspaper, as

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.420
everyone's attention moves to
the internet and absorbing

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.920
content on new devices.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.840
And so, the numbers of political
cartoonists my

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.570
particular craft, has reduced,
I think in 25 years, from

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.950
about 200 in the
US to about 70.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.260
And those numbers will
probably get smaller.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.890
And around the rest of the
world, there may be only

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.610
another hundred of us
that are doing this.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.550
But today, we're going to change
all that, because in

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.730
addition to me telling you a
little bit about the world of

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.160
cartoons that I reside in,
showing you some cartoons,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.670
doing a Q&amp;A, I'm also going to
draw some of my favorite

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.700
presidents that I've drawn
over the years.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.980
But we're going to finish off
with a drawing lesson, where

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.940
I'm going to teach everybody
here how to draw Barack Obama.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.720
OK?

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.610
So we're going to have like,
another 50 cartoonists by the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.160
end of the show.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.100
We hope that you guys
will practice.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.700
And then we'll start a new
revolution starting today.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.720
So anyways, my world.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.580
Editorial cartoonist.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.570
I've been with "The Economist"
magazine for 35 years.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.500
And many of you have copies of
the book that just came out

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.080
about a month ago celebrating
that fact.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.130
And during my career, both for
"The Economist" and as

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.310
cartoonist is for "The Baltimore
Sun," where I had

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.270
been, I've created over
8,000 cartoons.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.270
And I've created over
140 covers for

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.000
the magazine as well.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.020
And I wanted to give you guys
a little bit of insight into

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.590
this very special type of
creativity that's involved in

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.700
my craft, which requires both
the understanding of politics

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.270
and art, and done
on a deadline.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.920
But the thing that fascinates me
most about my craft is the

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.920
notion that you're dealing
with a certain kind of

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.360
technology.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.660
And the technology is pigment,
black pigment, on a white

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.200
piece of paper.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.170
And when you see it appear in
front of you, it's completely

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.530
individual, as individual as
each of our handwriting.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.800
Yet when it appears, suddenly
an image arrives.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.220
And everyone, no matter what
nationality, what language you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.930
speak, it will be universally
understood.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.380
And there is no special
effects with this.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.310
It's exactly what you see.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.630
There's something very human
and very tangible about the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.930
act of drawing.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.400
But then, there's also something
about the power that

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.330
this line can create.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.560
And we only have to think about
what happened to a group

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.430
of Danish cartoonists just a few
years ago, when they drew

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.820
the Prophet Mohammad.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.710
There were subsequent riots,
where hundreds

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.960
of people were killed.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.030
And it caused an international
outcry that still is an open

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.190
wound today.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.770
So besides the fact that there's
a magic to this line,

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.080
there's also a power
to this line.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.880
And I'm going to share with you
guys a little bit of the

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.420
inside of what it's like
to be a cartoonist.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:12.950
Some of the skill
sets involved.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.370
Some of the background stories
that go into it, particularly

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.070
with my work with the
"Economist." And then, we'll

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.440
have some fun doing some
drawing as well.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.459
So I thought I'd start--

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.910
I think it's a really important
thing when you're

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.010
dealing with artists, it's
really important to look at

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.840
their early work.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.520
You get some sort of sense
of where they come from.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.940
And I'm going to show you this
cartoon, which is a seminal

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.440
cartoons of mine.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.790
Very important cartoon,
which I drew when I

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.970
was six years old.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.480
So now, this cartoon
is important.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.880
You might see it's got Abraham
Lincoln, "Gettysburg Address."

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.610
The reason why this cartoon is
so important is because this

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.020
cartoon inspired a feature
length motion picture starring

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.240
Daniel Day Lewis.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.090
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: It's a
really important piece.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.360
But here's what's
cool about this.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.440
At age six, everybody in
this room is drawing.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.710
Right?

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.340
We are all drawing.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.200
But somewhere between six and
13, most people drop off.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.140
But we all have that in us, that
capacity to use lines to

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.030
dictate reality, to
translate reality.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.830
It's all something
that we absorb,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.960
life through the lines.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.430
And for me as a cartoonist, I'm
actually a professional

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.260
six-year-old.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.950
I kind of stayed with
this world of lines.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.910
So after graduating from
Harvard, I spent the next 11

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.170
years living in the UK.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.580
But I started as-- you're not
going to believe this--

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.190
a semi-professional
basketball player.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.560
I was always taller back then.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.290
But I also, when the team is
having financial trouble, I

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.170
went on the streets and started
drawing caricatures.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.630
And one of things when you're
a street artist, you get to

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.910
see hundreds, if not thousands,
of faces.

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.840
And you see people of all
different nationalities, all

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.810
different shapes of heads,
all different ages and

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.770
ethnicities.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.870
And you learn to deconstruct
and understand the

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.730
complexities of the face.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.060
And the unfortunate thing,
though, is I was doing this to

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.510
raise money.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.860
And you can imagine the typical
caricaturists knock

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.560
something out, what?

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.600
In about three or
four minutes.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.660
And they put a tennis racquet
in the person's hand.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.910
And they charge you whatever.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.660
I was a terrible businessman,
because it used to take me a

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.180
half an hour or 45 minutes.

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.480
Because I wanted to capture
that person.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.170
The spirit of that individual.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:35.010
And I thought I was mad until
I read a famous quote by the

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.480
Italian Renaissance painter,
Annibale Carracci, who said,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.770
"A good caricature is more
true to life than reality

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.780
itself."

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.050
And it's this whole idea that
you can get to the soul of

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.420
someone through a caricature
that's always inspired me.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.440
So when I started working for
"The Economist" magazine back

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.140
in 1978, I now was no longer
drawing holidaymakers.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.350
I was now drawing
policymakers.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.970
And I was beginning to realize
and understand that the

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.920
cartoon, the caricature, was
not just a source of making

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:10.590
humorous assertions of people on
the streets, but now you're

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.440
taking on powerful people,
and you could

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.700
knock them down a notch.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.180
And over this time, I've
drawn, wow, I've drawn

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.400
practically every major
politician over the years.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.430
Certainly every American
president.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.240
And some of the American
presidents obviously offered

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.760
more scope than others.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.770
And I also found the caricatures
I was drawing were

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.830
not simply representations of
the individuals, but they also

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.890
were telling stories.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.050
This cartoon, for example,
appeared on the cover of the

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.810
magazine "The Economist" not
long after Hurricane Katrina.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.890
But it was a metaphor of how
the Bush administration and

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.610
their policies were also falling
apart in the same way

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.640
that the country was.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.090
And this is the only cover in
over 150 years "The Economist"

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.230
ran with no words on it.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.320
And then, of course, caricatures
of individual

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.290
presidents who I've drawn
change over time.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.640
Partly because we all
change over time.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.520
But we've also seen how
Obama's has changed.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.580
This is what he look like
in 2008 when he

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.600
ran the first time.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.660
You guys remember this guy,
the upward looking, the

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.020
optimistic, the hopeful
president?

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:23.570
And now, five years later, this
is what he looks like.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:28.290
So the weight of the job, and
the gravity, and gravitas are

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.380
kind of pulling its weight and
taking a toll on the face.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.340
And so the drawing can
tell the story.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.280
And the other thing that I
learned when I was watching

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.080
caricatures over time was it
was that people's shape of

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.780
your head is the most
distinguishing characteristic

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:42.659
that you have.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.930
And so someone like John Kerry,
who's got a very long

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.250
face, made it good
for caricature.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.760
And there's other guys, like
Joe Biden here, where the

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.790
smile gives a shape of its own
and creates the fundamental

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:59.140
part of the recognition
of the face.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.940
Now it's also a point that I
discovered over time that the

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.600
caricatures are not just
reflecting the important

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.890
people in the news, but they
can also be educational

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.820
components, where they're
telling the readers who are

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.490
the people, important people,
that you should know about.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.370
So someone like Nancy Pelosi,
who everyone wouldn't

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:21.090
necessarily recognize if she
walked into the room, or

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.880
Senator Reid of Nevada.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.380
But these are important
people.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.750
If you put them in cartoons,
then people say, oh, maybe I

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.600
should know who these
people are.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.390
And then there's election
years, where we have new

00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:36.030
candidates coming along and
new challenges for the

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.170
cartoonist and the
caricaturist.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.960
So I was in the UK, like I
said, for about 11 years.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.520
And I hadn't been there for very
long before I realized

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.520
that as an American living
abroad, you are held

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.270
personally responsible for
everything that goes on in

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.910
this country.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:58.900
So as a result, I became more
aware and more interested in

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.560
politics to try to figure
out what was going on.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.760
Partly because I learned that
every taxi driver in London

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.440
seemed to know more about
American politics than I did.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.920
But I figured that I needed
to get my game up.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.600
So I got this new interest in
politics, and I combined it

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:15.350
with my interest in cartoons
to become a political

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.820
cartoonist.

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.070
Here, I was using caricature,
the skill set that I felt was

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.420
really one the most powerful
tools at the

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.870
disposal of a satirist.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.530
But I was also using it
as a way to get your

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.550
interest into a cartoon.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.350
At that point, I deliver
a message.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:35.970
And that makes the
good cartoon.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.160
So because my job is not really
to make you laugh.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.270
My job is to make you think
using humor, using caricature,

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:47.120
but using it as a vehicle
for a message.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.850
And after that, hopefully,
making you challenge your

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.720
thoughts and your ideas on the
important events of the day.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.350
So I will use caricatures.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:57.900
I thought caricatures
are great.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.990
To quote another famous person,
another great British

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.340
philosopher named Mary Poppins,
"A spoonful of sugar

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:09.830
helps the medicine go down." And
because we are animals and

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.940
we are wired to look at faces,
whereby our eyes are scanners,

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.580
our brains are hard drives, and
all we do is every time we

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.000
look at the person, we're
eyeballing and we're assessing

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.490
them to see if they're friendly,
if we like them, are

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.120
they attractive, would I like
to go out with them, or

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.840
whatever you're thinking.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.840
Your brain is processing this
information instantaneously.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.820
The caricature is the thing that
brings your eyeballs into

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:34.640
the cartoon.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.520
And when you have them in there
for five or six seconds,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.690
then you can deliver your
message at the same time.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.950
So now, I'm going to show you
some of the other tools in

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.220
addition to caricature that we
cartoonists use to get our

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.430
messages across.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.730
So one of them, of course,
is symbols.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.790
The donkey and the elephant,
most famously in the United

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.510
States, representative of
two different parties.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:58.440
Use them, of course,
in many cartoons.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.870
This cartoon, for example,
I did in 2010 during the

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:02.950
mid-term elections.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.490
Normally when the opposition
party gains an upper hand.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:08.380
We might expect to see
the same cartoon

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:12.220
again in 2014, perhaps.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.900
Although I never recycle
cartoons.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.090
I want to make that clear.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:15.300
All right.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:19.260
So here's another famous symbol,
our friend Uncle Sam.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:24.960
So this cartoon I did after
a visit to Cuba in 1999.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.055
And there, you can
see Uncle Sam.

00:12:26.055 --> 00:12:27.030
He's got his microphone.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:30.000
He's going, "People of Cuba!

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.530
Why stick with that dictator
idiot Castro when you can

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.820
freely elect your idiots
like we do?"

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:40.190
And that was during the time
of the Monica Lewinsky

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.970
nonsense and all that
stuff going on in

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:43.450
the background there.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.410
And then this cartoon about
Uncle Sam, one of my

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.700
favorites, has Uncle Sam, "What
foreign enemies think

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.440
Americans are looking for,
world control." "What

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.370
Americans are really
looking for is,

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.320
remote control." Right?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.830
Again, our good friend
Uncle Sam.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.560
Now, there's also, of course,
cartoons that are

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.640
not funny at all.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.210
When I live the job of an
editorial cartoonist, I live

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.700
within two polarities.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.140
Editorial that is serious and
cartoonist that is funny.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.520
And every day when I approach my
cartoons, I put myself on a

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.580
different part of that spectrum
according to the

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.000
appropriateness of the
subject matter.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.070
And you guys all have to think
back to what it was like in

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:37.580
the United States after 2001 and
the bombings in New York.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.330
And any of you that've lived
abroad in countries where

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.330
they've had major terrorist
activity, is that there's not

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:45.640
a lot of humor to be found.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.860
At those times, you have
to resort to other of

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.030
your skill sets. .

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.080
This cartoon, for example, I
did a few days afterwards.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.976
And it's about terrorism.

00:13:55.976 --> 00:13:59.930
And it's about the beast of
terrorism that is both visible

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.790
and invisible.

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.330
A beast that you will not slay,
but one that must be

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.270
engaged just the same.

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:10.570
But eventually over time, humor
does find its way back

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:11.450
into the discussion.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:13.890
And actually, I think humor is
an important part of the

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.330
healing process.

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:18.360
And cartoonists often lead the
way as being some of the first

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.880
people to approach this
sort of thing.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.770
And here's a cartoon I wanted
to show you that tells you a

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.810
little bit of a story about
what happened after 9/11.

00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:31.040
And in fact, in four panels, it
tells the entire story of

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.940
the decade long Iraq war.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.640
So it starts off, we have Uncle
Sam, who thinks he sees

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.180
weapons of mass destruction.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.420
And he's going in.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.900
And once he's in there,
where do they go?

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.110
They weren't here.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.430
And oh no, it's worse
than I thought.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.740
And then finally, oh,
there they are.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:51.470
We finally found the weapons
of mass destruction.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.790
Maybe not exactly where
we thought they were.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.630
AUDIENCE: And you're mooning
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:55.850
KEVIN KALLAUGHER:
That's right.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.060
So here, what's interesting too
is that note, this employs

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.310
yet another tool for
the cartoonist.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.280
And that is narrative
storytelling.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.820
Most of the cartoons you've
seen up to now

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.160
had a single panel.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.170
This one went over
several panels.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.410
You're telling a story.

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.410
So being a cartoonist, you
also have to be a good

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.300
storyteller.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.840
You have to be not only good
with pictures, but you have to

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.700
be good with timing.

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.360
This, by the way, I just wanted
to show you, is what

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.270
Iraq looks like today.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.410
This is much more of where we
stand, where Iraq is trying to

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:30.320
set off after the US is pulling
its hands away.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.610
But it doesn't look like it's
going to move so steadily.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.360
I'll also add, for those of you
who've spent any time in

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.830
England, you may know
in England--

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.560
well here in the US we say, on
your marks, get set, go.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.570
In England, they say,
ready, steady, go.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:45.190
And hence, that's why this
is ready, steady.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.000
If this was done for "The
Baltimore Sun," it would've

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.150
said, on your marks, get set.

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.670
And then everyone would have
known what happened.

00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.650
So we also do cartoons on a
whole array of subjects that

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.610
are not necessarily specific to
individuals, where you have

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:02.930
caricature, or symbols like
Uncle Sam, but they could be a

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.100
much more grander process.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:07.940
This brings me around to the
point of saying that when

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:12.640
you're a cartoonist, the
world is our bailiwick.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.560
We have to cover everything.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.770
All the other writers and
columnists and newspapers,

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.000
they usually have certain
specific niches.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.260
As a cartoonist, I have to cover
everything, which means

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:26.790
keeping up with the news, which
is I think is the part

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:28.430
of the my job that's
the hardest for

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.160
me to keep up with.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.740
We have to do very sensitive
subjects

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.920
as well, like religion.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.160
OK.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:37.040
Here's a cartoon I wanted to
show you about religion.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.940
It's set up in heaven.

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:40.860
And it says, "Hello, Lord
Almighty's office.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.770
Michael be Archangel speaking.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.860
May I help you?"" And a voice
from offstage says, "Who is

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:51.146
it?" "It's Pope John Paul II
on the line." "Again?"

00:16:51.146 --> 00:16:54.580
"He's worried about this
movement to ordain women as

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.930
priests." "But I've already
told him what I think.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.510
Tell him I'm busy."
"I'm sorry.

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:00.840
She's

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.770
busy right now." [LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.030
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: So here, one
of the other elements of being

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.880
a cartoonist is you've got
to be a good writer.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.550
And here we have writing, and
timing, and panels all wrapped

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.210
into one, because we had the
lead to the words to the last

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.069
few seconds.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.730
Not giving away our hand.

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.770
And so having all of that--
and this is what it looked

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:21.460
like in the paper--

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:26.890
having all of that work out in
a nice continuum that made it

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:30.000
an effective joke.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.650
Now we also cover tough
subjects like guns.

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:32.950
All right.

00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:36.510
Now guns is a subject which
I've done many cartoons.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.150
This is the cover of "The
Economist" that I did the week

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.310
that Gabrielle Giffords got
shot down in Arizona.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.810
This is a very touchy subject.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.250
Every country and every
individual has

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.750
certain touchy subjects.

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.130
And here, of course, guns
is one of them.

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:51.285
So recently, I was in Beirut.

00:17:51.285 --> 00:17:54.140
And I was talking to a group
of Lebanese cartoonists,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.260
showing my cartoons.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:57.930
And one of the cartoonists was
aware of the amount of gun

00:17:57.930 --> 00:17:58.650
cartoons I did.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:03.020
And he says, you've got to tell
me, Kal, do you ever get

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:07.130
worried that people will get
very upset about these kinds

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:08.690
of toons and do something
about it?

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.740
Because after all, all those
guys that you're complaining

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.270
about guns, they've
all got guns.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.860
And I thought, well, I've
been lucky so far.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.430
I've had cartoonists colleagues
both here and

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:21.650
abroad who have been
threatened and

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.910
this sort of thing.

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.630
But it's not been such
an issue for me.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:27.600
But then another Lebanese
cartoonist perked up.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.900
And he said, you know,
here in Lebanon, it's

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.380
the exact same thing.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.560
Except everyone here has
got rocket launchers.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.820
So it made me feel an awful lot
better, that conversation.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.190
I didn't feel so under siege.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.320
Now this cartoon is one about
the financial world.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.450
This is my most popular
cartoon ever.

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:49.760
It's just a normal day at the
nation's most important

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:50.880
financial institution.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.250
So this little guy there on the
left, he's saying, "I've

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.980
got a stock here that could
really excel." "Really excel?"

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.310
"Excel?" "Sell?" "Sell?" "Sell!"
"Sell!" Sell!" "Sell!"

00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:59.630
"Sell!" "Sell!" "Sell!"

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:00.690
"This is madness.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.020
I can't take anymore.

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.165
Good bye." "Good bye?" "Bye?"
"Buy?" "Buy?" "Buy?" "Buy?"

00:19:05.165 --> 00:19:08.450
"Buy?" "I've got a stock here
that could really excel."

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.990
So anyway, so this cartoon
appears 1989.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.540
It appears "Baltimore Sun,"
"New York Times," "Herald

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.720
Tribune." Starts picked up
by other newspapers.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.400
And the next thing you know,
I'm getting phone calls.

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.000
Scores of phone calls
from stockbrokers.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.690
And they're saying two things.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.700
One, they want a copy
of this cartoon.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:34.220
And two, this is exactly
what its like.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.550
This is what they all say.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.690
And ever since then, on almost a
weekly basis, I get requests

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:43.890
to use this cartoon in books,
encyclopedias, on mugs.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.650
I had that request six months
ago from a stockbroker in Hong

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:50.650
Kong, where we took this
cartoon, they blew it up.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.470
We divided it and made it one
single line, 24 feet.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.530
And they put it in the
lobby of their place.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.650
So it's amazing.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.670
Some cartoons can really hit a
raw nerve if you get it right.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.535
And some cartoons, of course,
we're always about trying

00:20:05.535 --> 00:20:07.420
getting things down
to their simplest.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.480
But sometimes, keeping things
complex are also great ways to

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.130
tell the story.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:15.710
So this is about Obamacare,
navigating US health.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.790
Before Obamacare, this is
what it looks like.

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.590
And after Obamacare, this is
what it's going to look like.

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.830
.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:26.140
So it's a great way of telling
the story in pictures.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.770
So this is kind of what I
thought your relationship to

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.370
China is here, between
Google and China.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.820
There is nothing more
annoying on the web

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.790
than an unwanted pop-up.

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:38.110
And that's a Chinese dragon kind
of finding its way into

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.410
everything you do here.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:42.670
So anyways, for the outside
world, this is what we think

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:43.800
you guys at Google are like.

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.140
You don't have your shoes on.

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:46.700
You always got a hat on.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.480
And you're always just
tapping away.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.770
So hopefully I'm going
you learn something.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.010
So the cartoon I do on Google
will be a little bit more

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.490
representative.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.290
So always as cartoonists, we're
always ingesting as much

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.330
information as we can about the
subjects we're covering.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.740
Now I want to show you a quick
notice about how cartoons have

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.410
progressed over recent years.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:09.140
And this is a pre-internet
cartoon I

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.110
want to tell you about.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.710
So the story is this.

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.460
Mikhail Gorbachev is
now the new leader

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.320
of the Soviet Union.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.930
1986, I think.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:19.940
And I was working in
the UK at the time.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.630
And there was this brand new
show called "Miami Vice." You

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:23.980
guys know that?

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.050
Brand new in 1986.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.890
And I say, wouldn't it be cool
to get this new cool new style

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:34.140
leader and draw him as the guy
from "Miami Vice." And the

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.610
editors at "The Economist" said,
great, Kal, go for it.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:39.110
I had 24 hours to complete
the cover.

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:43.260
But the bad news was I got home
and I realized I had no

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:46.240
photos of "Miami Vice."

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.540
And in those days, if you didn't
have any photos, you

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:49.670
had no photos.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.270
There was no way to
get anything.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.410
And so I turned to my wife and
I said, well, what are we

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:55.880
going to do?

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.040
So we said, what do we do?

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.130
The typical thing,
we went shopping.

00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.770
We went out and bought
some clothes.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:07.650
And this is me modeling for
the actual cartoon.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:08.850
Of course, that's not my car.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.080
That's not really my car.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.650
But those are my clothes that
Mikhail Gorbachev is wearing

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:13.540
in the cartoon.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:14.720
So that was pre-internet.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.550
So here's a cartoon
post-internet.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.140
So the story of this
cartoon took place

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.760
about five years ago.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.520
I was on vacation in the Big
Horn Mountains of Wyoming,

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.060
Northeast Wyoming.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.190
And I made the mistake
of checking my email.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:35.130
There was a note from "The
Economist" saying, , Kal, you

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.470
left a sketch for us that we
really liked about the

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.430
over-consumption of
oil between the

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.550
United States and China.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:45.030
And would you please paint it.

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.470
We want to put it on the
cover this week.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.130
So I get back to them with a
note and say, guys, there's

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.370
three problems.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.900
First, I'm on vacation.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.520
Second, I don't have
any paints with me.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:59.910
And third, I'm in the
middle of nowhere.

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:00.150
Right?

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.450
So I figured that kind of
will settle the score.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.110
But then they get back to me and
say, Kal, see what you can

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.320
do and call us in the morning.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:07.920
So I'm going, oh man.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:08.210
All right.

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.030
So I'm at a dude range.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.200
And so, I go talk
to the dudes.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.210
I go, dudes, where can
I get some paints?

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:19.410
And they say, well, this
dirt road, 10 miles.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:19.910
Go down there.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:20.700
There's a pharmacy.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.610
In the back row of the pharmacy,
there's a lady.

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:24.120
She likes to paint.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.330
Go talk with her.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.460
Go find the lady.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.010
She gives me a little
kids' pack.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.376
You know the little six?

00:23:29.376 --> 00:23:30.810
Them round little things?

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:31.480
That's what I got.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.890
Little six pack of kid paints.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.830
One piece of watercolor paper.

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:36.760
And I go back to the kitchen
table of the dude

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.240
ranch, and I do this.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:40.300
And notice the primary
colors here.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.790
It's very basic colors
in this.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.060
And then I scan it on my
portable scanner laptop.

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:48.320
Email it, like dial-up.

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:50.400
Five hours later, it
arrives in London.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.800
But the key thing was that two
days later, being "The

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.930
Economist," this appeared in
every country around the world

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:58.650
from the mountains of Wyoming.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:00.960
And ever since then and actually
before, wherever I am

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.480
in the world, I'm always doing
my cartoons for "The

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.850
Economist." And it's
a very easy thing.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.440
Particularly compared to what
it was when I first started

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.800
with "The Economist."
It was 1978.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.110
I worked in UK.

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:16.270
I came back to Baltimore
to New York in the

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.560
United States in 1988.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.020
And the internet was just
in its early days.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:24.490
And I pioneered the use of
sending my cartoons to London

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:25.690
from Baltimore.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.210
But in those days, a 400K
file would take

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:29.850
three hours to send.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.070
And now, of course, we could be
anywhere in the world, and

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.510
I could send my cartoon.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:37.056
So a lot of people ask
me, all right, how

00:24:37.056 --> 00:24:38.410
do you do your cartoons?

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:38.660
All right.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.900
So one thing is that I'm
constantly trying to ingest as

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.490
much information as I can from
a whole variety of sources.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.690
TV, the Web mostly.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:51.090
Radios really great.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.030
And of course, you're reading
some magazines as well.

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:57.100
But keeping up is
really tough.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:01.600
So now, because I consider
myself a columnist, my first

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.120
job is being a journalist,
gathering the information.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:07.970
But now, I have to try to get an
angle on an information and

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.080
not find out what's funny today,
but find out what is

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.040
important today.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.250
And once I've got that, now I
have to take that idea and

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:18.160
turn it into a cartoon.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.390
And in the beginning, it's
awfully difficult.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.560
So what I do is I give
myself lots of paper.

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.080
I put it on my desk.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.870
And I think and draw
at the same time.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.720
And part of this about the
creativity, you try to fire

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.140
between the two halves of you
brain, the logical and the

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.905
creative, saying what is
interesting and what logically

00:25:36.905 --> 00:25:37.540
would work.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.070
But then, also what will be cool
and what will be funny.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.410
And I'm doing lots
of sketches.

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.380
And my first sketch is often
virtually hieroglyphic.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:47.340
In fact, let me show you one
of my early sketches for a

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.460
cartoon I did recently.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.733
Can you see that?

00:25:49.733 --> 00:25:50.640
AUDIENCE: It's a Frank
Gehry design.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.520
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: That's it.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:51.690
[LAUGHS]

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:52.830
It's a perfect--

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:55.680
you can see obviously what's
going on here.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.810
But this was, I was commissioned
to do a cover for

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.400
"The Economist" recently.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.770
And they wanted me to do
something about raising taxes

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.660
on rich people.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.810
So I started to conjure up what
would be a good idea.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.850
And I thought, how about
fox hunting?

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:12.520
That's the kind of thing that
rich people maybe do.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:14.710
But I thought I'd give it
a little bit of a twist.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:19.230
And instead of having fox
hunters chasing foxes, how

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.790
about if I have politicians
chasing rich people?

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.310
And so this was what my first
sketch looked like.

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:26.210
But the next sketch
is much clearer.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:27.250
There you go.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.840
OK But already, I'm beginning
to map out all the varieties

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:34.120
shapes and trying to conjure
up a composition.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.680
The next sketch that I do on
top of that is getting a

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.590
little bit clearer.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.860
You might be able to see some
of the characters appearing

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:43.410
down in the southeast
part of the drawing.

00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:46.910
And the next drawing still is
getting more and more clear.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.980
And at the same time while I'm
doing this in London, they are

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.150
playing around with the
captions, the titles of the

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:52.800
publication.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.260
And they're also working on
compositions as well.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:57.650
Someone might have something
like this. "Follow the Money."

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:02.180
Or "Pursue the Rich." I think
we have another one here.

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:07.380
Next, once we have settled on
the pencil sketch, I now am

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.430
working on the color, including
creating the

00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:11.190
caricatures that are
going to go in it.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.990
And here, you can see the
Barack Obama version.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:18.720
And finally, when I've painted
it all, it looks like this in

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.850
watercolor.

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:22.640
And it's quite large
this one, I think.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:25.790
And this whole process between
this, actually, the original

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.200
sketch that I showed you
and this finished color

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.630
cover, is 36 hours.

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.500
36 hours from that little
sketch and all those

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.450
iterations.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:38.220
So one of the things about being
in my craft is that you

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.370
have to love deadlines.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:41.610
Not everyone loves a deadline.

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:43.360
We live on a daily deadlines.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:46.640
I mean, we're creating art and
commentary on a deadline.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:50.270
In fact, I tell people never
go to the pub with a

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:53.720
cartoonist, because we will wait
'til one minute before

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.000
closing time before we offer
to buy you a drink.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.440
Because we just love
deadlines.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.860
It's just the way
that we operate.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.275
So now a little bit
onto technology.

00:28:03.275 --> 00:28:04.940
I wanted to tell you guys
a little bit about it.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.170
We're always concerned about
what's happening to

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.880
newspapers, because it's the
natural home of cartoonists.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:16.050
But my senior thesis at
University back in 1977 was a

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:20.350
13 minute long animated cartoon,
back in the old day,

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:23.920
when you had to hand draw cells
after cell after cell.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.950
And the first thing I want to
show you here is that I've

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.690
been an artist in residence at
UNBC, which is a university

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.610
near Baltimore.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:35.340
And I've been exploring some
cool stuff in animation.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.750
But I'm going to start
off with this--

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.540
there's going to be a 30 second
television commercial

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:39.840
I'm going to show you here.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.075
It aired in 1986.

00:28:41.075 --> 00:28:44.110
It won several international
animation awards.

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:47.550
It was done with the help of
Richard Williams, who's the

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.030
animation director for "Who
Framed Roger Rabbit" and won

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:52.390
several other awards.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:57.400
And it stars Margaret Thatcher
and Neil Kinnock, who was the

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.808
Labour-- at the time.

00:28:58.808 --> 00:28:59.776
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:59.776 --> 00:29:02.438
-Did you consider that some
newspapers treat politics with

00:29:02.438 --> 00:29:04.132
a trace of bias?

00:29:04.132 --> 00:29:06.120
One side always right.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.020
The other side, always wrong.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.940
Or the other way around.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.656
Today, we'll show all
politicians without bias-- not

00:29:17.656 --> 00:29:21.838
as saints or devils, but
ordinary people.

00:29:21.838 --> 00:29:22.330
-Hi-ya!

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:23.806
-Order!

00:29:23.806 --> 00:29:24.790
-Order!

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:26.040
-Oh!

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.480
-"Today" covers the newspaper,
not the news.

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.952
"Today," the newspaper that's
broken the mold.

00:29:34.952 --> 00:29:35.940
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.100
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: All right.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.600
Give it up for that cartoon.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.380
Isn't that awesome?

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.910
That is so cool.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:41.370
So that was really great.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:43.170
I get a kick out
of seeing that.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.190
I've seen it so many-- it's just
really beautifully done.

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.900
It's really funny.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.020
It's smart.

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.120
And so you see something like
this that excited me about the

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.700
prospect of saying, wouldn't
be great to make political

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:53.730
cartoons come alive?

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:54.980
Wouldn't that be awesome?

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:56.770
But in those days, it was a
problem, because this took

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.990
three months to make 700-some
odd drawings.

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:04.360
And the prospect of being able
to do something about news,

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:07.970
when news changes like this, but
animation was so slow, it

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.330
didn't seem possible.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.750
Today, of course, new
technologies are allowing more

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.820
prospects and more possibilities
for animation to

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:16.780
become King.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.290
And I'm extremely excited
about the possibilities.

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:21.540
I'm just going to share with
you just that one little

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.400
project that--

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.400
actually, a couple little
projects I did.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.350
Back in the 2008 election cycle,
I worked with Second

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:32.000
City, the improv comedy troupe,
and did a nationwide

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.710
show with them.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.740
But as part of it, I had built
a few life-size versions of

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.990
some of my caricatures,
including this one of George

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.660
Bush, and then turned them into
digital characters, like

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.730
a digital Hillary Clinton.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:48.110
And I did a John McCain.

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:52.020
And as part of the my show, I
would do a live bit, where I

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.030
call live animation, where I
would be backstage in motion

00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:00.220
capture suit with voice
recognition software on a mic.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:03.190
And my character, let's say John
McCain, would appear on

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.490
the screen in front
of an audience.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:07.030
We actually did a show at the
Yerba Buena Art Center here.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.800
Packed house.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.730
And we would have a live press
conference between the

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.730
audience and the cartoon
characters.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:16.830
But for the Yerba Buena show,
which was really fun, we

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:20.150
actually did a dance off between
Barack Obama and John

00:31:20.150 --> 00:31:23.250
McCain, whereby we would select
different dance styles

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.120
from the audience.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.400
And then I would have to dance
as these characters to music.

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.810
And then the audience would vote
to see who would get a

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.130
certain amount of
electoral votes.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:33.490
It was really kind of cool.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:36.890
The last shows we did were in
New York City in Times Square.

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:39.820
We had a debate, actually,
between these two guys.

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.780
And I would actually do a
personal interview with them

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:43.590
during the debate.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:45.660
In fact, I'm going to do one
right now with John McCain

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.700
here, Senator McCain.

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:49.380
You had Sarah Palin
as your candidate.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.630
Do you really believe that she
was qualified to be president?

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.482

00:31:53.482 --> 00:31:55.490
-Listen, my friends.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:59.830
Sarah Palin is qualified
to be president.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:06.240
She has ridden caribou to hunt
polar bears with bazookas.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:12.350
She has caught Chinook salmon
blindfolded with her teeth.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:17.304
No community organizer in
Chicago has ever done that.

00:32:17.304 --> 00:32:17.781
Right?

Thank you.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:20.230
Give it up for Senator McCain.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.120
Thank you very much, Senator.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.510
Thank you very much
for coming.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:23.660
That's really great.

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:26.750
So in addition to doing these
3D cartoons, I've also now

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.130
been doing some 2D stuff as
well, including two cartoons

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:31.010

a century later.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.360
Here, speculators, which
included a vast array of

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.890
citizens, including
parliamentarians and a king's

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:14.550
mistress drove up the share
price of the South Sea Trading

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.763
Company with disastrous
results.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.970
-There have been many others
since, including the dot-com

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.970
bubble in internet company
shares that burst in 2000.

[POP]

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:30.804
-And the bubble in house prices,
which when it burst in

00:33:30.804 --> 00:33:33.648
2007, helped to trigger
the recent

00:33:33.648 --> 00:33:34.596
political economic downturn.

[CRASH]

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:39.850
-Economists argued whether
bubbles are caused by the

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:43.690
irrational behavior of crowds,
aided in part by savvy

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:49.000
speculators, or are the result
of misinformed consumers who

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.560
assume the inflated prices
are sensible.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:57.830
Whatever their cause, bubbles do
not last forever, and often

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:02.734
end not with a pop,
but with a crash.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:06.230
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: There we go.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:07.910
All right.

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:08.889
We've got another
one coming here.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:10.810
One more to show you.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:19.810
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:23.560
-When the prices of goods and
services rise rapidly,

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.790
families and businesses
suffer.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:30.500
But on rare occasions,
when rising prices

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.909
skyrocket out of control--

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.639
[CRASH]

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:38.832
- --the result can be
catastrophic hyperinflation.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.159
Hyperinflation is generally
caused by reckless governments

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:49.380
who let their money supply
grow too fast.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:52.610
After the First World War,
German prices at one point

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:57.100
were rising at a rate
of 23,000% a year.

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.540
This caused the country's
economic system to collapse,

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:05.310
creating a political opportunity
for the Nazis.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:10.035
More recently, in the former
Yugoslavia, 1993 prices rose

00:35:10.035 --> 00:35:12.755
around 20% a day.

00:35:12.755 --> 00:35:18.380
Later in July, 2008, Zimbabwe's
official inflation

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:25.110
rate reached an astonishing
231 million percent.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:31.520
Typically, hyperinflation
quickly leads to a loss of

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.430
confidence in the country's
currency.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.750
With the value of their cash
diminishing, citizens pursue

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:42.060
stable items like gold and
foreign currency as safe

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.440
stores of wealth.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:43.880
-Yeah.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:44.320
All right.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:44.760
Uh-huh.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.510
-Hyperinflation might not be
so bad if it was stable.

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:52.644
People and businesses could plan
for the future accounting

00:35:52.644 --> 00:35:56.436
for high, but predictable
pricing.

00:35:56.436 --> 00:36:02.170
However, there are no examples
of stable hyperinflation.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:09.062
By its nature, hyperinflation
is an uncontrollable--

00:36:09.062 --> 00:36:09.559
[BOOM]

00:36:09.559 --> 00:36:12.368

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.820
-There we go.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:15.666
All right.

00:36:15.666 --> 00:36:16.658
Thank you.

00:36:16.658 --> 00:36:17.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:18.642
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Thank
you very much.

00:36:18.642 --> 00:36:19.140
Thank you.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:23.900
So in this case, cartoons, I
believe animated cartoons can

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.420
work as great educational tools
and informative tools,

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.520
in addition to being sources
of commentary.

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.370
So anyway, before I leave this
portion of the conversation, I

00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:35.740
wanted to say we do
other things too.

00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.500
I've done a bunch of
beer labels for

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:39.860
some brewery in Baltimore.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.940
That's kind of fun stuff.

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:45.860
Gives me a bit of a break away
from the normal hardcore stuff

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.460
of politics and stuff.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.810
And my new book, which you guys
have seen, which has been

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:51.530
a great process.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.740
This, by the way, was funded
through a Kickstarter

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:57.680
campaign, where we raised
$100,000, and so pre-sold

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:00.110
copies to 46 different
countries.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:02.250
So it was a great,
great success.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:05.200
And with that, we're now
on to the questions.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.200
Thank you very much.

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:07.565
Thank you, guys.

00:37:07.565 --> 00:37:09.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.950
KEVIN KALLAUGHER:
So you guys--

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.870
Hal, do you want to?

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.920
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about one of the first things

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.570
you said, which was that
the number of political

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:19.520
cartoonists in the US was
slightly declining.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.030
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Yes.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.370
AUDIENCE: So for other forms of
art, typically people like

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:24.360
us wouldn't be too concerned.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.160
We would think well,
technologies going to

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.280
democratize everything.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.030
There may not be as many
full-time cartoonists, but

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:31.530
anyone could be a
cartoonist now.

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:32.130
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: That's right.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:32.670
Sure.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:34.800
AUDIENCE: But it doesn't seem
like it's turned out that way.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.870
So why haven't we seen the
internet flourishing with

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.990
clever political cartoons
from amateurs?

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:44.040
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: That's a
really great question.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.670
So one of the things, first of
all, the cartoon skill set

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:51.990
that we discussed a lot here is
also one that's not easily

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:53.270
transferable.

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:58.190
It's really finely tuned, highly
refined skill set.

00:37:58.190 --> 00:38:01.550
Some of it is built for the
print, cross-hatching, and

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:03.090
lines, and black ink.

00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:06.510
But some of it about the
concepts and the notion that

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:10.040
you have to really be a great
study of politics is something

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.700
that is very specific.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:14.390
In some ways, we're kind of like
decathlon athletes, where

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:16.520
we're juggling an awful
lot of things.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:20.230
And those kind of skill sets
aren't often found in any

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.960
individual.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.830
So I even think that if you
open it up for the general

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:24.890
public, there still would be
just very few people who would

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.810
qualify for that, or maybe
be able to assert that.

00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:31.430
But then there's a second part
is, is that true, the

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:35.390
cartoonists, they may have
this new field, new wide

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:37.840
audience, and maybe even
find niche audiences.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.350
But as we're finding, trying
to make money on the web in

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:43.080
many of these endeavors
has been tricky.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.330
But I still remain incredibly
hopeful that there's going to

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:47.460
be new possibilities.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.660
And I think that we're already
beginning to see this a little

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.430
bit in our cartoon world.

00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:54.300
But I'm also seeing that the
young people, anybody under

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.020
the age of, say, 25, who
didn't grow up reading

00:38:57.020 --> 00:39:00.340
newspapers, that the cartoons
like the ones I produce are

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.470
not magical to them in the
same way it was for my

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:04.320
generation.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.660
What's magic to them is
animation, or the things that

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.780
they've seen both on the web,
but also on television.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:13.950
And they might gravitate
in that area.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.210
We're also seeing lots of
individuals who are able to

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:20.170
express their views on lots
of different outlets.

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.190
And so maybe there's a--

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:25.360
for a long time, when you had
only a very few newspapers,

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.300
and only a handful of letters to
the editor that could ever

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.400
get into a newspaper, that the
cartoonist often spoke for the

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.970
volumes of other people who
felt misrepresented.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:36.380
And they really loved what
a cartoon could do.

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.650
And so now maybe other
people are speaking,

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:39.830
taking those voices.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.830
But I feel confident that the
history of mankind trying to

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:46.760
express itself in pictures is
something that's gone back to

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.080
the days of cave painting
And that with the new

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.420
opportunities and possibilities,
people will

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.300
find ways to make that work.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:57.030
And so I feel encouraged,
even though the official

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.740
professionals as we define
them are shrinking now.

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.890
It'll probably get
worse before it

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:01.920
gets better, I believe.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.960
But I do believe strongly
that it will get better.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.050
I curious about memes and this
idea that photo illustration

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:09.240
has become the cheap
trick for that.

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.720
But here's inspiration.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.630
But on a more serious note,
the other trend you were

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:16.420
talking on these last two
cartoons is that you're doing

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.230
things that are less opinion
and more factual or

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:19.820
training-oriented.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:21.960
What came to mind as we were
watching the bread rocket

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.040
through the sky was Salman Khan
and the Khan Academy and

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.560
the kinds of whiteboard
chalk talks, or so on.

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.490
And that linked to another one,
which is that, where is

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:30.690
the room perhaps--

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:33.740
clearly, the best art here has
been where opinion, or taking

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:35.241
aspects of someone's character,
or you're doing

00:40:35.241 --> 00:40:36.320
something subjective.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:38.610
But where might there be room
for objectivity in terms of

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.950
trying to tell a stories as
facts and possibly data

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:41.690
visualization.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:43.240
Because we're saying an
incredible amount of

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.655
innovation and budget moving,
say from editorial cartooning

00:40:45.655 --> 00:40:46.680
to editorial data.

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.120
You've probably seen that in
"The Guardian" amongst other

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.160
institutions.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.070
And where might there be
opportunities in your own work

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:54.530
to try and work more with data
without turning into "US

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:56.350
Today" cartoon sharks.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:57.176
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Yeah.

00:40:57.176 --> 00:40:58.930
No, I think that there
is going to be more

00:40:58.930 --> 00:40:59.970
opportunity with that.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:03.030
And of course, the thing is that
when you have animation,

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.660
it gets a little bit
more expensive.

00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.720
But the animation software
is getting faster.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.230
And then there's also
different--

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.235
I told you before that I'm
a storyteller, basically.

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:14.180
And I'm using narrative, I'm
using pictures, and so on.

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:16.940
And there's more kind of
storytelling software that's

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.730
becoming available, that we're
going to see different kinds

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.820
of cartoons, I think, that
are going to be easier to

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:25.660
assemble, and then become more
relevant on the web.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.880
But I think then, at the end
of the day, whether you're

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.170
working for Pixar, or you're
working as a cartoonist, you

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.900
can have all the great
technology behind you, it's

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.310
your storytelling.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:38.840
The capability of storytelling
the brings value to

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.860
that sort of thing.

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:43.020
And so as a result, one of
things that cartoonists tend

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.400
to have, that's where
they are wired best.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:46.970
They're best at storytelling.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:49.310
HAL BAILEY: Speaking of
storytelling and technology,

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.400
can you tell us a little bit
about your app, DaggersDrawn.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.020
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:53.440
That's right.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:53.800
That's right.

00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.170
In fact, I have Apurva
Shah, who helped

00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:58.890
design the app for me.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.330
And actually, I'm going
to ask you maybe.

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:02.550
We'll get the mic over here.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:06.330
I have a new app they just
got launched, just

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:08.490
about a week ago.

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:10.470
DaggersDrawn.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:11.180
It's called DaggersDrawn.

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.260
But there's a problem with it
that's it's not available on a

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:15.930
really great platform.

00:42:15.930 --> 00:42:18.500
Do you want to pass
the mic over here?

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.445
You want to to a little
bit about it?

00:42:19.445 --> 00:42:20.810
I'm sorry about that.

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.492
AUDIENCE: What platform
would that be?

00:42:22.492 --> 00:42:24.700
KEVIN KALLAUGHER:
That's right.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:25.600
APURVA SHAH: Hi.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.590
Great to see everyone here.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:29.720
Right now, it's an iOS app.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:33.060
Hopefully, we'll do an
Android version soon.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.380
But it's built with the
company I founded.

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.210
It's called Whamix.

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:37.970
It's a story-telling
platform, actually.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:42.080
And we took Kal's book, which is
beautiful, has these great

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.510
illustrations.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:47.190
And rather than having just an
eReader experience, create a

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:48.480
complement to the book.

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:52.260
So it has a lot of video
footage from him.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:57.090
He provides insight on the
cartoons, and some of economic

00:42:57.090 --> 00:42:59.090
terms that you saw as well.

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:02.140
And it tries to create an
experience where you can be

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.480
more interactive with it.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.760
So please check it out.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.480
AUDIENCE: So my question was,
has any politician ever

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:11.600
accosted you because of your
caricature of them?

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.210
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Right.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:15.850
Well, really interesting about
this, because obviously, in

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:19.350
many parts of the world, the
defining characteristic of

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:20.810
freedom of expression
is whether you can

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:24.140
draw the head of state.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.040
But because you can draw the
head of state, that doesn't

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.320
mean they necessarily like it.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.230
But a smart politician like
Ronald Reagan would have the

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:35.670
cartoonist come to the White
House and would enjoy having

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:37.710
his face drawn by everybody
around him.

00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:41.240
But ever since then, because
they're wanting to control the

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.860
message, every major politician
tries to keep

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.520
cartoonists at a distance.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.930
So most of the time where you
have, in the US, real impact

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:52.750
with politicians is in the local
area, whether you're

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:55.480
with governors or with mayors
and that sort of thing.

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:58.860
And I had my own personal
experience with the governor

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.730
of Maryland named William Donald
Schaefer, who used to

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:04.310
carry my cartoons around
in his pocket.

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:08.370
And at every press conference,
make comments

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.470
about what I did.

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:13.370
And there was a point where,
right before he left office,

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:14.250
he wrote me a letter.

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:16.440
And he wrote many letters, many
of them which I could not

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:21.590
even say in front of a mature
audience, even.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:26.750
And he said, dear Kal, please
send me the cartoon that

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.660
appeared in "The Baltimore
Sun," dated so and so.

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.540
And this is after seven years
of him going nuts about me.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.650
That's public enemy
number one.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.650
It was great.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:39.530
But I read on.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.930
As you want money for these
depressing monstrosities, I

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.130
herein attach the value that
I've put upon your cartoons.

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:48.330
And he taped a penny to the
letter and wrote "Overpaid" on

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:49.960
the top of it.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.800
So now, this letter is like a
diploma hanging in my office.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:56.690
And so you do get these
kind of interactions.

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:58.610
But the other thing is that
"The Economist" is read by

00:44:58.610 --> 00:44:59.100
Presidents.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:03.100
I mean, we have pictures with
them having the magazine

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:03.620
walking in.

00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:06.510
So you know they're
reading your work.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:07.720
But you'll never hear
from them direct.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.160
You hear through
their proxies.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.810
And there's some politicians who
hate everything you draw,

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:15.020
and other ones who love
everything you draw.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.960
Steve Forbes, who ran for
president a few years ago,

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.040
when he dropped out, he
contacted every cartoonist

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.450
around the country and got every
single cartoon drawn of

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:25.110
him for his library.

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:28.250
So it's funny how
people respond.

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:30.970
AUDIENCE: When I look at your
cartoons, like we call them,

00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:34.500
the longer I look at them, the
more detail I see in them.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.680
And every detail has
meaning to it.

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:40.560
It's like, seven layers of
meaning to a single picture.

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.390
It's amazing how you
can do that.

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:45.070
How long does it take to
draw a caricature?

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:47.040
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Thank you very
much for that question.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.200
My cartoons, the black and white
ones you see, it's a

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.220
full day process.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.280
And I have to be very
efficient here.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.330
You have a very hard deadline
at the end.

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.530
And when you're finished, you
want to deliver something that

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:00.690
has all those layers
to it, if you like.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.830
Partly, I do it as an
honor to my reader.

00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:07.260
I feel that if you feel like
I'm investing in you, then

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.490
you're going to reward me by
spending two or three more

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:10.700
seconds with the cartoon.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.680
And then it gives you the
opportunity to create a

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:14.790
relationship over time.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:17.980
In fact, I like to say every
cartoon is a sentence.

00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.030
And a week is a paragraph.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:22.750
And then over time, we're having
a long conversation

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.660
that we have to carry on
for decades, hopefully.

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:28.900
And the idea, however, is that,
for any conversation, is

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.780
you want to keep
it interesting.

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.400
And the way to keep it
interesting is you want to

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.790
have variety in it.

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:35.390
Some of my cartoons
are serious,

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:36.520
some of them are funny.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.100
Some of them have caricatures.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.630
Some have symbols in them.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.845
I've used all these different
tools in order to keep it, so

00:46:41.845 --> 00:46:43.870
every time you open the cartoon,
the newspaper, the

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.200
magazine, you don't know what
you're going to get.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.870
So I start the day, usually say,
up 'til 10 or 11 o'clock

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:52.560
cogitating the news.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.780
Now, of course, I'm constantly
cogitating the news.

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:56.690
Constantly ingesting
information.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.100
Listening and trying to
come up with ideas.

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.320
And I never come up with
ideas ahead of time.

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.720
You're always working on that
day, because there's always

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.280
news that changing
and breaking.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.220
I don't have anything
in reserve.

00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:09.810
And so by about midday,
I should have

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.300
settled down on my idea.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:15.090
I spent three hours then doing
the pencil sketch, refining

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:17.840
like I did with that cover you
saw, getting everything right.

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:20.220
I then let the editors
know, here's what the

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.070
I'm thinking of doing.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:22.550
We get it signed off on.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:25.080
And then it takes me three
hours to apply

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:26.730
the ink to the drawing.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.770
I'm using an old-fashioned quill
pen and a bottle of ink.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.330
Scratch, scratch, scratch.

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:31.640
Think.

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.420
Scratch, scratch, scratch.

00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:33.600
Headphones on.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.980
It's a wonderful experience.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:41.600
And then maybe by 6 o'clock,
7 o'clock, I might have the

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.150
thing completed.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.830
So, it takes that long.

00:47:42.830 --> 00:47:45.220
And then, you add color to
it, it can be longer.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.120
But all this experience is is
that every cartoon you do is a

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.100
practice for the next cartoon
you're going to do.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.300
Because when you work
on a deadline, you

00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:56.000
never finish the cartoon.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.230
You have to stop it.

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:00.080
If you wanted to finish, you'd
need another five, or six, or

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.300
seven hours to get it the
way you want it to.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.360
But you have to stop.

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.770
And at that point, you
learn the lessons.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:07.740
And then you apply them
to the next one.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.140
And it's part of the reason what
I love about my craft, is

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.560
that I feel that a decade from
now, two years from now, I'll

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.350
be better than I am today,
because you're constantly

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:17.750
learning and building
on your experiences.

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:21.370
AUDIENCE: I remember the cartoon
you did for 9/11.

00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:25.780
And I also remember the
controversy over the headline

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.740
that "The Onion" printed in the
same time period, which

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:32.310
was perhaps very insightful,
but also quite irreverent.

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:34.860
And I was just wondering, there
is an irreverence that

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.500
you draw with about
political leaders.

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.580
And I'm just trying to figure
out the line that you draw in

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:42.280
terms of what subject matter for
education, versus subject

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:44.105
matter for satire, versus
subject matter for

00:48:44.105 --> 00:48:44.810
irreverence.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:45.335
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Yeah.

00:48:45.335 --> 00:48:47.220
That's such a great question,
because this is

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:49.345
thing about the line.

00:48:49.345 --> 00:48:52.180
First of all, I've travelled
the world representing the

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.150
United States and the State
Department, speaking of

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:57.240
freedom of expression in a
whole array of countries.

00:48:57.240 --> 00:49:00.090
And that question is asked
to me all the time.

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:04.100
And as I reflect, I realize
that I ask myself that

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:05.420
question every day.

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:07.900
Whenever I'm doing a cartoon,
you're assessing who your

00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.670
audience is.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:13.750
How are you going to try to be
able sometimes push the line

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:16.250
on the cartoon, or get a
point across without

00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:17.510
going over the line?

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:20.640
And one of the things is that
the line is constantly moving.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.430
And where it was yesterday
is not going to

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:24.190
be where it is today.

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.300
In every country, every culture,
they've all got

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.730
different places.

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.470
And when our cartoonists get
together, we're in that

00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:31.135
situation too.

00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:33.460
And we've had situations where
almost all of us have gone

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:36.670
over the line, either
deliberately or by

00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:38.820
mistake over time.

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.410
And so, it is something that
you have to be very, very

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.890
careful with.

00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:46.000
Now part of the thing about my
work is that my cartoons are

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:47.270
very detailed.

00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:51.310
And so one of the things that
I definitely try to do with

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:55.420
all the freedom that I have
is to be very responsible.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.530
So I want to make sure I'm not
doing cartoons that could be

00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:00.660
deemed to be racist or sexist.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.670
I feel that I can cover any
subject that I want, but it's

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:05.760
how you cover the subject
inevitably that

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.370
gets you into trouble.

00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:10.290
And so even if I wanted to do
something about the Prophet

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:13.590
Muhammad, I could probably do
a cartoon on that subject.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:16.910
But maybe opt now to draw the
Prophet, because I know that

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:19.470
the outrage that it would create
and people would lose

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:21.700
track of the point that
I wanted to make.

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.320
Because at the end of the day,
I want to be an effective

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.540
commentator.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.890
I want to get a point across.

00:50:26.890 --> 00:50:28.820
And I want to engage
the opposition.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.930
I don't want to be speaking
to the converted.

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.050
And so in order to do that, you
have to realize that you

00:50:34.050 --> 00:50:36.600
can't step so much on the toes
of those people you disagree

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.100
with that they stop listening.

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.110
Otherwise, what's the point?

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:43.020
Because at the end of the day,
I feel like we're kind of an

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:44.440
instrument of democracy.

00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:47.460
We're trying to get a
conversation going using these

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:50.980
little pricks, these little
incitements, I guess, where

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:54.240
cartoon get do to the brain
firing a little bit.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.140
But having said that, there's
always somebody ticked off

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:58.430
with your cartoons.

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:00.850
So when I worked in the UK, I
worked in addition to "The

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.580
Economist" from other
newspapers.

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.470
In the UK, you have a situation
where you have about

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:07.880
a dozen daily newspapers, and
each one is targeted to a

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.990
special socioeconomic
demographic.

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:14.300
Down market, left wing, up
market, right wing, and

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.130
everything in between.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:19.120
Here in the US, we have one
newspaper per market usually.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:22.740
And which means it's read by
everybody in all the different

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:23.570
demographics.

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.430
So every cartoon you do is
ticking somebody off.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:29.030
And believe me, they
let you know.

00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:32.980
About 85% of my contact with
the public is negative,

00:51:32.980 --> 00:51:34.730
because we deal with ridicule.

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.010
We're making fun of people.

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:37.380
We're making fun of
the point of view.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.000
And they get upset, and
they let us know.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.020
And so as a result,
you can't help it.

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:46.270
But the question is, is are you
still being fair within

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:47.370
that realm?

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:48.470
And it's a tricky area.

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:51.840
But believe me, we're thinking
about this all the time.

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.750
Then add the fact that our
audience is now global.

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:56.610
I can do a cartoon here.

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:59.790
And then, it could be
willfully misread or

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:02.230
misrepresented in
another culture.

00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:04.260
And then, you could have
all sorts of problems.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.750
So it's a really interesting
time.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:11.160
Seriously, interesting time to
be doing what we're doing.

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:15.040
AUDIENCE: Did that problem start
after the internet, or

00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:18.800
was it there before when "The
Economist" was just in print?

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.790
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Well,
yes. "The Economist"--

00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:22.985
because in some ways, if you
imagine, "The Economist" was

00:52:22.985 --> 00:52:25.690
like the internet before,
because it was one of the only

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:28.680
global publications.

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.420
And so it was read everywhere.

00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:32.500
And yeah, we would have
situations where, for example,

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.645
I did a cartoon of
Indira Gandhi.

00:52:34.645 --> 00:52:35.900
It appeared on the cover.

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.070
It arrives in India.

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:37.710
They see it.

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:38.310
Don't like it.

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:42.120
They confiscate it and burn all
the copies immediately.

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:46.140
In Singapore, even to today,
they'll go in and they will

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:48.110
cut out articles.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:51.500
There was a time, I think it
was Singapore, where every

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:54.990
night, every single individual
magazine that went in would be

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:56.590
individually censored.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.060
This article would
be blacked out.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:00.090
This picture would be cut out.

00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:02.260
And there's still some
countries where

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:03.370
that happens today.

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:06.430
And also, even "The Economist"
will do a cover.

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:07.840
Now some of "The Economist"
covers can be

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:08.770
a little bit edgy.

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:11.840
And it will be well-understood
in certain parts of the world,

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.410
and not understood at all in
other parts of the world.

00:53:14.410 --> 00:53:16.630
And you can also imagine too
that now with "The Economist,"

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:20.250
we get comments online.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:24.860
If we some sort of major article
about China, Russia,

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:29.000
Iran, and I think there may be
one other country, they have a

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:34.185
legion of government-paid trolls
who just go out there

00:53:34.185 --> 00:53:39.120
and bombard you with all of
their opinions and so on.

00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:43.415
So you're going to get reaction
when you're global

00:53:43.415 --> 00:53:45.480
with anything, I guess.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.370
Well, good.

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:48.095
How about some drawing?

00:53:48.095 --> 00:53:49.730
Now we get to do
some fun stuff.

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:52.070
I'm going to do some drawing
here for you guys.

00:53:52.070 --> 00:53:54.250
And I'll be around too if
anybody has questions

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:55.370
afterwards.

00:53:55.370 --> 00:54:00.440
And I'll also be happy to
sign your books there.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:00.780
OK.

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:05.000
So let me find my
fabulous tool.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.650
My magic machine.

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:09.100
The ink machine that
I've got here.

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.840
So I'm going to draw
some of these guys.

00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:14.450
And I've drawn these guys
thousands of times.

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:16.250
So I can draw them
fairly quickly.

00:54:16.250 --> 00:54:17.480
And as I told you before,
these things

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:18.560
take me a long time.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:21.220
And I couldn't, for
example, draw my

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:23.860
own father from memory.

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:27.260
And it's because I haven't
drawn him many times.

00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:30.310
When you draw somebody, it
registers in a different part

00:54:30.310 --> 00:54:32.280
of the brain, because you've
had the opportunity to

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.560
evaluate their face,
break it down,

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.280
work it into an equation.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.340
So actually, these guys I can
do quickly, but it's only

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.160
because I've done them
a thousand times.

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.850
And I'm going to start
with Al Gore.

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:44.310
He's one of my favorite guys.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:47.040
Because he invented the
internet, for example.

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:50.190
And he's a guy who collects
cartoons.

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:52.280
And I've seen him up
close a few times.

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.710
And so I can tell you the
shape of his head or

00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:56.740
something like that.

00:54:56.740 --> 00:54:57.000
OK?

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.390
So that's kind of Al
Gore right there.

00:54:59.390 --> 00:54:59.746
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:59.746 --> 00:55:00.846
Island Al Gore.

00:55:00.846 --> 00:55:01.620
KEVIN KALLAUGHER:
That's right.

00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:02.240
That's right.

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.930
And so, Al Gore.

00:55:03.930 --> 00:55:07.540
He's got Ronald Reagan kind
of hair that kind

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:09.770
of goes like this.

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:13.163
He's got ears from
"Star Trek." They

00:55:13.163 --> 00:55:15.670
kind of go like this.

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:18.570
He's got nose, a straight,
bony nose.

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:20.880
Flared nostrils like this.

00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.030
Kind of goes like this.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:23.660
He's got a little Elvis mouth.

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:25.090
Kind of go like this--

00:55:25.090 --> 00:55:26.500
likes this.

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:30.210
And already, you can start to
see him appear from here.

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:31.570
So anyway, here's the
thing about Al Gore.

00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:34.440
Like I said, I've seen
him up close.

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:40.380
And many people think that he
lost the 2000 election in

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:42.530
Florida because of a
few hundred votes.

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:46.330
And I'm telling people that is
not the reason why he lost.

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:50.540
Al Gore lost the election in
Florida because Al Gore has

00:55:50.540 --> 00:55:52.720
got the eyes of death.

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.190
The eyes of death.

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:55.670
That's what he looks
like, really.

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:59.610
If you see him up close, that's
kind of where he is.

00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:01.040
Seriously.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:01.390
OK.

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.980
Poor Al.

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:02.370
Poor Al.

00:56:02.370 --> 00:56:02.760
All right.

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:03.870
Who would like this?

00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:05.250
Anybody want this?

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:05.890
Who wants the drawing?

00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:06.900
Here you go.

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:08.220
All right.

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:08.900
OK.

00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:09.250
All right.

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:12.270
So the next one we'll do is--

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:14.490
oh, I'll keep on the
Democratic theme.

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:17.470
We'll do John Kerry.

00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:19.882
So John Kerry's got the long
face thing I was telling you

00:56:19.882 --> 00:56:20.620
guys about.

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:23.590
So he's got kind
of a long face.

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:24.270
He's got a long face.

00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:26.980
He's got a long face.

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:31.570
He has got a really long face.

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:36.810
And you know, I'm thinking
maybe that's not right.

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:37.860
Let's try this.

00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:39.470
OK.

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.970
All right.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:40.300
OK.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:42.250
So this is better here.

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:42.720
All right.

00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:44.220
So this goes like this.

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:47.100
And then he's got here, and
his nose is like this.

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:48.770
And then his eye
goes like this.

00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:53.030
And he's got the hair, the
Brillo pad hair that kind of

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:54.280
goes like this.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.070
And his ears kind
of go like this.

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:57.430
And then this connects
down like this.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:58.540
And there's a line here
and a line here.

00:56:58.540 --> 00:56:58.840
What do you think?

00:56:58.840 --> 00:56:59.380
John Kerry.

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:00.120
What do you think?

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.230
Not bad.

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:01.990
Not bad.

00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.800
Not bad.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:02.860
All right.

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:06.790
Who wants a long cartoon
for their office?

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:07.715
Who wants it?

00:57:07.715 --> 00:57:08.390
Anyone?

00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:09.210
Put your hands up.

00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:09.740
Who wants it?

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:10.120
Right there.

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:10.950
OK.

00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:13.080
Actually, you'll get
the next one.

00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:14.250
You'll get the next one.

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:15.700
All right.

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.660
All right.

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:20.570
John Kerry, Al Gore.

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:21.930
Bill Clinton.

00:57:21.930 --> 00:57:23.920
Let's do Bill Clinton.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.700
All right, so here's
the thing--

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:25.780
[LAUGHS].

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.520
So here's the thing.

00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.480
I am a method cartoonist.

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.060
You guys have heard of
method actors, right?

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:34.250
Method actors, they get into
the part and the character.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.200
Well, I get it to my cartoons.

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.900
And my wife, she was at
a studio with me.

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:43.780
She goes crazy because I start
talking like George Bush or

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:44.850
Ross Perot.

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:47.270
And so all these people.

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:49.580
But anyway, so Bill Clinton
is a great person.

00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:50.620
You have get into his head.

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:52.940
Although inside his head,
believe me, there's a lot of

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:54.590
crazy stuff going
inside there.

00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:58.270
So I'm getting into him, and
I start talking like him.

00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:01.390
And Bill Clinton, he's got this
kind of pug nose like

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:06.880
this, and little teeth that
look like a bunny rabbit,

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:08.550
sticking like this.

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:10.420
And he's got a cheek.

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:11.480
Little cheeks here.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.450
And he's got eyes.

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:14.990
And he's got lots of bags.

00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.820
Have you noticed recently?

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:16.300
Poor guys.

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.550
Lots of bags.

00:58:17.550 --> 00:58:19.970
Which is a problem, because he
travels so much, and they

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.600
charge for every extra bag.

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:22.540
It's terrible.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:22.990
It's bad.

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:24.020
Really bad.

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:25.270
Poor guy.

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.440
OK.

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:31.340
And his hair's very white now.

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:34.900
I tried, and never did that
thing I told everybody about.

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.020
And his chin, he's kind
of a big Bill

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:39.710
Clinton chin like this.

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:41.230
And his thick neck, and
something like that.

00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.810
What do you guys think?

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:42.700
Is that Bill Clinton?

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:43.640
Not bad.

00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.170
Not bad.

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.450
All right.

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:49.700
Somebody had his hand up way
back there really early.

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:50.450
So, yeah.

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:51.030
So there you go, mate.

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:52.250
There you go.

00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:53.760
Bill Clinton.

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.450
Bill Clinton.

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:55.450
All right.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:55.630
All right.

00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:56.010
Bill Clinton.

00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:57.240
All right.

00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:01.760
So let's try George
H. W. Bush.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.370
Now I'm going to do him twice.

00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:05.350
I'm going to do him first what
he looked like when he first

00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:06.700
came into office.

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.160
And here's the thing.

00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:10.330
When somebody first comes into
office, the caricatures of

00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:12.700
them look like the
photographs.

00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.080
They actually are
close to that.

00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:17.760
But in time, the cartoonist and
you, the cartoon-consuming

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:21.190
audience, gets to know the face
so well, and we can start

00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:22.650
pulling apart.

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:25.690
And then at the end of four
years, the caricatures and the

00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:27.420
photographs don't look
anything alike.

00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.380
You put them next to each
other, but everyone

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:29.950
knows who it is.

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:32.970
So let me what he looked when he
started, and then I'll show

00:59:32.970 --> 00:59:35.500
you what he looked like
after four years. .

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.840
So when he started, this
is the profile.

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.840
This at the top of his head
here and his hair.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.950
And this is the back
of his head.

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:45.870
Hair going down here.

00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:47.610
Nothing sensational here.

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:49.850
He had a pretty big forehead.

00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:53.110
He had a nose that was kind of
a little bit sharp like this.

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:54.290
Eyes went down like this.

00:59:54.290 --> 00:59:55.580
Crow's feet coming out here.

00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:58.130
Few lines going up.

00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:00.560
He had an upper mouth
that went like this.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.990
He had these little
grizzly teeth--

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.912
[LAUGHS]--

01:00:02.912 --> 01:00:04.520
that went like this.

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.647
And then he had a chin that was
kind of like his son, like

01:00:06.647 --> 01:00:08.910
W's, like this.

01:00:08.910 --> 01:00:10.190
Line went like this.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:11.850
His ear out the back here.

01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:13.200
Little echo there.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.550
And the glasses, which he
called the vision thing.

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:17.500
The vision thing was
here like this.

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.790
And he had a little kind of
scrawny neck like this.

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:21.320
So anyways, the thing
was, he looked like

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.270
an insurance salesman.

01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:24.170
Like any insurance salesmen.

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:28.450
That was George H.W. Bush
at the beginning.

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:31.140
So let's see where he ended up.

01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:31.410
All right.

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:32.320
Who wants this one?

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:33.440
Yes.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.850
Here you go.

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:38.990
Let's see where he goes
at this end of this.

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:44.870
So at the end of four years,
the hair at the top.

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:48.090
A little bit thinner, but not
much difference there.

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:51.360
But the head shape turns in
kind of to a light bulb.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:52.500
OK?

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.230
Kind of a light bulb
like this.

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:56.505
His ears now sticking out the
back of his head here.

01:00:56.505 --> 01:00:59.300
The back of his hair
is going like this.

01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:02.910
His nose is like a sharp
knife like this.

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:04.840
His eye is going all the
way down like this.

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:07.730
The lines are going way up
the forehead like this.

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.402
His upper mouth is
like a beak.

01:01:09.402 --> 01:01:12.700
Little grizzly teeth down
here like this.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:17.150
And then his chin's going
way out like this.

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:18.280
Like this.

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.720
And then his glasses are perched
way out at the end of

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:21.990
his nose like this.

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:24.850
And his neck has even gotten
smaller, and skinnier, and

01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:26.370
scrawnier down there.

01:01:26.370 --> 01:01:28.300
And that's what he looked like
at the end of four years.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.010
Isn't that something?

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:30.130
It's crazy.

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:30.780
Crazy.

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.350
But it looked like
him, doesn't it?

01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:32.850
There we go.

01:01:32.850 --> 01:01:33.460
Who wants this one now?

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.182
Who wants this one?

01:01:35.182 --> 01:01:35.920
Who wants it?

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.340
Who wants it?

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:36.770
There you go.

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:37.300
There you go.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:39.260
OK.

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:40.330
All right.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.250
Here you go.

01:01:41.250 --> 01:01:41.800
Excellent.

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.470
Excellent.

01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:43.740
George H. W. Bush.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:43.850
All right.

01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:46.640
Now George W. Bush.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.440
W. Bush.

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.330
All right.

01:01:49.330 --> 01:01:49.500
All right.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.640
So now, George W. Bush
has got some ears.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.240
So it means making these sort
of things is a bit tricky,

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:58.520
because usually, I need like
this much room for the ear

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:01.130
here, and this much
for an ear here.

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:03.270
So I'm going to draw his ears
first, just to make sure that

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:06.150
we have room on the paper.

01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:09.360
And I'm going to draw
it like this.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.620
Now when I've drawn George Bush,
here's the thing that I

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.400
learned is that I--

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.240
the State of the Union Address,
it's always really

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:18.770
good to see these politicians
live, not just look at photos.

01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:21.640
So I record the State
of the Union Address

01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:23.320
and watch it twice.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.010
I'm the only person
who watches the

01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:26.660
bloody thing twice.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.720
Because I'm watching their
faces and seeing all the

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.550
various different things.

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:33.290
And one thing about him is
I recognize his nose was

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:35.370
something that was very
distinctive to him.

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:37.280
Most people didn't
pick that up.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.375
He had nice little nose with
big flared nostrils.

01:02:40.375 --> 01:02:43.230
And a set of parentheses here.

01:02:43.230 --> 01:02:45.730
The mouth kind of goes down
like this and up on

01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:48.300
one side like that.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.590
And his teeth are
here like this.

01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:55.540
Then he's got a chin, which is
a W, which kind of helps.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.520
That's really good for
us cartoonists,

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.950
just in case we forgot.

01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:59.935
All right.

01:02:59.935 --> 01:03:01.710
Then we got the line
here that kind of

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.800
connects down like this.

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:05.785
And then his eyes.

01:03:05.785 --> 01:03:07.952
He's got these little
teeny eyes.

01:03:07.952 --> 01:03:10.330
Little teeny eyes like this.

01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:11.640
OK.

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:13.200
And then we got the eyes.

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:16.480
The heavy brow kind of going
like this, and teeth here.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.840
And then, this one
way up here.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:21.420
He doesn't know what he's doing
up there, this guy.

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:22.780
Like this, OK.

01:03:22.780 --> 01:03:24.420
And then we've got
these lines.

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.730
They have a scientific name.

01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:27.650
They're called perplexoids.

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:30.000
He's got a lots of
perplexoids.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.870
And his hair kind of
goes like this.

01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:35.590
Come down the side like this.

01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:37.130
And George W. Bush.

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:37.870
What do you guys think?

01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:38.530
George W. Bush.

01:03:38.530 --> 01:03:39.460
What do you think.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.210
Yeah, I think so.

01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:42.650
Not bad.

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:43.720
Not bad.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.170
Not bad.

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:45.940
Here you go.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.330
Always sit in the
front row, guys.

01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:48.840
This is just a little hint.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.460
Just take a little hint here.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.610
So we're going to do now--

01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:55.170
what we're going to do, we're
going to do Barack Obama.

01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:57.890
I am going to draw, but we're
going to do a lesson.

01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.550
We have some paper there.

01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:01.590
You guys got pens with you?

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:01.820
All right.

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:02.730
Get a pen.

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:03.620
We're going to do a
drawing lesson.

01:04:03.620 --> 01:04:07.830
I'm going to teach everybody
here how to draw Barack Obama.

01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:12.140
This is a great thing to do.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.900
Even if you think you can't
draw, believe me, you will be

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.830
surprised what's going
to happen here.

01:04:17.830 --> 01:04:19.190
You can draw on your lap.

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:21.280
You can draw if you
have the book.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.250
You can draw it on the
back of the book.

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.580
Don't use a permanent pen,
because [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.020
We have some big paper there.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.500
Take a pad.

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:29.870
All right.

01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:30.680
So what we're going
to do is this.

01:04:30.680 --> 01:04:33.530
First, I'm going to do a
cartoon about Obama.

01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:34.640
I'm just going to show
you a little thing.

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.190
My observation about Obama.

01:04:36.190 --> 01:04:38.760
Then, I'm going to do
the step by step.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.280
Very quickly what to do.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.660
You guys watch.

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.090
And then, we're all going
to do it together.

01:04:43.090 --> 01:04:43.540
OK?

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:44.700
It won't take a minute.

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:45.530
It's a lot of fun.

01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:46.530
Pretty simple.

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:49.040
And I think this day,
you'll be very

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:49.740
pleased with the results.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:51.460
Now first, I just want to
tell you a little bit

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.670
about Obama's face.

01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:55.590
Now I have been watching
his face carefully now

01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:59.720
for five or six years.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.340
And one thing about
his face, he's got

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:04.620
a very strong profile.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:06.190
So the profile's kind
of like this.

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:09.470
He's got kind of big ears that
some people make a lot of.

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:11.930
But his heavy brow
is a big thing.

01:05:11.930 --> 01:05:13.470
The sun hits is forehead.

01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:16.280
The brow casts his eye
off into a shadow.

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.410
You can see a little
bit of it there.

01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:20.390
He's got a nose that's not
particularly distinctive,

01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:24.200
except he has got a little
mole there on his left

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.650
nostril, which you guys will now
never take your eyes off

01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:28.750
of when you see him next.

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.610
Seriously, it's this little mole
that moves up and down

01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:31.700
when he talks.

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:31.980
All right.

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:34.190
So then, he's got
this upper lip.

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:35.800
Big shadow there.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.960
Beneath the bottom lip is
something like this.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:43.345
And he's got this muscle here,
which is very distinctive on

01:05:43.345 --> 01:05:45.200
him, becoming very apparent.

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.060
And his chin.

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.040
And already, you could start to
see the character appear.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.120
So anyway, here's the thing
about his face.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:56.540
It's that Barack Obama has been
hounded by these birthers

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:59.880
who suggest that he was not
born in the United States.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.270
They say he was not
born in Hawaii.

01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:03.170
On the island of Hawaii.

01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:06.170
And looking at him and his
strong profile, I'm beginning

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.840
to think there might be
something to this.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:13.160
Because I think Barack Obama
was born on Easter Island.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:13.550
You see?

01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:14.950
That's what I think.

01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:16.260
That's what I think.

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.225
I think that there's a lot
of parallel there.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:23.130
So anyway, that's my first
evaluation of Barack Obama.

01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:26.920
Who wants it?

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.380
Right here.

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.990
OK.

01:06:28.990 --> 01:06:29.140
All right.

01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:29.890
So now the lesson.

01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:31.410
Barack Obama lesson.

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:32.940
Well, watch what I'm
going to do.

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:33.190
OK.

01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:35.970
We're going to break this down
to very simple shapes that

01:06:35.970 --> 01:06:37.040
everybody can do together.

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:39.060
Watch this, and then
we'll do together.

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:41.290
So what we're going to do is
we're going to start with a

01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:45.590
sideways C. We're going to do
two vertical lines and a

01:06:45.590 --> 01:06:48.210
horizontal line going
like this.

01:06:48.210 --> 01:06:49.170
And we're going to
fill them in.

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:52.120
Then we're going to do a shelf
like this, shelf like this.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.780
We're going to do a
line like this.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:55.070
A line like this.

01:06:55.070 --> 01:06:58.460
We're going to do a letter C
here with another one inside.

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:00.790
A second one here reversed
on this side.

01:07:00.790 --> 01:07:03.550
We're going to do an upside
down letter C like this.

01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:06.570
Then, we're going to do
two heavy brows here.

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:08.050
Now I've got the thick pen.

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:10.030
I can make it easily thick,
but you guys will

01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:11.210
have to work at it.

01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:12.410
Really make it nice and thick.

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:15.020
We do another line, and then
that could be where his eyes,

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.570
which is a little dot on it.

01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:18.290
Halfway down, we're going
to do a little squiggle.

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:20.250
It's Is going to go one, two,
three, and then it's going to

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:23.290
come around and get his little
thing going on there.

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:26.490
Then we do between here the M.
M. And we're going to fill in

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:27.990
the top like this.

01:07:27.990 --> 01:07:29.450
We're going to fill in
this one like this.

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:31.500
We're going to do a little
bit underneath.

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.720
And then do a set of parentheses
that are going to

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.530
almost connect at the bottom.

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:36.620
We're going to put
this thing in.

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.530
You guys know what
this is called?

01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:39.630
The Obama.

01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:40.550
This is the Obama.

01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:42.470
We're going to give
him an Obama.

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:45.040
And then we're put his
little skinny neck.

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:48.490
And we can even have him giving
a big thumbs up to our

01:07:48.490 --> 01:07:49.630
friends at Google.

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:50.900
And this is what we're
going to do.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.020
So this is going to
be Barack Obama.

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:54.160
OK.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.150
Very simple.

01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:57.970
The question is, do you guys
think we can this?

01:07:57.970 --> 01:08:00.800
And the answer is, yes we can.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.520
All right?

01:08:01.520 --> 01:08:02.150
Are you guys ready?

01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:03.450
Can we do this?

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:04.730
AUDIENCE: Yes we can.

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:05.160
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: All right.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.070
Good.

01:08:06.070 --> 01:08:08.640
Let's see if we can
make this happen.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:11.216
I'm going to stick this one over
here so everybody can use

01:08:11.216 --> 01:08:12.520
it as a model.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:12.940
Are you ready?

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:13.630
So we're going to do this.

01:08:13.630 --> 01:08:18.219
We're going to start with
a sideways C like this.

01:08:24.370 --> 01:08:27.080
Let's get a horizontal
line and two

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.500
vertical lines like this.

01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:35.319
And we fill those in
with additional

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.295
texture for added realism.

01:08:37.295 --> 01:08:40.359
For added realism.

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:43.130
Let's get a shelf sticking out
like this, and another shelf

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:46.740
sticking out like that.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.779
And then let's get a little
coming down like this, and

01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:51.410
then a line coming
down like that.

01:08:57.630 --> 01:09:00.880
Then we get a letter C here.

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:05.300
Letter C. Another letter C, and
reverse on this side here.

01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:10.340
Follow up with a--

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:11.720
this is where you're going
to have to do some work.

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.529
Get these heavy brows
going here.

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:15.390
Get those heavy brows.

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:16.640
Give it some work.

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:22.810
And if you got those down, let's
get a line underneath

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:27.140
here with an eye like that.

01:09:30.819 --> 01:09:31.640
Halfway down.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.680
Let's do that little
squiggle thing.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.700
One, two, three.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.490
And then let's get a squiggle
around like that.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:39.680
And then at the bottom,
let's give it a

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.939
letter C upside down.

01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:47.925
And now halfway between these
two, let's get the letter M.

01:09:47.925 --> 01:09:50.029
One, two, three, and four.

01:09:50.029 --> 01:09:52.170
Letter M across.

01:09:52.170 --> 01:09:53.420
And fill in that top bit.

01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:59.960
And then let's go underneath
like this.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.210
Give it a little shadow
underneath.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:04.130
All right.

01:10:04.130 --> 01:10:06.420
Now we get that set
of parentheses

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:07.210
going here like this.

01:10:07.210 --> 01:10:09.290
And they're going to be nearly
connect at the bottom.

01:10:14.350 --> 01:10:17.990
And we'll give him that
little skinny neck.

01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:20.750
Do it if you like
with his arm.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.650
But there's just two more very
important steps once you've

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:26.750
gotten this far.

01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.930
OK.

01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:31.570
So the first thing that you all
have to do is hold up your

01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:32.640
cartoon and show me.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:32.730
Let's go.

01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:33.480
Hold them up.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:33.680
Come on.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:35.160
Let's see the drawings.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:35.340
Come on.

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.000
Hold them up.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:36.750
Let's see.

01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:38.420
That's very good excellent.

01:10:38.420 --> 01:10:39.470
Excellent.

01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:40.230
No, no.

01:10:40.230 --> 01:10:41.200
Don't Keep on showing them.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:41.790
Up here, let's see.

01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:42.190
There you go.

01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:43.090
Excellent.

01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:43.730
Very good.

01:10:43.730 --> 01:10:44.270
Very good.

01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.700
Excellent.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:46.100
Good going, guys.

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:46.520
Excellent.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:46.970
Good.

01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:47.790
Good.

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:50.210
Now the next and most important
part is you must

01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:52.220
sign these cartoons.

01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:52.890
All right?

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:54.360
Now I have seen those
cartoons.

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.720
Do not sign my name
to those cartoons.

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:00.280
Let's sign the cartoon,
because here's what's

01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.030
interesting.

01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:03.965
Last time some of you guys drew
was probably when you

01:11:03.965 --> 01:11:06.200
were six years old.

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:09.420
And it's a whole lot of fun.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.420
And here's the thing about
drawing, is that it is kind of

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:13.340
a latent muscle in your brain.

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:16.220
Particularly as we got so much
technology at our disposal,

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:20.270
this very tangible, physical
thing of letting your brain

01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:22.830
connect to your hands and
produce something out of

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:25.850
nothing is magic.

01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:29.270
If you want to be a magician,
the best and easiest way to do

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:31.790
it is to draw.

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:35.310
So one of the things I also
have to add is that for a

01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:38.520
time, I was the president of an
international human rights

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:42.920
group dedicated to cartoonists,
where this act of

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.130
drawing is a very dangerous
thing, and where over half the

01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:50.005
world, we couldn't even
have this meeting.

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.970
Where the police would
march in, and you

01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:53.640
guys would be arrested.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:56.370
And I'd disappear not
to be seen again.

01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:58.460
And it seems kind of funny that
cartoonists could have

01:11:58.460 --> 01:11:59.000
this happen.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.510
But the crime that we would be
all doing is laughing at our

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:03.240
own head of state.

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.540
And currently, there is
cartoonists around the world

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.990
who are being jailed, tortured,
and murdered because

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.790
of what they do.

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:13.700
And so the fact that first, I
can do this incredible job--

01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:15.800
been doing it for 35 years.

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:18.250
I can stand here, and I can
share it with you guys.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:19.810
We can have a laugh together.

01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:21.580
We could do all this stuff
and not worry.

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.430
And yet, we don't all have to
agree with the stuff that

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:26.360
we've seen here together To me,
it is an amazing thing.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:27.590
That is magic.

01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:30.940
And I want to thank you guys for
the opportunity to do it.

01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:33.040
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.290
KEVIN KALLAUGHER: Thank you.
