00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.430
As flawless as a movie might seem when fans
first see it, repeat viewings can reveal that

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.040
some of the biggest questions are never actually
answered.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.270
There can be plenty of reasons, but whether
the answer is found in deleted scenes, overlooked

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.919
clues, or novelizations, we've got you covered.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:24.610
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Amazing Movie Mysteries
Finally Answered.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.180
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
Since Return of the Jedi ended with the downfall

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.079
of the Death Star and Emperor, it was assumed
that the Rebel Alliance had won the day, with

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.800
the Imperial army weakened by the loss of
its commanders.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.100
But in The Force Awakens, the Rebels are still
known as "the Resistance," without ever explaining

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.100
what they're resisting.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.260
In the novelization, it's explained that the
slow, boring politics of the Star Wars prequels

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.260
are to blame.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.640
Apparently, once the Empire started to crumble,
the same greedy, oblivious senators all dragged

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.699
their feet, ignoring Leia and the Rebels.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.019
That let the Empire recover, kicking off the
next movie trilogy.

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.059
The Lion King
When Simba runs away from his home, he doesn't

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.270
stop until he's left the African plains behind
for the jungle, growing from a boy into a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.270
man.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.050
He only returns when his childhood friend
Nala shows up to tell him how bad things have

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.970
gotten - but she's surprised to find him.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.180
So what was she doing miles and miles from
home?

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.830
In the original story, Nala had been banished
after refusing Scar's romantic advances.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.780
But the studio decided such a dark sexual
storyline wasn't right for the younger audience

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.540
it was aiming for.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.980
Captain America: The Winter Soldier
Fans of Steve Rogers didn't just get to see

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.750
an updated, stealthy costume for Cap in his
big screen sequel, but a return to his roots,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.830
when he puts on his original costume - after
stealing it from the Smithsonian.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.830
But the actual reason for stealing the uniform
isn't given.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.200
A deleted scene showed Cap's suit was being
tracked, so he ditched it to lead S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.970
on a wild goose chase, forcing him into street
clothes for the rest of the movie.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.390
He needed a uniform that couldn't be followed,
leading him to his uniform created before

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.560
the tracking technology was used.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.270
Star Wars: The Phantom Menace
Some problems in George Lucas' prequels arise

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.260
when fans realize that the Sith, the Jedi's
ancient enemy, isn't a powerful order or army,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.020
but just two Force Users: a master and apprentice.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.350
Why not recruit an army instead of hatching
a decades-long plan?

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.340
The answer comes in the novels, when the greatest
surviving Sith, Darth Bane, realized the greed,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.420
hunger for power, and anger the Sith taught
guaranteed they'd betray each other, and never

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.420
work together.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.390
It was better, he decided, to keep just two
true Sith at any time, who could manipulate

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.560
the rest of the galaxy’s leaders without
them ever realizing it.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.810
The plan worked, after all.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.849
Independence Day
Science fiction nitpickers are quick to point

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.829
out the most far-fetched moment of Independence
Day, when an Apple computer is completely

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.840
compatible with the alien mothership.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.060
But follow the plot, and you don't even need
the deleted scene explaining it.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.420
The Area 51 scientists explain that the digital
age was a result of studying the alien ship,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.790
right down to the microchip.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.860
If modern computers were reverse-engineered
from the alien systems, as revealed in a deleted

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.409
scene, someone as brilliant as Jeff Goldblum's
character could have easily programmed an

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.409
interface.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.219
The Lost World: Jurassic Park
It's one plot hole that refuses to die, and

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.219
with good reason.

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.859
When the ship containing the T-rex crashes
into San Diego's port, the crew are found

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.829
completely dismembered on board.

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.029
Shockingly, that fact is never explained.

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:10.310
But in the novel, a pack of velociraptors
snuck on board, killing the crew, and apparently

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.760
falling overboard on the way.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.370
At least, we HOPE that's what happened to
them.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.700
The Dark Knight Rises
Critics cried foul when Bruce Wayne returned

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.870
to Gotham from his prison pit, without any
explanation.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.360
But the solution is obvious going by the previous
movies.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.670
It's not hard to believe Bruce could have
traveled back to a port city, since he left

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.420
the States in the exact same way.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.749
It's also shown, and explicitly stated by
Harvey Dent, that Wayne Manor isn't anywhere

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.680
close to Gotham.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.409
So Bruce could have gotten to his Batcave
easily - with his gadgets and tech, getting

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.459
past Bane's forces would have been a breeze.

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.760
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
The movie makes a point of explaining that

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.900
the First Order’s superweapon is practically
planet-sized, compared to the original Death

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.900
Star.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.749
But seriously, how could a space station ever
be built so large?

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:57.319
Besides being home to billions of soldiers,
how could the crew use all of the space?

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.601
The novel explains it by revealing the base
wasn't built at all - it was a planet to begin

00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:03.601
with:

00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:06.091
"...the planet had been altered: its mountains
tunneled into, its glaciers hacked, and its

00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:10.029
valleys modified until it no longer resembled
its original naturally eroded form.

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:12.150
Those who had remade it had renamed it.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.269
Starkiller Base."

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.750
Titanic
Every Titanic fan points out the same problem:

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.470
Jack and Rose could easily have both fit on
the floating door if they'd just tried, or

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.360
taken turns if it wouldn't support both their
weight - and they could have both been rescued.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.310
But think about it: when help arrives, Jack
looks to be almost frozen solid.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.949
Rose barely survives herself, so if she and
Jack had taken turns getting in and out of

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.250
the water, they would BOTH have died of hypothermia.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.880
Jack probably knew it, sacrificing himself
to a certain death, instead of trying a plan

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.430
that would have gotten them BOTH killed.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.400
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
Fans have been debating the true identity

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.690
of the new hero Rey since the movie released,
wondering who it was that left her all alone

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.500
on Jakku, and why they never returned.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.271
It seems pretty cold for a hero like Luke
or Leia to leave her behind for good, but

00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:57.640
the novel reveals that wasn't the plan at
all.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.180
When Luke's lightsaber triggers Rey's Force
visions, the scene ends with Rey hearing a

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.389
voice calling to her.

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.009
Not just any voice, either, but that of her
parent, with their last words a promise to

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.949
come back for her once it was safe, ending
with the line "I'll come back sweetheart,

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.470
I promise" - confirming once and for all that
movie audiences don't know the half of her

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.470
origin story.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.350
Those are the nagging questions we've seen
movie fans debate with no hope of an answer,

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.849
but which great debates, plot holes, or unexplained
movie mysteries are your favorites to discuss?
