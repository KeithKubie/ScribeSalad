00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.075
The answer is the fourth choice. That this works

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:06.894
at least against the attack that was described

00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:09.503
as long as the random value is kept secret.

00:00:09.503 --> 00:00:12.458
If C decrypts the message while C has the private

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:15.299
key here also, we’ll learn the random value and

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.586
can use that in collaboration with eavesdropper

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:20.704
who heard these messages now to figure out

00:00:20.704 --> 00:00:24.712
which voter voted for which candidate. So this is a

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:27.774
weak system. So this solution doesn’t work at

00:00:27.774 --> 00:00:31.145
least not it for a threat model includes an

00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:33.579
eavesdropper colluding with party C or C

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.000
having the ability to eavesdrop on this link.
