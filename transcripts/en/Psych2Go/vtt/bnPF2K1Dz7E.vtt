00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.090
Before starting this video, we just
wanna thank you for supporting our channel.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.190
It truly means a lot to know what a wonderful
community we've built together.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.100
Without further ado, let's get to today's
topic on the Effects of Growing Up with a

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.010
Single Parent.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.810
Although having two parents in the picture
is definitely beneficial for kids growing

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.590
up, it's not always the case.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.840
There are many children today who are going
through life with just a single parent, and

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.230
when they reach adulthood, many of them become
highly successful, happy individuals.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.399
Both negative and positive psychological effects
of having a single parent have been studied

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:43.910
extensively.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.329
Interestingly, many new studies suggest that
divorce in particular might not necessarily

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.399
be the root cause of psychological issues,
despite previous schools of thought.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.940
Instead, these issues might simply be the
result of traumatic memories in general.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.530
Let's check out 7 Effects of Growing up with
a Single Parent.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.920
Boys tend to be more idle in young adulthood.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.780
Sometimes, specific genders seem to react
in different ways to growing up with a single

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.780
parent.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.310
In terms of boys, some studies have suggested
that they're more likely to be idle in young

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.540
adulthood.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.700
This includes things like being unproductive
and even dropping out of school.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:29.510
While boys are more likely to experience this,
it can definitely happen with girls as well.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.500
Girls are at a higher risk for teen pregnancy.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.320
Multiple surveys and studies have shown a
link between single-parent homes and teen

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.800
pregnancy.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.760
While unplanned pregnancies aren't always
a bad thing, teen pregnancies in particular

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.810
can involve certain issues and complications
such as lack of financial opportunities and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.759
access to higher education.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.760
Some have theorized that this correlation
is due to the lack of a male figure in the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.920
household, which can have negative psychological
effects on a young girl.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.909
Single-parent families can actually be more
beneficial in some cases.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.819
With more and more children growing up in
single-parent households, more research is

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.290
being done on not only the negative effects
but also the positive ones.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.300
Some studies have pointed out that in some
cases, a single family household can actually

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.659
be more beneficial.

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:28.219
The main example would be an extremely stressful
two-parent home versus a peaceful relaxed

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:30.709
single-parent home.

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.459
When there is extreme conflict, violence or
stress in a two-parent home, a single-parent

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.079
home is actually a much more beneficial environment
for the child.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.939
That's definitely something worth keeping
in mind as we list some of the negative effects

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.049
here.

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.699
Kids with a single parent might end up having
a stronger relationship with that parent.

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:56.439
There's always a very special bond that forms
between children and their parents, but one

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.680
study suggests that in a single-parent home,
that relationship could potentially be even

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.449
stronger and unique in a way that is unseen
in two-parent homes.

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:09.389
Not only is the relationship often stronger
in this situation but the children and parents

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.230
are more dependent on each other, more affectionate
and more likely to work together towards a

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.879
common goal.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.779
Before we continue to the next point, we want
to share with you a recommended video from

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:22.129
Better Help.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.050
Haesue talks about Seven Ways To Overcome
Emotional Neglect.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.279
If you find yourself to be somebody who suffered
from emotional neglect, you may want to check

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.349
it out after this video.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.779
Kids with single parents might end up being
less satisfied in life.

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:41.959
In a slightly alarming study, research was
done on tens of thousands of individuals to

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.849
test their overall feeling of satisfaction
in life.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.819
The study found a small but persistent decrease
in life satisfaction among those who had grown

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.609
up with a single mother throughout childhood.

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.730
They found that these individuals were less
likely to experience educational and economic

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.090
success and good physical health.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.359
Additionally, they found a connection between
single mother childhoods and unmet relationship

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.359
goals.

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.989
But remember, there was only a small decrease
in life satisfaction when compared to those

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.799
with two parents.

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.220
There could be an increased risk of psychiatric
issues; there's a huge wealth of scientific

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.970
literature which states single-parent homes
are a risk factor for a number of mental health

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.370
issues in children including depression and
psychological distress.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:33.440
Once again, we're not saying this happens
to all children in these situations, but there's

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.300
definitely a link.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.169
Also, we have to mention that the trauma of
potentially negative memories might be the

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:47.750
root cause, not necessarily single-parent
homes specifically.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.159
Children with single parents benefit immensely
from a strong relationship with their grandparents.

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:57.620
Let's end things with something positive;
what can be done to avoid some of these negative

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.280
effects and help children in these situations?

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.130
One study suggested a perfect solution; encourage
a strong relationship with the child's grandparents.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.960
The recent study discovered that this simple
act can considerably boost social skills and

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.539
help reduce behavioral problems in adolescents.

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:21.030
This is a great example of how psychological
research can really help those in need.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.949
What do you think about kids growing up in
single-parent homes?

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.360
Do any of our viewers have first-hand experience
with these situations?

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.130
Let us know in the comments below. And as always,
thank you for your continued support.
