00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:05.810
MARTIN OMANDER:
So my guest today

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.800
is Joe Born, co-founder of the
startup behind the Hale Dreamer

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.930
Alarm Clock.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.430
Thanks for coming
on the show today.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.721
JOE BORN: Thanks for having me.

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:15.760
MARTIN OMANDER: So this
is a hardware product.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.180
You worked in hardware.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.084
How has crowdfunding changed
hardware, do you think?

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:21.250
JOE BORN: Oh, night and day.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.630
You are talking about we
suddenly have the ability

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.700
to release a product and get
market feedback before we've

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.640
actually brought it
into full production.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.530
It's a much more
important factor

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.500
than many of the others that
get more notoriety-- 3D printing

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.220
and some of the
open source stuff--

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.940
because you think
about the ability

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.590
to get feedback up front without
making these big investments.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.920
That's really changed.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.380
It's really turned
hardware development

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.660
upside down-- very big impact

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.647
MARTIN OMANDER: And you
used it to your advantage

00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:51.730
for building this product.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.590
Could you tell us a
bit more about that?

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.750
JOE BORN: Yeah.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.360
So our goal was a little bit
unconventional in this product.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.060
So we really wanted to
get up-front feedback

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.890
and really see particularly
developer, early adopter

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.760
community with our product.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.950
So for example, the hardware's
got a relatively open

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:09.540
interface.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.770
And that allowed us to
recruit a few other apps that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.580
would work with our hardware
as a result of Android Central

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.830
and some of the publicity
that we got out of the gate.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.250
And that came from that
very focused approach

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.819
that, in this case,
crowdfunding facilitated.

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:24.610
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.160
So for you, it was just as much
crowd marketing and building

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.262
community as getting the
funding for the product.

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:32.470
JOE BORN: Yeah, that's right.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.430
And so Kickstarter is
a big, big community

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.840
of very involved users
that it's very hard

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.690
to get out of traditional kind
of mass distribution and sales

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.220
channels.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.020
So whereas Amazon is very
mainstream or [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.520
or the like, Kickstarter
really does get you

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.740
that early adopter, that
very involved consumer.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.570
And that's very important to
try and recruit them up front,

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.650
particularly with many
of the hardware devices.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.390
MARTIN OMANDER: Mm, I see.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.310
And crowdfunding runs
in the family, I hear.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.664
Your daughter ran a campaign.

00:02:07.664 --> 00:02:09.330
Could you tell us a
bit more about that?

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
JOE BORN: So my daughter's
going into seventh grade now.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.300
And she invented a no-spill cup.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.190
My dad has Parkinson's.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.050
His hand tremors, and he
was shaking and spilling.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.770
And so she invented
a three-legged cup

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.330
that holds the
base off the ground

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.520
and did a couple crowdfunding
campaigns, the most

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.137
recent over the summer.

00:02:29.137 --> 00:02:30.220
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, great.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.380
That must have been a
great learning experience

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.250
for both you and your daughter.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.350
What did you learn?

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.236
What was unexpected?

00:02:36.236 --> 00:02:36.860
JOE BORN: Yeah.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.627
Well, one of the big
unexpected things

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:40.710
was-- and I think there's
a lesson for all of us--

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.950
that if you'd asked me
what's important for her

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.544
as an inventor coming
out of the gate,

00:02:44.544 --> 00:02:46.710
I'd have said, well, aesthetic
sense and the ability

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.375
to iterate and stuff.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:50.030
But it turns out that
being a spokesman

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.180
is really, in many ways,
much more important

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.430
than those details.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.500
Because it was her ability to
articulate and tell the story

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.630
that really captivated
people and really recruited

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.630
interest and developed stuff.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.050
So I think that's a good
part of what crowdfunding

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.487
does in forcing us to
articulate the product.

00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:10.570
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, right.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.194
You have that one-
or two-minute video,

00:03:12.194 --> 00:03:13.736
and you have to pack
it all in there.

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:14.360
JOE BORN: Yeah.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.240
And I think that's
a great exercise.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.840
Because we start out, and
we and our co-founders

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.990
are so used to the product.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.810
And they've heard the
articulation a million times,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:25.785
and they get used
to the fact that it

00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:27.020
has 10 million features.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.480
All of a sudden,
now you're forced,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.910
how do I articulate this at
a very high level to someone

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.297
who doesn't know the product
in a minute or two minutes?

00:03:33.297 --> 00:03:35.005
And going through that
exercise is really

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:37.120
an important discipline--
what's important,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.380
what's not important,
what could I leave off?

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.550
And I think going through
that exercise early really

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.916
is a help to
understanding your product

00:03:43.916 --> 00:03:45.540
and how you're going
to sell it and how

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:46.791
you're going to articulate it.

00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:47.665
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah.

00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:49.760
A lot of people with
an engineering mindset,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.060
like me, we start thinking about
a product and start building

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.735
it.

00:03:53.735 --> 00:03:57.079
And feedback comes
way late, well after.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.120
JOE BORN: And that's the
conventional way, right?

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.090
And that's why crowdfunding
is so important.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.850
Because all of a sudden, we
find ourselves selling a product

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.730
before we've completed the
whole engineering process.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.100
Well, that's great,
because now there's

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.590
plenty of time to make changes
and get feedback and learn

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.726
from it before you've
made all the investments

00:04:14.726 --> 00:04:16.100
and before you've
locked yourself

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.910
into the technology, the
details, the implementation,

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.540
and so on and so forth.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.280
So I think that kind
of exercise probably

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.780
is as good for
software as hardware.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.969
But particularly so in
hardware where you do

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:28.010
have to make investments.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.760
And a lot of those
investments do lock you

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.659
into certain things.

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:31.450
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.800
Because it's harder
to change hardware,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.930
you mean, than software?

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.107
JOE BORN: Yeah.

00:04:36.107 --> 00:04:37.690
Hardware's become
more like software--

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.235
more iterative, more
software-driven.

00:04:39.235 --> 00:04:41.026
But you still have a
physical manifestation

00:04:41.026 --> 00:04:45.300
that's in the field and can't
be changed-- at least the knobs

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.300
and buttons and housing,
and that kind of stuff.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.330
So you do get
locked into tooling,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.290
and you have to make
decisions that do lock you in.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.301
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:54.800
Great.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.330
So how is your daughter's
campaign and product doing?

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.080
JOE BORN: Good.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.490
We've sold 10,000 cups over
the summer, so $62,000 worth.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.865
And now we're feverishly working
to bring those into production

00:05:07.865 --> 00:05:10.804
and tool it up and
ship those to people.

00:05:10.804 --> 00:05:12.970
It's called the Kangaroo
Cup, if any of your viewers

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:13.840
are interested.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.048
MARTIN OMANDER: Kangaroo Cup.

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:15.624
Great.

00:05:15.624 --> 00:05:17.790
Well, thank you so much for
coming on the show, Joe,

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.640
and sharing your experience, and
that of your daughter, with us.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.147
Best of luck with your
product and your daughter's.

00:05:24.147 --> 00:05:24.730
JOE BORN: Yes.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.700
I'll pass that along.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.219
Thank you.

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:28.010
MARTIN OMANDER: We hope
you found something

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.510
you can use in your startup.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.810
