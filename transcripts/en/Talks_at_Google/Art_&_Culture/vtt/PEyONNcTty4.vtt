[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.170
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.380
So firstly, welcome
to our guests.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.552
Thanks for coming.

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:15.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.630
So our goal I think with this
talk is to kind of, firstly,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.420
celebrate Pride because
it is Pride month.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.160
And then secondly,
kind of challenge some

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.080
of the assumptions around what
an LGBTQ person looks like.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.770
So there's lots of diversity
within the LGBTQ community,

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.890
not just in terms of
gender orientation,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.800
sexual orientation, but also
in terms of race, of culture.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.570
And this sort of
concentration, we're

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.470
concentrating on
differences of religion.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.054
So because these are
kind of sensitive topics,

00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:48.970
I just want to sort of
make a couple of points

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.689
before we begin.

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:52.480
We tried really hard
to vet these questions

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.150
with the panelists and
within our internal team

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.880
as well to make sure
they're challenging and

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.910
thought-provoking but
still respectful and kind

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.829
of inclusive.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.120
And so we'd ask, when we get
to the question and answer

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.910
portion with the audience,
that the audience can sort of

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.650
try to strike the same balance.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.840
So that's a request to you guys.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.890
And then in the spirit of that
inclusiveness that I was just

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.590
talking about, please
note that whenever

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.530
we refer to the acronym
LGBTQ, which we'll

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.770
be doing quite a lot I guess
during this discussion,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.510
it's sort of just
shorthand for LGBTQQIAAP.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.690
So we definitely want to
include everyone again.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.460
But we're going to be using
that acronym a lot, just

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.920
for shorthand purposes.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.730
So those are just a couple of
points before we get started.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.520
I'll just introduce with
a short blurb written

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.610
by the panelists themselves
each of the panelists

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.540
in their own words.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.140
So I'll start with Kelsey,
who's right to my right here.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.500
So Kelsey is a Long Island
native currently living

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.926
and learning and Philadelphia.

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:00.800
She's just completed
her second year of study

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.500
at the Lutheran
Theological Seminary

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.900
and will be moving to
Santa Monica, California,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.690
in August for a
year-long internship.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.110
She describes herself as
unapologetically queer, black,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.250
and Lutheran.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.100
Her motto is reliance
on sass and grace.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.590
It's a great motto.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.690
She's passionate
about slam poetry,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.940
has a voice for
social justice, and is

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.992
an avid seeker of the truth.

00:02:24.992 --> 00:02:25.724
So welcome.

00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:26.724
KELSEY BROWN: Thank you.

00:02:26.724 --> 00:02:31.070
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.420
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: And next
we have Sensei Joshin.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.560
So Sensei Joshin is a
co-founder of Village Zendo,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.870
a Zen Buddhist meditation
center in downtown Manhattan.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.740
She began her formal
Zen training in 1986,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.870
spending three years in
residential monastic training.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.034
She now lives with her life
partner, Roshi Enkyo O'Hara.

00:02:51.034 --> 00:02:53.200
Besides teaching meditation
and giving Dharma talks,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.360
Sensei Joshin is
a psychotherapist

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.060
and is interested in the
interface between spirituality

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.680
and psychotherapy.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.662
So welcome.

00:03:00.662 --> 00:03:04.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.345
And next we have
Rabbi Nancy Wiener.

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:11.150
So Rabbi Nancy Wiener
is the clinical director

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.660
of the Center of Pastoral
Counseling at Hebrew Union

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.150
College Jewish
Institute of Religion,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.550
where she's an adjunct full
professor of pastoral care

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.840
and counseling.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.300
She holds a doctor of ministry
in pastoral counseling,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.100
a master's degree
in Jewish history,

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.350
and a master of Hebrew letters.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.090
She sat on the
Central Conference

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.480
of American Rabbis' ad hoc
committee on human sexuality

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.410
that wrote the official
statements and resolutions

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.430
related to rabbinic officiation
at same-sex weddings

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.180
and the inclusion of bisexual
and trans-identified Jews.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.980
Her publications include
two books related

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.470
to marriage and engagement,
"Beyond the Breaking

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.840
Glass: A Spiritual Guide
to your Jewish Wedding"

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.450
and "Meeting at the
Well: A Jewish Spiritual

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.810
Guide to being Engaged,"
the first inclusive books

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.740
published by Jews and for Jews
to address relationship issues

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.320
of concern to both
the LGBTQ community

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.730
and non-LGBTQ communities.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.790
Her most recent book, "Maps
and Meaning: Levitical Models

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.740
of Contemporary
Care" re-examines

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.610
issues related to marginalized
individuals and communities

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.339
and their enduring relationships
to holiness and community.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:20.326
So welcome.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:24.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.951
And then lastly, we
have Faisal Alam.

00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:30.530
He's a queer-identified Muslim
activist, speaker, and writer

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.360
of Pakistani descent.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.404
At age 19, Faisal founded
the Al-Fatiha organization,

00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:37.820
which is an
organization dedicated

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.860
to supporting and
empowering LGBTIQ Muslims,

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.240
and served as its volunteer
director until 2003.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.980
In 2013, Faisal
helped launch Muslims

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.700
for Sexual and Gender Diversity,
which is an organization aimed

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.480
to connect LGBTQ Muslims,
increase diversity

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.550
within the Muslim
community, and promote

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.070
a progressive understanding of
Islam that's centered around

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.310
inclusion, justice,
and equality.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.050
In 2011, Faisal wasn't invited
to attend the White House iftar

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.630
with President Barack Obama.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.050
Faisal was also
named an innovator

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.700
by "Advocate
Magazine" and selected

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.760
as one of the 30 young
visionaries by "Utne Reader."

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.910
So welcome.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.940
So I think I just might start
with a introductory expository

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.490
question.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.460
So as I said, our
goal here today

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.950
was to kind of highlight
the intersection

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.050
of your religious
identities with your gender,

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.290
sexual orientation identities.

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.150
And so I guess I
just start by having

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.730
you guys describe
each in your own words

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.670
how you identify with sort
of both of those categories,

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.390
and how--

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.047
I guess very broadly--

00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:48.630
how you see those
two coming together.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.190
So Kelsey, maybe
starting with you.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.320
KELSEY BROWN: Hi, everyone.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.790
So I am a member of the
Evangelical Lutheran

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.160
Church in America, and
I identify as a lesbian.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.840
Where I see those two
intersecting most frequently is

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.880
the ELCA for short has a variety
of social statements that we've

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.340
published over the
past couple of years,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.980
most importantly
the 2009 decision

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:24.780
which affirmed LGBTQ identities
for ordained ministry.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.900
So the track that I
am on will hopefully

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.359
lead me to a parish and
to be a parish pastor.

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:33.150
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Can
you speak a little bit

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.080
about how you kind of came
to your religious identity

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.940
and sort of your
formative years and what

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.410
that evolution looked like?

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.900
And also I guess from
your gender identity,

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.770
how that kind of
evolved as well?

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.200
KELSEY BROWN: So a little
less fun of a story.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.970
I was born a Lutheran.

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.240
My family has been
Lutheran my entire life,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.990
and I have actually been a
member of the same church

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.450
for the past 24 years.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.590
So a little boring.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.850
But in my process
of coming out, I

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.470
struggled a bit connecting
church and what I was being

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.020
taught to what I was feeling.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:18.930
It was very difficult to
come from a more conservative

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:19.890
pastor.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:23.910
Not all Lutheran churches act
and think and talk and teach

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.490
the same things.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.010
And to hear what he
was saying and then

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.990
hear what my family
was saying, affirming

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.470
my different identities, it
proved a little bit difficult,

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.920
and I actually removed myself a
little bit from the leadership

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.420
roles that I had taken within
the church, such as communion

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.890
assisting and teaching Sunday
School and choir and things.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.360
I didn't want to be as
connected as I was in the past.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.780
That has changed now due
to public affirmation

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.290
by the national church and
some other church bodies

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:00.060
of my various identities.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.200
But then it was rather
difficult. I was about 14,

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.320
and then I really cared
what people thought.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:09.450
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Sensei.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:14.441
BARBARA JOSHIN O'HARA: So
I identify as a lesbian Zen

00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:14.940
Buddhist.

00:08:18.504 --> 00:08:20.460
But it was quite a
journey to get there

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.505
because I was raised an
Irish Catholic in Ireland.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:35.360
And I guess my sense
of the church--

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.640
I mean, my family
was very religious.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.320
So we'd go to mass on Sunday.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.390
And so I remember as early as
maybe five or six sitting there

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.230
with my parents and my
sisters and my brothers,

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.270
and my twin brother was up on
the altar being an altar boy.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.510
So he got to fetch
the crucible of wine

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.760
and the water for the priest.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.270
And that seemed
like a lot more fun,

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:10.460
but I couldn't do that
because I was a girl.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:18.940
So that didn't stop me from
going home and re-enacting.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.440
I became the priest.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.280
And with the sideboard, my
mother's chalices and trophies,

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:32.230
I would offer the Eucharist,
and my brother was my acolyte.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.650
All told, I think
around 16 I realized

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:41.380
that women had pretty
secondary role in the church.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:47.260
And there were other issues I
had about the church's dogma.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:53.910
And basically, I felt that
women didn't get a good deal,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:59.490
and I started into meditation
and yoga on my own.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:04.880
I didn't know any gay people
growing up in Ireland.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:11.450
I thought, in fact, around 16,
17, that I was the only one.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:17.210
And it took me to travel
in France and Spain

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:22.250
to come upon two
women living together.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.010
And that was
actually an awakening

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.800
that this is possible.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.270
I mean, I'd read "The
Well of Loneliness,"

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.860
but I'd never
actually known anyone

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:39.410
who was able to profess
their love for same gender.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:46.710
Even in college, there were no
associations or organizations.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.570
So my encounter with
Buddhism came much later

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:55.850
when I came to this
country and read something

00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:04.040
that said life is suffering, and
the way out of this suffering

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:11.070
is through our minds,
watching our minds.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:17.820
And I loved the idea that
my own spirituality was not

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.020
going to be mediated
by a third person,

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:27.780
that it took simply sitting on
a cushion counting my breath

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:32.900
to know my true nature.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.470
So that was it.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:44.640
And I was hooked and met my
partner at this Zen center,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:50.220
and she went on to start
sitting in her house.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.910
I went into monastic
residence for three years

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.140
and really explored the
tradition very deeply and then

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.640
came out and joined her.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:03.800
And the Village Zendo was born.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.220
And so 30 some years
later, it's still

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:17.580
going strong in Soho, Broadway
between Houston and Prince.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.020
And we have a very
vibrant community

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.990
of all kinds of people.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.400
NANCY WIENER: So I, like
Kelsey, was born a reformed Jew

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.980
and into a reformed
Jewish family,

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.150
was very comfortable within
the liberal Jewish tradition,

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.060
and was very active as
a child in synagogue

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:48.000
and through my years in
junior high and high school.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.630
I didn't come out
until I was in my 20s,

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:54.780
and I identify as a lesbian.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:58.526
I went through many
heterosexual relationships,

00:12:58.526 --> 00:13:00.150
always feeling that
there was something

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.730
that seemed to be missing.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.160
And I had thought of the
rabbinate as a possibility

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.120
when I was younger and
had originally thought

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.390
that I needed to listen to my
rabbi who said, no, no, no.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.890
You'll be a religious
school teacher

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:20.610
because when I said that there
weren't women rabbis yet.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.920
I chose to go into the
rabbinate because I

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.340
felt that there were many ways
that the things that I loved

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.490
and the things that I found
most meaningful in my own life

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:36.990
were things that I could
share with other people.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:40.040
When I applied to
rabbinical school,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:44.240
the reform movement was already
accepting gay and lesbian

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.990
congregants.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.150
They were not at a point
where they had made

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.670
a statement about clergy yet.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.510
And so I entered rabbinical
school in the closet

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.300
with my partner who
had been out for years

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.960
sort of re-entering
the closet with me.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.740
And we found a
spiritual home together

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.640
at Congregation [? Batzim ?]
Hatorah here in New York City.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.420
And through my years
in rabbinical school,

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.060
I was very active with a
group of other students

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:18.740
who are also I would say at best
semi-closeted at the seminary.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:24.710
We had many advocates among our
peers, and some of the faculty

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.890
was very supportive.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.160
But technically we
couldn't be out.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.250
And particularly when we
finished with our studies,

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.640
we were told that when
we applied for jobs

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.000
that we were going to end
our careers if we came out

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.650
in the process.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:45.020
Fortunately, the June
after my ordination in May,

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:50.540
the reform rabbinic community,
the Central Conference

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.850
of American Rabbis, voted to
accept gay and lesbian clergy

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.780
in their midst.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.438
And so for my entire rabbinate,
that has been a possibility.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.310
FAISAL ALAM: Yeah, as
Kelsey and the rabbi,

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:08.730
I also grew up in
a Muslim household.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:12.240
I identify as queer Muslim
of Pakistani descent.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.430
And depending on
how far back you

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.080
want to go in my
parents history,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.700
you know pre-partition
India, I was born in Germany

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.830
and lived in Saudi
Arabia, and then

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:25.650
grew up in a small
town in Connecticut.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:28.640
So when people are like,
identify your identity or where

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.430
are you from?

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:31.470
I'm always like, how far
back do you want to go,

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:36.975
or let's just say
I'm from Connecticut.

00:15:36.975 --> 00:15:42.000
So I moved here when I was
10, and my parents enrolled

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.100
my brother and I and
our Sunday School

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.270
at our mosque, which was nearby.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:50.700
And that's primarily where I
learned the tenets of my faith,

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.360
learned about Islam, et
cetera, and at the same time

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.170
was going to a
predominantly white school

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.960
in the suburbs of Connecticut.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.250
So I grew up pretty much
with a very dual identity

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:09.030
of being sort of American
when I was in public school

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:14.830
and then being sort of Pakistani
and Muslim on the weekends,

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:20.010
and all the while also coming
to realize that I was gay

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:24.580
and also thinking that
I was the only one.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:26.430
I don't think I was
raised necessarily

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:31.322
in a homophobic environment,
but at our mosque,

00:16:31.322 --> 00:16:33.780
at our Sunday School there were
probably about two weekends

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:38.310
where we spent talking about
homosexuality and Islam.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.820
And the teaching essentially
was that, just like Christianity

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.750
and Judaism, Islam also
condemns homosexuality.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.430
You can't be gay and Muslim.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.440
That doesn't exist.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:53.650
And there's sort of no no
ifs, ands, or buts about it.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:58.740
And so it was definitely
very challenging sort

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.290
of realizing that they
were talking about me,

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:05.099
and so how could I
be gay and Muslim?

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.589
Like, why would God you know
instill these feelings inside

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:12.300
of me if he or she-- depending
on how you view God--

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.270
was going to condemn you later?

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:21.660
And so my journey really was
to find other LGBT Muslims,

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.050
and that's essentially
what I did when I was 19

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:28.530
is to look for
other LGBT Muslims

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.200
and really create a
community for myself.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.370
And that was almost
20 years ago.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:44.100
And unlike Protestant
denominations of Christianity

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:48.570
or sects of Judaism, within
Sunni Islam, which is about 80%

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.880
of Muslims, there
isn't a hierarchy.

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.760
So there aren't
statements necessarily

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.150
that the church or the
rabbinical institution

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.990
can issue supporting
LGBT people.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.960
And so in the United
States at least,

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.974
depending on where you are,
it depends on which mosque

00:18:07.974 --> 00:18:09.390
you're going to
or which community

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:12.720
you're going to in terms of
how open or welcoming they

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.160
may be to LGBT people.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.830
ANMOL BHAGCHAND:
Very interesting.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.530
I'd like to get even more
personal actually, if we could,

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.931
and actually ask you guys
about the coming out process,

00:18:24.931 --> 00:18:25.430
I guess.

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:29.000
So coming out involves maybe
coming out to yourself.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.875
As we know, there's so
many different stages.

00:18:30.875 --> 00:18:33.470
There's coming out to yourself,
coming out to your parents,

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:35.030
coming out to
family and friends.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.700
I'm particularly curious
about your coming out process

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.670
with whichever higher
power you believe in

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:44.570
and what kind of shape
and form that took

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:49.080
and how you reached a harmonious
relationship with that

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.580
if you did.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.950
KELSEY BROWN: So I find
my relationship with God

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:59.710
to be very relational.

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.590
I thought it was
really funny, if we

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:06.030
view God as feminine or
masculine, male or female.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:10.420
God to me is just God,
and I try my hardest

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.640
to instill that in the
people that I teach

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.810
and the conversations
that I have with others.

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:19.600
So for me, my coming
out experience to God

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:25.090
was just a check in to say, hey,
by the way, you know I'm gay,

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.290
but like now I know I'm gay.

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:29.740
So I'm gay.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:34.300
It was much more
interesting to explore

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.780
the idea of coming out
to my faith community

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.560
than to God's self.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.810
I did come from a particular
community that preached

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.670
homophobia from the pulpit.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:53.290
And although that may not be the
general consensus of many ELCA

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.710
Lutheran congregations,
for me it was.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.080
So I have been a member
there my entire life,

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.990
but I'm still not out
to that community.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:06.970
And for a variety of reasons,
I live fully as myself

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.880
there without
having to say a lot.

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.310
And they're OK with that.

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:16.330
God, on the other
hand, has affirmed me

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:20.560
through scripture and people
that I have met and interacted

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.950
with to sort of give
me the go-ahead.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:28.450
I find a lot of assurance
in being affirmed

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.390
by the seminary
in which I attend,

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.840
or the conferences and
congregations in which I

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.740
support and preach and teach at.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.720
That when they affirm
my identity fully

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:44.500
and wholeheartedly as
unapologetically black, gay,

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:48.140
and Lutheran, that that is
God affirming that as well.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.280
BARBARA JOSHIN O'HARA:
So I think for me it

00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.050
was the whole issue
around my sexuality

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:06.590
that forced me into this
kind of inward search

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:13.100
that started me on questioning
everything and sort of seeing

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.330
that maybe reality was surfaces,
that there was something

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:25.100
certainly going on with me that
had no representation outside.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:32.970
And so it was this sense of
having to figure out on my own.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:38.080
And so that I think is what
actually led me on this search.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.720
I knew I was not going to get
any help from the Catholic

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.910
Church with this, nor my
parents, nor my school,

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:52.510
nor my neighborhood,
or my country.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.470
I found myself truly
alone, and this then

00:21:56.470 --> 00:22:00.610
started this inward quest--

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:05.980
yoga, meditation, and then
actually traveling, leaving

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.410
home.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:10.360
Which is OK, because in
the Buddhist tradition

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.000
that has good antecedents.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.360
The Buddha also left
home on a quest.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.110
And so I do think my
sexuality started me

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:24.610
on my spiritual quest.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.030
NANCY WIENER: I was raised
with three main ideas that

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.230
were related to God.

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.680
One was that God created a world
that was filled with diversity.

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:41.740
The second was that God was a
god that liberated our people.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.620
And the third was
that the encounter

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.070
with God at Mount Sinai made
us responsible for ourselves

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.710
and for taking
care of the world.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.440
Those three things
led me to question

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.280
how the group that had
raised me and formed me

00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.330
didn't accept me
fully as a lesbian.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.480
And so the challenge went
to the community as opposed

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.700
to a challenge to God.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.920
It was a question
of if you believe

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:12.340
that we are all supposed to be
free people, why am I not free?

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.194
If I'm supposed to be
responsible for who I am

00:23:15.194 --> 00:23:16.860
and for making the
world a better place,

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.330
why aren't we all
doing this together?

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:21.480
And it really became
the impetus for me

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.700
to work within my
religious community

00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:27.680
to foster and work
towards the changes

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.340
that I felt were consistent
with who we claim

00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:34.467
to be as a religious group.

00:23:34.467 --> 00:23:36.800
FAISAL ALAM: Yeah, these are
very challenging questions,

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:37.300
Anmol.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.264
I was very impressed--

00:23:40.264 --> 00:23:42.180
not your traditional
questions that we usually

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.210
get, which is like, what
does your religion say?

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:49.860
And so I think my relationship
with my higher power

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.650
and God is not
necessarily harmonious

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:57.090
because I do come from a
tradition that is viewed

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.140
as inherently homophobic.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:04.780
And many instances of that
are apparent around the world.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.290
And so what I
struggle with I think

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:11.370
is I don't have a mosque
for example or a community

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:17.110
that I can call my own,
especially as a very out queer

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.610
Muslim.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.550
If I wasn't out,
I probably could.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.590
But where I do find
community and I do

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:26.700
find God is when I'm
with other queer Muslims.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:31.704
And especially when you know we
have conferences and retreats

00:24:31.704 --> 00:24:32.495
around the country.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.170
During prayer times, we don't
segregate men and women.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.180
We allow women to lead prayers.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:47.670
We have folks come as
they are regardless

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:49.410
of what they're wearing.

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:53.280
And that's a really,
really powerful experience

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:58.380
to be with a group of
people without being forced

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.910
into these gender rigidities
that a lot of mosques

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:04.570
and in clothing rigidity.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.350
So I think on a personal
level, I'm still struggling.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.350
I've spent a lot
of time in therapy

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:15.520
and probably like thousands
of dollars figuring this out.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.870
But I'm also re-imagining
what my God is.

00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:22.260
And so, as Muslims we're taught,
that God Allah is the most

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.600
forgiving the most merciful.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.440
And from that I think comes the
element of most loving, most

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:33.960
accepting as well, and
really sort of reframing

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:36.283
my own sort of
understanding of God

00:25:36.283 --> 00:25:40.860
and realizing that the
religion, which is actually

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:48.070
just a man-made phenomenon
mostly by straight men who want

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:54.300
to stay in power, that
God does not necessarily

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:56.460
speak through them.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.720
And in the marginalized
voices within our faith

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.339
that is where my
God really lies.

00:26:05.339 --> 00:26:06.255
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Cool.

00:26:06.255 --> 00:26:07.590
Very interesting.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.510
So I'd like to switch
gears now a little bit

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:14.040
to talk about the human,
social, political, component

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:14.790
behind religion.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.520
I think you've talked about
your own personal experiences

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.410
with your spirituality,
your faith.

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.940
But I'm particularly curious
how you see your LGBTQ status.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.820
I think you've touched
upon this a little bit.

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:28.860
How you see your
LGBTQ status fitting

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.730
in with the larger
religious community

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:31.800
that you're a part of?

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.840
And then also,
conversely, how do you

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.220
see your religious identity
fitting in harmoniously

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.080
or not harmoniously with
the LGBTQ community?

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.750
Do you find that
there is some sort

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:45.940
of hesitancy or discrimination
on that side as well?

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:48.372
So I'm curious about both sides.

00:26:48.372 --> 00:26:49.830
KELSEY BROWN: So
when I tell people

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.190
I'm going to be a pastor,
their first reaction is, wait,

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.390
but you're gay.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:59.670
And not questioning my
call or the way in which

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.010
I feel connected to
God and why I feel

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:06.960
called to pursue this
as a career, but more

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:13.950
how I have reconciled my
identity to be in a place

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.560
where many deem not safe.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:23.250
And I have found that through
working with the ELCA LGBT

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:29.610
advocacy group Proclaim that
I have found many people that

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:35.620
are struggling to place these
particular identities not

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.900
on a hierarchy, but
rather on a continuum of--

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.280
some days when I'm in
the church I am Lutheran,

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.540
and that is what I am doing.

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.620
And then some days I am
there but I am very queer.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.900
And then the other
days I am there,

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.450
and I am battling
white supremacy which

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.870
is deeply rooted in the ELCA.

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.180
And then I am
unapologetically black.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.020
And some days all three
of those are battling

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.250
to see which one will win.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.450
It has been much more
difficult to live

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:16.170
into each of those identities
in our political climate.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.110
And I have watched as
many congregations have

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:29.480
struggled to place church above
some of those other identities.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.910
And perhaps that's our job.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:33.350
Perhaps that is
what we are called

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:36.510
to do is to place God
above any of those.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:42.740
But I don't think I can all
the time, and I try not to

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:48.200
because I think that God
has called the marginalized

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.800
and called the oppressed
to be the people that

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.190
push the message forward.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:58.100
And if I can't use each
of those identities

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:03.980
to further God's message,
then I'm kind of wasting it.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.550
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Sensei.

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:09.340
BARBARA JOSHIN O'HARA:
So Zen Buddhism

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:12.070
is a very ancient tradition.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.730
It's over 1,000 years old,
and our particular lineage

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:20.410
comes through the
Chinese, Japanese.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.500
But the beauty of
it right now is

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:30.040
that, in America, we don't have
a lot of institutional baggage.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.860
We don't have to
respond to a Vatican

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:40.580
or a main central agency
that's handing down orders.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.860
And so it keeps
reinventing itself.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.060
It's not that we don't
hold to the traditions,

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:55.090
but we're constantly looking
at ways to make them relevant.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:30:01.870
So it seems that we ourselves
and the Village Zendo, we

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:08.350
hold the tradition, but we
make it just a community that

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:15.110
is to practice essentially
meditating and getting to know

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.230
what our true nature is.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:22.480
So we have always
had gay people come.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.640
We're in the village.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.995
We've had a sitting
group a GMHC,

00:30:26.995 --> 00:30:31.930
and so we were very active in
the '90s with the AIDS crisis.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:38.530
We marched as the Zen queers
in the gay pride parade.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:44.740
So it's very fluid,
it's non-problematic.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.400
And because you have
two lesbians in charge,

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.440
word gets round, and
people feel at home.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.200
NANCY WIENER: I sit in a
unique place in the broader

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:06.630
Jewish world, being part
of Reform Judaism, which

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:11.460
is in the liberal
end of the spectrum.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:17.970
Being a woman rabbi and being
a lesbian are absolutely fine

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:22.690
and welcomed within the
liberal Jewish world.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.620
And I know that when
I march in a gay pride

00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:28.140
parade with a
Jewish group, there

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.600
are Jews on the sidelines
screaming and yelling

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:33.540
and saying that we
shouldn't exist,

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.630
that we're an
abomination, et cetera.

00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:43.750
I get equal heat from the most
right-wing Jewish groups as

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:45.604
well for being a woman rabbi.

00:31:45.604 --> 00:31:47.020
As far as they're
concerned, women

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:51.910
shouldn't be ordained
as rabbis and should

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.960
have a much more proscribed
role within the Jewish world.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:08.130
My feeling is that Judaism
is a religious group

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:12.390
and an ethnic group that
has evolved over time.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.440
We no more look like the Jews
who are described in the Bible

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.100
than any of you look
like your ancestors

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:23.470
from hundreds or
thousands of years ago.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:26.010
And our strength
is in our ability

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.940
to distill the enduring
values and teachings

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:34.020
and find ways to express them
and to enact them in the world

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.450
that we're living in today.

00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.360
It doesn't mean that
it's always an easy place

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.270
to be since there are
people who question

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.730
our very right to exist.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:48.820
But it also feels like the
place where I need to be

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.140
and where I can make the
most important contributions

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.230
to the world and to our society.

00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.630
FAISAL ALAM: Yeah, I
think the intersection

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:04.290
of being Muslim
and being queer, I

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:11.010
think for a long time our sort
of mainstream LGBT communities,

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:12.720
especially political
organizations,

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:18.390
were afraid to go into or
at least approach religion.

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:22.329
And so it's remarkable that
now a place like Google

00:33:22.329 --> 00:33:24.120
is actually having a
conversation on faith,

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.170
which just shows the
importance of including

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:30.120
LGBT people of faith.

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.990
Because we've always been
part of the struggle.

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:38.130
And that's all to say
that for LGBT Muslims,

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.280
and for myself particularly,
we stand especially

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.830
in this political climate
on at many intersections.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:51.420
We're a multiracial group,
multiethnic community,

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.490
multigenerational.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.790
I myself am an immigrant.

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.510
I'm a person of color.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.790
And so depending
on where I'm going,

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:03.720
I have to wear specific hats.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:08.610
And I guess what I
will say is oftentimes

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.170
when we're within the LGBT
communities, we're saying,

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:14.040
hey, don't forget
about the Muslims.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.530
And not just mainstream
straight Muslims.

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:20.080
Like, hello, there are
queer Muslims here as well.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.320
And then when we're going
into Muslim communities,

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:28.699
we're saying the same
thing with the LGBT voice.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:33.030
And so right now I think
we are particularly

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:36.960
a wedge issue that
is being used not

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.900
only by this administration, but
by conservative voices, where

00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.860
they're pitting Muslims
against LGBT people.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.179
And we saw this really
after Orlando as well as

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:52.080
in rhetoric that is coming
from the administration now.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.800
So we sort of
stand in the middle

00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:00.810
and say that we don't want to
be that wedge issue, that we

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.510
do belong to both of
these communities,

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.960
and that it's much
more complicated.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:10.680
Our identities and our politics
are much more complicated

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.299
than you all would
like it to be.

00:35:14.299 --> 00:35:16.840
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: You brought up
the Pulse nightclub incident.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.770
I think it would be interesting
to explore that a little bit

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:20.640
more.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.100
Can you expand on
anything else that

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:27.420
came out from your
experience of that incident,

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:31.220
specifically in relation
to how the larger Islam

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:35.460
community views gay people
or views the LGBT community?

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:40.650
FAISAL ALAM: Yeah, the
attack in Orlando--

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:44.330
we're coming up on the one-year
anniversary on June 12--

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:48.210
was a real pivotal
point for us I

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.270
think as Muslim-Americans
as well as LGBT Muslims.

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:56.250
It was the first time that
national civic leaders,

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.920
national civic
Muslim organizations

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:03.160
came out in support
of LGBT rights,

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:07.140
and that was a pretty
remarkable time.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:11.340
And so where we stand
when that happened was,

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.970
let's see what your
commitment really is now.

00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.370
Like, a, we haven't
forgotten about things

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:21.600
that have been said in the
past, but we want to show up.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.820
I think it's horrible that a
tragedy is what sometimes it

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:32.760
takes for communities to come
together and find common voice.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.180
And so this was
really an opening

00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.460
that we have taken
advantage of and moved

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.680
into by engaging mainstream
Muslim communities

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:49.170
around issues of inclusion
and acceptance of LGBT people.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.780
And at the same time, it
really put our community

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:57.330
in a spotlight that we
were not ready to be in.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:37:03.600
And it really brought
out a lot of trauma,

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.260
a lot of mental health
challenges that our communities

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:11.190
face because all of a sudden
the media was just like,

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.410
we want to talk to like
any queer Muslim that we

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.530
can in any kind of capacity.

00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:19.680
And so one of the things that
we also were doing at the time

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.250
was really controlling the
narrative that was coming out

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.830
because the mainstream
narrative would be,

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:29.250
look, here's a Muslim extremist
who could or could not

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.770
have been gay, and
maybe you know something

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.140
about that we don't know.

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:39.930
And so making this connection
that Islam is homophobic,

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.570
and that's why this person
you know chose what to do.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.760
And what we sort of
came in and said was,

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.770
yeah, it's not that easy.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.730
Let's talk about
toxic masculinity.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:55.620
Let's talk about gun
violence in this country.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:00.120
These are all other
reasons why this attack

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:03.070
could have happened.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.470
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Thank you.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:06.761
So I'm going ask one last
question before we open it up

00:38:06.761 --> 00:38:09.390
to questions from the audience
and from the live stream.

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:12.300
So we might have a lot of people
watching this over YouTube

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.040
eventually, and I
guess I'd just like

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.260
to ask you guys
in your own words,

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.690
if there's a young person
watching who's just

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:21.330
kind of struggling with
reconciling these identities

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:23.626
and sees them as
adversarial perhaps, what

00:38:23.626 --> 00:38:24.750
advice you might give them?

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:32.970
KELSEY BROWN: So I try really
hard not to use scripture

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.930
in the ways in which scripture
is used to sort of batter

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:40.770
the LGBT community.

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.520
And it sounds really cliche
to say that you are fearfully

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.570
and wonderfully made.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:48.410
But what I find most
affirming is the idea

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:52.490
that before we were born
that God created us.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:59.270
And that in that creation,
that creation was perfect.

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:03.040
And the way in which God
created the globe and the earth

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:09.080
and said that it was good, that
in our very being we are good.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:12.440
I think that that is
what I needed to hear

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.840
and could have
benefited in hearing

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.790
a lot earlier than I did.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:22.820
But on top of that, we
talked about in the room

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.610
before the ability
to occupy space

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:29.120
and to claim our
personhood in this space.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:35.600
And I would say that,
by sitting here and all

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.030
of us being a part
of this discussion,

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:39.920
that you can do this, too.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.910
God and a higher
power, for me, that God

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:47.390
is calling us to a
new thing, to be proud

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:50.180
and to proclaim him even
in the midst of people

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.170
trying to shut us up.

00:39:53.864 --> 00:39:55.530
BARBARA JOSHIN O'HARA:
Hard to top that.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.540
Beautiful.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.880
Yeah, the same thing.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:06.850
That we're each a
manifestation of the divine.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:13.660
I think it does help also to
find support, to find another,

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:17.680
so that one doesn't
have to be alone.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.780
Aloneness has its functions.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:25.450
But I think in the end,
having other people

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:30.400
so that one can relax
into self-acceptance.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:36.080
So finding others that you can
identify with and relate to,

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.260
I think is key.

00:40:39.954 --> 00:40:41.120
NANCY WIENER: I would agree.

00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.540
I would say to somebody
that it's really important

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:45.220
to know that they're not alone.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.920
That if they look,
they can find people

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.160
who are waiting to greet
them and accept them and say

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:53.380
we are a community together.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.250
And that the voices
that are telling them

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:57.370
that they can't be
who they are are

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.860
voices that will
continue to exist

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.040
but aren't the only voices
that are there to be heard,

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.757
and that they should really try
to hear the other voices that

00:41:05.757 --> 00:41:06.340
are out there.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.100
FAISAL ALAM: Yeah,
the Koran you know

00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.620
says that we are
created in God's image.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:22.020
And if God is perfect,
then we are also

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.680
perfect in all of who we are.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:31.530
And I always say that
it doesn't get better.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:36.540
It gets easier, but it doesn't
necessarily get better.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:42.120
And that it's challenging, but
there are many more resources

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.770
than there were before.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:47.530
There are community
groups around the country.

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:50.910
There are many, many
outlets through social media

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:55.980
for people to connect with and
talk to other LGBT Muslims.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:59.940
And there's also a growing
progressive Muslim community

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:06.100
that is both LGBT and straight
and that welcomes LGBT people.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.460
And there are now
places of worship

00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.780
in a lot of major cities where
people can go and participate

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.650
in religious
services or prayers.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:18.570
Here in New York,
for example, there's

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:20.310
a queer Muslim
community that holds

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:23.640
an iftar, the breaking of
the fast during Ramadan,

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:27.270
almost every day at
somebody's house.

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:30.420
And these are really
magical, special places

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:38.216
that young people are
welcome to and can access.

00:42:38.216 --> 00:42:40.340
NANCY WIENER: If I can,
I'd like to add two things.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.870
One is that we, too, emphasize
the idea that we're all

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:44.970
created in God's image.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.560
We also say there's a
prayer in Judaism that

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:51.550
praises God for the
diversity of creation,

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:55.370
and that that is a key idea.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.510
And we see our
mission in the world

00:42:58.510 --> 00:43:00.970
is to make the world
a better place,

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:04.000
and part of that is creating
a more inclusive world

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.792
and that they, too, can
be part of that process.

00:43:06.792 --> 00:43:07.750
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Great.

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:08.745
Thank you.

00:43:08.745 --> 00:43:10.120
So we have about
10 minutes left.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.940
I just want to open up for
questions in the audience.

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.380
I know there's a lot of
people watching on live stream

00:43:14.380 --> 00:43:14.879
as well.

00:43:14.879 --> 00:43:18.247
So there's a Dory as well.

00:43:18.247 --> 00:43:19.241
Any questions?

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:30.585
AUDIENCE: So this
question is for you.

00:43:30.585 --> 00:43:31.960
Correct me if I'm
wrong, you said

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.550
there isn't a mosque
that is LGBT friendly.

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:39.340
And it strikes me as
a lonely place to be.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.860
I mean, you can have the private
prayer meetings and stuff

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:42.360
like that.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:46.560
And I think in Christianity
there are outlets,

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.100
there are churches.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.100
You even find a rogue
Catholic priest every once

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:52.410
in a while that will give
a like a gay-friendly mass,

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:56.060
and in Judaism you have
the progressive side.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.960
Are there LGBT people working
to interpret scripture

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.300
at sort of an imam
level to create

00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:08.430
a gay-friendly mosque or
a gay-friendly safe zone

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.230
for the religion?

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.690
Do you know anything about?

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.356
And is it worth it, or will that
just create sort of a backlash?

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.780
FAISAL ALAM: So there
are definitely mosques

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.340
that are LGBT welcoming.

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.820
They aren't necessarily
open about it.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:29.190
I think there is a fear that
there will be a backlash.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.770
So there are imams who
have privately told

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:34.650
us that they are
open and welcoming,

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:39.420
but there isn't anyone who
is ready to take that mantle,

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.570
if you will, at least
a religious leader.

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:44.760
There are many academics
and scholars, though--

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.380
Muslim scholars and
academics-- that

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.260
have come out and
support, especially

00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:53.310
when marriage equality was on
the table as a civil rights

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:55.350
issue.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:59.550
And there aren't necessarily
LGBT-specific mosques,

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:03.030
but there are these progressive
Muslim spiritual spaces

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:04.080
that I was talking about.

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.820
Sometimes they're in churches.

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:08.010
Sometimes they're
in people's houses.

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.960
And it's really just
only a matter of time

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.310
before they become brick
and mortar mosques.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:17.640
And also, just to
recognize that there

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.480
is such an ideological
difference across the country.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:25.110
And even in a place like New
York, one mosque to another

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:27.000
can be extremely
different when it

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.480
comes to any sort of
ideology, especially when it

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.520
comes to social issues.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.610
But again, I think it's
only a matter of time,

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.680
and it's probably in
the next five years

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:42.900
that I'll see mainstream,
at least some imams

00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:46.140
coming out in support
and talking about that we

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.850
should at least be welcoming.

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:50.280
Even though we may
disagree theologically,

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:55.200
that Muslims should not
reject LGBT children.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.190
This was something that
Orthodox Judaism and a group

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.160
of orthodox Jewish rabbis
on issued a statement

00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.000
a few years ago, which
was a historic moment

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.510
for the orthodox
Jewish community.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:09.511
And I think we will be
following a similar path.

00:46:09.511 --> 00:46:10.760
AUDIENCE: Kind of a follow up.

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.460
So the academic
scholars, are there

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:15.930
are people working within
the Quran itself saying,

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:17.610
no, you're reading this wrong.

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:20.220
This means x, this means
y, and reinterpreting

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:25.110
some of the more what are
read as anti-gay passages.

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.350
I guess, are they backing it up
with, they're going to come out

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.854
like, we have the support.

00:46:30.854 --> 00:46:32.020
FAISAL ALAM: Yes, there are.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.020
There's a professor by the
name of Scott Kugle who wrote

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.850
"Islam and Homosexuality."

00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:39.400
There are also feminist
Muslim scholars now

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:43.750
who have already done work
theologically around issues

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:46.060
of gender equity and
gender equality, who

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:52.090
are now looking at sexuality
as sort of a follow-up of that.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:56.770
So people like Dr. Amina Wadud,
Kecia Ali, some of these folks

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:59.500
who are on the
forefront around talking

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.370
about gender and sexuality
are now looking at LGBT issues

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:04.280
as well.

00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:09.590
So there are more articles
and academic things that

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:10.840
are being written about those.

00:47:13.276 --> 00:47:14.151
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Yep.

00:47:17.709 --> 00:47:18.250
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:19.290
This is for anyone.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:25.230
What's the best thing allies who
may be struggling with religion

00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:29.700
as well, who are maybe
on the side of it sucks,

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:34.680
what's the best thing
they can do for you guys?

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.762
Because it can be
hard when religion,

00:47:36.762 --> 00:47:38.220
there are a lot of
bad parts of it.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:41.820
I grew up Roman Catholic, so
I have my feelings about that.

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.890
So what can I do
or what can allies

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:47.580
do to support the LGBT
community without totally

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:51.840
bashing religion if we may feel
our own type of way about it?

00:47:53.669 --> 00:47:55.585
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Anyone
want to take that one?

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.140
KELSEY BROWN: I would say
probably acknowledging

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.820
existence is the most--

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.630
it sounds kind of silly--
but probably the most

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:11.650
affirming part is for someone
to say, you exist in this space,

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:14.229
and I am affirming that
you are here and I am here.

00:48:14.229 --> 00:48:16.270
One of the most beautiful
things that my mom ever

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:19.090
did for me in church is,
when there was this hate

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:23.350
speech being preached from the
pulpit, she would hold my hand

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:26.530
and she would squeeze
it really tight.

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.780
She let me know
that she affirmed

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.570
that I was able to
be there, and that

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:34.360
was an important place for me.

00:48:37.377 --> 00:48:39.210
NANCY WIENER: Also,
naming the relationships

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:43.730
that you're seeing for what they
are as opposed to passing them

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:45.440
off as something else.

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.070
Many years ago, I was
at a synagogue speaking

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:52.250
with a women's
group where they had

00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:53.930
said that they had
opened their doors,

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:56.120
and they were
welcoming, et cetera.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:02.040
And they wanted to know how
they could make that known more.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.190
And I was explaining
to them that one

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:07.440
of the things that they
needed to challenge themselves

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.580
to think about was how they
could make the space one where,

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:14.520
at the end of services when
people would turn and kiss

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:17.040
the people that they were
with, that it wouldn't

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.890
be uncomfortable for people
to see two women or two men

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.170
kissing each other at
the end of the service.

00:49:22.170 --> 00:49:24.300
Everybody else's
family is doing it.

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.420
If the families were really
going to be fully welcomed,

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.940
then there should be a space
where that could happen.

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:33.180
It seems sort of
like a no-brainer,

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.640
but it's a big deal
for a congregation

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.600
to reach a point where that's
OK and to have the background

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.140
discussions where
they can say, if we

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.690
say we're a diverse group,
then that diversity needs

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:52.440
to be expressed in the ways
that are normative for everyone

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.290
in terms of how
we show affection.

00:49:55.290 --> 00:50:00.240
And really to encourage
people to express themselves

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.030
in more open ways so
that people can then

00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:07.680
move beyond feeling that
there is a barrier for them

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.914
to express themselves.

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:12.960
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Thank you.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.677
We have like two minutes left.

00:50:14.677 --> 00:50:16.260
Maybe if there's
like one really quick

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:18.660
question we can take one more.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.954
If not?

00:50:20.954 --> 00:50:22.631
No?

00:50:22.631 --> 00:50:23.130
Yeah.

00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.070
AUDIENCE: I know Anmol
asked for a quick question,

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:33.450
so maybe this isn't.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:36.890
But regardless, sorry.

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:41.160
You gave some
really great advice

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:44.670
to people who are
struggling, but many of you

00:50:44.670 --> 00:50:49.650
mentioned moments when you
encountered these roadblocks

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:52.350
or these contradictions.

00:50:52.350 --> 00:50:57.540
And I'm curious, how do you
personally overcome those

00:50:57.540 --> 00:51:00.740
emotionally or psychologically?

00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:04.710
What do you think
or say to yourselves

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:10.260
when that experience occurs
that empowers you to get past it

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:11.442
or transcend it?

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:15.880
Sorry.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:21.027
It's a long, complex question,
but seemed important.

00:51:21.027 --> 00:51:23.110
BARBARA JOSHIN O'HARA:
Well, from the Zen Buddhist

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:27.580
tradition, we
actually use koans,

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:33.550
which are designed to be like
roadblocks to the rational mind

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:36.580
and to frustrate
our usual approach,

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.580
and to generate a situation
where you're really

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:40.840
up against it.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:46.340
And interesting things,
I think, can happen.

00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:49.630
There can be a
force to surrender.

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:54.430
to And these are
moments when we do,

00:51:54.430 --> 00:51:58.120
at least I've experienced,
when we come in contact

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.660
with that which is
larger than just

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:07.195
my own self-encapsulated
identity or sense of control.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:14.160
That's what comes to
me is that roadblocks

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.260
are not to be feared.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:21.270
They can be a genesis
for awakening.

00:52:23.295 --> 00:52:24.420
ANMOL BHAGCHAND: Thank you.

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.570
That's a good note
to end on, I think.

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:29.520
So we're sort of out of time.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:33.390
I have like 20 more questions
that I wanted to ask you guys.

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:34.760
So thank you, first of all.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.340
It was a fascinating discussion.

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:37.560
Thank you for joining.

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:43.310
[APPLAUSE]
