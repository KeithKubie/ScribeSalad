00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.200
So you might remember a little
while ago, we made a film

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.930
called, Lighting a Match with
Water, where we heated some

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.330
water and passed it through a
copper coil, and then used it

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.130
to light a match like this.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.585
Stick it into the stream and
then withdraw it to allow the

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:26.710
air to get to it, and at that
point the match ignites.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.220
So that was all a bit
complicated and it inspired

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.755
one of our YouTube followers to
leave a comment, which I'll

00:00:36.755 --> 00:00:37.630
read to you.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.530
He says, why not put a bit of
sodium on the end of the match

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.350
and then put a small drop
of water on it.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.080
So basically, can we light
a match with just a

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.010
single drop of water?

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.740
I think is what he's
getting at.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.010
So, the first thing I thought
was that it's a little bit of

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.650
a cheat because it's just kind
of using chemistry to light

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.430
the match, which is what the
match does anyway really.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.860
But the second thing I thought
was, actually, I don't know

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.560
what would happen.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.650
So I thought it would
be nice to find out.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.060
Here's a huge lump of sodium
of which I'm going to cut a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.360
very small piece off.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.818
Nice silvery finish there.

00:01:34.818 --> 00:01:37.680
So, I'm just going to--

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.795
We have to keep it under oil
because it's so reactive.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.256
I'll try not to get sodium
on Bruce Hood's skull.

00:01:50.256 --> 00:01:52.870
Oh well, it's all right.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.070
So this is a little
piece of sodium.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.370
Sodium is what's called an
alkali metal from group one of

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.240
the periodic table.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.130
And all the alkali metals
are very reactive.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.780
They react very strongly with
air, which is why they're

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.900
stored in oil in the
jar and in here.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.640
But also very strongly
with water.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.974
Wipe the oil off a bit and
then damp this down.

00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:20.848
Throw it in here and we'll
see what happens.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.230
It's very exothermic
so it melts.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.275
So if you look-- so it's
a molten ball.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.590
So what we saw there was, well,
first of all, the sodium

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.860
melted with the heat from
the exothermic reaction.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.590
And secondly, we saw the flame,
which was from the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.310
hydrogen that was liberated
by the reaction.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.320
So the hydrogen came from the
water that the sodium was

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.010
reacting with, ignited with the
heat, and then the whole

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.335
thing burned for a while
and got so hot,

00:02:55.335 --> 00:02:58.010
it eventually exploded.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.060
The question is whether we can
transfer all that and get it

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.815
to happen on the
end of a match?

00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:07.507
Just poke it down over, our
piece of sodium, like that.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.560
I think this might
work, actually.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.430
OK, so that was kind
of all right.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.760
We managed to light the match
using the reaction between

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.860
sodium and water.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.330
I guess it wasn't a whole lot
more practical than using the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.490
copper coil and the boiling
steam, but there you go.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.040
But we didn't manage to light it
with just a single drop of

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.720
water, it took quite a lot.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.400
It would be nice to see
if we can do that.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.420
So I think the next thing to
do is to move a little down

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.140
the periodic table.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.760
So these are the alkali metals
here, so we just used sodium.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.180
So next one on the list,
K for potassium.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.020
So it's a lot like sodium
in a lot of ways.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.080
It reacts very similarly, but
actually reacts even more

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.450
vigorously.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.899
And that's because it's
outermost electron, which is

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.880
responsible for the reactivity,
is held on even

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.260
less strongly than it
is with sodium.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.190
So we're going to do the same
thing we did before with the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.880
potassium and we'll
see what happens.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.150
So that was pretty good.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.580
We lit the match with just
a single drop of water.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.770
If anyone else has any ideas
for some useless or useful

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.450
experiments they'd like to
see us try in the prep

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.700
room, get in touch.
