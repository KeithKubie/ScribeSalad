00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.001
 

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.637
(Western music)

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.842
(cow mooing)

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.020
- I'm a contributing photographer

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.155
to National Geographic Magazine.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.158
I relentlessly want to understand things

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.827
and particularly things that are not part

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:31.398
of my sort of orbit of perception.

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:35.668
(twangy Western music)

00:00:39.406 --> 00:00:41.674
(shouting)

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.979
I'm in Texas with the Hughes family seeing

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.147
what life is like here.

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.088
I'm interested in how
boys learn to become men

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:56.689
in different parts of the world.

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:02.529
Certainly, a critical
element of historic notions

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.098
of masculinity has been overcoming fear.

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:11.771
I have no idea how I'm going

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:14.040
to take the pictures of the bull riding.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.974
I have no idea.

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.079
This story has an aspect of it

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.648
that is pretty unfamiliar to me,

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.049
which is kind of like sports photography.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.617
I don't use long lenses.

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:26.653
I don't know how exactly I'm
going to handle this thing

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.288
that happens, like, very quickly.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.526
(shouting)

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:47.107
I don't think I got it.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.610
I don't know, I thought all the elements,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.480
you know, the halogen light,
the wide open awkward space,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.881
I thought it'd all be magic.

00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:00.206
Sheesh.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:04.357
Always, I've really strived

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:07.727
to explore larger subjects
through individual stories.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:11.131
So rodeo is a way in to something else.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:18.671
A way in to looking at Rig,
and Rowdy, and Ridge Hughes

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.740
and what their lives are like.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.242
How are these boys growing up?

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.580
It's a very different kind of experience

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.615
than I had growing up.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.183
And that, I think, in a lot of ways,

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:32.819
is what propels me to be as curious

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.987
as I am about these things.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:34.954
I want to understand things

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:38.992
outside of the world that
shaped and informed my outlooks.

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.564
(galloping hoofbeats)

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.207
The actual act of photography, I think,

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:55.909
is fairly intuitive.

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.978
The pictures that I feel
end up resonating the best

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.480
are pictures that were made in situations

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.517
where it's like, I'm barely
conscious of what's happening.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.921
(chattering)

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:12.825
Photos are imbued with a lot,

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.861
and they're shaped and determined

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.496
by where the photographer stands

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:20.366
and the moment that the
photographer chooses.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:22.335
And that's a lot of responsibility,

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:24.070
because as a photographer,

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.805
you choose, bam!

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.811
(Western music)

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.690
- [Mrs. Hughes] Good job baby, good job.

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:47.060
- [Pete] I think the image

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.628
that a lot of people have in their mind

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:53.233
of ranch life in this part
of Texas is hats and horses.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:56.369
But Kelly and Flint, I think,
are presenting their sons

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:59.806
with a pretty dynamic set
of learning experiences

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:01.808
as boys and young men.
