00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.180
SPEAKER 1: And so now, without
further ado, Sarah McBride.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.461
SARAH MCBRIDE: Thank you.

00:00:15.461 --> 00:00:15.960
Is this on?

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.626
Can you hear me?

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:18.150
Thank you so much.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.450
Thank you all for coming
out during your lunch break.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.680
It's wonderful to
be here at Google.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.800
My brother-in-law works
in the New York office,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.380
so it's great to be with family.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.994
My name's Sarah McBride.

00:00:28.994 --> 00:00:31.160
I'm the national press
secretary at the Human Rights

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.280
Campaign, the nation's
largest LGBTQ civil rights

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.700
organization.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.010
I am 27 years old.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.940
I'm a native of Wilmington,
Delaware, a proud graduate

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.860
of American University.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.830
And I'm a transgender woman.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.250
It took me 21 years to
muster up the courage

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.650
to say those last two words--

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.330
transgender woman.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.940
Today, they are among
my proudest identities,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.180
and this afternoon, I can
stand before you as the person

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.599
that I am.

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:03.140
But of course, I don't have to
tell you that it hasn't always

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.700
been that way.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.300
I remember as a child
lying in my bed at night

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.850
praying that I would
wake up the next day

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.660
and be myself, to just have
my family be proud of me

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.200
and to still be able
to pursue my dreams.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.946
I was a big reader of
history growing up,

00:01:19.946 --> 00:01:21.320
and in reading
the history books,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.920
it became abundantly clear
to me that no one quite

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.490
like me had ever made it
very far, at least no one who

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.810
was out.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.740
And growing up, it was
clear as the sky is blue

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.210
that my dreams and my identity
were mutually exclusive.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.870
And so I kept that fact inside.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.400
I told myself that
if I could make

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.539
it worthwhile for other people
for me to stay in the closet,

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.080
by making a difference
in this world,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.920
by making my family proud,
that those things would somehow

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.160
bring me wholeness
and completeness.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.490
I think one of the challenges
we have in the fight for trans

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.470
equality that differs in
the fight for gay equality

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.990
is that people who
aren't transgender

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.150
have a difficult time
understanding what

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.100
it feels like to have
a gender identity that

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.470
differs from your sex
assigned at birth.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.410
For straight folks, they
understand, generally speaking,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.060
what it's like to
love and to lust,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.550
and there's an entry point into
empathizing with gay, lesbian,

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.810
bisexual, and queer individuals
who aren't transgender.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.430
But because they
don't necessarily

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.940
have that analogous experience
for the experience of being

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.470
in the closet as
a trans person, it

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.580
becomes a little
bit more difficult.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.810
And for me, and while
every journey is different

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.940
and every experience
is different,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.690
for me, being in the closet,
not being seen and affirmed

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.300
as my whole self
by society, felt

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.680
like a constant feeling of
homesickness, that unwavering

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.750
ache in the pit
of my stomach that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.190
would only go away when I could
be seen and affirmed as myself.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.980
And unlike homesickness
with physical location

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.340
which dissipates
with time and getting

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.880
used to your new surroundings,
this homesickness

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.940
would only increase
with distance.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.270
During my sophomore year in
college after moving down

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.320
to DC from my home
state of Delaware,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.960
I was elected president
of the student

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.590
body of American University.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.230
And it was through
that experience,

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.900
it was through advocating
on a number of issues,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.040
including LGBTQ equality,
that it became clear

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.080
that the things I told
myself would make me

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.330
feel whole and complete, making
a difference in this world,

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.880
that those things
wouldn't actually

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.130
fill the void in my life.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.200
And at a certain point,
that homesickness

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.290
had become so all encompassing
that my gender identity was

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.000
a reality, was a
fact, that I thought

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.860
about every single waking
hour of every single day.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.340
I remember sitting in
church on Christmas Eve

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.560
night with my parents
listening to the choir sing

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.840
and looking up at the
stained glass windows

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.830
and just knowing that I couldn't
spend any more time missing

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.450
the beauty in this world.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.180
I couldn't spend any more time
watching my life pass by me

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.089
without fully living as myself.

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:06.380
And so I didn't waste any time.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.330
I came out to my
parents the next day

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.850
on Christmas Day in 2011.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.920
I kind of ruined Christmas.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.720
But you know what?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.839
It was a big present for
them they were not expecting.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.899
And while my parents
struggled with my news-- well,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.260
my parents made clear
that they really

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.130
wished this wasn't the path that
we were on, but they loved me

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.360
and that they would support
me in every step of the way.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.996
My parents, they
feared rejection

00:04:34.996 --> 00:04:36.120
in every sense of the word.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.750
And we sat down and we talked
for the next several days

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.570
as they went through
a mourning period.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.380
It sort of felt like
I was dying to them.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.750
So I sat down with them, and
I asked them every question

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.870
while simultaneously
listening to their cries

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.500
and telling them that there was
nothing I could do about this,

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.870
that this was who I am,
and these were the steps

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.340
that I needed to take.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.350
And so I answered
every question, mostly

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.760
beginning with, are you sure?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.890
And I said, I'm as sure as
of the fact that I love you.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.980
They asked-- my dad, a
progressive, asked me.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.710
He said, I don't
quite understand.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.710
One of the things that I
feel like we've learned

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.470
is that gender is
a social construct.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.387
And how do you feel
a gender identity?

00:05:18.387 --> 00:05:20.720
How do you have a deeply held
sense of a gender identity

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.350
if gender is a social construct?

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.760
And I told my dad that, for me,
gender is a lot like language.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.970
Language itself is
a social construct.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.910
Every single word has
been created by humankind,

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.110
but language expresses
very real things,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.300
the feeling of happiness,
that sensation is very real.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.360
The word "happiness"
is a social construct.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.310
And just like with
gender, where there

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.390
are an infinite number of ways
to express an individual deeply

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.890
held sense of your
gender identity,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.620
with language, with
everyday individual feeling,

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.210
there is an infinite
number of ways

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.550
to express that feeling, whether
it's in the different words you

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.550
use, or the different
construction of sentences,

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.350
or the non-verbals.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.010
And gender, in many ways,
operates the same way.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.810
And so these
conversations, they could

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.060
help my parents
intellectualize this news,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.320
but it didn't solve the
fact that they were scared.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.090
But with the courage
and confidence

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:22.390
that my family gave
me in May of 2012,

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.520
during the last day of
my term as student body

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.740
president at
American University,

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.810
I announced to the
broader campus community

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.190
that I was Sarah in an op-ed
in the AU student newspaper.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:36.250
I was very scared and nervous
about the university's

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.820
response.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.230
This was 2012.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.330
It was well before what
"Time" magazine called

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.570
the "transgender tipping point."

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:46.225
And I had seen the university
welcome gay, lesbian,

00:06:46.225 --> 00:06:48.520
and bisexual students
pretty seamlessly,

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.850
but I wasn't quite sure how they
would respond to a transgender

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.060
student, let alone a transgender
student body president.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.180
And almost immediately
after posting that note

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.380
and then posting the op-ed, the
messages of love and support

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.460
began to come in from
students across campus.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.380
And when I was student
body president,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.330
I always said that
our college campuses

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.430
should look like
the country we want

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.070
to believe in 10 or 15 years.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.580
And what was amazing was
that on that night in 2012,

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.510
AU was trying to send a
message to the country, which

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.750
is that while we may still
be learning about transgender

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.070
identities, and while we may not
totally understand transgender

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.580
experiences, this
is how you respond,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.480
with love, with acceptance,
and with support.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.910
One student commented
that the joy on campus

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.680
sort of felt like we
had just won a sports

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.050
championship, which I don't
know how he would know,

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.650
because AU doesn't actually
win sports championships,

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.310
but it was just an overwhelming
sense of joy and love.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.690
And it became
abundantly clear to me

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.770
that as difficult as it
was for me to come out,

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.620
it was relatively easy compared
to the experience of far too

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.740
many transgender people across
this country, particularly

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.750
transgender folks living
at the intersection

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.660
of multiple
marginalized identities.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.450
And so I wanted to make
sure moving forward

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.730
that the privileges that
I had in coming out,

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.260
of keeping my family, of being
able to continue at my school,

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.620
of being safe from violence,
that those would no longer be

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.870
a privilege, but rather
a right guaranteed

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.810
to every single person, no
matter their sexual orientation

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.720
or gender identity, because
it shouldn't be a privilege

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.100
to keep your family.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.919
It shouldn't be a privilege
to be able to keep your job

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.580
or stay in school because
you come out as transgender.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:43.356
It shouldn't be a privilege
to be safe from violence.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:45.230
So I moved back to my
home state of Delaware.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.490
I began working with our state's
equality organization, Equality

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:49.060
Delaware.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:51.190
Because at that
time, Delaware was

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.400
one of a majority of states in
this country that still lacked

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.740
clear and explicit protections
from discrimination

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.812
for transgender people,
and to this day,

00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:02.770
a majority of states and
the federal government

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.670
still lack those same explicit
protections for LGBTQ people

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.120
more broadly.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.690
And so day in and
day out, we went down

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.360
to the state legislature.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.040
And I started out
telling these legislators

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.650
about all of the stats
and all of the statistics

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:19.570
and all of the facts.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:22.660
But as I watched my parents
connect with these legislators,

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.980
I realized that my job wasn't
to offer the most cogent case.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.800
My job was to offer the
most compelling case.

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.900
And at the end of
the day, stories

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.300
have the power to make change.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.480
Vulnerability, I
learned, is oftentimes

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.840
our best path toward
justice and equality,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.450
because vulnerability,
it transcends geography.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.710
It transcends ideology.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:49.130
It transcends race,
religion, gender.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.981
Everyone understands what it
feels like to be vulnerable.

00:09:51.981 --> 00:09:54.230
Everyone understands what
it feels like to be othered.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.904
Everyone understands what
it feels like to be scared.

00:09:58.904 --> 00:10:00.320
They don't want
that for themself,

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.630
and hopefully, they don't
want that for other people.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.930
And so by telling
our stories, it

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.540
became abundantly clear
to these legislators

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.300
that behind this national
conversation on transgender

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.740
rights are, quite simply,
real people, people who love

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.800
and laugh, hope and
dream, fear and cry, just

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:20.750
like everyone else.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:24.110
And when they learn that
simple but radical fact

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.140
about transgender people,
they could no longer

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.300
look us in the eye and deny
us the equal protection

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.800
of the laws they
swore to uphold.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.060
And so in June of 2013, we were
able to convince enough state

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.120
legislators to pass the Gender
Identity Nondiscrimination

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.010
Act, and fortunately,
that night,

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.920
the governor signed it
into law in Delaware.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.830
But like I said, that
isn't the reality

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:47.340
in most states
across this country.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.732
And so I moved back down to
DC to begin working first

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.815
at a place called the
Center for American Progress

00:10:51.815 --> 00:10:54.170
and now at the Human Rights
Campaign to try to make sure

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.624
that the change we've seen
in states like Washington

00:10:56.624 --> 00:10:58.790
and states like Delaware,
while there's so much more

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.900
work to do, to at least allow
other places in this country

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.810
to see the change that we've
seen in places like Washington

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.960
and Delaware.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.150
Now, I come to
this fight, and one

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.560
of the most important stories
that I share in my book

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.920
is the fact that I come to this
fight not just as a transgender

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.750
person but also as
someone who's loved

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.270
someone who's transgender.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:27.090
I met my future husband,
Andy, fighting for equality,

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.210
and we fell in love.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.510
I admired his extraordinary
courage, optimism, advocacy.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:36.680
He was a transgender man about
three years older than me.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:41.090
After we started dating, Andy
was diagnosed with cancer.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:45.590
And after radiation, chemo, and
surgery, and eventually getting

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:49.100
a clean bill of health,
Andy received the news

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.220
that every single
cancer patient fears.

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.400
His cancer was back.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.020
It had spread.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.607
And for him, it was terminal.

00:11:59.607 --> 00:12:01.940
After Andy found out that he
didn't have much time left,

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.980
he asked me to marry him.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:06.380
And of course, the
answer was yes.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.540
Three weeks after his
terminal diagnosis,

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.560
we married on the rooftop
of our apartment building

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.720
in front of family and friends.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:20.210
And then just four days
after that, he passed away.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.990
And I share that story today,
and I share that experience

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.960
in this book, because
knowing and loving Andy

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.540
left me profoundly changed.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.360
He taught me how to
love and be loved.

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.430
He taught me how to
live the values I fight

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:35.700
for at work in my own life.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.510
But more than anything else,
my relationship with Andy

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.680
underscored for me that change
cannot come fast enough,

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.490
that every day matters when it
comes to building a world where

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.390
every person can live
their life to the fullest.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.880
After Andy passed away, I went
through the different stages

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.600
of grief.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.440
I went through
sadness and disbelief,

00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.860
and then I eventually
landed on anger.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.900
I'm not an angry
person by nature.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.184
I find petty anger,
the kind of anger

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:07.100
that you feel when you're
slighted by a friend

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.560
or feel under-appreciated to
be kind of a waste of time,

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.440
and I'm a pretty lazy person.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.140
But that's not the only
type of anger that exists.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.010
There's also righteous
anger, the kind of anger

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.260
that when met with a
mission and hope has,

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:24.620
throughout history,
helped change the world.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.810
Andy had had the
courage to come out

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.690
as his authentic self at
a relatively young age.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.830
He had the courage in college to
say to this world that tells us

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.580
that who we are is
wrong that he would not

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.950
spend one more day hiding.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:41.530
He was supposed to have 3/4 of
his life as his authentic self,

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.170
but because of circumstances
outside of his control,

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:46.960
he had less than a quarter.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:51.200
Some people have even
less time than that.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.840
Hope can be limitless.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.850
Ideas can always be found.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:57.380
Inspiration is often endless.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:00.710
But time, that is the
one resource none of us

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.390
can afford to waste.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:05.900
Dr. King called it "the
fierce urgency of now."

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:09.184
I was angry that society,
that a hateful world, even

00:14:09.184 --> 00:14:10.850
with his progressive
family and friends,

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:12.980
had kept that time
and truth away

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:15.680
from Andy, that had kept
him inside of himself

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.250
for what ended up being
a majority of his life.

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.350
And it made me
more fully realize

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:23.990
that when we ask
transgender people, when

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:27.170
we ask any marginalized person,
whether we ask people living

00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:29.990
in poverty or women or
people of color or those

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.430
with disabilities, when
we ask anyone to sit back

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:38.600
and allow a slow conversation to
take place before we grant them

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.660
opportunity and treat
them with dignity,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.970
we are asking that person
to watch their one life

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.430
pass by without the
respect and fairness

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.010
that every person deserves.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:54.410
This is truly a critical moment
in the fight for trans equality

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.500
and the fight for
LGBTQ equality.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:00.200
Over the last year and a
half at the federal level,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:04.100
we have seen attack
after attack after attack

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.350
on the LGBTQ community.

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.200
Not to get too political,
but the political

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.760
is personal in
this conversation.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:15.110
And just a few months after
taking office, Donald Trump,

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.720
Mike Pence, Betsy
DeVos, and Jeff Sessions

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.810
rescinded lifesaving guidance
promoting the protection

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.350
of transgender students.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.510
They've appointed
anti-equality extremist people

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.180
who've compared being
gay to pedophilia

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.610
and called transgender
youth part of Satan's plan.

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.530
They've appointed
people like that

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:35.950
to administration positions
and the federal bench.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.480
They've granted a
sweeping license

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.282
to discriminate to government
workers, federal contractors,

00:15:40.282 --> 00:15:41.740
and even health
care professionals,

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.730
against LGBTQ people, religious
minorities, and women.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:48.820
And of course, in one of
his most shameful moves yet

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.550
in a series of erratic tweets--
although every single one

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.960
of his tweets is erratic--

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.780
he targeted transgender
troops for his hate

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.570
by trying to reinstate a ban
on transgender people serving

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:03.010
openly in the military, which
is America's largest employer.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.050
But we also know that
the challenges facing

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.720
the trans community
do not begin and end

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.540
with the federal administration.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.930
2017 was the deadliest year
on record for the transgender

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.130
community.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.640
At least 28 transgender people,
mostly trans women of color,

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.210
were killed.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.240
And while that violence has
been on the rise in part

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.730
because of politicians
all too eager to appeal

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.400
to the darkest undercurrents
of American society,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.480
that hate is not new.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.420
I mentioned that a
majority of states

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:35.030
and the federal government
still lack clear protections

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.920
from discrimination in
employment and housing

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.010
and public spaces.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:41.180
And through it all,
LGBTQ people are

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.850
as diverse as the
fabric of this nation.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.650
And for those living
at the intersection

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.300
of multiple
marginalized identities,

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.600
those forced to face not
just transphobia but misogyny

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.080
and racism, the stigma, the
prejudice, the discrimination,

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.780
and yes, the violence, can
have often deadly consequences.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:03.550
In 2017, we saw over
130 anti-equality bills

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:05.589
introduced in 30 states.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.990
I'm very proud that here
in Washington, you all

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.810
were able to keep an
initiative off the ballot that

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:13.780
would have targeted transgender
people for discrimination.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.510
That sent a powerful
message across this country

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:19.599
that discrimination
will not be tolerated

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:23.530
by voters, by activists, by
people across this state.

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.119
But we still have
a lot of challenges

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:26.827
in state legislatures
across the country.

00:17:26.827 --> 00:17:30.490
And the two most frequent
types of bills we're seeing,

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.160
the first is
legislation that seeks

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.770
to utilize religious
freedom as a guise

00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:38.054
to license discrimination.

00:17:38.054 --> 00:17:39.970
These bills are coming
from the same folks who

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.700
are trying to keep people
from an entire religion

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.620
from entering this
country, and yet they're

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.690
trying to claim that
religious freedom allows

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.270
them to have a sphere
without LGBTQ people,

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.600
without interaction
with LGBTQ people.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.870
Religious freedom is a
core and fundamental value,

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:57.820
but religious freedom
has always been

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.860
a shield against
government persecution

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.000
for religious minorities.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.430
It has never been and
should never be a sword

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.980
to inflict harm on people.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.020
The second type of
bill we're seeing

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:11.020
are the North Carolina-style
bathroom bills,

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:14.020
legislation that seeks
to forbid transgender

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.990
people from accessing restrooms
consistent with their gender

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.280
identity.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.320
One of the most
frequent questions I get

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.530
is, why do we hear so
much about bathrooms

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.630
in this fight for
trans equality?

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.450
And the first thing I say is
that, frankly, transgender

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.260
people would rather,
for the most part,

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.690
not talk about bathrooms.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.000
We're talking about dignity
and equality and fairness

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.020
throughout daily life, but
yes, that includes restrooms.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.780
It's opponents of equality that
keep bringing up restrooms,

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.040
and they do it for two reasons.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.750
The first is the
knowledge that bathrooms

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.090
are politically potent weapons.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:51.550
Every single battle for civil
and human rights opponents

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.100
of equality have
sought to center

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.160
in on bathrooms in
the conversation.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.610
We saw it in the fight
around the Civil Rights Act.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:02.210
We saw it in response to the
push for the Equal Rights

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.710
Amendment.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:05.260
We saw it in the early days
of the gay rights movement.

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.420
We saw it in response
to the effort

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.430
to pass the Americans
with Disabilities Act,

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.550
and today, we're seeing it in
response to the transgender

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:14.520
rights movement.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.950
And they understand that
everyone feels a little bit

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.030
vulnerable in restrooms.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.184
Everyone feels a little
bit squeamish in restrooms.

00:19:20.184 --> 00:19:21.600
And when you can
stoke fears, when

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.690
you can take advantage of
people's ignorance and lack

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:26.760
of understanding of who
transgender people are,

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.080
bathrooms become fertile
ground for fear mongering

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.030
and for scare tactics.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:35.670
But it's also a little bit
more insidious than that

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.520
why they are focusing
on bathrooms.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.890
The reason is because
they understand

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.560
that if they lose on
every other issue,

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:47.160
if they can win on bathrooms,
if they can legislate or allow

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.080
for discrimination to
occur in bathrooms,

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.260
it becomes the closest thing
to a silver bullet to allowing

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.020
discrimination
throughout daily life.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.260
Because if you cannot easily and
safely access a restroom that

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.680
makes sense for you, it becomes
much more difficult to go

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.560
to school, to go to work, to
leave your house for more than

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.460
two or three hours.

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:09.180
And so these efforts are nothing
more than a thinly veiled

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.060
attempt to legislate and
push transgender people out

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:16.970
of public life, and we need
our allies to understand that.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.570
We need folks to understand just
how dangerous this agenda is

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.370
for transgender people
across this country,

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:27.560
that it's not just on
indignity, which is bad enough.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:29.740
It's not just allowing
discrimination

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.160
in one small area of life.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.380
It is nothing more
than an effort

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.830
to push us back into the
shadows and into the closet.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.710
But we've also seen in
response to every single one

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.500
of these attacks that
when a politician comes

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.630
for us, whether it's Pat
McCrory in North Carolina,

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:47.720
whether it's Donald
Trump in the White House,

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.540
we have seen that
each attack unleashes

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.260
a national dialogue that
only serves to open hearts

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.820
and change minds further.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.830
And in the end,
it ends up sowing

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.770
the seeds of the destruction
of the politics of hate

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.444
and the policies that
they seek to implement.

00:21:03.444 --> 00:21:04.610
We saw it in North Carolina.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.560
We're seeing it now
nationally, which

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.290
is that when our
allies stand up,

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.530
when diverse LGBTQ voices
are heard, when the business

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:15.970
community speaks
out, we can still

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.830
defeat the politics
of fear and division,

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:23.190
the politics of discrimination
and misinformation.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.780
One of the things that I carry
with me in all of the work

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.150
that we're doing is advice
that my brother gave me

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.690
in the last month
of Andy's life.

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.640
My brother, who is a
radiation oncologist

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.260
and has watched far too many
people pass away from cancer,

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:42.130
he said to me, this is going
to be incredibly difficult.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:44.760
But take stock in the
acts of amazing grace

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.759
that you see around
you every single day.

00:21:47.759 --> 00:21:49.300
And while it's almost
a trite saying,

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.850
sort of "find the beauty"
in even that tragedy,

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:55.750
it was a perspective
change that allowed

00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:00.910
me to truly find that beauty, to
see that hope only makes sense

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:02.710
in the face of
hardship, and to witness

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:06.340
the little miracles that happen
around me every single day.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.020
And it taught me beyond that
experience that all of us

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:13.720
can bear witness to
acts of amazing grace,

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.280
that even in the
darkest moments,

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.340
even in the most troubling
times, if we look around

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.950
for it, we can see acts
of courage, bravery,

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.380
and compassion all around us.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.690
And we're seeing it every
day across this country

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:28.510
in the people marching, and the
people protesting, and folks

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.810
showing up in record numbers,
and special elections,

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.050
and people standing up against
the politics of hate in ways

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.440
that we've never seen before,
and young people in Parkland

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.620
turning tragedy into action.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:45.052
We're seeing that amazing
grace every single day.

00:22:45.052 --> 00:22:46.510
And if there's also
one thing we've

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.934
seen throughout the
movement for LGBTQ equality

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:50.350
and throughout
every single battle

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:54.630
for civil and human rights
in our country's history,

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.250
it's that change
is always possible.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.970
It's not easy.

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:02.300
It doesn't happen inevitably.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.920
But with hard work
and compassion,

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.380
it is clear that we can make
more tomorrows better than

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.730
today.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.620
And I get to see that
change every single day

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.720
in my job with HRC.

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.420
When I came out six
years ago as transgender,

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.150
it was clear that my
dreams and my identity

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.130
were mutually exclusive.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.370
And yet today, I get to meet
countless young transgender

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:27.110
kids across this country, young
transgender people like Stella,

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:30.350
a 13-year-old from just
out of Seattle who,

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.350
when I met her last year
and asked her what she wants

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:36.170
to be when she grows up, she
declared without any hesitation

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:40.000
that she will be the first
transgender president.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.260
What once seemed so impossible,
that we could live our truth

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:49.010
and dream big dreams, is now
very real to kids like Stella.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:53.080
The mere fact that these
young LGBTQ people exist today

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.360
demonstrates how far we've come.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.860
But of course, the
fundamental truth

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.110
remains that no one
in any community

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:03.040
is totally equal until all of
us from the gay Muslim refugee,

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.440
to the queer undocumented
immigrant, to the transgender

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.170
woman of color living
right here in Seattle,

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.810
until every single
one of us is treated

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:13.580
with dignity and fairness.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:16.500
But I know that
that day will come,

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.570
and when it does, when
our understanding of "we

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.085
the people" finally
includes all of us,

00:24:22.085 --> 00:24:24.880
a young LGBTQ kid
will grow up and learn

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.430
about the struggles for
justice and equality

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.890
in their history
books and never have

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.490
to know what this progress
felt like to all of us,

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.290
because they will never
know anything different.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.190
And that will be because of
advocates and activists who

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.770
dreamed of a different world.

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:44.110
It will be because of LGBTQ
people, marginalized people,

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.820
speaking out and stepping up.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.920
It will be because our
allies worked with us

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.950
to bend the arc of the moral
universe just a little bit more

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.510
towards justice.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:55.220
So I want to thank you
all for having me today.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:56.770
I'd love to answer
any questions,

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:59.371
and I appreciate you coming
for this conversation.

00:24:59.371 --> 00:25:00.370
Thank you all very much.

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:04.852
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:12.930
AUDIENCE: So there are several
openly trans celebrities,

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:16.695
I guess you can
say, like Renee Cox.

00:25:16.695 --> 00:25:17.820
SARAH MCBRIDE: Laverne Cox.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:23.230
AUDIENCE: Laverne Cox,
sorry, and Caitlyn Jenner.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.480
SARAH MCBRIDE: Very different.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.450
AUDIENCE: Very different,
very different.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:34.790
Any comment on how they
represent the trans community?

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:36.810
SARAH MCBRIDE: It's
a good question.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.480
I think Laverne Cox is
an incredible person.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.450
I think Laverne Cox is one
of the best spokespeople

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.120
that we have for our community,
even though that's not her job.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.550
Her job is to be
an actor, but she

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.290
has taken on the
responsibility that

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:51.450
comes with being a
trailblazer with such grace

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:55.740
and such compassion
and such skill

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.400
that I am perpetually
thankful for folks

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.440
like Laverne Cox, Janet
Mock, so many others.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.760
Caitlyn Jenner is--

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:12.270
I'm very happy for
Caitlyn Jenner.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:16.770
I think, on the whole,
Caitlyn Jenner's coming out

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:19.020
has been a net positive for
the transgender community,

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.650
because I do think that
her coming out offered

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.430
an opportunity for conversations
that weren't happening

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.660
in far too many places.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.860
One of the best things that
happened that night the Diane

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:35.250
Sawyer interview aired was
that every single local ABC

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:39.030
station also after
that segment had

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.000
a story about a local
transgender person, not

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.430
Laverne Cox.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.420
Every single one featured
a transgender person

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.390
in that community, and so often
we hear from elected officials,

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.880
from people, "there
aren't any trans people

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.020
that live around here."

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.490
And that's just absurd.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:54.910
It's just not true.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.660
And so in having that
opportunity to elevate

00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:00.720
those stories, to demonstrate
the diversity of our community,

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.850
and the fact that we
are in every single area

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.280
of this country,
was truly profound.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:11.130
And I think there were
70-year-old people

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.519
in Iowa or in Arizona who were
having conversations, perhaps

00:27:15.519 --> 00:27:17.310
imperfectly, but were
having conversations,

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.410
about trans identities
and trans people

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.110
maybe for the first time around
their dinner table that night.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.510
And that's how change happens.

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:29.250
Now, I don't for
one second agree

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:32.110
with Caitlyn Jenner's politics.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.450
And I would love to have a
prolonged debate with her

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:40.200
about that at some point.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.166
But I'm happy for her.

00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:42.540
I think, for the
most part, we've

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:44.980
got some exceptional
folks who are serving,

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:47.349
as Laverne Cox says,
as possibility models

00:27:47.349 --> 00:27:48.390
for so many young people.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:54.090
And that's truly incredible that
there is a generation growing

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.700
up that's living
authentically they

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.890
can turn on their television
and see folks in television,

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:05.970
in business, in politics,
for the first time, not just

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:07.865
as themselves, but
succeeding as themselves.

00:28:07.865 --> 00:28:10.711
And that's life-saving.

00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:12.960
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for being here and telling

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.650
your story.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.691
SARAH MCBRIDE: Of course.

00:28:14.691 --> 00:28:17.070
AUDIENCE: And so my
sister is transgender,

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:20.460
and she wants to just
be perceived as female

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.890
and wants to erase her past.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:27.930
So I'm wondering, how do
you make sense of your past?

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:32.760
And what's it like being
out, being openly accepting

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.480
of your own identity?

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:38.160
SARAH MCBRIDE: So
that's a great question.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.630
I think one of the most
dangerous narratives

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:42.600
I think we have in
the LGBTQ community

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.430
is that everyone has to be out.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.390
Everyone has to be out.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.290
And I think that that
is an unfair burden

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.050
to place on an already
marginalized community,

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.630
I think, particularly for
transgender people, when,

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.090
in existing in this
world, if people

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:58.980
know they are transgender,
it can oftentimes

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:01.110
be an asterisk on their gender.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:04.230
And they know they can't be
fully seen as themselves,

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:06.690
which then causes pain.

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.200
I don't want to
cause anyone pain,

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.905
and I don't want to
have to go about--

00:29:10.905 --> 00:29:12.780
one of the things that
Andy always taught me,

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:14.321
and we actually had
this conversation

00:29:14.321 --> 00:29:19.170
around outing anti-equality
politicians who were closeted.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:22.534
And Andy said to
me, one, we're not

00:29:22.534 --> 00:29:24.450
going to open anyone's
heart by outing people.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.654
But I'm fighting for a world
where every person can live

00:29:27.654 --> 00:29:29.820
their gender identity and
sexual orientation the way

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:34.510
they need to, and that's
a principle that I'm not

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.760
willing to sacrifice.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:38.770
So I'm not willing to
universalize this notion

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:42.190
that everyone has to be out
in pursuit of a principle that

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.272
contradicts that tactic.

00:29:43.272 --> 00:29:44.980
And if my principle
that I'm fighting for

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.521
is not a first
principle that I'm not

00:29:46.521 --> 00:29:47.890
willing to break, then what is?

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.810
So I think we have to
get past this place

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:51.040
where everyone has to be out.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.860
Sharing one's story can
be incredibly empowering.

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.470
I want to build a
world where people

00:29:56.470 --> 00:30:00.220
can be seen as trans people
and be seen fully as the gender

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:03.082
identity that they are.

00:30:03.082 --> 00:30:04.540
One of the things
that I always say

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.420
is people write
"transwoman" as one word.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.250
And I say, no, it's two words.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.856
My identity as a woman, and
my identity as a trans person,

00:30:11.856 --> 00:30:12.980
they complement each other.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.710
They interact with
each other, but they

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:16.510
don't negate one another.

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.910
They don't change the other
fact about one another.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.340
I'm proud of my
transgender identity.

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.500
I'm proud of the journey
that I've been on.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.270
I think being transgender
has made me a stronger,

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.310
more compassionate person.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:30.220
I think being
transgender helped lead

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.190
me to find the love of my life,
and I think being transgender

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.770
has brought me into a
community that is beautiful

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:40.040
and part of the rich diversity
of this country and this world.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:42.460
And so there are
going to be people,

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.250
for me, who aren't willing
to see me as a woman,

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:51.970
because I'm also out as trans,
and I'm fortunate to have,

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.100
I think, privileges
that shield me

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.500
from the consequences of
those stigmas and biases.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.960
It doesn't bother me either.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.610
At the end of the day, it
doesn't cause me pain any more.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.880
It maybe used to.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.640
But for those who
would experience pain,

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.910
I would never want
to say to them, well,

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:14.259
you have to go through even
more for a political end.

00:31:14.259 --> 00:31:16.300
Even if that political
end is a moral imperative,

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:19.390
I'm not willing to require
someone to live their life,

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.640
to watch their life pass
by, or to experience

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.364
more pain in their one
life for this movement.

00:31:24.364 --> 00:31:26.780
There are so many other ways
that we can achieve equality.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.530
So those are sort of my
individual feelings about me

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:31.420
being out, but also my
feelings more broadly

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.740
about not requiring other
people who are LGBTQ to be out.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:41.140
AUDIENCE: So that the
Human Rights Campaign

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:46.949
does not have the best track
record for trans advocacy.

00:31:46.949 --> 00:31:47.740
SARAH MCBRIDE: Mhm.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.210
AUDIENCE: For example, there
is the scorecard for lots

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:57.100
of large companies
that will mark 100%,

00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:00.130
"this company is great
for LGBTQ folks,"

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:08.115
and their medical insurance will
have trans exclusion clauses.

00:32:08.115 --> 00:32:09.490
SARAH MCBRIDE:
They can't get 100

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.220
if they have exclusion clauses.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.920
That has changed.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.360
AUDIENCE: That has changed, OK.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.890
SARAH MCBRIDE:
Now-- sorry, if you

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.250
want to finish your question,
and I can respond to all of it.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:20.420
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.294
SARAH MCBRIDE: Sorry.

00:32:21.294 --> 00:32:25.660
AUDIENCE: I was just asking
that now that you're with HRC,

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:28.781
what positive changes have
you seen in that organization?

00:32:28.781 --> 00:32:30.530
SARAH MCBRIDE: So
that's a great question.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:33.580
I appreciate you
asking that question.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.300
So the first, on the
question of the CEI,

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.350
there is a
requirement in the CEI

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:42.610
that companies don't have
exclusions, that companies have

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.110
inclusive health insurance.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:46.990
Now, that doesn't always
mean that every single,

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.490
unfortunately,
health insurance plan

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:53.740
is going to cover the full
range of services and procedures

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.360
that transgender people need.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.950
And that's an
ongoing conversation

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.100
that we continue to work
with insurance providers

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:03.269
on ensuring that
their standards are

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:05.560
truly inclusive of the medical
needs of the transgender

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.880
community.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.420
But the CEI does require trans
inclusive health benefits,

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:16.390
and actually, we've seen, in the
several years since that aspect

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:19.930
has been included in CEI,
and because of so many people

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.950
within companies articulating
and advocating for change,

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:27.640
but we've seen that the
percentage of major companies

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:29.830
that are scored by the
CEI that have trans

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:32.110
inclusive health insurance,
or don't have exclusions

00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:34.270
at the very least, has
gone from single digits

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.620
percentage wise to
60-something percent.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:42.170
So on that front,
the CEI, I think,

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.310
is always evolving and
always constantly looking

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:48.250
at what are best practices,
and best practices, rightfully,

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:51.160
are always evolving and
changing and improving.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.890
But on the specific question
of health insurance,

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.660
we do require that.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:58.660
One of the major
elements of scoring

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.450
is that there aren't exclusions.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:04.905
More broadly-- so
I'll be upfront

00:34:04.905 --> 00:34:06.280
about this history
for folks that

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.070
don't have quite
the same context.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.139
In 2007, the Human
Rights Campaign

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:13.420
continued to support the
Employment Nondiscrimination

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.060
Act even after gender
identity was stripped out

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.540
by Democrats in the
House of Representatives.

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:22.181
And that was a decision that
was wrong, plain and simple.

00:34:22.181 --> 00:34:24.639
I don't think there's anyone
at the organization that would

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:26.290
make that same decision twice.

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.420
The organization's new
leadership, Chad Griffin,

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.340
has apologized for that.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.487
We have a principle
that is unbreakable

00:34:32.487 --> 00:34:34.570
that we will never support
legislation that is not

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:37.060
inclusive of gender identity.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:41.440
And one of the
things that I truly

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.300
appreciate about my
colleagues at HRC

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:46.630
is they understand that
that was a decision that

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:50.590
left real scars for
a lot of people,

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:55.750
and that changes in
perceptions and people healing

00:34:55.750 --> 00:35:00.279
from that pain and that
wound, that healing

00:35:00.279 --> 00:35:01.320
doesn't happen overnight.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.782
That takes time.

00:35:02.782 --> 00:35:04.240
And one of the
things that I really

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.150
value about my colleagues, both
trans and cis-- "cis gender"

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.370
is a term for people
who aren't transgender--

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:12.864
is that they understand
that even though there is

00:35:12.864 --> 00:35:15.280
a ton of great work happening
at the Human Rights Campaign

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.130
today on trans issues,
that it's going to require

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:24.360
that sustained investment before
people are willing to forgive,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.280
and frankly, they'll
never forget,

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.962
that those scars are
deep, and they're lasting.

00:35:29.962 --> 00:35:31.420
What are some of
the things in some

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.961
of the work that I see right
now in the Human Rights Campaign

00:35:33.961 --> 00:35:34.780
on trans issues?

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.520
First, I wouldn't go
to an organization

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:40.360
that I wasn't totally
positive was 150% behind,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.580
passionate about,
and centering trans

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.890
equality work in their work.

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:46.820
Before I was on staff
at HRC, I talked

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.820
about the Gender Identity
Nondiscrimination bill

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:49.340
in Delaware.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.189
And I can tell you without
any question in my mind

00:35:52.189 --> 00:35:54.730
as the person who helped lead
that effort in Delaware that we

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:57.100
would have not passed
that bill without HRC.

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:58.891
HRC came in with resources.

00:35:58.891 --> 00:35:59.890
They came in with staff.

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:01.060
They came in with expertise.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.060
They came in with skill.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.910
They came in with
mobilization efforts

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:06.280
that truly allowed us to
pass both marriage equality

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:09.070
and gender identity protections
within a month of each other,

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.900
which is historic.

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.730
And I saw that passion.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:13.480
I saw that skill.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.720
I saw that commitment from
the staff, from Chad Griffin

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.310
on down.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:21.640
And I have seen firsthand and
been the beneficiary firsthand

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.330
of that work.

00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:29.920
Every organization is
always on a path for growth.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.150
No organization is perfect.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.180
There's always more
that can be done.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.290
But in terms of
the progress I've

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.160
seen over the last
several years,

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.000
trans work is probably 60% to
70% of our work at this point.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.670
Trans work is not just at
the center of the movement,

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:51.750
but it's at the center of the
work that we do every day.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:58.579
We put an unprecedented amount
of staff, volunteers, and money

00:36:58.579 --> 00:37:00.870
into the state of North
Carolina to specifically defeat

00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:05.580
Pat McCrory after HB2, because
we understood that defeating

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.310
Pat McCrory would send a
really important message

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.740
to anti-equality politicians
that if you come for us,

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:13.156
we're going to come for you,
not just the trans community,

00:37:13.156 --> 00:37:15.080
but the LGBTQ community
and our allies

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.360
will come for you
on Election Day.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.520
I see the amazing
trans work that's

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.040
happening in our
foundation programs, which

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.390
is working to ensure that our
schools are inclusive of trans

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.910
and gender nonconforming and
non-binary and gender-expansive

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.510
students, making sure that
our hospitals are becoming

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:34.330
a bit more safer.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:36.774
As someone who's been a
caregiver and a patient

00:37:36.774 --> 00:37:38.190
in a hospital as
a trans person, I

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.023
know just how important
that is and how much

00:37:40.023 --> 00:37:41.280
work there remains to be done.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.220
So we have a team that's
working specifically

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:48.420
on expanding hospital safety and
access, and a lot of their work

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.550
is trans focused.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:52.260
At the state level--

00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.540
for instance, there was a
battle in Pennsylvania--

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.690
we removed our support for
a bill, a nondiscrimination

00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:00.597
bill, that still
included gender identity,

00:38:00.597 --> 00:38:02.430
but they stripped out
public accommodations.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.950
And we knew that stripping
out public accommodations

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.920
would disproportionately harm
the transgender community,

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:10.440
and so we said we can no
longer support this bill.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.500
And the bill died in
part because of us

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:16.470
and other organizations saying,
this is a first principle.

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.380
Any legislation that
disproportionately does not

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.580
protect the trans community is
legislation we can't support.

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.200
We're hiring more
trans staffers.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.240
I think the diversity
on our staff,

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:29.760
both in terms of gender
identity and trans identities,

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.260
but also in terms of race and
religion, immigration status,

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.180
all of these
different identities

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.077
that make up a diverse
workforce, that we're

00:38:39.077 --> 00:38:41.160
consistently trying to
make sure that we're hiring

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.451
more diverse staff, more
trans and gender nonconforming

00:38:43.451 --> 00:38:46.200
people, not just in
entry level positions,

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.200
but also in senior leadership
positions and public positions

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.290
and communications and the
foundation and our legal team.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:53.850
So I've seen a lot of progress.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.520
I'm really passionate about
the work that we're doing

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.430
and the fact that I didn't
join an organization because I

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:03.150
wanted to come in and try to
make it start doing trans work.

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.834
I came into this organization
because I saw firsthand

00:39:05.834 --> 00:39:08.250
just how much they were doing
and just how skillfully they

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:09.157
were doing it.

00:39:09.157 --> 00:39:09.990
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.031
SARAH MCBRIDE: Thank you.

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.109
AUDIENCE: First of all,
thank you so, so much.

00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:18.150
SARAH MCBRIDE: I have had
a cough for four weeks,

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:20.610
so I apologize.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:22.920
AUDIENCE: So my
question is I know

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:27.270
and I know of a lot of people
whose opinions on trans people

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:30.240
are pretty uninformed by actual
interactions with or hearing

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.660
the stories of trans people
that are often very sort

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.240
of biological essentialist
or very rooted

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:39.360
in data gender theory.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.340
And I was wondering
how you interact

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.400
with people like that,
people who may not even

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.100
think that they know any
trans people, without taking

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.620
the whole burden on
yourself to try to humanize

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.500
yourself or make this about--

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.550
to try to convince them
that trans people are

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.410
real and people.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:58.090
SARAH MCBRIDE: So
that's a great question.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:00.900
I think in terms of
how do I deal with it,

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:03.390
I feel a particular
responsibility

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:04.930
to deal with that.

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:07.140
And I feel a particular
responsibility in the fact

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:13.800
that this is my job
to be willing to bear

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:16.709
a bit more of that burden
of humanizing and educating.

00:40:16.709 --> 00:40:18.250
I think there are
a couple of things.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.130
One, there are
certain things that I

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:23.190
am firm about that I'm
not going to talk about.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.470
My personal medical
history is just that.

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.880
It's personal.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:31.770
And I am pretty
clear, particularly

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:35.420
if a reporter asks me about
that, that I politely push back

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.420
and just say, I'm sorry.

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:37.780
I'm not comfortable
talking about that,

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.970
certainly not on the record.

00:40:42.097 --> 00:40:43.680
There are some people
who aren't going

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:46.860
to change their mind either
ever or in one sitting,

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.700
and I think understanding that
and sort of freeing myself

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.340
from that responsibility of
feeling like if I don't change

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:57.540
everyone from A to Z in one
sitting then I've failed,

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:01.950
or I'm not doing a good job,
I think that's been freeing

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:02.850
in many ways.

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:03.780
My approach is this.

00:41:07.110 --> 00:41:10.900
I know that there's a lot
of ignorance out there.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.200
I want allies to
educate themselves,

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.900
but I understand that it's
also difficult to not know

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.200
what you don't know.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.120
And so people are
going to make mistakes.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.490
People are going to come in
with knowledge gaps that exist.

00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:27.920
If you're coming to me
with a genuine interest,

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.530
a genuine desire to understand,
if there's a willingness

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.300
to grow, if there's
a willingness

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.340
to not get defensive
if you make a mistake

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:40.740
and I politely correct you, then
I'll sit it, and I will engage.

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:44.670
If there's no
willingness, then they

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.985
can come back to
me when they maybe

00:41:46.985 --> 00:41:49.110
grow the heart that they're
lacking in that moment.

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:54.570
And I think for the
most part, most people

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:58.860
are in that former category.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.700
I think most people are
compassionate people.

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:04.440
Most people are
empathetic people

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:08.220
that when confronted with a
human being in front of them,

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:13.636
when confronted with a story,
their hearts will be opened.

00:42:13.636 --> 00:42:15.510
Their minds will be
changed, and their hearts

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.051
will be opened at
least a little bit.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.250
And so I think
that, well, I don't

00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:27.700
need to spend my time with
someone who's doing this just

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.930
to troll or just to hurt, that
the vast majority of people

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.670
I can engage with
because they are coming

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:36.630
to me with a genuine willingness
to have their empathy tapped.

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:39.930
And I think that at the end
of the day, if we do that,

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.550
if we allow
ourselves to do that,

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:44.640
and if we allow people to make
mistakes, but offer people

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.250
the willingness to grow and
the opportunity to grow,

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.429
that that will make progress.

00:42:49.429 --> 00:42:49.970
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:50.770
SARAH MCBRIDE: Hello.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:51.730
AUDIENCE: I'm also from
Wilmington Delaware,

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:52.854
and I'm also a trans woman.

00:42:52.854 --> 00:42:55.264
And we have family
connections actually.

00:42:55.264 --> 00:42:56.430
SARAH MCBRIDE: Wait, really?

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:57.260
AUDIENCE: People that
I grew up with that

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.555
know your family, yeah.

00:42:58.555 --> 00:42:59.430
SARAH MCBRIDE: Great.

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:00.512
Can I ask who?

00:43:00.512 --> 00:43:02.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so your
brother is best friends

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:03.599
with my cousin, Phillip.

00:43:03.599 --> 00:43:04.640
SARAH MCBRIDE: Lamplough.

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:05.264
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:05.264 --> 00:43:07.456
SARAH MCBRIDE: Oh, my god.

00:43:07.456 --> 00:43:08.580
Delaware is truly so small.

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:09.700
AUDIENCE: Delaware
is really small.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.820
Every time you meet
people from Delaware,

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:11.930
you're like, oh, my god.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:13.690
Do you remember Charcoal Pit?

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:14.820
SARAH MCBRIDE: Yeah,
we've either dated, mated,

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.490
or are related.

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:17.850
AUDIENCE: Exactly, exactly.

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.590
So I was in trans activism here.

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.200
I'm a founder of Gender Justice
League for Washington State.

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.470
SARAH MCBRIDE: I love
Gender Justice League.

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:24.320
AUDIENCE: Dope.

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.750
We love you.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.980
SARAH MCBRIDE:
Y'all are amazing.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.521
AUDIENCE: And I was part of the
effort in front of the Senate

00:43:28.521 --> 00:43:31.170
to get the bathroom bill shut
down a couple of years ago.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.739
And I have since
stopped doing activism

00:43:33.739 --> 00:43:35.280
because it's exhausting
and draining,

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.050
and it will eat your life.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:41.670
And my masochism has led me
to the dregs of the internet

00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:42.930
to get my anger out.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:48.060
And so I see a lot of direct
misinformation campaigns,

00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.050
like intentional, structured,
toxification of communities.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.605
I see things like PragerU
and Jordan Peterson

00:43:55.605 --> 00:43:57.480
and these people that
come out with this sort

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.060
of low-level, soft-sell
disinformation

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:01.320
for the hard right.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.560
And I wonder how
aware/concerned are

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.150
people at places
like the HRC, which

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:09.010
I know you guys have legislation
as sort of your main deal.

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.610
And when it comes to
social communities

00:44:11.610 --> 00:44:15.780
on the internet like Reddit
or YouTube comments sections,

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:18.540
where do you guys feel
like the responsibility

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.850
lies to make sure that
these platforms aren't used

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:24.600
specifically to spread
this disinformation

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.470
and to sort of weaponize awful?

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:31.170
SARAH MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.620
So to the first question
of how aware and concerned

00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:39.340
are we-- very aware and
actively engaged on the issue.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.150
One of the things that
we have tried to do

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:45.180
is there are a handful of--

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.610
well, the vast majority
of the medical community

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.334
and scientific community
affirm the reality

00:44:50.334 --> 00:44:51.750
of transgender
people and the need

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:53.970
to have access to affirming
health care and affirm

00:44:53.970 --> 00:44:56.141
transgender identities,
the validity of transgender

00:44:56.141 --> 00:44:56.640
identities.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:57.760
There are a handful--

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.520
AUDIENCE: There's always
Paul McHugh just waiting

00:44:59.520 --> 00:44:59.895
in the background.

00:44:59.895 --> 00:45:00.770
SARAH MCBRIDE: Right.

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:02.800
Paul McHugh is a great example.

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.970
We have done a lot to try to
engage, educate the media,

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:11.490
to get statements of
opposition from their research

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:13.590
institutions, if they're
affiliated with research

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:17.850
institutions, articulating
that these positions are not

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:19.830
the positions of
this institution,

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:21.284
that this institution--

00:45:21.284 --> 00:45:23.700
Johns Hopkins is a great example
with McHugh as a hospital

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:26.262
too that my husband went
to as a cancer patient.

00:45:26.262 --> 00:45:27.970
And every single time
we got a new doctor

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:29.877
or nurse we would
wonder, is this person

00:45:29.877 --> 00:45:30.960
familiar with Paul McHugh?

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.160
Are they an acolyte
of Paul McHugh?

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.470
And will that change the
way they interact with Andy

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:37.540
and me because of that?

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.510
And so we've actually
spent the last two years

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.520
trying to engage
with Johns Hopkins

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.640
to get them to make a clear,
affirmative statement that Paul

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.070
McHugh does not represent
the positions of the hospital

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:48.660
and the institution.

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:51.270
Because those are
important statements

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:54.090
to be able to combat the
misinformation that Paul

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.940
McHugh, who's not a gender
or sexuality specialist,

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.517
but who has these personal
biases that he writes about

00:46:00.517 --> 00:46:02.850
in non-scientific journals,
but with a "doctor" in front

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.099
of his name that makes it
seem like he has credibility

00:46:05.099 --> 00:46:07.710
on the issue, to make sure that
we get these statements so we

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:10.680
can have them ready in courts
if he's ever testifying,

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.660
in legislatures if he's ever
testifying, and to again,

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:19.080
educate the media about why this
person is not a credible person

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:23.380
to be interviewing
on trans identities.

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.570
So we're very aware of that.

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.890
There's ongoing
efforts depending--

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:28.040
Bailey, I think--

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:28.750
AUDIENCE: J. Michael
Bailey, yeah.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:29.130
SARAH MCBRIDE: Yeah.

00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:30.420
There's a whole host--

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.607
there's a wonderful person
named Brynn Tannehill

00:46:32.607 --> 00:46:33.690
who does a lot of writing.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:34.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I know Brynn.

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:35.940
SARAH MCBRIDE: Brynn's
great, and we work actively

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.980
with Brynn tracking these
folks and making sure

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:42.720
that we're going in and engaging
with their institutions.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:44.550
The second question
of the responsibility

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:47.790
of platforms to make sure that
social media and the internet

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:51.870
is a force for good
as opposed to a force

00:46:51.870 --> 00:46:55.800
that it elects the 45th
president of the United States

00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:01.140
is, I think, one of the
most significant questions

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:02.580
before us.

00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:08.640
How do we leverage changing
and advancing technologies

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.360
for good and not for ill?

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:14.270
How do we address
the reality also

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:17.330
that in this individualized
media society,

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:20.870
half of the country is truly
not even hearing the other half?

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:23.280
How do we bridge that divide,
whether it's in cable news,

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.670
whether it's on
Facebook, whether it's

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:27.530
on social media,
where people are

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.600
going into these echo chambers?

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.270
And if you're going into
an echo chamber of hate,

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:35.570
it emboldens your hate.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:37.190
I don't have a good answer.

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:39.980
That's, honestly,
above my pay grade

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:44.540
in terms of what
are the mechanisms

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:48.455
that these individual
platforms should utilize

00:47:48.455 --> 00:47:50.330
or what steps should
they take to address it.

00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:55.160
I do think they have a
moral obligation, a business

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.670
obligation, and a
practical obligation

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:02.790
to make sure that they are truly
rooting out hate speech when

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:05.090
it occurs and
violent speech when

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:06.410
it occurs on their platforms.

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:07.785
If they have these
policies, they

00:48:07.785 --> 00:48:10.010
need to actually abide by them.

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:14.397
I think they need to make
sure that if they don't

00:48:14.397 --> 00:48:15.980
have those policies,
they are adopting

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.590
those policies, for one.

00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:20.750
I think one of the
exciting things that we're

00:48:20.750 --> 00:48:24.160
seeing right now is that the
generation just behind me--

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:27.290
I'm a millennial-- the
generation that are

00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:30.466
digital natives are doing it.

00:48:30.466 --> 00:48:32.340
I don't think they know
how they're doing it,

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:33.470
but I think they're
already doing it

00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:35.094
where they're bridging
that divide that

00:48:35.094 --> 00:48:40.910
exists across media, and
they're utilizing social media

00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:43.430
for good.

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:46.250
And I think that's going to
be the generation that truly

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:50.120
figures out how we
solve what feels almost

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.460
like an unsolvable
problem at this point.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.960
I know the obligations
exist, but I

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.270
don't have answers for them.

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:58.700
And I would certainly
charge anyone

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:02.030
who's working in tech
to actively grapple

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:04.010
with these questions,
to actively grapple

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:06.950
with the policies you have
and the practices that

00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:12.680
are occurring, because I truly
think it's probably the biggest

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:17.420
question we face, both the
echoing of hate on social media

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.190
that emboldens
hate and also this

00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:24.170
divide that no longer allows us
to operate from the same fact

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:26.240
patterns and the
same conversations

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:28.839
and keep us from talking
with one another.

00:49:28.839 --> 00:49:29.880
So it's a great question.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.130
I don't have a good answer,
but I'm passionate about.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:32.146
AUDIENCE: No, that's fine.

00:49:32.146 --> 00:49:32.646
Thank you.

00:49:32.646 --> 00:49:35.227
SARAH MCBRIDE: And I think
we need to address it.

00:49:35.227 --> 00:49:35.590
SPEAKER 1: All right, great.

00:49:35.590 --> 00:49:37.370
Thank you so much,
Sarah, for coming today--

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.827
SARAH MCBRIDE:
Thank you so much.

00:49:37.827 --> 00:49:39.210
SPEAKER 1: --and sharing
your story with us.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:39.918
We appreciate it.

00:49:39.918 --> 00:49:43.160
