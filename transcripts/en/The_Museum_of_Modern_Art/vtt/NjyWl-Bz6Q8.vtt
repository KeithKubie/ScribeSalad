00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.809
Hi, good evening.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.340
My name is Anne Umland.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.800
I'm a curator in the Department of Painting
and Sculpture here at The Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:27.360
And we are standing here in one of the Museum's
5th floor galleries in Midtown Manhattan

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.710
in between 53rd and 54th Street.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.550
And we are really tremendously lucky, because
it is after public hours, and that means that

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.310
we have this whole room full of art to ourselves.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:52.140
So I am here tonight to answer questions from
all of you about what it means to be a curator

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.780
here at The Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.800
But I thought that before we get started doing
that and more people are still joining the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.080
live stream, I could show you around this
gallery a little bit, take advantage of having

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:13.650
it all to ourselves, and talk a little bit
about the history of MoMA and of what modern

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.000
art means.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.740
So this institution, The Museum of Modern
Art, commonly known these days as MoMA, was

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.170
founded in 1929, so that is almost 90 years
ago now.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.920
And it was predicated on a very simple yet
radical idea, and that idea was that the art

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.380
of the present, the art of the now, the modern,
was as worthy of people's attention as the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.070
venerated art of the past.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.060
And the Museum has remained true to that vision
from 1929 on through to the present day.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.670
Although I think it's very important to stress
that right from the very beginning the term

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.520
modern and the term modern art at The Museum
of Modern Art encompassed many different things.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.119
I could refer to paintings or to sculptures,
to architecture, to design, to film, photography,

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.810
or these days to performance and media art.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.230
And I think that that idea of the modern as
being something that doesn't have a particular

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.950
style or a particular media or a particular
type of subject matter, it's an open-ended

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.390
proposition about what the new and the compelling
can be.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.760
And as you go through the galleries at the
Museum, the one thing, however, I think that

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.970
you can say that all of the creations and
the creators who you see on our walls and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.840
in our gallery spaces have in common is this
fundamental desire to make things new, to

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.300
create works of art, the likes of which we've
never seen before, to come up with new sorts

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:01.790
of visual vocabularies to respond to the world
and the time around us in different ways that

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.490
change and vary over the years.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.290
And I think when I say that here at MoMA modern
art can be many different things and that

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.910
it's something that the curators think about,
argue about, talk to our public about in an

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.270
ongoing basis is one great example of thinking
about how modern art can be many different

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.020
things is to begin right here in this gallery.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:32.300
And so to talk a little bit about what we're
looking at here, we're in a room, and here

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.300
I'm working with Nathan.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.370
Nathan is behind the camera, and he has agreed
to follow me around, so I'm not gonna move

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.180
too quickly.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.600
But we're in a gallery that so curatorially
speaking we would say we are in a monographic

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.600
gallery.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.840
In other words, we are in a space where all
the works installed with only two exceptions

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.840
are by a single artist and that artist, in
this case, is someone named Pablo Picasso.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.459
And I think it's probably fair to say that
in the mind of the general public to the degree

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.290
I can see into the mind of the general public,
which is quite debatable, but, anyway, I think

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.300
it is fair to say that the term modern art
and the name Pablo Picasso are almost virtually

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.310
synonymous, and he is an artist that has been
written into this institution's DNA virtually

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.879
from the start.

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:24.370
So this is a room that features Picasso's
works, which is a curatorial decision, because,

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.999
of course, with gallery installations, you
could have many different artists in the same

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.999
gallery.

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.219
You could hang only pictures with the color
red.

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:37.069
You could decide to show only collages or
awesome blushes or sculptures.

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:42.210
You could look at works created in particular
cities or in a particular year, but in this

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.020
case, the curators chose to devote a gallery
to Pablo Picasso's art and to a particular

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.479
slice of that art moreover.

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:59.830
The works in this gallery, the earliest, this
here on my left from 1906 where you see Picasso

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:07.039
in his 20s beginning to work in a way that
is still relatively naturalistic.

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.169
You can still recognize the subject matter.

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.729
The colors and hues are harmonious and delicate.

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.520
But as you move around the room, however,
and by the end, you'll get all the way to

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.539
1915, so what is that, 1906 to 1915, so nine
years, you watch Picasso taking on the task

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:31.099
of reinventing the language of Western pictorial
art.

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:37.670
He looks to sources as varied as ancient Iberian
sculpture with the two nudes from 1906 here

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.789
on my left.

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:45.330
And by the time we spin around to the work
that we started out with, which is Pablo Picasso's,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:53.539
or started out with behind me, Pablo Picasso's
painting of 1907 known by the title, "Les

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.589
Demoiselles d'Avignon."

00:05:55.589 --> 00:06:01.879
This is a work of Picasso referred to as his
exorcism picture, as the work in which he

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:08.300
set out to upend the ways that paintings,
and compositions, and themes, and subjects

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.050
had been constructed before.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.830
I think it is fair to say that to this day
it remains one of the most confrontational,

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:24.529
aggressive paintings in the history of Western
art with the way that the five protagonists

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:25.680
stare right out at us.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.220
You could say on the one hand that they are
objectified.

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.699
It is a picture of five naked women on the
one hand, but the way that their gazes lock

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.210
in on ours objectify us.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.009
This is a moment where Picasso in his search
to come up with new ways to making pictures

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:48.499
is looking to sources as varied as Oceanic
art, African art, Egyptian art, El Greco.

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:53.020
So he's creating a picture that isn't unified
in terms of its style, it's a picture that's

00:06:53.020 --> 00:07:00.050
not unified in terms of its space, and that
is willfully deformed and ugly and confrontational

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.470
in that way, and I think from that moment
on Picasso never looked back.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:12.240
So the rest of this gallery takes you through...you
watch Picasso.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.409
This is a sculpture that he made in 1909 in
a very closely related painting here on the

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:19.409
left.

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:24.429
So again, tonight we're gonna be talking about
things that curators do or that they decide.

00:07:24.429 --> 00:07:30.469
Here, Picasso is along with Henri Matisse,
one of the great painter, sculptors of the

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:31.469
20th century.

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:35.900
So it was very important to the curator that
we show him working not only in two dimensions

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.639
but in three and the way that those two aspects
of his production inform each other.

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:46.270
Or then as you move down this wall, so, as
I said, I think before, I can't remember,

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.520
another decision made was to hang the works
in this room in chronological order, so that

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:56.550
as you circumnavigate, you're going from 1906
now through 1909.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:08.080
You get over here to probably the most abstract
that Picasso ever gets to the least, easily

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.080
recognizable.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.360
This art historians refer to the style of
a work like this as high analytic cubism.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:22.729
But I think what you get a sense of is Picasso
trying to find a way to capture the intensity

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:29.610
of the way that he perceives the world by
actually trying to go back to some state prior

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:34.159
to all the learned languages that...you know,
he was such a gifted draftsman.

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:35.930
He studied at the academy.

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:41.620
Here he is renouncing or denying all that,
creating a picture that lacks color virtually,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:46.950
that is made up of drawn lines, of shimmering
planes, of shifting perception, and a way

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:52.180
that I think hints at the complexity of the
way that Picasso saw the world.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:58.160
And then right next to it, from just a few
years later is a much simpler object, right?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:05.440
And radically recognizable relative to the
opacity of "Ma Jolie," so this is a sheet

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.660
metal guitar that Picasso made in 1914.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:15.880
And it is for all its humble subject matter
or, in fact, because of its humble subject

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:23.470
matter, because if you think, in 1914 sculptures
more often were figures on pedestals, right?

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.460
They were not just common everyday still life
objects.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:32.080
And they were commonly made from precious
things like bronze, or marbles, or granite,

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.730
or stone that was carved from an internal
core.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.871
Well, Picasso's sheet metal guitar is made
out of a common industrial material that is

00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:43.300
relatively easy to cut and snip.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.050
It is not made from a single core.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:51.710
It is made from multiple parts that are put
together in a way that is in fact so simple

00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:56.540
that one of Picasso's great friends at the
time and talking about this object said it

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:00.950
was so simple that any ignoramus in the universe
could make it.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:05.310
Now, of course, not any ignoramus in the universe
could make it, because only Picasso did and

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:11.050
had the idea, but the fact that he was creating
an art that was so simple that declared the

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:15.830
means of its making right out front was a
radical proposition at that time.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:21.730
And in terms of the history of sculpture,
another thing that is so revolutionary about

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:27.790
this work is the way that by opening up the
body of the object that we can see inside

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:35.220
it, Picasso was introducing air itself in
a way or space in as a sculptural material

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:41.620
for the very first time that I think if you
just pan back to look from the Demoiselle

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:46.860
down at the end and then on through the guitar,
or...

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:56.190
Oh, I really want to spin here to get Nathan
back, because I want to end up by this wonderful...this

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:02.140
is another sculpture by Picasso from 1914.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:12.250
It's one of a series of six that he made that
takes a glass of absinthe as its subject matter.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.070
So, I mean, think about this.

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.910
This is diminutive.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.920
It's anti-monumental.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.130
It is particularly interesting.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:24.510
I can't tell if you can see this on the camera
or from the viewer or not, but it incorporates

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.000
a real spoon.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.970
So this is one of the first times in the history
of art that you are looking at up an awesome

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:36.200
blush, right up a sculpture that is made out
of composite parts and not all of which are

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.720
made by the artist himself.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:44.570
The absinthe spoon was a sort that you could
buy at any flea market, and in fact, this

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:53.410
little sculpture rather faithfully replicates
what...if you were drinking a glass of absinthe,

00:11:53.410 --> 00:12:00.240
you would have a spoon with a sugar cube,
and you'd pour water over the top to dilute

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.240
the alcohol.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:07.600
So you can see that Picasso's...even he's
cast a sugar cube in bronze, he's cast the

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.310
body of the sculpture in bronze, he's cut
through it.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:15.990
He's made a glass, something that should be
transparent, opaque by making it in bronze,

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:20.990
painting over it and at the same time giving
us all these little peek-a-boo views into

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:26.730
it so that figuring transparency, again, in
a sculpture that we would normally think about

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.740
as solid.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:35.670
So I think to conclude, to wrap up this portion
of our live stream and to move on to questions,

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:41.260
because I know a lot of people are joining
us and the questions are coming in, I'd simply

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:48.660
say that in this room, as I said at the beginning,
a decision was made to look at a slice of

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:55.191
Picasso's work and to bring him in this case
right up to the eve of World War I, and I

00:12:55.191 --> 00:13:00.210
think that it's always important when looking
at works in the gallery or when curators look

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:04.360
at works in the gallery to think about what's
going on in the larger outside world or what

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:09.500
was motivating Picasso at the time, and it's
interesting with this work to know that absinthe

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.410
was banned in 1914.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:17.810
The French government decided that it was
too dangerous for people to drink, and so

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:24.160
in a way this little diminutive sculpture
is a memorial to this particular moment of

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:30.960
Bohemian Café life in Paris that was so much
a part of the early vocabulary of cubism as

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.850
you see here, and that ended, of course, with
the outbreak of World War I when so many of

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.720
Picasso's friends and acquaintances went off
to fight.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:47.080
So I'll see you in the next room.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:14:00.850
So, hi again.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:14.840
So now I'm seated in a different gallery,
so this is the first gallery on the 5th floor

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.900
and I think I can't see what they're
saying through the camera, but I bet you're

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:22.470
getting to look at Vincent Van Gogh's "Starry
Night" right behind me, so, lucky you.

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:26.400
And I'm getting to look at this whole crew
of people, which is very weird in the galleries,

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.990
but it's nice to have so much company.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:34.480
So, all right, we've gotten a lot of questions
from the trailer that we posted, so I'm gonna

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.250
start with some of those.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:41.470
But for those of you who are watching us at
home, please send us in your questions during

00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:45.650
the live stream, and they'll be passed on
to me by our producers.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.220
So, okay, let's see.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.820
Is this question number one?

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:59.740
All right, this is an Instagram trailer question
from Barbara Santagata.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:04.430
Sorry, Barbara, I hope I'm pronouncing your
name correctly.

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:06.290
So Barbara's question is a great one.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:11.750
She asked, "How long does it take to bring
an exhibit to life from first discussion to

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.280
opening day?

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:19.440
So, okay, well, the simple answer to that
is that it varies.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:28.910
It depends on the size of the exhibition,
who has the works that you want to borrow,

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:36.000
on how difficult the loans are to obtain,
but I think it's fair to say that for a major

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.529
historical exhibition, like Picasso's sculpture,
like the Francis Picabia show or other things

00:15:43.529 --> 00:15:50.320
I've worked on, it takes anywhere from two
to three years from the moment of the genesis

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:55.410
of the idea up until opening day, sometimes
it takes even longer.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:16:00.900
I'm working on a Sophie Taeuber-Arp exhibition
right now that I have been thinking about

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.940
doing since 2006, and it won't open until
2020, but, you know, I don't get to work on

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:10.600
it nonstop for 14 years, other things have
to come in.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.760
So I hope that answers your question.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:24.320
Okay, next stop, Instagram trailer from Carxissax,
great name.

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.300
I hope I didn't mangle it.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:36.901
So this question is, "What do you think are
the most important skills in being a curator?"

00:16:36.901 --> 00:16:42.360
Well, I think there are a lot of them, but
I suppose I would single out two.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:52.320
I think one is striving to have an endlessly
open mind to be flexible in your thinking

00:16:52.320 --> 00:17:05.480
and to be willing to look about and think
about things that are different or that contradict

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.010
beliefs that you have.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:16.439
And I suppose the other in addition to working
hard to keep an open mind and to be flexible,

00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:23.909
the other thing I think is important is to
be a perfectionist, to be asking right up

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:30.910
until the last minute every moment, whether
it is a text you are writing or a gallery

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:37.549
that you are installing or an exhibition that
you're organizing, is this the best it can

00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:38.549
be?

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:41.360
Have I done the best that I can for this subject?

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:46.429
Is every detail the way that it should be?

00:17:46.429 --> 00:17:50.549
And if it's not, what can we do to make it
better?

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:54.620
Yeah, so open-mindedness and perfectionism,
those are my two.

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:58.480
You'd probably get different answers from
lots of different curators here.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:07.860
Oh, my goodness, this is a heavy one, Instagram
trailer, from LakeMCG.

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:15.450
"What is the function of an art museum in
society?"

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.899
So that is a big profound question.

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:27.990
I think I would say that the role of an art
museum, the role of this art museum is to

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:38.149
celebrate, to showcase, to create a space
where people can come together singly, in

00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:49.220
groups to look at great works of modern and
contemporary art and that it is a place therefore

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:54.860
where we can think about empathy, where you
can think about others' perspectives, where

00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:00.799
you can learn about or be exposed to different
ways of seeing the world.

00:19:00.799 --> 00:19:07.210
And that if the museum functions as that sort
of special place and a place for convening

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:14.960
conversations about art, that to me is the
most important thing that a museum can and

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.149
should do.

00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:17.159
Okay.

00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:23.230
All right, let's go over here.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:34.220
Okay, here is a question from Jules H. "How
do you choose what art to include or exclude?"

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:36.159
So that's another big, good question.

00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:40.929
So I suppose you can answer it in many different
ways, because you could include or exclude

00:19:40.929 --> 00:19:47.360
things from the collection, or you could include
or exclude things from a gallery hang, or

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.240
you could include or exclude things from an
exhibition.

00:19:51.240 --> 00:20:00.419
So I guess it always depends on the context,
whether it's the context of the collection

00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:08.100
and what works would add something to the
story that we tell.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:14.270
In a gallery display, it's what works well
as an ensemble.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:21.739
I often think when you're installing galleries...a
former curator here used the analogy of installing

00:20:21.739 --> 00:20:23.929
galleries as like writing.

00:20:23.929 --> 00:20:29.730
You know each work of art is a word, and you're
kind of making sentences within an individual

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.419
gallery, an individual galleries with an exhibition
add up to make an essay.

00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:37.919
So back to your question of what to include
or what to exclude, you want things that are

00:20:37.919 --> 00:20:45.299
contributing to the argument, that are contributing
to the message, that are of a quality, right,

00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:54.150
that merit display on the walls, that, yeah,
add something important, so different things

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:56.890
depending on different situations and different
times.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:00.840
That governs what to include or what to exclude.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:17.509
All right, next stop is from a YouTube trailer,
from Megan K. "What led you to pursue a career

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:19.269
as a curator?

00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:25.380
How did you get to where you are today, and
what advice would you give to aspiring curators?"

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.289
So let's see, what led me?

00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:34.320
All right, well, I'll be short, I think, because
you people love to talk about themselves,

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:37.850
and suppose I'm no exception, so I'll just
try to keep this quick.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.950
What led me to be a curator?

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:41.080
I always loved art.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:47.480
I wanted, in fact, to be an artist, but I
was not any good at that.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.910
So I had a mother who was a chemist, she was
an organic chemist, and she told me about

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.990
a profession called being an art conservator.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:22:01.600
So I went off to college to study art conservation
and to double major, in fact, in art history

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.960
and in science and chemistry, and I failed
miserably at the science part, so there I

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.590
was, an art historian.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:14.640
And fast forwarding, I just loved working
with objects, and I knew I wanted to work

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:20.940
in museums, because I liked having a larger
public, I liked that museums had an educational

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:26.730
role that they reached out to different communities
and then back to the fact that at museums

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:32.450
you work with real objects, you work with
tangible things, you work with living artists,

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:39.749
you work with artworks, right, that live in
the sense of the presence that they bring

00:22:39.749 --> 00:22:41.879
to our gallery walls.

00:22:41.879 --> 00:22:49.769
So that was why I chose to pursue a career
as a curator, was because I wanted to work

00:22:49.769 --> 00:22:56.230
in a museum, because I wanted to work with
different communities and just not in a narrow

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:02.899
academic field, although curators can, by
the way, teach, and write, and publish, or

00:23:02.899 --> 00:23:07.270
do things like this, you know, speak to all
of you on social media.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:12.850
So I think the field is much broader than
maybe many people think.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.779
And so how did I get to where I am today?

00:23:16.779 --> 00:23:24.340
Well, right, I think I've worked very hard,
so I'll give myself credit for that, but I've

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.919
also been very fortunate.

00:23:25.919 --> 00:23:30.059
I know that I have had a lot of luck.

00:23:30.059 --> 00:23:35.509
I got a job straight out of college as a curatorial
secretary in Dallas, Texas, because that's

00:23:35.509 --> 00:23:39.269
where I'm from a while back, Texas.

00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:47.279
And I worked for a group of four amazing people,
and there I learned that I wanted to move

00:23:47.279 --> 00:23:50.659
to New York City, because I wanted to be where
I could see a ton of art and I wanted to go

00:23:50.659 --> 00:23:51.669
to graduate school.

00:23:51.669 --> 00:23:53.529
And when I was in graduate school...

00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:56.950
This is becoming what my dad would call a
"shaggy dog story," like, it's too long.

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:04.509
So anyway, at graduate school, I studied with
a professor named Kirk Varnedoe, and he became

00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:08.129
a former Chief Curator in the Department of
Painting and Sculpture here at The Museum

00:24:08.129 --> 00:24:14.529
of Modern Art, and he invited me to come work
with him, and I said yes, because MoMA was

00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:16.470
my dream job.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:25.230
And once I got here, as I said, I worked hard,
I did a lot of different things, I had the

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:30.620
tremendous privilege of working with incredible
people and, yes, so...

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:39.940
And I didn't leave, because once you're at
MoMA, I mean, I'm still smitten and I can't

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.970
believe I'm lucky enough to be here.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.289
I think it's one of the greatest museums in
the world.

00:24:44.289 --> 00:24:48.220
So, all right, that was a bit of boosterism,
but it's heartfelt.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.059
What advice would I give to aspiring curators?

00:24:51.059 --> 00:24:54.929
Well, I think internships are hard to beat.

00:24:54.929 --> 00:25:03.059
I would say you can get experience in the
arts, especially if you're based in New York

00:25:03.059 --> 00:25:07.960
City but almost anywhere now online, to look
for internships and get your foot in a door

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.700
and do a good job when you're there, because
there will always be positions opening up,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.519
and it's great to have the experience, and
it's good to make connections and to meet

00:25:16.519 --> 00:25:19.360
people, and that will take you far.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:25.690
You should also go look at lots of arts, look
at as much art as you can in the flesh.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.169
Okay.

00:25:28.169 --> 00:25:34.950
Instagram trailer, from, I'm not gonna read
who it's...well, it's from PGONYEA99.

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:40.210
"How many people are involved when a gallery
is reinstalled?"

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:41.210
Okay.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.460
Well, that's a great question.

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:48.200
So looking around this gallery, how many people
are involved?

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.840
I'm just gonna list all the different types
of people I can think of.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:26:01.110
So there are the curatorial team that's usually
anywhere from one to two to three people.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:03.659
There's the registrar department.

00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:10.559
So those are the folks who take works from
storage and very, very carefully bring them

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:12.299
to the floor.

00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:19.200
There are the art conservators who, before
you bring works to the gallery to hang on

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:26.440
the walls, examine them to be sure that they
are stable, that they don't need reframing,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.330
that their surfaces are intact.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:33.279
Sometime they'll say to us, "Well, you really
should glaze that or put glass on it to protect

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:34.570
the surface of the picture."

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:38.419
So registrar, conservators, curators, educators,
right?

00:26:38.419 --> 00:26:46.320
If anyone goes through our gallery, you will
see that very often we...well, in every case,

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.889
every object has a label that has basic information
on it.

00:26:49.889 --> 00:26:53.789
Sometimes there are additional labels that
have a small short text that provide background

00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:55.259
or content.

00:26:55.259 --> 00:27:00.230
Those texts are reviewed by people in the
Department of Education and also in publication.

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:07.909
So we have editors who try to make sure that
the language that we use is clear, and open,

00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:11.669
and accessible for our public.

00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:18.649
There are the people, the painters, the exhibition
designers, the lighting engineers, all of

00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:23.639
whom work together with the curators, with
the registrars, with the conservators to make

00:27:23.639 --> 00:27:29.830
the galleries here look as and the artworks,
most importantly, in the galleries look as

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.259
the best they can possibly be.

00:27:32.259 --> 00:27:33.279
So I don't know, what are we up to?

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:34.690
It's like 20.

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:39.580
You could keep going on, because once a gallery
is up, then, right, communications, publications,

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:40.929
social media.

00:27:40.929 --> 00:27:47.419
So, right, core team is probably 20 people
get involved with the gallery installation,

00:27:47.419 --> 00:27:52.840
but in the sense that the art is at the heart
of what this institution does in every sense

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.820
of the word.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:59.769
Every department in the Museum in the end
is involved in what goes on on our gallery

00:27:59.769 --> 00:28:01.379
walls here.

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:05.820
Okay, let's see.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.779
Fay Kelly.

00:28:08.779 --> 00:28:15.029
"When you get paintings from private collections
or other galleries for an exhibition, do you

00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:21.559
rent them or are they given for loan, for
free?"

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:24.880
Well, that's a good question.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:37.330
So in my experience, when organizing temporary
loan exhibitions, no, we do not pay rent for

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:40.259
the pictures that we borrow.

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:47.320
Sometimes with other institutions, we will
be charged a loan fee, and usually what that

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:53.100
loan fee would cover would be the cost of
creating a work, of framing it if it doesn't

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:58.149
have a frame, if it needs conservation treatment
in order to be stabilized for travel.

00:28:58.149 --> 00:29:04.289
The borrowing institution would be asked to
pay for that.

00:29:04.289 --> 00:29:12.259
When a private collector lends to an exhibition
here at the Museum, we would do the same thing.

00:29:12.259 --> 00:29:17.259
The Museum ensures it pays the cost of creating,
it pays the cost of framing, it pays for any

00:29:17.259 --> 00:29:22.379
sort of conservation treatment that is needed,
and then, of course, we publish the works

00:29:22.379 --> 00:29:23.379
in our catalog.

00:29:23.379 --> 00:29:25.429
We talk about them on our website.

00:29:25.429 --> 00:29:32.669
We give them another life by showing them
on our walls, and I suppose this said, of

00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:39.489
course, without the generosity in the civic-mindedness
of private collectors who are willing to be

00:29:39.489 --> 00:29:45.830
without their works sometimes for a year or
more depending on how long an exhibition tour

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:47.169
is.

00:29:47.169 --> 00:29:52.830
We could not do what we do here, so we are
tremendously grateful at every moment to the

00:29:52.830 --> 00:30:00.100
people who allow us to share their works with
our large public.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:07.869
I hope that answers that.

00:30:07.869 --> 00:30:10.590
Okay.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.090
YouTube trailer from Matt Spaul.

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:18.279
"The convention now is for the museum gallery
space to be white and blank, but this wasn't

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:19.299
always the case.

00:30:19.299 --> 00:30:23.239
When did it become the standard, and in what
situations is it relevant now to not have

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:25.059
a white gallery space?"

00:30:25.059 --> 00:30:31.999
Well, I'd begin by saying I can't tell if
you can see here that the walls in this gallery

00:30:31.999 --> 00:30:33.130
are not white.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:40.220
And, in fact, if you go through the galleries
at the Museum now, I think pure white walls

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.940
are the exception rather than the rule.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:48.899
This said, I think that in the '60s and '70s
and perhaps...

00:30:48.899 --> 00:30:53.320
What's the word I'm looking for?

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:59.229
In the '60s and '70s at the height of Greenberg
and formalism, right, and the idea of art

00:30:59.229 --> 00:31:04.619
being presented autonomously, that is when
white walls became the norm.

00:31:04.619 --> 00:31:10.809
And I think that there's a book by Brian O'Doherty
called The White Cube 1976 that sort of marks

00:31:10.809 --> 00:31:13.220
the apogee of that trend.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:19.549
But if you look even on MoMA's website, I
would recommend this at MoMA, moma.org, there

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:22.340
is a wonderful section called Exhibition History.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:28.769
And if you click on that link, you can go
back and see photographs of exhibitions and

00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:33.759
collection gallery spaces here at the Museum
from 1929 on.

00:31:33.759 --> 00:31:42.029
And I think that very quickly will disprove
the notion that the conventions here were

00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:45.059
strictly white cube and white space.

00:31:45.059 --> 00:31:53.679
There's always been a much more diverse way
of mounting and installing works and the common

00:31:53.679 --> 00:31:58.200
denominator, I think, are always the criteria
is what is best for an individual work of

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.909
art or what is best for an individual artist's
work.

00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:06.429
And if that artist's work looks best on a
white wall, then a white wall it shall be,

00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:13.740
but in the case of this gallery with older
late 19th century works, for instance, a more

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.820
warmer, softer, beige color is what was selected
to use.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.399
But great question.

00:32:20.399 --> 00:32:27.179
In what situation...yeah, so it's relevant
not to have a white gallery space when the

00:32:27.179 --> 00:32:32.789
art merits it or determines it or asks for
it.

00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:36.499
Look at this, Instagram trailer from Chuddles.

00:32:36.499 --> 00:32:42.470
"Is there one specific exhibition that you've
seen at some point in your life that radically

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:46.809
changed the way you think about art and/or
your role as a curator?

00:32:46.809 --> 00:32:49.080
And if so what, when, and how?"

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.760
That's a big question.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.100
All right, I'd rather ask everybody in the
room.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.200
But, all right, I'll think of...

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:01.539
You know, I'll tell you about two things that
I remember.

00:33:01.539 --> 00:33:06.759
I don't know if they radically changed the
way I think about art and my role as a curator,

00:33:06.759 --> 00:33:09.849
but they certainly gave me something to aspire
to.

00:33:09.849 --> 00:33:16.570
So the first is a show that was held here
at this museum in 1989, so that's too dated,

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:17.570
right?

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.909
To me, it seems like yesterday, but '89, right?

00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:22.309
So we're decades past that now.

00:33:22.309 --> 00:33:29.440
But the show was called "Picasso and Braque:
Pioneering Cubism," and it was organized by

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:34.450
the former Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture
here at MoMA named William Rubin.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:41.289
And what William Rubin did was he set out...well,
the backstory is that for a brief period of

00:33:41.289 --> 00:33:49.509
time, say from 1907 to 1914, Pablo Picasso
and Georges Braque worked very closely together

00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:56.049
to invent this new language of visual form
that was called or that came to be called

00:33:56.049 --> 00:33:57.230
cubism.

00:33:57.230 --> 00:34:02.529
Braque described the relationship between
the two of them that they were like two mountaineers,

00:34:02.529 --> 00:34:06.889
you know, roped together to achieve something
new.

00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:11.890
Or Picasso liked to...you know, affectionately
called each other, like, Wilbur and Orville

00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:14.669
Wright, right, because the airplanes were
being invented right at that time.

00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:19.430
But, anyway, this idea that two people together
could make something that neither one of them

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:20.900
could have done alone.

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:27.630
And what this exhibition, "Picasso and Braque:
Pioneering Cubism," did was tell that story.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:37.260
So for me, it so changed the notion of an
artist as a single, isolated, solitary genius,

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.260
right?

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:48.409
It pointed to the fact that every work of
art is the result of a context, or a community,

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:54.909
or a collaboration of some sort even when
you're looking at some of the most famous

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:57.270
artists of the 20th century.

00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:06.280
And I just loved the way that that story was
mapped out in the galleries of that exhibition

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:13.510
and that, in fact, it put together a show
that Picasso and Braque, right, they saw the

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:18.100
works they were making, but they themselves
would never have been able to see them altogether

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:22.850
in the way that Rubin put them together for
us in 1989.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.260
So it was both moving in that sense.

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:29.740
It was a tremendous chapter in the invention
of modern art.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:35.480
It was like you could watch a visual language
being formed on the walls.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.890
I think for me it mattered, too, that it was
very serious and it was very scholarly, it

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.650
was very rigorous.

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:45.970
There was a lot of research that went into
the catalog.

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:48.300
There was a big symposium after the exhibition.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:54.210
So, anyway, it gave me something to aspire
to in the ways that exhibitions can make a

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:58.940
contribution to art history and change the
way that we think.

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:05.070
And then the other favorite memory I have
about an art exhibition that sort of changed

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:11.020
the way I think about art or encapsulated
something was a show at the New Museum downtown

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:18.340
years ago, and actually a specific piece in
that show by an artist named Felix Gonzalez-Torres.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:25.350
He's deceased now, but in the 1990s he was
a young contemporary artist, and in this exhibition

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:30.210
was a piece that Gonzalez-Torres had made
that would consider him nothing more, nothing

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:36.340
less than a stack of sparkly covered candies
in red, white, and blue.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.900
And as I was standing there looking at this,
like a sparkly, scatterous sculpture in the

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:47.830
corner, this little kid came running over
and grabbed some of the candies.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:51.810
And, in fact, that was the complete intention
of the artist, right?

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:58.590
So if you think about from Marcel Duchamp
on kind of inviting the audience into the

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:05.350
piece, what that work of Gonzalez-Torres did
was make the generosity of that invitation

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:11.511
implicit, and it was a work that, you know,
everybody was invited to take a piece so that

00:37:11.511 --> 00:37:13.660
slowly it would dwindle away.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:18.920
And so he was an artist working in the age
of AIDS and was thinking a lot about mortality,

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:26.131
and he managed to make from something as simple
as a stack of candy in the store, on the floor,

00:37:26.131 --> 00:37:33.790
a really poignant sculpture about change,
and passage, and time, and then the institutions

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.450
that own those candy pieces or the private
collectors are responsible for replenishing

00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:38.450
them.

00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:41.780
So there's always this chance for regeneration
built into them.

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:46.510
So that really changed the way for me that
I thought about what an art object could be

00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:52.470
and the way that the relationship between
an art object and the person who owns it,

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:59.020
be an institution or a private collector,
could interact.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.770
Okay.

00:38:02.770 --> 00:38:05.930
YouTube trailer from Kold Krash Gaming.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:10.380
I think I have to, like, change my social
media moniker.

00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.180
You all are, right, much more creative than
me.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:15.330
So here's the question from Cold Crash Gaming.

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:20.780
"A lot of what you describe is your responsibility
sounds similar to what an exhibition designer

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.790
would be responsible for.

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.040
Are there no designers?

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.000
And if there are, what are their responsibilities?"

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:34.280
So I think, Cold Crash Gaming, you must be
responding to a moment in the trailer, I'm

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:40.800
suspecting, where I was talking about the
Meret Oppenheim fur teacup and how we have

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.320
to decide what size the pedestal is and all
the rest.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:49.930
So let me say, for the record, MoMA has an
incredible team of exhibition designers, and

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:53.510
we, the curators, are dependent on them.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:54.840
We collaborate with them.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:01.880
It is one of the greatest joys of working
in this place, to have the opportunity to

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:08.890
sort of think out loud with people who know
so much about the presentation of works of

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:09.890
art.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:18.510
And I suppose where the two jobs differ is
that...let's think about the fur teacup, what

00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:23.010
the curator, what I could bring to that discussion
with the designer about how high should the

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:26.910
pedestal be, and how should it be lit, and
the size of the vitrine, and all of that is

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:32.210
a knowledge of how the artist had displayed
the object in her lifetime, of how it had

00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:34.720
been shown in the past, of how it had been
photographed.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.700
Where was the little furry spoon?

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:45.500
I can bring to that a sense of what the presence
of the object sort of historically and presently

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.610
demands.

00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:53.220
And then the exhibition designers, of course,
can talk about, "Well, you know, this size

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:54.220
would be better.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.310
This color would be great.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.480
Have you thought about lighting it in this
way?"

00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:03.880
So it's very much a collaboration, and I'm
sorry if I gave the impression that there

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.030
were no designers.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:08.460
There certainly are.

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.870
Okay.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:21.480
I love this question from Yokthan Chaderichie,
I think.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.800
I'm sorry, I probably did a terrible job on
that, too.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:29.800
So your question is, "What advice would you
give to a normal art visitor to look at a

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.670
painting to appreciate it most?"

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.560
So that is just such a good question.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:40.390
I love it, because it means I get to tell
you my favorite thing about looking at any

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:47.600
work of art, which is choose a picture, choose
a sculpture, whatever you choose, stand in

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:54.700
front of it for 30 seconds without saying
anything, without looking at your phone, without

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.530
taking a selfie.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:03.920
Look at the work in front of you for 30 seconds,
and you will notice so many things.

00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:11.380
And then if you're with someone and they've
done the same thing, a great way to continue

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.540
to look at the painting, get even more out
of it is to ask the person what they noticed

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:18.020
and to compare it to what you've seen.

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.950
And 9 times out of 10 you're gonna have noticed
really different things.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:31.430
And so I think that immediately is a point
of entry to how to appreciate a painting,

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:37.450
and even if it's a painting that makes you
mad at first, to think about why that is and

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:44.110
then maybe what was that artist trying to
communicate, because I think all visual artists

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:47.320
are making things for an audience.

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.540
They may not know that it's you, but they're
making things that are there to be seen and

00:41:51.540 --> 00:42:00.390
to be engaged with, so I hope that helps.

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:06.310
A question from the YouTube trailer from Ali
Adinehzadeh.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:14.290
"How would you identify an artist such as
Pablo Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein, Salvador

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:15.290
Dali?

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:19.780
Even though everyone says they belong to a
certain movement such as cubism, surrealism,

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:25.000
pop art, etc., they actually did do more things
than most people would know about them, and

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.230
they did really great things as well."

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:36.090
So another great question, and I think every
artist, and especially Pablo Picasso, or Roy

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:44.750
Lichtenstein, or Salvador Dali, strives to
escape categorization, and I think that it

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:50.550
is always the case that you can't reduce an
artist to a single label.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:57.500
So how would I identify an artist such as
Pablo Picasso, one of the 20th century's great

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:00.210
visual innovators, right?

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:01.210
That leaves it open.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.390
It doesn't say he's just a cubist or a surrealist
or this or that, right?

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:07.210
He's an inventor of visual form.

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:14.550
Roy Lichtenstein, right, the way that he looked
at popular culture, and comic books, and the

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:20.550
language of the graphic arts and brought that
into the way that he made pictures is absolutely

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:22.550
revolutionary.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.050
And I didn't need to say pop to tell you that.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:34.860
Or Salvador Dali, right, who, yes, is synonymous
with the word surrealism but who, as you know,

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:36.840
went on to do many different things.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:41.310
You know, then you can talk about...maybe
if you get away from the labels and start

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:50.970
describing what they did and actually looking
at things, that is the way to identify artists,

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:56.480
is by talking about what they did rather than
using a short-hand label.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:00.380
Okay, I have to have a sip of water.

00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:14.020
I don't know about all of you out there, but
I'm thirsty.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.510
Sorry.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:22.070
Okay, YouTube trailer from John-Luke Durham.

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:26.050
"Do you think curating is an interdisciplinary
profession?

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:30.660
What skills outside of the art world do you
use as a curator?"

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.410
Fun.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:40.020
So yes, I think curating is interdisciplinary.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:48.340
What skills outside of the art world...so,
in addition to art history, writing skills,

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:59.880
public speaking skills, teaching skills, entertaining
skills, chitchatting skills, cooking skills.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:05.830
I like to give dinner parties for people that
I work with or artists that I meet.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:12.610
So I think all of those things contribute
to what you do as a curator.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:21.420
And, of course, I think that curators need
to engage with people outside of their profession,

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:28.410
so not only in terms of skills that I use,
but people that you engage with in terms of

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:32.670
their expertise make this an interdisciplinary
profession.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:40.260
So I have two here, you want me to take both.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.260
Okay.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.260
Well, I don't know.

00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:43.260
So I'm gonna look at both.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.570
I'll decide which one.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:52.260
Oh, my gosh, all right, so this one says we're
about out of time, so I have to move on to

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:57.270
a conclusion, and this one says, all right,
I have to look at my conclusion.

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.240
They were the conclusion for me.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:00.240
Okay.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.140
So I have fans tuned in.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:08.480
Wow, this is so exciting, from Colombia, Alaska,
Liverpool, Chicago, Paris, and Istanbul.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.400
So, well, hi.

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.230
Wow, that's really exciting.

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:14.720
How many of these places have I been to?

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.480
I've never been to Istanbul, I would love
to go.

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:19.000
Paris, yes.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.570
Chicago, all the time.

00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:21.840
Liverpool, once.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.560
Alaska and Colombia, never.

00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:25.490
So I hope to get there one day.

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:31.890
So, well, okay, thank you to everybody out
there, especially all of you in far-flung

00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:35.180

The Museum does a series called "At the Museum."

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:50.490
They do another one called "How to See."

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:52.690
They do a further one, "In the Studio."

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:58.000
So I've scrolled through some of those myself,
and I can say there's a lot of great material

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
