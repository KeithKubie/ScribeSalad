00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.350
But what I think about now is the if we're given some triangle,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.720
and here we have triangle ABC

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.910
What are the medians of the triangle

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.670
and how do they relate to each other

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.470
and do they have some interesting properties,

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.960
and you might guess that they do

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.860
So the median is, if we start at one of the vertices

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.610
so let's start at this one right over here

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.110
And then we bisect the opposite sides

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.660
So this right here would be a median

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.970
And so it started there, and it bisects this side right over here

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.240
So the length from B to let's call this D

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.160
is equal to the length from D to C

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.790
Now, let's do that with every side

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.960
I can draw a median over here, like that

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.310
So, let's call this point E

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.840
So the length from A to E

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.240
is going to be equal to the length from E to C

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.860
Although it's kind of a little lopsided,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.160
but that gets it pretty close

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.960
And then we're gonna draw another median

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.430
And I'm not gonna prove it in this video,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.850
but all the medians, and this is another neat thing, that, you know,

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.610
when you have three lines that will always intersect at one point,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.450
that all the medians do intersect at one point

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.890
They all are concurrent

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.990
They all hit one common point in the center

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.070
So, let's draw it that way

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.290
I'm not gonna prove it in this video, so this length,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.680
let's call this point right over here F

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.590
So this length right over here,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.260
this length right over there is equal to that length over there

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.760
And the point at which these medians intersect

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.090
is called the centroid, the centroid

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.360
And when you start studying physics,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.700
if you're actually and this was a uniform triangle

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.790
and you were to throw it,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.010
it would rotate around the centroid right over here

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.500
But we'll study it geometrically for now

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.470
So let's call this ten centroid well, we've already gone up to F

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.780
So let's call this centroid G right over there

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.250
Now, what I wanna that by itself is neat that you have a centroid,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.330
that if you were to throw it, if it was a uniform mass,

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.890
it would rotate around the centroid

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.520
But what's even neater about this,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.980
is that we can see that we've divided this triangle

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.820
into six smaller triangles

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.010
What's really cool,

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.280
even though these aren't congruent triangles necessarily,

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.760
but they do have the same area

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.170
And that's what we're going to prove in this video

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.190
That these six triangles all have the same area

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.500
Now, to start off, I'm just going to look at two

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.650
I'm gonna look at different pairs of triangles

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.280
So let's look at let's look at these two triangles right over here

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.750
Let's look at those two triangles over here

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.980
And to show that those two have the same area,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.200
we're just going to invoke a very simple principle

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.880
So, imagine rotating, just those two triangles over

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.610
So just rotating, just those two triangles over

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.850
It would look something like this

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.860
It would look something like this

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.560
Let me try my best to draw it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.920
Where this would be point G I'll even try to color code it the same

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.390
that is point G

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.440
That is that side right over there

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.230
This is point C

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.640
This is point B, that is point B

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.430
And then this right over here

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.360
would be the second part of that median right over there

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.360
That over there would be point D

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.770
Now, we know and I didn't draw it I should, at nicely over here

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.640
We know that this length is equal to this length right over here

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.920
And these two triangles, if we're starting to think about the area,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.790
they have the same base

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.250
And we know area

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.430
Area is equal to ? base * height

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.820
So, they definitely have the same base

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.080
What about their heights?

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.900
Well, they also have the same heights

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.160
Both of their heights, both of their height is exactly that tall

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.080
They both have the same height

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.950
So both of them have the same base

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.520
They both have the same height

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.460
On an ob on an obtuse triangle right here, the altitude sits outside of it

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.050
So that might be a little counterintuitive

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.910
So if you have an obtuse triangle like that

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.390
I say obtuse cause this is more than 90 degrees

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.110
Your altitude, your height will actually

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.310
sit outside of the triangle, but that's okay

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.700
Both of these triangles have the same base, and the same height,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.310
so they must have the same area

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.110
So if this one right here has area x,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.520
this one right here will have area x as well

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.650
And you can use the exact same logic to say, well, look

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.320
This guy and this guy, they have the same base,

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.040
and they both have the same height

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.620
So if this one right over here is of area y,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.490
then this one over here is also going to be of area y

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.150
They will have the same area

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.210
And then finally,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.810
we could do the same thing for these two characters up here

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.210
They both have the same base

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.800
This was BF is equal to FA, and they both have the same height

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.550
We drop an altitude like that

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.590
And so if we call this area, if we call this area right over here Z,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.640
you could call that area Z, as well

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.190
So, so far, we've shown that we can divide this

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.630
into three pairs of triangles that have the same area

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.830
But we wanna now show that they all have the same area

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.730
And to do that, we can invoke this same principle,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.190
but we'll do it with different sets of triangles

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.490
So now, let's look at triangle let's look at triangle BAE

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.750
Look at triangle BAE, triangle BAE

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.950
So the area of triangle BAE,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.120
area of BAE, is going to be equal to z + z + y

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.770
z + z + y

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.170
And let's look at the area of triangle BEC, BEC right over there

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.750
That's going to be,

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.060
this triangle right over here, is going to be x + x + y

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:16.280
So the area of BEC is going to be x + x + y, but the same principle

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.070
They both have the same base, and they both have the same height

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.720
We could drop an altitude like this

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.690
This one is obtuse, so that the altitude sits outside of it,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.420
but they have the exact same height

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.040
So these two areas need to be equal to each other

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.300
So you have Z, well, let me just add that up

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.900
Now you have 2z + y is going to be equal to,

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.510
is going to be equal to 2x + y

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.930
2x + y

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.790
Subtract y from both sides

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.690
You get 2z is equal to 2x

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.250
Divide both sides by 2

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.330
You get z is equal to x

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.600
And so we could say, we could write an x here, and an x there

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.800
So we know that all of these will have the same area,

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.740
but we still have to worry about these y's here

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.480
And to do that,

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.580
we just have to kind of rotate the way that we look at it

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.790
And now look at triangle ADC

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.480
Let me do that in a different color

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.750
Triangle ADC, which I'm highlighting right over here

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:22.590
Triangle ADC, whose area, so the area of ADC is going to be 2y + x,

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.090
is equal to 2y + x

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.470
And then look at triangle let's see, what color have I not used yet

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.120
Let me use this green

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:37.260
Triangle ADB, triangle ADB

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.770
Triangle ADB is going to be equal to,

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.190
well, you could say it's 2z + x,

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.920
but we know that the z's are equal to x

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.690
It's really just x + x + x

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:50.910
It's really equal to ADB is equal to 3x

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.560
And we have the same idea here

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.610
ADB has this base, which is the same as ADC's base,

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.420
and they both have the same height

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.250
We can draw up an altitude like this,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.460
we can draw up an altitude like that

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.330
They have the same height

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:06.160
We're just invoking this principle over and over and over again

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.630
So these things have to equal each other

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:15.520
So we get 2y + x is equal to 3x, is equal to 3x

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.410
Subtract x from both sides

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:25.140
You get 2y is equal to 2x, or, or y is equal to x

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.630
So that's a really neat result

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.640
You go from each of the vertices of a triangle to the opposite side,

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.390
and you bisect that opposite side, and you do that three times,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.730
you have three medians

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.160
These lines are called medians, where they intersect as a centroid

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.310
You know what's really cool is,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:44.920
it divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area
