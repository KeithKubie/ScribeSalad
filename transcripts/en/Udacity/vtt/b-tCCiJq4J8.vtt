00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.980
This selector returns a jQuery collection of the DOM element of

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.800
class article-list.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.180
Using that selector and the DOM traversal methods you just learned,

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.320
can you grab this h1 tag, which says Cool Articles,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.970
all of the children of article-list and its two parent divs, here and here?
