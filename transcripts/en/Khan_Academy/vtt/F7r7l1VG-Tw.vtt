00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.320
Let's think a little
bit about what

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.870
happened in the last video.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.690
I'll review again
these different

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:06.570
notions of money supply.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.620
And then let's talk about
whether it's fair for people

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.620
to think that they really have
the money that they have.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.390
So in the original video, after
the crop was harvested,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.830
the farmers deposited 1,000
gold pieces in my bank.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.370
Then I lent out 900 of those.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.880
I had to keep some reserves in
case those farmers wanted some

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.820
of their money back.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.730
And I figured they would never
need more than 10% at a time.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.710
I lend it out.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.920
Someone has a great idea to
build an irrigation canal, so

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.570
that more fields become usable
and get access to water.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.210
To build that irritation canal,
they take those 900

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.710
gold pieces, and they pay
a bunch of workers.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.100
Those workers now have
the gold pieces.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.290
They need someplace
safe to put it.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.780
They put it back in my bank.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.400
Now I get 900 gold pieces
of deposits.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.350
I put 10% aside again.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.920
And now I lend out
810 gold pieces.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.050
Let's say I lend it out for an
entrepreneur who wants to

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.920
build a factory to build some
type of tools that might make

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.560
the apple harvest more
efficient, or faster, or need

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.140
less labor, or whatever.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.590
That entrepreneur takes those
810 gold pieces and pays the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.890
builder in the town.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.450
And then the builder now has 810
gold pieces, and then he

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.050
gives the money back
to me in my bank.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.800
Because I'm the safest
place to keep it.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.960
I stop the chain there.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.110
You can keep going on and on.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.110
Although there is some end.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.880
Notice that these values
get smaller and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.850
smaller every time.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.650
And we'll do a little bit of
math on that to figure out how

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.660
far it can go.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.500
But then I take the builder's
money, and I said, well, you

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.710
know, this banking idea's
a new idea to me.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.410
I'm just going to leave
it all as reserves.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.740
I want to see how it all plays
out first. So then we said,

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.690
how much money is
in the system?

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.650
And it all depends on how
you define money.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.060
And we made one definition
of money called m0.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.220
In m0 we said-- we'll call this
our narrowest definition.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.730
And this is literally,
how much gold is

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.250
there in the system.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.230
Or how much stuff is there in
the system that could be

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.980
immediately used for conducting
a transaction.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.440
And I'm assuming, for the sake
of this argument, that none of

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.420
these players actually kept any
gold in their pockets, or

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.720
kept some cash in their wallets
for a rainy day.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.660
Although if they did, we would
included it in this

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.230
calculation.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.610
I assume that everyone always
deposits their gold

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.690
with Bank of Sal.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.910
So when we did that calculation
there was this 100

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.900
gold pieces of reserve that
we had set aside at

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.480
first. Then 900 here.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.160
And then 810 here.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.390
And if you add those up,
you get 1,000 gold

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.190
pieces in the system.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.460
Which makes a lot of sense,
because we originally had

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.830
1,000 gold pieces
in the system.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.900
In the example, at least as I
described it, we didn't have

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.800
anyone discovering
any new gold.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.040
Nor was any a gold eaten or
destroyed in some way.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.520
So it makes sense that there
are 1,000 gold pieces.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.720
But then there's a more
interesting question.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.230
If you went around the city
and you asked everyone how

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.470
much money they had, they'll
say, I have this much in my

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.040
checking account with
the Bank of Sal.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.890
If you ask me how much money I
had, I would tell you how much

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:08.870
is in my checking account.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.610
I actually have very little cash
in my wallet right now,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.080
if any of you are thinking
of mugging me.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.310
All of my money is in
a checking account.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.540
So if someone asked me how much
money do you have, I'd

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.110
give that number.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.830
So if you went around the town,
and you asked everyone,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.760
how much money do you have, and
you added it up, you would

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.160
get the total of the of their
checking accounts.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.560
And so we had 810 gold pieces
from the contractors, 900 gold

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.410
pieces from the ditch diggers,
and then 1,000 gold pieces

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.140
from the farmers.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.150
Let's see, 1,900 plus 810.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.200
You get 2,710 gold pieces

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.630
collectively in checking accounts.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.490
And since I'm the only bank,
that's the total of my

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.570
liabilities here.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.710
And we call that m1.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.470
And I'm calling these that for a
reason because these are the

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.620
actual words that are used
by economists and

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.990
our government officials.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.770
There's a couple of really
interesting questions here.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.290
One is how did a 1,000 gold
pieces get turned into 2,710.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.130
And then, this 2,710, does it
represent real wealth, or was

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.550
this some kind of weird shell
game we played, and it

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.690
represents some type of
weird pyramid scheme?

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.160
How it got created-- we went
through the mechanics, right?

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.810
Every time I set a little aside,
I lent some out, and

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.970
then they deposited,
et cetera.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.210
That's how it got created.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.680
The interesting question is,
does it represent real wealth?

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.240
The answer is it represents real
wealth if each of these

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.310
investments were real
investments.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.230
So if this 900 gold pieces that
were used to build this

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.740
irrigation ditch or whatever
it is, if that project

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.800
actually does generate at
least 900 gold pieces of

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.110
future wealth-- essentially you
could at least pay back

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.960
the 900 gold pieces.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.600
It'll probably generate more
if it's a good project.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.950
But if it generates at least
900 gold pieces of future

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.650
wealth, then this is a
real asset, right?

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.350
This is a real asset.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.010
Likewise, if this factory really
does generate at least

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.990
810 gold pieces of future
wealth, if it really will

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.370
allow us produce that much
more apples or gold or

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.770
whatever, this is a
real asset here.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.850
So these people, this wealth,
really does exist. This 2,710

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.520
gold pieces of, quote unquote
wealth, really does exist as

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.200
long as the projects that were
the justification for

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.850
borrowing the money actually
do generate future wealth.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.500
So there's a couple of
things to realize.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.570
There are not 2,710 gold
pieces in this world.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.520
There only 1,000 physical
gold pieces.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.130
But if these projects are real
projects that are actually not

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.850
mismanaged, they're not just
some type of pouring money

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.960
into a hole type of project,
then we do have 2,710 gold

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.960
pieces worth of wealth.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.600
And I really want to
stress this point.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.520
Remember gold isn't wealth
in of itself.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.740
Gold is used to represent
wealth.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.910
You cannot eat gold.

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.940
You cannot live under gold.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.230
Gold will not transport
you someplace.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.900
Gold will not improve
your health.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.240
It's something that's used
to represent wealth.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.450
Sometimes people think it is
wealth itself, and that's

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:32.910
actually a misconception.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:39.520
So this 2,710 perceived gold
pieces, that does represent

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.190
real wealth, although
it doesn't

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.520
represent real gold pieces.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.793
And once again you might say, oh
boy, this is some type of a

00:06:47.793 --> 00:06:48.000
shell game.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.290
But it's really not.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.660
As long as these investments
are good investments.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.590
Remember, these are wealth
generating investments.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.280
And notice, the money supply--
at least as we defined it with

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.250
this m1-- it expanded to
facilitate real economic

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.190
production.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.550
So as long as this factory does
generate wealth, or this

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.770
irrigation ditch does generate
wealth, then the money supply

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.460
did not grow faster than the
amount of wealth out there.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.310
If before a gold piece bought an
apple, now hopefully a gold

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.860
piece will still buy an apple.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:28.320
In fact, and this is an
important thing to realize, if

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:31.990
these investments are very good,
you're actually going to

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.550
have-- let's say that
we used to produce

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:40.510
1,000 apples per year.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.310
Notice apples are real wealth.

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.680
Apples are something that
you can consume.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.970
They will keep you living.

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.100
And you can also view them as a
form of investment, because

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.390
by eating them you're
able to do work.

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.270
But anyway, let's say before all
of this investment started

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.520
happening, our economy could
produce 1,000 apples.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:04.930
Now let's say that after this
irrigation ditch was produced,

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:10.140
we go from being able to produce
1,000 apples to being

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.140
able to produce 2,000
apples a year.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.160
And once again, a lot of
wealth was created.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.950
Remember, we only took 900 gold
pieces to build this.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.160
And all of a sudden
we're doubling.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.240
We're able to produce
another incremental

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.720
1,000 apples a year.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.830
Which, in our old economy, was
worth 1,000 gold pieces.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.420
So that actually will
definitely pay off.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.179
You borrowed 900 gold pieces
and this project will

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:37.990
generate, not 1,000 gold
pieces in total, it'll

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.000
actually generate the equivalent
of 1,000 gold

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.970
pieces per year.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.840
It increases our production
of 1,000 apples per year.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.890
And likewise, let's say that
this takes us from 2,000

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:52.100
apples a year to 3,000.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.910
So let's think about it.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.080
Now in a a given year, how many

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.540
apples are being produced?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.060
We used to only have 1,000
apples being produced.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.690
Now we have 3,000 apples being
produced, because these were

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.770
really good investments.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.950
They really improved
our productivity.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.030
So now, if you say everyone in
the economy thinks that they

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:14.580
have 2,710 gold pieces, or some
equivalent of them, and

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.530
we can produce 3,000 apples, now
the money supply, 2,710,

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:24.390
actually grew slower
than our wealth.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.640
Let me let me draw that out.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.530
Let's say money.

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:32.960
Wealth.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.780
I think it's really important to
separate the two concepts.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.790
Money is used to transact wealth
or represent wealth.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.390
It is not wealth in
and of itself.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.730
And that has some important
philosophical

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.190
underpinnings to it.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.460
It'll probably make you live
happier if you realize this

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:46.810
difference.

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:50.480
But before we had 1,000 gold
pieces, before the banking and

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.500
this fractional reserve
system existed.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.640
And we had 1,000 apples
of wealth per year.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.830
And I'll go more into the
velocity of money.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:04.080
But after all this stuff
happened later, we had 2,710

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.260
perceived gold pieces.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:08.350
This was our m1 definition.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.040
Our m0, the actual physical
gold, was still 1,000.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.710
But how many apple do
we produce a year?

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.860
We now produce 3,000 apples.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:19.990
So notice, the ratio
of gold to apples

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.630
has actually improved.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.070
And now, if you think about it,
an apple is actually going

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.530
to cost less gold.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:29.790
Before roughly you had one
gold piece per apple.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.680
Now you have less than one
gold piece per apple.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.720
So because of our
innovation, we

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.190
actually experienced deflation.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.020
So you might have said,
all of this money was

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.860
created out of nowhere.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.000
This money doesn't exist. This
will lead to inflation.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.270
But no, this is a very important
point, because the

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:51.420
money was put to work in actual
productive investments

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:56.040
that create wealth, that make
the pie bigger, or the pie of

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.810
apples bigger, we actually
experience deflation.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.400
And our economy actually grew.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.640
And this was actually a very
very positive example.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.910
I'll see you in the
next video.
