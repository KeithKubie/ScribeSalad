00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:10.900
He was one of the most fearsome 
warlords who ever lived,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.062
waging an unstoppable conquest
across the Eurasian continent.

00:00:16.062 --> 00:00:19.449
But was Genghis Khan a vicious barbarian

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.687
or a unifier who paved the way
for the modern world?

00:00:23.687 --> 00:00:28.540
We'll see in "History vs. Genghis Khan."

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.991
"Order, order. 
Now who's the defendant today?

00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:35.577
Khan!"

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:38.620
"I see Your Honor is familiar 
with Genghis Khan,

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.919
the 13th century warlord whose military
campaigns killed millions

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:48.189
and left nothing 
but destruction in their wake."

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:52.771
"Objection. First of all,
it's pronounced Genghis Kahn."

00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:54.347
"Really?"

00:00:54.347 --> 00:00:56.309
"In Mongolia, yes.

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.062
Regardless, he was one of the greatest
leaders in human history.

00:01:00.062 --> 00:01:05.202
Born Temüjin, he was left fatherless
and destitute as a child

00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:10.371
but went on to overcome constant strife
to unite warring Mongol clans

00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:14.444
and forge the greatest empire
the world had seen,

00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:18.782
eventually stretching from the Pacific
to Europe's heartland."

00:01:18.782 --> 00:01:21.871
"And what was so great 
about invasion and slaughter?

00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:25.464
Northern China lost 2/3 of its population."

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:29.537
"The Jin Dynasty had long harassed 
the northern tribes,

00:01:29.537 --> 00:01:33.754
paying them off to fight each other
and periodically attacking them.

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:36.859
Genghis Khan wasn't about 
to suffer the same fate

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.590
as the last Khan who tried 
to unite the Mongols,

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.473
and the demographic change may reflect
poor census keeping,

00:01:44.473 --> 00:01:49.455
not to mention that many peasants
were brought into the Khan's army."

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:52.351
"You can pick apart numbers all you want,

00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:57.747
but they wiped out entire cities,
along with their inhabitants."

00:01:57.747 --> 00:02:01.339
"The Khan preferred enemies 
to surrender and pay tribute,

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:05.390
but he firmly believed in loyalty
and diplomatic law.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.136
The cities that were massacred were ones
that rebelled after surrendering,

00:02:10.136 --> 00:02:12.248
or killed as ambassadors.

00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:16.676
His was a 
strict understanding of justice."

00:02:16.676 --> 00:02:21.308
"Multiple accounts show his army's 
brutality going beyond justice:

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:24.381
ripping unborn children 
from mothers' wombs,

00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:26.698
using prisoners as human shields,

00:02:26.698 --> 00:02:29.594
or moat fillers to support siege engines,

00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:32.404
taking all women from conquered towns--"

00:02:32.404 --> 00:02:34.978
"Enough! How barbaric!"

00:02:34.978 --> 00:02:38.729
"Is that really so much worse 
than other medieval armies?"

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.893
"That doesn't excuse 
Genghis Khan's atrocities."

00:02:41.893 --> 00:02:45.193
"But it does make Genghis Khan 
unexceptional for his time

00:02:45.193 --> 00:02:48.106
rather than some bloodthirsty savage.

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:52.393
In fact, after his unification
of the tribes abolished bride kidnapping,

00:02:52.393 --> 00:02:55.367
women in the Mongol ranks 
had it better than most.

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:57.160
They controlled domestic affairs,

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.843
could divorce their husbands,

00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:00.726
and were trusted advisors.

00:03:00.726 --> 00:03:03.676
Temüjin remained with 
his first bride all his life,

00:03:03.676 --> 00:03:08.195
even raising her possibly 
illegitimate son as his own."

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:11.765
"Regardless, Genghis Khan's 
legacy was a disaster:

00:03:11.765 --> 00:03:17.217
up to 40 million killed across Eurasia
during his descendents' conquests.

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:20.764
10% of the world population.

00:03:20.764 --> 00:03:23.644
That's not even counting 
casualties from the Black Plague

00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:28.292
brought to Europe by 
the Golden Horde's Siege of Kaffa."

00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:30.386
"Surely that wasn't intentional."

00:03:30.386 --> 00:03:33.276
"Actually, when they saw their own troops
dying of the Plague,

00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:37.191
they catapulted infected bodies
over the city walls."

00:03:37.191 --> 00:03:39.030
"Blech."

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.621
"The accounts you're referencing

00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:43.708
were written over a hundred years 
after the fact.

00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:46.079
How reliable do you think they are?

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.831
Plus, the survivors reaped the benefits
of the empire Genghis Khan founded."

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.497
"Benefits?"

00:03:52.497 --> 00:03:56.457
"The Mongol Empire practiced
religious tolerance among all subjects,

00:03:56.457 --> 00:04:00.807
they treated their soldiers well, promoted
based on merit, rather than birth,

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:03.117
established a vast postal system,

00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:06.134
and inforced universal rule of law,

00:04:06.134 --> 00:04:08.290
not to mention their 
contribution to culture."

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.020
"You mean like Hulagu Khan's 
annihilation of Baghdad,

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.300
the era's cultural capital?

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.975
Libraries, hospitals and palaces burned,
irrigation canals buried?"

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:21.514
"Baghdad was unfortunate,

00:04:21.514 --> 00:04:24.493
but its Kalif refused to surrender,

00:04:24.493 --> 00:04:29.595
and Hulagu was later punished 
by Berke Khan for the wanton destruction.

00:04:29.595 --> 00:04:32.685
It wasn't Mongol policy 
to destroy culture.

00:04:32.685 --> 00:04:37.207
Usually they saved doctors, scholars
and artisans from conquered places,

00:04:37.207 --> 00:04:39.416
and transferred them 
throughout their realm,

00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:41.594
spreading knowledge across the world."

00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:45.308
"What about the devastation of Kievan Rus,

00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:47.664
leaving its people in the Dark Ages

00:04:47.664 --> 00:04:51.492
even as the Renaissance 
spread across Western Europe?"

00:04:51.492 --> 00:04:54.311
"Western Europe was hardly 
peaceful at the time.

00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:58.939
The stability of Mongol rule
made the Silk Road flourish once more,

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:02.468
allowing trade and cultural exchange
between East and West,

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:06.945
and its legacy forged Russia and China
from warring princedoms

00:05:06.945 --> 00:05:09.225
into unified states.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:11.045
In fact, long after the Empire,

00:05:11.045 --> 00:05:13.199
Genghis Khan's descendants could be found

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.818
among the ruling nobility 
all over Eurasia."

00:05:16.818 --> 00:05:20.709
"Not surprising that a tyrant would inspire
further tyrants."

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:23.988
"Careful what you call him.
You may be related."

00:05:23.988 --> 00:05:25.750
"What?"

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.913
"16 million men today are descended
from Genghis Khan.

00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:32.201
That's one in ever 200."

00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:36.250
For every great conqueror,
there are millions of conquered.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.234
Whose stories will survive?

00:05:38.234 --> 00:05:41.455
And can a leader's historical
or cultural signifigance

00:05:41.455 --> 00:05:44.815
outweigh the deaths 
they caused along the way?

00:05:44.815 --> 00:05:50.216
These are the questions that arise
when we put history on trial.
