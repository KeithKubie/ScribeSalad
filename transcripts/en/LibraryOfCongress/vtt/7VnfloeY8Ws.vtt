00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.550
&gt;&gt; Well good afternoon and welcome.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.660
I am Francisco Macias from
the Law Library of Congress.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.600
We have certainly had the pleasure
of delivering a robust slate

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.990
of events in observance of
Hispanic Heritage Month.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.690
These programs are possible
because of the collegial spirit

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.440
that fills this wonderful
institution.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.090
And for that I want to
thank all my colleagues,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.170
many of whom are present
here, for the commitment

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.100
in making 2016 another successful
celebration of our heritage.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.710
Today's program, A Spanish
Reading of Hemingway,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.720
brings to us an unorthodox
reading of one

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.820
of America's most celebrated
authors.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.820
We ask that you be prepared to
see Ernest Hemingway certainly

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.360
through the lens of World War I.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.150
But we also ask that you set
aside some of what you know of him

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.000
so that you might see him through
the lenses of Cuba and Spain,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.350
spaces from which he drew his
inspiration, and through authors

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.440
like Miguel de Unamuno,
Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.420
Felix Lope de Vega y Carpio,
Pedro Calderon de la Barca,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.820
Rafael Alberti, and
Vicente Blasco Ibanez.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.750
Douglas LaPrade is Professor
of English at the University

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.940
of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.020
He has received two
Fulbright grants to Spain.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.650
Over the course of eight
years, while in Spain,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.010
he taught at the University
of Barcelona.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.210 position:56%
He has published four books in
Spain at the University of Salamanca

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.790
and at the University of Valencia.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.520 position:56%
His book are based on the censorship
of documents from the Franco regime

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.400
that he found in the official
archives of the Spanish government.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.840
In Spain he is a member of the
Board of the [foreign words].

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.040
This foundation is named for
Hemingway's Spanish biographer.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.900
In Cuba, he is a member of
the [foreign word] Hemingway.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.020
His work has been reviewed
in Spain's leading newspaper,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.500
<i>El Pais </i>, and in Cuba's
official newspaper, <i>Granma </i>.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.560
In addition to his work
in South Texas he lectures

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.830
in Spain and in Cuba.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.510
Please join me in welcoming
Dr. Douglas LaPrade.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:48.080
[ Applause ]

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.780
Thank you Francisco.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.540
You're a national treasure

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.050
and our ambassador-at-large
to the Hispanic world.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.350
And I thank you.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.650
It's always a pleasure to talk

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.600
about Anglo-Hispanic
crosscurrents with you.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.960
It's been a pleasure and
thank you for arranging this.

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.140
The title of this lecture is "A
Spanish Reading of Hemingway."

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.700
But this is not the first time
there has been a Spanish reading

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.000
of Hemingway in Washington,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.210
D.C. Seventy-four years ago there
was an important Spanish reader

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.070
of Hemingway's works.

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.830
That Spanish reader was the
Ambassador of Spain in Washington.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.730
When the Spanish Ambassador read
Hemingway's works at the Embassy

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.830
of Spain in 1942, he
was not pleased.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.500
The Ambassador had just received
a letter from the Counsel of Spain

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.840
in California who warned him

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.570
that a Hollywood studio was
preparing a film version

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.200
of <i>For Whom the Bell
Tolls </i>, Hemingway's novel

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.890
about the Spanish Civil War.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.920
In his letter to Spain's Ambassador
the Counsel condemns Hemingway

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.730
as follows.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.370
"Given the subject of this work,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.020
and taking into account the
leftist tendency of this author,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.060
this film could, if completed,
become anti-Spanish propaganda

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.890
that is highly detrimental to
our government's objectives."

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.330
A week later the Ambassador of
Spain responded to his Counsel

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.600
in California with a
letter that read as follows.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.110
"Regarding the film, <i>for
Whom the Bell Tolls </i>,

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.860
which Paramount Studio
intends to produce and which,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.650
as you judge correctly, could
serve as propaganda against Spain,

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.300
I think it would be advisable

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.970
to insist upon halting
production of the film."

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.110
Upon receiving this letter from
his Ambassador the Counsel of Spain

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.140
in California approaches
Paramount Studio in Hollywood

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.480
to request a copy of the script.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.170 position:56%
Paramount Studio cooperates with the
Spanish diplomats and provides them

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.780
with a copy of the script.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.420
After reading the script the
Counsel writes the following letter

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.300
to the Ambassador of Spain.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.520
"The script is atrocious, a
thousand times worse than the book.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.760
The Red Bandits described by
Hemingway appear as angels,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.670
moderate Republicans with
a high democratic ideal.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.260 position:56%
On the other hand, the nationalists,
who are always called Fascists,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.570
appear as loathsome sorts with no
honor or courage who are devoted

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.950
to cutting women's hair
off after raping them

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.780
and killing their aged parents.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.860
I see no way how this script
could be made even half decent,

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.220
no matter how much it
is changed or modified."

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.280
When the Ambassador of
Spain receives this quickie

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.860
from his Counsel in California, the
Ambassador in turn writes a letter

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.490
to Spain's Minister of
Foreign Affairs in Madrid.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.880
In this letter from the Ambassador

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.630
to the Minister dated September
25th, 1942, the subject line reads,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.750
"Report on Paramount's
Proposed Film Against Spain."

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.040
In the first sentence of the letter
the Ambassador expounds as follow.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.340
"Paramount Studios in Hollywood
has plans to produce a film based

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.670
on the book published by the writer
Hemingway entitled <i>For Whom the</i>

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.740
<i>Bell Tolls </i>, which was written

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.270
for the propaganda of
the Reds in Spain."

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.930
The next month, on October 7th,
1942, the Ambassador of Spain

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.480 position:56%
in Washington writes another letter
to the U.S. Undersecretary of State.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.820 position:56%
The letter says, "The film script
based on Hemingway's book is, quote,

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.490
'completely insidious
for the Spanish nation

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.670
and it is almost impossible
to fix it,'" end of quote.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.830
The letter continues to
issue the following warning

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.760
to the American government.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.730
Again, quote.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.270
"The Embassy of Spain in
Washington has thought it necessary

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.920
to make these points clear
and to engage the cooperation

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:34.380
of the authorities of the United
States to determine the possibility

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.670
of halting the propaganda
which by all accounts is unfair

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.970
and inaccurate, and
which could contribute

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.310
to complicating the current
relations between Spain

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.440
and the United States,"
end of quote.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.970
Let's stop here and re-examine
the title of this lecture,

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.100
"A Spanish Reading of Hemingway."

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.960
These diplomatic letters tell us
that the first Spanish reading

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.540
of Hemingway in Washington,
D.C. occurred 74 years ago

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.670
when Spain's Ambassador tried
to stop a Hollywood studio

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.640
from making the movie version
of <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>.

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.620
This happened in 1942
when America was involved

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.320
in the Second World War.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.260
American troops were
fighting against Hitler

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.770
and Mousseline while back home

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.820
in California an American film
studio allowed a Fascist official

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.060
to censor a copy of an
American film script.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.020 position:56%
The American public became aware of
this because articles were published

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.830
in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>
about Paramount's complicity

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.880
with Franco's censor.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.300
In spite of the protests
of the Spanish government,

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.830
the film was released in 1943.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:34.960
The film stars Gary
Cooper and Ingrid Bergman.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.690
However, some of the Spanish
Counsel's recommendations were

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.450
incorporated into the script.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.770
In the movie, the Fascists
are called nationalists.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:47.330
The Spanish officials were very
proud of this semantic victory

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.120
in the propaganda war, the war of
words that accompanies all wars.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.690
So when we talk about a Spanish
reading of Hemingway in Washington,

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.850
D.C. we must realize that a
Spanish reading of Hemingway

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.760
in 1942 has influenced the way
Americans perceive Hemingway.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.100
The Spanish readers altered
the English language script

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.000
of the movie version of
<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.390
In 1942 the citizens of Spain could
not even read <i>For Whom the Bell</i>

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:18.270
<i>Tolls </i>because Franco censored
the novel entirely until 1968.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:21.910 position:56%
However, the diplomatic
correspondence we have just examined

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.080
proves that Hemingway's
name was well-known

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.520
to the highest government
officials in Spain.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.180 position:56%
Some of the letters we have cited
reached the desk of Spain's Minister

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.530
of Foreign Affairs in Madrid.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:35.850
This is the counterpart to
the U.S. Secretary of State.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.020
We must ask ourselves, how many
times in history has a writer

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.200
or artist been considered a threat

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.830
to the national security
of a country?

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.350
As we have seen, the agents

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.870
of Franco's Spain all label
Hemingway a red propagandist.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:53.480
Americans can debate Hemingway's
political sympathies endlessly.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.800
Was he communist or
just a sympathizer?

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.620
However, to Franco's
Fascist regime in Spain,

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.890
Hemingway was clearly
an agent of propaganda

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:03.880
at the service of the reds.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.090
Hemingway's role in the Spanish
Civil War was well-known to Franco,

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.060 position:56%
and for that reason Franco
censored Hemingway's books published

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.360
in Spain.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.760
For example, in one of
Hemingway's short stories

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.040
about the Spanish Civil
War entitled,

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.710
<i>The Old Man at the Bridge </i>,

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.910
Franco's censors changed the
word "fascists" to "troops."

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:26.020
Once again, Franco's sensitivity
of semantics is apparent.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.540
In another short story about Madrid
entitled, <i>Capital of the World </i>,

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:34.170 position:56%
the censors eliminated the dialog
in which one character says that the

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.320
"bulls and the priests are
the two curses of Spain."

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.470
Another line of dialog from
this censored passage speaks

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:45.600
of the necessity of killing the
priests and the [foreign words].

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.740
Hemingway's novel entitled,
<i>Across the River</i>

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:50.740
<i>and into the Trees </i>includes
a phrase critical of Franco.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.370
Specifically, Hemingway calls
Franco "General Fat Ass Franco."

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:58.710
Of course, Franco's censors
eliminated this phrase

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.490
entirely [laughter].

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.130
As we celebrate Hispanic
Heritage Month here at the Library

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.430
of Congress we should recall

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.610
that October 12th is the
national holiday of Spain.

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:14.000
October 12th has been called El Dia
de la Hispanidad, when Spain wanted

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.810
to emphasize its connection to its
former colonies in Latin America.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.520 position:56%
For others, October 12th is Columbus
Day of the Day of the Virgin

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.720
of the Pilar, the Patroness
of Spain.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.110
October 12th also is important
in the academic calendar

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.290
at universities in Spain.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:31.760
Historically, classes begin

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.290
at the Spanish universities
after October 12th.

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:39.580
Eighty years ago this week,
on October 12th, 1936,

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.620
a famous ceremony took place
at Spain's oldest university,

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.820
the University of Salamanca.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.300
The famous philosopher Miguel
de Unamuno was President

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.520
of the University of Salamanca
and he presided over the ceremony

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.720
on Spain's National Holiday.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:56.880
The Spanish Civil War had
begun three months before

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:02.100
on July 18th 1936, and Unamuno had
to conduct the ceremony with some

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.680
of Franco's Fascist
officers in attendance.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.060
One of Franco's generals,
Jose [foreign words],

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:15.040
stood up during the ceremony
and shouted, "Viva la muerte.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.480
[Speaking in foreign
language]," or long live death.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.470
Death to intelligence.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:22.340
Unamuno responded by giving an
impassioned defense of culture

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.960
which he felt was imperiled
by Fascism.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:31.650
Unamuno knew that Franco's side
would win the war and he said,

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.080
"[Speaking in foreign language]"
or rather you will conquer

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.450
or you will not convince.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:38.420
Franco's wife escorted
Unamuno from the hall.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.680
Unamuno was placed under
house arrest and died

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:44.690
of a broken heart two-and-a-half
months later on New Year's Eve.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:48.110
Hemingway even wrote a short
story as a homage to Unamuno.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.870
Actually, he published this story
three years before the Spanish

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.740
Civil War.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:56.640
The story's entitled <i>A Clean
Well-Lighted Place </i>which takes

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.760
place in a bar in Spain.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.540
Unamuno was an agnostic philosopher
in addition to being President

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.640
of the University of Salamanca.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.250
Unamuno's seminal essay is
entitled <i>The Tragic Sense of Life,"</i>

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.140
<i>of Del [speaking in foreign
language] de la Vida </i>,

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.580
published in 1912.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.960 position:56%
Unamuno says that "IT The tragedy
of life is not the prospect of death

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.910
or hell, but rather the
uncertainty of knowing whether

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.410
or not there is anything
in which to believe."

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:26.080
The word "nada" becomes a virtual
refrain in Unamuno's essay.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.360
Nada is the Spanish
word for nothing.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.890
The word "nada" occurs
about 150 times in his essay

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.380
as Unamuno wonders whether
or not there is a god

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.870
or if there's just nothing.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.090
In Hemingway's story, <i>A
Clean Well-Lighted Place </i>,

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:42.490
an old man drinks alone in
the same bar every night

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.220
until well after midnight.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:48.720
An older waiter is sympathetic
to his customer's spiritual void

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.810
and recognizes that the clean
well-lighted bar represents a

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.980
sanctuary to this alcoholic
customer who believes in nothing.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.950
The story concludes with
the old waiter reciting

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.110
"The Lord's Prayer" to himself.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.290
But he substitutes the Spanish word
"nada" for every significant word.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.270
In Hemingway's story, "The Lord's
Prayer" becomes the following.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.640
"Our nada who art the
nada, nada be thy name,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.990
thy kingdom nada, thy
will be nada, nada.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.340
God in heaven had become nothing.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:22.470
Hemingway adopts Unamuno's agnostic
refrain "nada" for his short story

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.480
and incorporates the word
"nada" into "The Lord's Prayer."

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.540
So when the Spanish Civil War
began Hemingway already knew

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.510
about Unamuno, and Hemingway
adopted Unamuno's attitude

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.270
that Fascism was the
enemy of culture.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.380 position:56%
Fascism was an exercise in nihilism.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.640
The Fascist refrain was not "nada,"

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:43.700
but something even
more existential --

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.050
"viva la muerte," long live death.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.650
Another Spanish poet,
Antonio Machado,

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:52.680
also believed that Fascism
was the enemy of culture.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.970
Antonio Machado wrote the
following at the outset

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.270
of the Spanish Civil War.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:03.300
So here's a fairly long passage
of a paragraph by Antonio Machado.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.830
"Fascism is the force
of anti-culture,

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.640
the negation of the spirit.

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:11.530 position:56%
The people protect works of art with
devotion and Fascism destroys them

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:15.020
with rage because they are
works of spirit and culture.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.800
I affirm that absolutely the Prada
Museum, the National Library,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.100
have been bombarded without
any military objective other

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:26.030 position:56%
than the fatal necessity of
destruction which motivates Fascism.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:30.330
I have seen the marks of the shells
used on those temples of culture.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.580
Cultural interests are in danger.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.600
This vandal bombardment shows it.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.470
Culture is a military
objective for the Fascists.

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.420
And to destroy culture they
send their foreign airplanes

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.070
as ambassadors of the
negative forces of history."

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.780
That's the end of the
quote of Machado.

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:49.660
So when Hemingway went to Spain
during the Spanish Civil war he

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.370
recognized immediately the
attitude of Unamuno and Machado,

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.780
who considered Fascism a threat
to culture and civilization.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:01.070
In fact, Hemingway became a close
ally of a group of Spanish writers

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.360
who called themselves "The Alliance
of Antifascist Intellectuals

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.310
for the Defense of Culture," which
was founded the year the war began.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.860
The Spanish poet, Raphael Alberti,
was the Director of The Alliance.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.910
The Alliance was an
official organization

00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:21.560
under the Spanish Republic's
Ministry of Public Education.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.590
In other words, The
Alliance was created

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:27.090
to produce propaganda
favorable to the Republic.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:30.830
Much of their propaganda depicted
Fascists destroying culture.

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:33.750
Hemingway contributed to
this propaganda effort

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.980
by writing <i>For Whom the
Bell Tolls </i>as a homage

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:39.420 position:56%
to Raphael Alberti and The Alliance.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.770
Hemingway's classic novel

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.480
of the Spanish Civil War is
really a tribute to the history

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.340
of Spain and to Hispanic culture.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:51.050
In fact, Hemingway includes the
etymology of the word "Espania"

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.050
in the middle of his novel.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:54.780
On the first page of Chapter Three

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:58.090
of <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>
Hemingway offers his etymological

00:15:58.090 --> 00:16:00.920
study of the word "Espania."

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.820
This etymological study is cryptic

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.080
and requires careful
scrutiny of the text.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.230
It is not nearly as obvious as
Hemingway's use of the Spanish word

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.920
"nada" in the short
story we just discussed.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.740
The word "Espania," the Spanish
word for Spain is derived

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.940
from the Latin word
"Hispania" with an "H."

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.450
Obviously "Hispania" is the root
word of the adjective "Hispanic."

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.630
And we are here to celebrate
our Hispanic heritage.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.550
But let's recall that Hispania
was the name given to Spain

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.150
by the Romans when they
conquered the Iberian Peninsula.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.580
Hispania was an integral
part of the Roman Empire

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.640
and three Roman Emperors were
from Hispania, namely Trajan,

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.500
Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.240
Before the Romans conquered Spain,

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.100
the Greeks had established
colonies in Iberia.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.410 position:56%
But the earliest immigrants to Spain
were the Phoenicians who sailed

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.020
to Spain over 3000 years ago.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.610
Phoenicia is now Lebanon at the
eastern end of the Mediterranean,

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.390
while Spain is at the western
end of the Mediterranean.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:00.790
Therefore, when the Phoenicians
sailed to Spain in 1100 B.C.,

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:05.020
they called Spain Span, S-P-A-N,

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.420
because Span was the
Phoenician word for hidden.

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:11.250
For the Phoenicians,
Spain was the hidden land

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.860
at the other end of
the Mediterranean.

00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:16.080
Hemingway knew this and
he originally planned

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.510
to entitle his novel,

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:21.280
<i>The Undiscovered Country </i>before
settling upon <i>For Whom the Bell</i>

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.580
<i>Tolls </i>.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.940
<i>The Undiscovered Country</i>
sounds like the Phoenician name

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.690
for Spain, the hidden land.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.980
We should notice also
that the word, "Hispanic,"

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.690
and also the Spanish word "Espania"
both include the Phoenician root

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.110
word "Span."

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:39.520
The four letters, S-P-A-N, still
figure prominently in both words,

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.900
"Espania," and "Hispanic."

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:44.790
It easy to trace the etymology of
"Espania" back to the Latin name

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.770
"Hispania" with an H. After all,
Spanish is a romance language.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.210
But the Romans maintained
the Phoenician word "Span"

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:53.120
within their name, "Hispania."

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.620
But the Phoenician name for Spain,
Span, also had another meaning.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.380
Besides meaning hidden,
Span means "rabbit."

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:06.100
So for the Phoenicians, Spain
was the land of the rabbit.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:10.090
Rabbits proliferated in Spain, so
Spain was the land of the rabbit.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:13.050
Everybody knows that in <i>For Whom
the Bell Tolls </i>the protagonist

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.080
Robert Jordan has a distinctive
nickname for his lover, Maria.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:21.300
Throughout the novel he calls his
lover "Rabbit" or "Little Rabbit."

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.590
In the novel, Robert Jordan is
an American Professor of Spanish

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.400
at the University of Montana.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.090
So when he calls Maria "Rabbit"
he is making her a personification

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.600
of Spain.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.730
Because he is a professor of
Spanish he knows that the etymology

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.290
of the word "Espania"
means land of the rabbit.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:42.360 position:56%
Maria is always described in
comparison to the Spanish landscape.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.260
Her hair is compared to a field of
wheat and her breasts are hills.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:49.370
When Robert Jordan and Maria
make love, the question is asked,

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.580
"Did you feel the Earth move?"

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:56.080 position:56%
Of course this metaphor for a sexual
climax has inspired countless jokes.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.360
However, Hemingway
wanted to make it clear

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.190
that Maria is a personification
of the country Spain,

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:04.820
so this is why he compared making
love to Maria with an earthquake.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.120
The joke is obvious,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.280
but not everyone recognizes
the literary intention

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.540
to make Maria a symbol of Spain.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.000
Robert Jordan is a Professor
of Spanish so his love

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.290
for Maria symbolizes
his love for Spain.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.020
Like Hemingway, Robert
Jordan is concerned

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.000
that the Spanish Civil War
will destroy Hispanic culture.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.300
All readers know that the plot

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.800
of <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>
is remarkably simple.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.510
The protagonist, Robert Jordan,
carries a knapsack full of dynamite

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.910
which he plans to use
to blow up a bridge.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.020
By exploding the bridge
he can prevent the enemy

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:37.340
from advancing toward Spain.

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.840
Not surprisingly, Hemingway
transformed the --

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:43.380
transforms the bridge into
another important symbol.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.330
After all, that is the
essence of literature.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.910
Hemingway's metaphorical method
becomes apparent early in the novel

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.970
on the first page of Chapter Three
of <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:55.060
The Professor, Robert
Jordan, examines the bridge

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.980
that he wants to blow up.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.630
He examines the structure of the
bridge carefully because he wants

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.050 position:56%
to place the dynamite strategically.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:06.010
He even carries a notepad and
draws diagrams of the bridge.

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:09.070
This seems like an odd pursuit
for a Professor of Spanish

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.230
who is accustomed to
conjugating verbs rather

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:13.690
than drawing diagrams of bridges.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.130
However, both pursuits, the
grammatical and the architectural,

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:19.740
demand the same power of analysis.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.870
Robert Jordan even says to himself,

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:25.220
"You're a bridge blower
now, not a thinker."

00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.460
As he diagrams the
bridge and ruminates,

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.720
Robert Jordan uses the word
"span" as a synonym for bridge.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.350
In fact, Hemingway uses the noun
"span" or the past-tense verb form

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:39.270
"spanned" three times on
Page One of Chapter Three

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.380
as Robert Jordan draws the bridge.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.320
Following are the three sentences
on the first page of Chapter Three

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:47.760 position:56%
of <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>that
include the word "span" or "spanned"

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.060
in reference to the bridge.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.360
So here's a quote from the novel.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.900
"It was a steel bridge
of a single span

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:55.660
and there was a sentry at each box.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:58.160
It was wide enough for
two motors cars to pass

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.770
and it spanned a deep gorge.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.660
Now he was noting the points where
the explosive should be placed

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.990
in order to cut the
support of the span

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.540
and drop a section
of it in the gorge."

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.230
As we have seen, span is the
Phoenician word for "Spain."

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.620
Who else would know this other
than a Professor of Spanish?

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.490
When Robert Jordan
calls Maria "Rabbit,

00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:19.690 position:56%
and when he calls the bridge a span,
he is demonstrating his knowledge

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.360
of the etymology of
the word "Espania."

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:27.080
Maria personifies Spain and the
bridge is another symbol of Spain.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.670
Many people have wandered the
mountains northwest of Madrid,

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.450
the Sierra de Guadarrama,

00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:33.450
looking for a bridge
resembling the one described

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.390
by Robert Jordan in the novel.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:37.690
Needless to say they have
never found the bridge,

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.130
so they criticize Hemingway
for lack of verisimilitude.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.510
These are the same
people, of course,

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.280
who laugh at the lovers
who make the Earth move.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.740
Hemingway's novel is not
a historical chronicle

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.430
of the Spanish Civil War.

00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.440
On the contrary, <i>For Whom
the Bell Tolls is an allegory</i>

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.410
<i>and in an allegory all characters</i>

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.660
<i>and things represent
as abstract ideas.</i>

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:01.380 position:56%
<i>Maria and the bridge are symbols
of Spain, which raises the question,</i>

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:03.530
<i>what does Robert Jordan represent?</i>

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:07.960 position:56%
<i>His last name is the same as that
of a famous river, the Jordan River.</i>

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.510
<i>Late in the novel the character
makes the connection explicitly</i>

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.320
<i>between his name and the river.</i>

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.040
<i>The Jordan River separates Moses</i>

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.150
<i>and the Hebrews from
the Promised Land.</i>

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.290
<i>Likewise, in Hemingway's novel,</i>

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.960
<i>Robert Jordan must destroy
the bridge over a river</i>

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.570
<i>to protect the promised land
of Madrid and all of Spain</i>

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:27.180
<i>from the advance of the enemy.</i>

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:32.280
<i>So why did Hemingway decide to
write his long novel as an allegory</i>

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.990
<i>in which one character
personifies Spain</i>

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.680
<i>and another character
personifies a river?</i>

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.240
<i>The answer requires us here</i>

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:43.810
<i>to introduce another famous Spanish
writer, the poet, Raphael Alberti.</i>

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.960
<i>Besides Federico Garcia Lorca,</i>

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.280
<i>Raphael Alberti is the most famous
Spanish poet of the 20th century.</i>

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:55.300
<i>Alberti won Spain's National Prize
for a volume of poetry in 1924.</i>

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.270
<i>Alberti was a Communist and a
supporter of the Spanish Republic.</i>

00:22:59.270 --> 00:23:03.050 position:56%
<i>During the Spanish Civil War the
poet, Raphael Alberti, and his wife,</i>

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.530
<i>Maria Teresa Leon, were two of
the leaders of a group called</i>

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.410
<i>"The Alliance of Anti-Fascist
Intellectuals</i>

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.950
<i>for the Defense of Culture."</i>

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.250
<i>The Alliance was formed in 1936</i>

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:18.760
<i>and became the Spanish Republic's
propaganda mission during the</i>

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:20.150
<i>Spanish Civil War.</i>

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.340
<i>The Alliance staged many plays,</i>

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.590
<i>and these theatrical productions
influenced Hemingway's composition</i>

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.940
<i>of For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.820
Alberti introduced Hemingway to the
Spanish Republic's propaganda war

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:36.400
and Hemingway adopted the Spanish
Republic's posture as the guardian

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.310
of Spanish art and culture.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.750
The Alliance performed its plays

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:43.680
in the Zarzuela Theater
in the center of Madrid.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.720
They designed their plays to
encourage the besieged citizens

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:49.790
of Madrid during the
Spanish Civil War.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.330
The most famous play performed

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:54.510
by The Alliance was the
play entitled <i>Numancia </i>.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:24:01.630
The play <i>Numancia </i>was written
originally by Cervantes in 1585.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.680
Alberti revised <i>Numancia </i>for
performance during the Spanish

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.980
Civil War.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.860
Following is the story
of <i>Numancia </i>.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:14.310 position:56%
The Romans ruled Spain from 200 B.C.
to 400 A.D. and fought many wars

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:16.360
against the native Iberians.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.760 position:56%
The most famous such battle was
fought at Numancia, the Iberian city

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.790
to which the Romans
set siege for 16 years.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.990
Numancia is situated on top of
the hill near the modern city

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.640
of Soria [assumed spelling] on the
Dwerel [assumed spelling] River.

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.860
When the Romans finally
defeated Numancia in 133 B.C.,

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:37.330
they entered the city to
find all the citizens dead

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.870
as result of a suicide pact.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.390
The citizens of Numancia
preferred to die instead

00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:44.390
of surrendering to the Romans.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.060
Since then, the indomitable
spirit of the Iberians

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.760
of Numancia has been
symbolic of Spain's refusal

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.030
to surrender to invaders.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:56.160
The story of Numancia is invoked
whenever Spain is under siege.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.140
The play about Numancia is an
allegory and includes a character

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:01.380
who is a personification of Spain.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.470
This character's name is Hispania.

00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:07.930 position:56%
Another character in the play is a
personification of the Dwerel River,

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.560
the river that flows
past Soria and Numancia.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.350 position:56%
This is where Hemingway got the idea

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.150
to write <i>For Whom the
Bell Tolls </i>as an allegory.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.430
Like the characters in
Numancia, the characters

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:19.650
in <i>For Whom the Bell
Tolls </i>are allegorical.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:25.550 position:56%
Maria personifies Spain, and Robert
Jordan personifies the Jordan River.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:29.050
Besides the two allegorical
characters, there's another feature

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:33.600
of <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>that
makes it similar to Numancia.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.790
Both works are about
a siege on a hilltop.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.580
Numancia is about a siege
during which the Iberians

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.010
on a hill resist the
Romans for 16 years.

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:46.260
Likewise, Hemingway's characters in
<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>are on top

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:49.230
of the mountain waiting
for the enemy to approach

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:53.060
for the entire duration
of this 500-page novel.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.670
<i>For Whom the Bell
Tolls </i>is designed

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:56.650
to resemble the siege of Numancia.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:58.670
After all, the only dramatic action

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.940
in the entire novel is the
explosion of the bridge.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:05.040
Other than that the characters
just wait, biding their time on top

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.600
of the Guadarrama Mountain
outside of Madrid.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.680 position:56%
Hemingway's mountain setting and
stalemate resemble the 16-year siege

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.200
of the hilltop city of
Numancia by the Romans

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:20.530
in the Second Century B.C.
Besides the play by Cervantes

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.180
about Numancia, The Alliance staged
other plays from the Golden Age,

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.490
Spain's glorious era of
theater during the Renaissance.

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:32.320
Alberti and Leon had a predilection
for plays with a democratic theme.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.360
The Alliance's strategy was to
dramatize the socialist spirit

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.120
with which the Spanish people
have always resisted the tyranny

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.810
of kings in the past.

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:44.950
The same tyranny embodied by Franco
during the Spanish Civil War.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:50.100
Besides Numancia, Lope de Vega's
play entitled <i>Fuenteovejuna </i>formed

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.020
part of The Alliance's repertoire.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.410
In this classic Spanish play,
published in the year 1619,

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:57.710
the citizens of the town

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:01.590
of Fuenteovejuna killed the
tyrannical [foreign word].

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:04.380
When the judge interrogates
individual citizens each one

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.840
responds by saying that
Fuenteovejuna is the culprit.

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.950
In other words, when they are
asked to identify the killer,

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.140
they say the whole town did it.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.130 position:56%
By offering the same response, the
citizens forfeit their individuality

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:20.110
to protect themselves
in a collective identity

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:23.020
which is the essence of socialism.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:26.340
Hemingway even mentions the title
of the play, <i>Fuenteovejuna </i>,

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.860
within the pages of <i>For
Whom the Bell Tolls </i>.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.950
Lope de Vega's name also
appears in the novel.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.950
Hemingway's allusion to Lope
de Vega is really a homage

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.490
to Alberti and The Alliance.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:41.270
Furthermore, Chapter 10 of <i>For
Whom the Bell Tolls </i>represents

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.510
Hemingway's version
of <i>Fuenteovejuna </i>.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:45.810
Many readers sympathetic

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:48.520
to the Spanish Republic
have criticized Hemingway

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.890
for including Chapter
10 in his novel

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:55.330
because the scene narrates a
wild frenzied massacre during

00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:00.220
which the Republicans kill Fascists
in a ritual ceremonial fashion.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.730
However, it is wrong to way

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:04.850
that Hemingway is criticizing
the Republican in this scene.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:07.340
On the contrary, the
point of the massacre is

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.930
to show the socialist
spirit of the Republic.

00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.070
Hemingway does not want
to emphasize the violence

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:15.890
but rather the cooperative
communal spirit of the ceremony.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:19.160
The key to understanding this
scene is the mutual desire

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.960
of the townspeople to share
the blame amongst themselves.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.090
Each citizen is obliged
to participate

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.050
in the lynching of the Fascists.

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.570
Like Lope de Vega, Hemingway
wants to portray mass identity

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.240
as the fundamental
element of socialism.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.610
The citizens protect themselves
by not allowing individuality

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:39.230
when they must pass judgment
on the fate of the tyrant.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.850
During the massacre one of
Hemingway's characters even says,

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.490
"Each man should have his
share in the responsibility."

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:50.330
The character named Pilar says, "If
the Fascists were to be executed

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:54.020 position:56%
by the people, it was better for
all the people to have a part in it,

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.310
and I wish to share the
guilt as much as any."

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:00.940
Hemingway's line recalls the most
famous line in <i>Fuenteovejuna </i>.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.790
When officials investigate
the killing,

00:29:02.790 --> 00:29:06.660
all the citizens respond,
"Fuenteovejuna did it."

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.480
Both Lope de Vega and
Hemingway create scenes

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.210
in which citizens protect each
other by assuming a mass identity,

00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:15.590
or rather a socialist identity,

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:18.900
so no individual can be
singled out for responsibility.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:22.800
This explains Hemingway's direct
reference to a 17th century play

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.280
in his 20th century novels.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.210
Another favorite play performed
by The Alliance was <i>The Mayor</i>

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.320
<i>of Zalamea </i>, a play written

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:38.150
by Pedro Calderon de la
Barca in the year 1636.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:42.590
This play also portrays the Spanish
people's resistance to tyranny.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:45.700
In Calderon's play, the Spanish
Army is courted in the town

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.460
of Zalamea on its way to Portugal.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:52.300
A captain in the army rapes the
daughter of the Mayor of Zalamea

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.820
who in turn executes the captain.

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:58.010
The King of Spain arrives in
Zalamea and determines that,

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:00.480
while the mayor has no
jurisdiction over the army,

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.280
his execution of the
captain is just.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:07.430 position:56%
Calderon's play is about the
democratic right of Spanish citizens

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:11.980
to resist abuse by the Spanish
Army even under a monarchy.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.460
Hemingway offers his version of
<i>The Mayor of Zalamea </i>in Chapter 31

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.870
of <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:21.810
In this chapter, Hemingway narrates
how the Fascists rape the daughter

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.140
of the mayor of a Spanish town.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.720
This is a clear allusion to
the plot of Calderon's play.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.610
Both Calderon's play and
Hemingway's novel depict the rape

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:32.340
of a mayor daughter.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:34.900
In Hemingway's novel,
Maria's father is the mayor

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.830
of the town where he is killed.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:41.060
So his assassination
acquires symbolic value.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:43.880
His assassins take his
daughter, Maria, into his office

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.880 position:56%
in the city hall and rape her there,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:48.990
thus augmenting the symbolic
nature of the action.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.570
Besides assaulting
Maria as an individual,

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.330
the Fascists are expressing scorn

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.750
for the civil authorities
in the Republic.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:31:00.110
In summary, the central plot of
<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>resembles

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.820
that of <i>Numancia </i>, a
play written by Cervantes

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.880
and revised by Raphael Alberti.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.850
Chapter 10 of <i>For Whom
the Bell Tolls </i>is a homage

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.790
to Lope de Vega's play
entitled <i>Fuenteovejuna </i>,

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.690
a play mentioned directly
in Hemingway's novel.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.250
Chapter 31 of Hemingway's
novel is a homage

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.940
to Calderon's play entitled
<i>The Mayor of Zalamea </i>.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.240
These three plays from Spain's
Golden Age of Theater formed part

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.550
of the repertoire of The
Alliance directed by Alberti

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.960
and Leon during the
Spanish Civil War.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.210
The purpose of The Alliance
was to encourage democracy

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.900
by preserving Spain's
democratic heritage portrayed

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:38.630
in Golden Age plays.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:39.970
The Alliance organized a group

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.780
of actors called Guerreras
[assumed spelling] del Teatro

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.210
which staged plays at the front to
encourage the Republican soldiers.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.950
By calling themselves Guerreras,

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.690
these actors underscored
the close relationship

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.210
between theater and warfare.

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.480
The Guerreras del Teatro
imagined themselves as soldier

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.720
in the propaganda war, and
The Alliance was their army.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.550
When Hemingway wrote <i>For Whom
the Bell Tolls </i>he aligned himself

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:07.110
with The Alliance and
its propaganda machine.

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:11.040
And Hemingway became yet
another Guerrera del Teatro.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:14.860
Toward the end of <i>For Whom the Bell
Tolls </i>the character Pilar says,

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.550
"So much theater tires me."

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.990
When she speaks the word
"theater" she is referring to war

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:22.530
which she compares to theater.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:26.310
But besides the metaphor, Hemingway
also wants the reader to recognize

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.910
that Pilar is an actor in a play.

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.970
She is a Guerrera del
Teatro and when she speaks

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:34.040
of theater she is saying
that the plot

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:38.180
of Hemingway's novel is also the
plot of the play <i>Numancia </i>.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.450
Pilar's statement demands that the
reader ask if he's reading a novel

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.770
about the Spanish Civil War or
if he is watching a presentation

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.850 position:56%
of a play performed by The Alliance.

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.320
The reader must recall that
Hemingway wrote only one play

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.240
in his life, and that play is
about the Spanish Civil War.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:57.700
<i>The Fifth Column </i>is Hemingway's
play about the siege of Madrid

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.830
and it was intended as a homage
to the theatrical presentations

00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:03.940
of The Alliance and the
Guerreras del Teatro.

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.020
The artistic and political
affinity between Hemingway

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:12.600
and Alberti continued beyond
the Spanish Civil War.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.960
Both men were exiled from
Spain at war's end in 1939.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.800
Hemingway went to Cuba and
Alberti went to Argentina.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.560
However, they did not
concede defeat.

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.870
They still had hope that the
Spanish Republic would be revived

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:30.540
to replace Franco's
dictatorship in Spain.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.510
Hemingway maintained
the indomitable spirit

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.040
of <i>Numancia </i>and The Alliance
from his exile in Cuba.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:38.890
In fact, the Spanish
Republic's fight against Fascism

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:44.610
in Spain motivated the revolution
in Cuba, which triumphed in 1959.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.760
The influence of Alberti
can even be seen

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.170
in Hemingway's novel entitled
<i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.560
Published in 1952, 12
years after the publication

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.640
of <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.940
<i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>is

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.190
about a simple Cuban
fisherman named Santiago.

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.990
In <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>
Hemingway alludes to a poem

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:05.870
by Alberti as a way of
saying that the spirit

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.080
of The Alliance now lives in Cuba.

00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:11.580
Hemingway alludes directly
to a famous poem by Alberti

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.710
in the following passage from
<i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:15.940
Here's a quote from <i>The
Old Man and the Sea </i>.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:20.340
"He always thought of the sea as la
mar, which is what people call her

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.550
in Spanish when they love her
as though she were a woman.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:25.270
Some of the younger
fishermen spoke of her

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:28.530
as el mar, which is masculine."

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:32.080
In this passage, as in his other
works about Spain and Cuba,

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:36.040
Hemingway leaves some words in
Spanish to invoke Hispanic culture.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.550
We have already discussed <i>A
Clean Well-Lighted Place </i>in

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:42.240
which Hemingway repeats the
Spanish word "nada," repeatedly.

00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.780
In the above passage from
<i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>,

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.710
Hemingway suggests that
"mar," the Spanish word

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:50.960
for "sea" can be preceded
by either the feminine

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:55.210
or masculine definite
article, "la" or "el."

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:58.280
Hemingway's reason for
distinguishing between "la mar"

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.330
and "el mar" is found in
the first line of a poem

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:04.470
of the first anthology
published by Raphael Alberti.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:06.510
So here's a quote from
a poem by Alberti.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:13.590
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:15.500
Thus begins a poem
of [foreign words],

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:23.510
the anthology that began
Alberti's poetic career in 1924.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.910
[Foreign words], the
translated title,

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:27.210
I believe, is "Land-Locked Sailor."

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.160
Alberti won Spain's National Prize

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.590
for this volume, so
it was well-known.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:35.210
When Hemingway explains the
difference between "el mar"

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:39.250
and " la mar" in Spanish in the
middle of an English language book,

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:41.460
he is paying homage to
the first famous poem

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.190
by his friend Raphael
Alberti, 13 years after the end

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.490
of the Spanish Civil War.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.680
Another passage in <i>The Old Man and
the Sea </i>represents a paraphrase

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.020
of another poem by Alberti.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:56.030
Like all of Hemingway's
books, <i>The Old Man</i>

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:58.350
<i>and the Sea </i>has a
very simple plot.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:02.330
The old Cuban fisherman named
Santiago hooks a giant fish

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:05.210
and then spends the whole
novel pulling him in.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.510
In the middle of the book,

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.270
the old fisherman recalls his
youth to give him strength.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:12.360
Specifically, he recalls
the time he participated

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.660
in an arm-wrestling match.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.090
Here's another quote from
<i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.990
"As the sun set, he remembered
to give himself confidence,

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:23.880 position:56%
the time in the tavern at Casablanca
when he had played the hand game

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.110 position:56%
with the great negro from Cienfuegos

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.070
who is the strongest
man on the dock."

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:31.110
That's the end of the
quote from the [inaudible].

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:35.050
The arm-wrestling match lasts
all night and ends in a draw.

00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:39.270 position:56%
As Santiago struggles with his fish,
his mind wanders back to his youth.

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:42.650 position:56%
His recollection of the
arm-wrestling match represents a way

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:45.220
of summoning strength,
the strength of his youth.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:49.450 position:56%
Nonetheless, this interpellated
tale requires further justification,

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:53.040
and Raphael Alberti's poetry
again provides an explanation.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:58.550
In 1935, Alberti wrote a volume

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.520
of poetry entitled [speaking
in foreign language].

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:05.180
In other words, "Thirteen
Stripes and 48 Stars."

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.760
The anthology's title
refers to the American flag.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.060
And the poems within are

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.410
about American imperialism
in Latin America.

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:15.780
The fourth poem in the collection
is entitled [foreign words].

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.510
The first stanza of [foreign
words] is as follows.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:31.330
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:33.100
In English, these lines
are as follows.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:35.320
"Black man, give your
hand to the white man.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.380
White man, give your
hand to the black man.

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:40.080
Hand to hand, for Cuba does
not belong to the Cuban,

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.850
but rather to the American."

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.460
[Foreign words] is an allegory
of American imperialism in Cuba.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:49.600
The black man personifies Cuba
while the white man personifies the

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:50.900
United States.

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.220
As the arm wrestle mano o mano,

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.020
they determine the
political fate of Cuba.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:59.050
In <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>
Santiago recalls an arm-wrestling

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:01.520
match in which he competes with
a black man from [foreign words].

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.790
Santiago's memory

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:07.160
of the arm-wrestling match is quite
singular because it has nothing

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.790
to do with the story's plot.

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:12.550
His recollection is even more
distinctive because he stipulates

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:16.580
that his opponent is black
while Santiago himself is white.

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:19.230
The memory lasts two
full pages in the middle

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.900
of <i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.620
Santiago's gratuitous memory

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.770
of the arm-wrestling match
is Hemingway's homage

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.290
to Alberti's poem [foreign words].

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:28.630
The scene in Hemingway's novel

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:32.040
and Alberti's poem share a
common setting, a common action,

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.830
and a common cast of characters.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:38.070
In both cases the setting is
Cuba, the action is arm-wrestling,

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:40.580
and the characters are a
white man and a black man

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.530
in competition against each other.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:47.310
The reader must ask why Hemingway
would allude to Alberti's poem

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:50.100
about American imperialism in Cuba.

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:54.590
When Alberti published the poem in
1935, Fulgencio Batista had been

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:59.380
in power in Cuba for two years, and
would remain in power until 1944

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.900
when he left Cuba for Florida.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.140
Batista returned to
power in Cuba in 1952,

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.160
the same year that Hemingway
published <i>The Old Man</i>

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.460
<i>and the Sea </i>.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.860
By referring to Alberti's poem
in <i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>,

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.180
Hemingway is acknowledging
that the United States

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:18.200
and Cuba were wrestling for
the fate of Cuba in 1952.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.720
Batista was an American puppet
who forfeited the interests

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.730
of common Cubans like
Santiago to make concessions

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.250
to American businesses in Cuba.

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.410
Hemingway's protagonist
is a humble fisherman

00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:32.360
who lives on the day's catch.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.530
The Cuban economy in 1952 has
become distorted to the extent

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:40.650
that life is almost impossible for
the subsistence fisherman Santiago

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:44.410
who must play the lottery
for financial survival.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:48.730
The final stanza of [foreign words]
reinforces the allegorical quality

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.030
of the arm-wrestling match --

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:53.070
mano o mano [speaking in foreign
language] norteamericano, negro,

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:56.540
mano o mano, blanco, mano o mano,
negri [assumed spelling] blanco,

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.450
mano o mano, mano o
mano, mano o mano.

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:02.380
For the better part of this stanza
Alberti simply repeats the words

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.140
"mano o mano" which
literally mean "hand to hand"

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.390
and which have become
recognizable to English speakers.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:11.450
Alberti is saying that
Cuba is engaged constantly

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:14.600
in an arm-wrestling match
against the American.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.470
Hemingway's arm-wrestling
scene in <i>The Old Man</i>

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:17.770
<i>and the Sea </i>is memorable.

00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:21.110 position:56%
But one must be aware of Hemingway's
political and artistic affinity

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:22.830
with Alberti to recognize

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.770
that Santiago's arm-wrestling
match represents his struggle

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:28.590
with American imperialism.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:30.700
Hemingway and Alberti
both supported the side

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.870
that lost the Spanish Civil
War against Fascism in 1939.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.830
When he wrote <i>The Old
Man and the Sea </i>in 1952,

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:42.750
Hemingway was attempting to sustain
the anti-imperialist spirit in Cuba

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:45.990
where many Spanish Republicans
went after the Spanish Civil War.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.820
If you go to Havana, you
can visit the hotel room

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.320
where Hemingway wrote <i>For
Whom the Bell Tolls </i>.

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:56.030
Room 511 of the Ambos-Mundos
Hotel is now a museum dedicated

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:57.330
to Hemingway.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.240
You can look out the
window at Havana Bay

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.190
and imagine Hemingway
writing his novel about Spain,

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:04.700
a country from which he
was exiled for 14 years

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.690
after the Spain and Civil War.

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:10.460
When Hemingway was in Cuba,
he was homesick for Spain.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:11.760
The most nostalgic scene

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.570
in <i>For Whom the Bell
Tolls </i>is about Valencia.

00:41:14.570 --> 00:41:15.960
One of the characters recalls going

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:18.810
to the bullfight there during
the big fiesta in July.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:22.490
Then the character recalls eating
paella outdoors on the beach.

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.240
This scene is remarkable
for the menu

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:27.060
as Hemingway recalls eating
seafood and cold melon.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.680
He recalls drinking beer
and wine in Valencia.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:32.610
It is a very sensual scene,
a bombardment of tastes

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:36.440 position:56%
which ends inevitably in the bedroom
with two characters making love.

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.170
This beautiful scene
is Hemingway's farewell

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:41.290
to Spain written in
a Cuban hotel room.

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:44.320
We must ask why Hemingway
chose Valencia as the site

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.780 position:56%
of this nostalgic farewell to Spain.

00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:48.460
The answer is clear.

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:52.870
Hemingway began writing <i>The Sun
Also Rises </i>in Valencia in 1925.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:57.260
Of course, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>
was Hemingway's first masterpiece

00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:58.560
about Spain.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.270
In <i>The Sun Also Rises </i>, the
characters run with the bulls

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.530
through the streets of Pamplona.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.360
Hemingway attended the
big bullfight fiesta

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.340
in Pamplona early in July, 1925.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.490
And then he followed the
bullfighters to Valencia

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:12.590
for the season's next big fiesta

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:15.290
which takes place every
year in late July.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:18.050
Fourteen years later,
Hemingway was in Cuba trying

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.130
to write his second novel about
Spain, <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>.

00:42:21.130 --> 00:42:24.410
For inspiration Hemingway
invokes the memory of Valencia

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:27.960
where the muses had blessed
him with <i>The Sun Also Rises </i>.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.300
Let us imagine that we
are in Valencia and 1925

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:33.690
as Hemingway writes
<i>The Sun Also Rises </i>.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:38.370
In Valencia, in 1925, Hemingway
surely was inspired by the legacy

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:43.490
of the Spanish writer
Vicente Blasco Ibanez.

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:46.770
Vicente Blasco Ibanez was the
pride of Valencia and the author

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.940
of international best sellers.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.020
One of the most famous novels

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.740
by Blasco Ibanez is
about the bullfight.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.030
That novel is entitled
<i>Blood and Sand </i>,

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:59.970
published in Spanish in 1908.

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:03.970
The American public became familiar
with <i>Blood and Sand </i>in 1922

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:05.590
when Hollywood produced
a film version

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:08.530
of the novel starring
Rudolph Valentino.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:13.220
Rudolph Valentino was
Hollywood's first super star.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.520
In fact, the first
iconic Hollywood portrait

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.520
of the romantic male lead
was Rudolph Valentino dressed

00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.410
as a bullfighter in 1922.

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.780
When Hemingway published
<i>The Sun Also Rises </i>in 1926,

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.810
the American public
still recalled the image

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.150
of Rudolph Valentino
dressed as a bullfighter

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:32.810
in the film version
of <i>Blood and Sand </i>.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.640
Hollywood and Blasco Ibanez
prepared the American public

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:39.580
for Hemingway's bullfight
novel of 1926.

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.880
Certain characteristics

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.810
of Hemingway's novel show a
clear debt to <i>Blood and Sand </i>.

00:43:43.810 --> 00:43:47.380
The Spanish novel by Blasco Ibanez
includes a female character named

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:51.770
Dona Sol who is a classic femme
fatale who seduces a bullfighter

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.050
and sabotages his career.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:57.040
Anyone who has read Hemingway's
<i>The Sun Also Rises </i>knows

00:43:57.040 --> 00:44:00.890 position:56%
that the female protagonist Brett
Ashley seduces the bullfighter Pedro

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.110
Romero and jeopardizes his
performance in the bullring.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:09.370
In 1924, Hemingway published
a one-page experimental piece

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:12.910
in the Parisian edition of <i>In Our
Time </i>that describes the bullfight

00:44:12.910 --> 00:44:14.850
in cinematic terms.

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:17.820
Hemingway describes a bullfighter
who dies in the bullring

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.070
after he is gored by
the horn of the bull.

00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:22.280
Part of the piece reads as follows.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.890
"[Foreign word] felt everything
getting larger and larger

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:26.530
and then smaller and smaller.

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:30.120
Then it got larger and larger and
larger, then smaller and smaller.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.550
Then everything commenced
to run faster and faster,

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:35.680
as when they speed up
a cinematograph film.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:37.400
Then he was dead."

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.900
In this passage Hemingway
uses two cinematic techniques.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:44.230
He describes those -- a zoom lens
as the scene gets larger and larger

00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:45.780
and then smaller and smaller.

00:44:45.780 --> 00:44:49.040
The second technique is
Hemingway's appeal to fast motion

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.970
as when they speed up the camera.

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:53.990
Why would Hemingway write
about the view of the bullfight

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:55.850
through the lens of a movie camera?

00:44:55.850 --> 00:44:58.070
The clear answer is
that Hemingway is trying

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:01.680
to appease the American reader who
already associates the bullfight

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.490
with the famous film
starring Rudolph Valentino

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:09.090
which was released only two years
before Hemingway's publication.

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:10.650
Even before <i>Blood and Sand </i>,

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:13.010
Hemingway had already been
influenced by another novel

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.910
by Vicente Blasco Ibanez.

00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:19.800
That novel was about the First
World War, and it was entitled,

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:21.950
<i>The Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse </i>.

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:26.050 position:56%
"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
was published in Spain in Spanish

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:31.030
in 1916, and it was the first
great novel of the First World War.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:33.400
A hundred years later,
the two best-known novels

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.390
about the First World War are
Hemingway's IT A Farewell to Arms

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.960
and Remarque's <i>All Quiet
on the Western Front </i>.

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.600
However, both of those novels
were published in 1929,

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:46.540
13 years after Blasco Ibanez's
masterpiece and 10 full years

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:48.920
after the end of the war.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.610
We cannot underestimate
the influence

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:52.950
of <i>The Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse </i>.

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:56.190
In 1919, the English
language translation

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.880
of this Spanish novel
was the bestselling novel

00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:01.020
in the United States.

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:04.410
In fact, the Spanish novel
was so popular in America,

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:07.600
it was made into a
Hollywood film in 1921.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:11.800
The star of that film, yet
again, was Rudolph Valentino.

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.840
The very next year in 1922
Valentino starred in <i>Blood</i>

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:17.960
<i>and Sand </i>which we've
just discussed.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.240
Between the years 1919 and 1922,

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.200
Vicente Blasco Ibanez
became enormously popular

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.490
in the United States
because of his novels

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.410
about the bullfight and
the First World War.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:32.760
Blasco Ibanez made a lecture tour
of the United States in 1919,

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.250
and he was featured in
"Life Magazine" in 1920.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.630
His name and image were
everywhere and his novels were made

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:42.080
into films starring
Rudolph Valentino.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.620
<i>The Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse </i>, the best-selling novel

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:48.280
of 1919 takes its title from
the last book of the Bible,

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:52.120
the Book of Revelation, also
known as the Apocalypse.

00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:55.100 position:56%
The Book of Revelation includes many
symbolic characters including the

00:46:55.100 --> 00:47:00.190
four horsemen who represent
pestilence, war, famine, and death.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:02.020
The First World War
was so cataclysmic

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.180
that many people though doomsday
was near, so the biblical reference

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:07.650
to the apocalypse comprised
a suitable title

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.090
for a novel about the war.

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:11.800
The influence of Blasco Ibanez

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.960
on popular American culture
became most apparent in 1924

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.330 position:56%
when the backfield of the University

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:20.460
of Notre Dame football team
was named the Four Horsemen

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:24.500
by the most famous sportswriter in
American history, Grantland Rice.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.070
Everyone in the United States
recognized the connection

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:30.970
between Rudolph Valentino and
the Notre Dame football team.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:34.830
Also in 1924, the same year that
the Four Horsemen played football

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:38.030 position:56%
for Notre Dame, Hemingway
published his first fictional pieces

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:39.800
about the First World War.

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.590
And like the Notre
Dame football team,

00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.500
Hemingway was influenced
by Blasco Ibanez.

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:49.930
For example, in 1925, Hemingway
published a short story entitled

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.680
"On the Quay at Smyrna."

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:56.640
The story is barely two pages long
and began as a newspaper article

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.400
that Hemingway wrote
for the <i>Toronto Star </i>.

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:02.640
While living in Paris after World
War I, Hemingway went to Turkey

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:06.450
to cover the conflict between
Greece and Turkey in 1922.

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:10.260
The First World War was over
but skirmishes continued

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.260
and Hemingway found symbolic
value in this incident

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:15.640
in which the Turkish army
drove Greek residents

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:18.500
from the coast city of Smyrna.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:21.380
"On the Quay at Smyrna"
cannot be any shorter.

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:24.680
However, the entire
story is in the title.

00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:26.600
Where is Smyrna?

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.460
What is the importance of Smyrna?

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:31.400
Smyrna is on the western
coast of Turkey.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.660
But Smyrna is also mentioned
in the Book of Revelation,

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.110
the last book of the Bible
that inspired the title

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:39.120
of the novel by Blasco Ibanez.

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:44.130
John the Divine wrote the Book of
Revelation on the island of Patmos,

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:46.030
and sent it as a letter
to seven churches

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.370
in Asia Minor, now called Turkey.

00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:52.460
One of the seven churches to which
John sent his letter is the Church

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.760
at Smyrna.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.860
In other words, Hemingway
knew that the mere mention

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.320
of Smyrna would conjure
up apocalyptic images

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:01.410
of doom among those readers
familiar with the Bible.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:04.470
As a result, Hemingway does
not have to write a long story

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:07.280
about the apocalypse
because the title says it all

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.220
in a cryptic illusive style
that would become the hallmark

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.970
of Hemingway's entire career.

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:16.560
This shortest of short
stories, published in 1925,

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:20.560
is evidence of Hemingway's debt to
Blasco Ibanez whose famous novel,

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.620
<i>The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</i>
, already had made the connection

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.440
between the Book of Revelation
and the First World War.

00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.340 position:56%
In the Book of Revelation, Jesus
says, "I am the alpha and the omega,

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.680
the beginning and the end,
the first and the last."

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.530
Hemingway's story quotes
these words but reverses them.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.670
Hemingway says, "No end and
no beginning," as if to say

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:43.690
that all history has ended.

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.180
Furthermore, Smyrna is
near the remains of Troy,

00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:49.060
so Hemingway suggests
that the Greco-Turkish War

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:53.320
of 1922 was reminiscent of the
Trojan War, with references

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.530
to the Bible and to Homer's
<i>Iliad </i>, Hemingway suggests

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.780
that there has only
been one war in history.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:03.270
It just never stopped, and it
will end only with the apocalypse.

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:08.120
When Hemingway won the Noble
Prize in 1954 he said he was happy

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:12.270
to be the first Cuban writer to
win the Nobel Prize for Literature.

00:50:12.270 --> 00:50:15.800
He said this in Spanish during an
interview on Cuban television just

00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:18.670
after he received the award.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:21.210
Even Hemingway considered
himself a Cuban writer.

00:50:21.210 --> 00:50:25.540
Six years later in 1960
Hemingway was forced

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:28.620
to leave his beloved Cuban
home because of politics.

00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.500
Hemingway decided to move
in Idaho where he would live

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:34.300
for only one year before
committing suicide.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.940
The choice of Idaho is significant

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.730
because Idaho had a
high concentration

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:40.130
of Basque immigrants from Spain.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:44.460 position:56%
Traditionally, Basques migrated to
the American West, to Idaho, Nevada,

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:47.400
and new Mexico where they
would work as shepherds.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.920
After working for 15 or
20 years they would return

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.530
to the Basque country where
they could retire comfortably

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:54.770
with their American fortune.

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:57.270
The Basque shepherds in Idaho
reminded Hemingway of his youth

00:50:57.270 --> 00:51:00.370
in Spain when he wrote
about the bullfight.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:03.060
During Hemingway's last
year in Idaho he was visited

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:07.190
by a Spanish novelist, Jose Luis
Castillo Puche, who wrote a novel

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:09.010
about his visit to Idaho.

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:12.860
The novel is entitled, <i>Oro
Blanco </i>or <i>White Gold </i>,

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.570
a reference to the
lucrative wool industry

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:18.550
and employed the Basque immigrants.

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:21.480
Jose Luis Castillo Puche later
wrote the most famous book

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.120
in Spanish about Hemingway.

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.790
When Hemingway committed
suicide on July 2nd, 1961,

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:30.960
he already had tickets to
the bullfights in Pamplona

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:34.150
which were scheduled to begin
five days later on July 7th,

00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:36.460
just as they do every year.

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.030
His suicide occurred only
three months after the Bay

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:44.530
of Pigs invasion of Cuba which
took place in April, 1961.

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:46.590
Hemingway knew he would
never be able to return

00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:49.040
to his beautiful home in Cuba.

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:53.690
One year after his
suicide, in July, 1962,

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:56.750
some Cuban fishermen erected a
bust of Hemingway in the village

00:51:56.750 --> 00:52:00.470
of Kohima, the setting of
<i>The Old Man and the Sea </i>.

00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:02.660
Just three months after
they erected the bust,

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.130
the Cuban Missile Crisis
transpired between America

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:09.030
and the Soviet Union
in October, 1962.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:12.530 position:56%
Even on the eve of the Cuban Missile
Crisis, the citizens of Cuba knew

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:13.830
that Hemingway loved them.

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:17.900
In 1968, even Franco allowed
the citizens of Pamplona,

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:21.140
Spain to erect a bust of Hemingway,
whose books had been censored

00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:24.100
as Communist propaganda
by the same regime.

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:27.190
These busts of Hemingway were
erected by a Communist regime

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:30.350
in Cuba and by a Fascist
regime in Spain.

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:33.310
Hemingway's books are transcendent
because they unite cultures

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:35.790
that have been separated
by politicians.

00:52:35.790 --> 00:52:38.540
These two busts of Hemingway
are the best evidence

00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:41.170
that literature is the best
diplomacy and that a novel

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:44.180
by Hemingway is the best
passport to Spain and Cuba.

00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:45.980
Thank you.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:54.930
[ Applause ]

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:56.230
&gt;&gt; Francisco Madias:
Thank you very much.

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:57.530
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade.

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:58.830
Thank you.

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:00.130
&gt;&gt; Francisco Madias: We have
just a few moments of --

00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:01.430
if there are any burning questions

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:06.350
for Dr. LaPrade, we
could take those now.

00:53:06.350 --> 00:53:07.650
Yes.

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:10.860
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about translations.

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:17.410
Were any of the works [inaudible]
translated into English?

00:53:17.410 --> 00:53:20.460
Were they well-known
in this country?

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:22.760
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade:
Not at that time, no.

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.320
Unamuno wrote something
about Walt Whitman.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.530
You know, they're -- so if you want
to begin to talk about that sort

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:36.290
of dialog it begins that early.

00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:39.550
But I'm not aware of any
translation that early of --

00:53:39.550 --> 00:53:41.400
certainly in [foreign words]
but not Unamuno either, yeah.

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:47.460
&gt;&gt; So many were --
any way [inaudible].

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:48.760
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade: He did one?

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:51.390
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade: Yes, he did.

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:52.880
In fact, I'll tell you now.

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:57.050
I spent the summer in Spain.

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:59.710
And one of the last
names I just mentioned --

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:03.220
there was Jose Luis Castillo
Puche, the Spanish novelist.

00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:07.290
He won Spain's National Prize
in 1958 and again in 1982.

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:09.730
He's probably 20 years
younger than Hemingway.

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:11.720
He was born in 1919.

00:54:11.720 --> 00:54:13.020
They were friends.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:14.450
And I'm on his foundation.

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:18.200
I spent the summer in his archives
looking for letters from Hemingway.

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.550
And, yes, they are in Spanish.

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:21.850
That's later, of course.

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:23.810
Though they didn't
meet until the '50s.

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.110
But he was good with languages.

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:39.120
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you for
doing this presentation.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.410
Extremely interesting,
historically significant.

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:51.540
And I'm glad we're covering it
here at the Library of Congress.

00:54:51.540 --> 00:55:00.630
I was just curious of when the
embassy was determining whether

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:10.030
or not to change the term
[inaudible] Fascist to Nationalist.

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:16.200
Was Hemingway ever
consulted during that time

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:22.080
or was it just government
embassy and studios with embassy?

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.620
Was the author ever consulted?

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.600
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade: The best
story I know about that.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.430
He was involved in the writing of
the script and one thing I thought

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:31.740
about including in the
presentation today --

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:35.050
Hemingway wanted to employ
somebody named Gustavo Duran

00:55:35.050 --> 00:55:40.040
as technical consultant
on the script.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:46.870
It wasn't allowed because if
-- this was, you know, 1943.

00:55:46.870 --> 00:55:51.710
It was frankly the early
days of McCarthyism.

00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:54.200
Gustavo Duran was a Communist.

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.650
And he was a friend of Hemingway's.

00:55:56.650 --> 00:56:00.380
But they were aware of the
preparation of the script.

00:56:00.380 --> 00:56:06.960
There again, I'll refer to
Jose Luis Castillo Puche.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:12.440
One time he told me he sat down
with Hemingway and a translation

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:19.600
of the novel and started pointing
out errors in the translation.

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:27.030
Hemingway got angry and threw
the book across the room.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:34.830
But -- So Hemingway would go
back to Spain in the '50s.

00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:41.880
He was aware of the censorship,
but according to what they say,

00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:48.240
he was frankly more concerned
about getting his royalties.

00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:54.690
So he had become rather
pragmatic at that point.

00:56:54.690 --> 00:56:55.990
Yes, sir.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:57:05.490
&gt;&gt; So at that time, the '40s,
the '30s and the '40s, the --

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:11.010
certainly by the '50s, didn't
Hemingway start to get a sense

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:19.980
of the genocide that the Communists
had been perpetrating since 1917?

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:24.800 position:56%
And, you know, when you look at
Stalin in Russia and you talk about,

00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:28.310
you know, how they just
annihilated Russian culture.

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:30.560
And, you know, and Red China.

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:35.110
That was much later, but didn't
Hemingway just sort of get a sense

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:37.430
for that and start to pull back?

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:38.730
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade: Yes.

00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:42.560
There again, one thing
you can say about --

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:46.670
I don't think you could ever
accuse him of having a party card.

00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:49.500
And even the -- the
alter-ego protagonist,

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.650
Robert Jordan in the novel, he,
you know, in a sort of stream

00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:57.270
of consciousness way asks
himself, "Are you a Communist?"

00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.060
He says, "No.

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:05.220
But I accepted Communist discipline
for the duration of the war."

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:06.520
That's it.

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:09.540
So he does acknowledge being a
Communist sympathizer in Stalin.

00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:13.810
There's one page in the novel
where he mentions the non-Stalinist

00:58:13.810 --> 00:58:21.210
or non-Soviet indigenous
Communist Party of Spain, the POUM,

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:25.320
Partit Obrer d'Unificació Marxista.

00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:28.270
If it has the word
Marxist in the title,

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:30.900
it's going to be a Communist Party.

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:34.580
Stalin did come in and
eliminate that party.

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:37.710
And, of course, that's
why it's so difficult

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:40.050 position:56%
to understand the Spanish Civil War.

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:43.560
It's not left against right.

00:58:43.560 --> 00:58:44.910
It's left against left.

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:53.190 position:56%
That was largely in Barcelona in May
of 1937 at the Place de Catalonia.

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:56.640
There's a Hotel Cologne [assumed
spelling] and the Telefonica

00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.950
where -- Stalin came in
to eliminate the FAI,

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:02.610
Federacion Anarquista
Iberica, and the POUM.

00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:07.100
And Hemingway ridicules the
POUM in the middle of his novel.

00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:10.450
That's how you can tell that,
yes, he is a Stalin sympathizer.

00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:15.200
And, of course, the best story in
that regard -- about 11 years ago,

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.500
it was 2005, a good book came out.

00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:17.800
There's a Steven Koch,
K-O-C-H, Cook, Koch -- I'm --

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.100
frankly I don't know
how to pronounce it.

00:59:19.100 --> 00:59:20.400
It was called <i>The Breaking Point </i>.

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.700
And it described Hemingway's
break with Dos Passos.

00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:23.000 position:56%
And, of course, Dos Passos was more
explicitly Communist than Hemingway.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.300
Made tours of the Soviet
Union and so on.

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:25.780
But when his translator, who taught
at Johns Hopkins and was a native

00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:27.400
of Valencia, was assassinated
by, or executed by Stalin,

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.960
Hemingway told him to dismiss
it as a casualty of war.

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.340
And so the title of that books
if <i>The Breaking Point </i>.

00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:31.640
And there's a good book in Spanish,

00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:32.940
Ignacio Martinez de Pison,
called [foreign words].

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.240
So he talks about -- there again,

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.540
Hemingway in relation
to Stalinism, sure.

00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:42.730
&gt;&gt; Do you know if Hemingway
ever visited the Soviet Union?

00:59:42.730 --> 00:59:45.950
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade: I know that he
published something with Pravda.

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:50.830
You know, there's a character
in <i>For Whom the Bell Tolls </i>.

00:59:50.830 --> 00:59:52.130
He calls him Karkov.

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:56.180
It's a thinly disguised
name for Koltsov.

00:59:56.180 --> 01:00:01.780
Koltsov was the -- a
journalist for Pravda

01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:04.070
who was Stalin's right-hand man.

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:09.820
And so I don't believe
Hemingway went.

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:12.570
Here's something else
that's rather interesting.

01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:16.850
There's a guy named
Alexander Orloff who record --

01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:20.830
in 1935 he was in Cambridge
recruiting the Cambridge spies

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:24.500
who then became the double
agents for the next 40 years.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:30.370
And in 1936 he goes to Madrid
and sets up the Secret Police,

01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.890
the precursor to the KGB.

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:35.020
So all through <i>For Whom the
Bell Tolls </i>there's a reference

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.550
to the SIM, Servicio de
Investigacion Militar

01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:42.840
which is the Secret Police
at the service of Stalin.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:47.950
Alexander Orloff set all
of that up and he claims

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:52.420
to have taught Hemingway about
guerilla warfare in Benicassim

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.100
which is on the Valencia Coast.

01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:57.240
He had a training camp
for guerilla warfare.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:01.730
So Hemingway was close
to these Communists,

01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:05.880
the Soviets Koltsov
and Alexander Orlov.

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.730
Alexander Orlov --
Koltsov was called back

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:10.030
to Moscow and was killed.

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:12.980
He was part of the purge,
or one of the purges.

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:16.470
And then Alexander Orlov got
recalled and he knew what was going

01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:20.290
to happen, so he escaped, went
to Cleveland, lived his life

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:24.050
in Cleveland, and in 1963 published
a handbook of guerilla warfare

01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:26.840 position:56%
at the University of Michigan Press.

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.020
And he was probably immune

01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:31.770
because he had the identity
of the Cambridge spies.

01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:34.840
That was his protection.

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.790
So, yes, he flirted with disaster
and danger and what have you,

01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:44.220
but there again seemed to avoid
the label more than others.

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:47.480
&gt;&gt; Can I have one other question?

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.780
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade: Mm-hmm.

01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:50.080
&gt;&gt; Sure. In Hemingway's
short stories,

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:55.480
he talks about his involvement
in the Hispanic Civil War.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.770
It seems he's always
doing propaganda films.

01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:00.070
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade: Very good.

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:01.520
&gt;&gt; Did he do -- did he
do any military stuff

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:04.510
with the -- in the revolution?

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:05.810
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade:
I don't think so.

01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:10.120 position:56%
I mean I think you can find a photo
of him reloading a gun for somebody.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:17.190
But I don't -- in fact, there was
a Republican General, a Communist,

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:20.030
who eventually went to Cuba where
he was more comfortable and --

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:24.920
name of Lister, Enrique
Lister, who was from Galicia.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.220
And the name is Lister.

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.020
It sounds English,
but he was Galician.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:31.880
He's got a book published in
1966 called <i>Nuestra Guerra </i>,

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:35.030
his memory of -- his memoir
of the Spanish Civil War.

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:42.500 position:56%
And he ridicules Hemingway frankly
for wanting to go to the front lines

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.280
and -- but just being ridiculed

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:50.600
because he wasn't taken
seriously by the combatants.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.200
&gt;&gt; Douglas LaPrade: Thank you.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.500
&gt;&gt; Francisco Madias:
Thank you very much

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.800
for joining [inaudible]
some Hemingway.

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:57.100
A round of applause.

01:02:57.100 --> 01:03:03.940
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
