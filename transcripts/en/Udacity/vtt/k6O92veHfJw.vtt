00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
My solution, I admit, is not the most elegant,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but it's the simplest that I could find

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
without going into more complicated data structures.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The key thing is that I'm going to go through all my data items,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
there's a for loop over here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
As I explained before, this gets me the length of the data sequence;

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
this gives me a list of all the indices from zero to six, in this case.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We're going to go through these indices one after another in this variable "i."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now comes the tricky part. I pick the i'th data item,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I count how often does this occur in the entire list.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
For the first data item, 1--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the argument here would be 1--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and the count will give me 1

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because there's exactly 1 occurrence of 1.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But for the third item--

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
as we know, "i" will be 2 now, going from zero on--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
then this thing over here will give me the number 5.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm going to hit count.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I get back 3 because there's 3 occurrences of 5.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now I need to find the maximum count,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and specifically the data item that maximizes the count.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For that, I've implemented a variable called "modecnt" that I've set to zero.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If my current count exceeds modecnt, then I've found a new winner.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So as a new winner, I'm going to set the new data item

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to the winner--the mode--

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and I update modecnt

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to reflect the fact that this new winner has a higher count in the data set

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
than my initial zero.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I iterate this. Out comes the mode.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
When I run it for this data set, I get 5.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
If you got this right, then you know a lot about programming.

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This was really a nontrivial programming quiz.
