00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.470
You know as a parent – so I have an 11 year
old and a 7 year old and I’ve gone through

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.870
the whole process up until now.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.740
I think I have like I would say like a ten
year market study of my kids’ eating habits

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.250
and how they were formed and hopefully like
where I can take them to.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.109
When they were young and I’m going to go
back all the way to like from bottle feeding.

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.870
They went from breast milk to formula and
then onto solid foods.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.690
And that was a key point where we could still
control what they were having, what their

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.290
intake was.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:48.490
And knowing this as a chef I would make fresh
purees in the restaurants and then cryovac

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.490
them.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.220
So I would make sweet potato puree, malanga
puree, spinach and carrot.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.559
These days you can vacuum seal just about
anything.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.899
You can buy a vacuum seal at Target and make
your purees, put them in the freezer, pull

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.029
them out and then, you know, you’re giving
– you can really at that point still control

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.719
their internal environment.

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:21.039
I think where we made a mistake – and I’ll
say this is that we started to – as they

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:27.429
got older we started introducing them to whether
it was pastas or French fries and that sort

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.109
of kind of like, you know, the busy parent
ends up feeling like oh, I just want to like

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:34.509
feed them and move on.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.159
And it’s foods that they like and I just
think that that’s a mistake that we made

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.770
and now ever since then we’re still trying
to make up the ground on how do we get kids

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.859
away from these unhealthy foods that they
naturally gravitate towards.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:56.630
I think that there’s a textural issue with
kids that really is hard to overcome.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.429
So I’ve kind of overcome that by doing a
lot of, putting a lot of things in the blender

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:09.750
and getting that first initial eating experience
as a soup.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:16.250
So it’s a warm soup but that has all the
good nutritional ingredients and elements

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.000
into it so that they can have something healthy.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.590
And then at that point it’s still a battle,
it’s still tough.
