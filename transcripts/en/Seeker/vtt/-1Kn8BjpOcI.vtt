00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.520
You know that friend who always tells stories
and you’re like….what the?

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.190
That never happened?

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.810
WELL...they’re not crazy, just a little
sleep deprived!

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.480
(And maybe a little crazy.)

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.080
Hello hello everyone, Laci Green here for
DNews.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.030
Has anyone out there ever had a memory that
you SERIOUSLY WEREN’T SURE HAPPENED OR NOT?

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.030
Oh yeah.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.200
The struggle is real.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.860
Now scientists are helping us understand this
crazy phenomenon.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.230
For the study at UC Irvine, they showed a
clip of a man putting a stolen wallet into

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.429
his jacket pocket to two groups of students.

00:00:33.429 --> 00:00:38.079
Half of the participants then went to bed,
while the other half stayed up - all night.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.981
In the morning, they read a text account of
the crime with false details about what had

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:45.989
happened - it said he put the wallet into
his jeans pocket instead.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.569
Between the two groups, those that were sleep
deprived were significantly more likely to

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:53.460
recall that the video actually showed the
wallet being tucked into his jeans.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.639
This kind of test is called “event coding”,
and it shows us that people code events differently

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:59.089
if they haven’t slept.

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.329
We already know that memories are a reallllly
sketchy source of information - DO NOT TRUST

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:05.840
ANYTHING YOU REMEMBER.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.760
Our memories are so easily influenced by things
like stereotypes and expectations, what other

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.840
people have said about the memory, how you
felt about the memory and so on.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.670
In fact, every memory you have is slightly
distorted every time you visit it.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.860
So, it shouldn’t be much of a surprise that
sleep deprivation can REALLY take you down

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.220
to crazy town remembering things that didn’t
even happen if it’s subtle enough.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.020
This study isn’t the first with these findings.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.259
Another study they conducted found that with
less than 5 hours of sleep, people incorporated

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.829
more misinformation and even claimed they
had seen video footage that didn’t exist.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.719
The studies, which were published in the journal
Psychological Science, are part of an ongoing

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.999
effort to improve the reliability of eyewitness
accounts of crimes.

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:47.659
The researchers say that sleep deprivation
is on the rise - earlier this year the CDC

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.280
even called it a public health epidemic, blaming
the epidemic for more and more car accidents,

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.609
industrial errors, and fatal medical errors.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.579
The data shows about 30% of people experiencing
sleep deprivation at least once within the

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.579
past month.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.899
With this becoming so common, the researchers
think that we may need new legal requirements

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.369
for eyewitnesses -- like having been rested
when they saw the crime.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.090
Or, not having all kinds of suggestions and
interrogations from the police about what

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.750
happened for hours on end.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.819
So folks, have you experienced sleep deprivation
lately?

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.390
Noticed it messing with your memory recollection?

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.379
Tell me about it down below and I’ll see
you next time with more DNews updates!
