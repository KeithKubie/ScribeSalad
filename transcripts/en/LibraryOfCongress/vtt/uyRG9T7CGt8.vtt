00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.290
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good evening
everybody, my name is David Plylar

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.650 position:56%
and I'm a music specialist in the
concert office at the music division

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.260
of Library of Congress and
it's my great pleasure tonight

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.680
to welcome you to our
special lecture,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.940
our guest speaker is the
distinguished [inaudible] professor

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.920
of music at Princeton
University, Kofi Agawu.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.660
Prof. Agawu has taught at major
institutions around the world,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.750
from the University of
Ghana, Hong Kong University,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.750
King's College London and Yale
University to pick just one each

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.110
from four continents among others.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.430 position:56%
Prof. Agawu is an author of five
books and lectures on topics ranging

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.330
from music analysis of
numerous musics to tonality

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.680
as a colonizing force,
excuse me in African music.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.910
His books demonstrate a phenomenal
breadth of scholarly inquiry,

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.980
in his first book Playing With
Science A Symbiotic Interpretation

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.570
Of Classical Music Dr. Agawu
explores the expressive

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.890
and structural aspects of classical
music by composers like Haydn,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.990 position:56%
Mozart and Beethoven in a discussion
of possible semiotic meetings.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.500
Excuse me.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.960
His second book, African Rhythm
Of Northern Ewe Perspective,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.250
takes a more holistic approach
to the study of rhythm grounded

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.770
in language and broader
cultural contributions

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.050
to rhythmic expression.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.850
Prof. Agawu's third
book was the first

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.370
that I encountered
representing African music,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.410
Postcolonial Notes
Queries Positions.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.590
Here he shifts the focus
from subject to scholar

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.130 position:56%
and confronts the study and critique

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.820
of African music's raising
important questions about the way

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.760
in which we think and
talk about music.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.950
His next book continues to work
he began in playing with science,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.780
Music Is Discourse Semiotic
Adventures And Romantic Music.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.500
It shows Dr. Agawu's unique
approach to dealing with questions

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500
of musical meaning
in romantic music.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.730
Prof. Agawu's latest
book from which the topic

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.700 position:56%
of this evenings lecture is drawn
is The African Imagination In Music.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.510
Please join me in welcoming
Kofi Agawu.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.110
[ Applause ]

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.410
&gt;&gt; Kofi Agawu: Thank you

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.340
We're just getting set up here
so it'll be an hour or so.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.160 position:56%
Okay, so it's an honor to have been
invited to speak here of the Library

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.650
of Congress this evening, I'd
like to thank David Plylar

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.100
for this kind invitation and for
arranging things so expertly.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.310
The book I've been asked to talk
about, the African Imagination

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.930 position:56%
In Music is an introduction to black
African music published last year

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.350
by Oxford University press, here
is what I say on the opening page

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.430
of the introduction quote.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.150
"In its richness and diversity
Africa music remains one

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.060
of the most vital repertories
performed today.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.780
It's history reaches back
into the ancient times,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.060
its continued cultivation
on the continent is as alive

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.280
and human centered as it ever was,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.570
and its worldwide influence
is indeed subtle and profound.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.710
This book is designed to
support exploration of some

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.970
of the core features
of African music,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.410
for the most part emphasis is
placed on the music itself rather

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.910
than on external factors,"
end of that quote,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.530
and if you sense anything polemical
at all about that introduction

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.630
or you're sensing some
of that is real.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.210
So my approach is not to sell
you facts or alternative facts

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:24.670
about African music but
to find creative ways

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.460
of supporting your
own exploration of it.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.290
I'm not seeking to do Africa
from scratch, complete with maps

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.690 position:56%
and photos nor do I wish to peddle
Africa to its historical oppressors,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.850 position:56%
I aim or about to reach readers
who'd like to listen to Africa music

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.060
and for whom a modest elaboration

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.340
of its core features
might deepen appreciation.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.610
What do I mean by African music?

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.580
African music is music conceived,
created and performed at least

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.060
in the first instance
by African peoples.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.490
It includes vast repatries
of precolonial origins,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.640
we call that traditional music,

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.400
others of more recent vintage
associated with a populist sphere,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.980
we call that popular music, and
still others produced in of mold

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.440
of arts composed music art,
we call them art music.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.810
My book focuses on traditional
music but includes examples

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.930
of popular and art music.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.820
So let me just start of by
playing you an example of the kind

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.580
of traditional music
that I write about,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.490
this is a southern Ewe
dance called Agbadza.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.380
[ Music ]

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.680
That's not Agbadza.

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:27.560
[ Music ]

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.100
Okay, this is going to be a very
long evening if you're just going

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.460
to sit and not move in any way
to this music, it's impossible

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.760
to just sit and listen quietly.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.320
Okay, so my book has 8 chapters
and I just want to start

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.930
by saying a few words about each
of them so that you get a sense

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.550
of the project as a whole,
after that I'll focus

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.420
on the fourth chapter
which deals with rhythm.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.290
So chapter one, Music
And In Society,

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.330
explores the uncommonly close
connection between music

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.460
and society, reminding
us that music is a part

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.040
of society not apart from it.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.810
I identified 3 important
occasions for musicmaking as work,

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.970
ritual and entertainment.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.690 position:56%
I discussed the role of music in the
lifecycle with particular reference

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.110
to death, and I end the chapter
with reflections of the nature

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.230
of the relationship between musical
structure and social structure

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.150
and in particular the
role of circles

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.950
in various conceptualizations
of music's social attachments.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:42.280
Chapter 2 On Musical Instruments
acknowledges the incredible number

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.570
of sound producing objects
found on the African continent.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.250
There's been a great deal of
research on musical instruments

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.040
and since part of my aim in
the book is to introduce some

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.880
of the scholarship as well I cite
a handful of writings by 18th

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.950
and 19th century explorers.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.720
Now there's a famous classification
system devised by two Germans

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.000
on the eve of the first war,
on Bostol [phonetics] and Zacks

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.360
which is a mainstay of
scholarship on African music.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.920
So it specifies, I don't know,
some of you might know it.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.510
It specifies things like aerophones
which are wind instruments,

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:21.410
chordophones, string
instruments, idiophones,

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.340
self sounding instruments
and membranophones drums.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.350
I reject this classification
system and suggest instead

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.500
that we pay attention
to indigenous ideas

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.350
about musical instruments
including their names

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.660
and number of which onomatopoeic.

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:44.410
It is better to say dum dum
than to say talking drum.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.390
The chapter ends with commentary on
individual instruments like voice,

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:54.750
hand clap, drum and so on and
on ensembles especially those

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.990
that cultivate heterogeneous
sound ideal.

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:05.010
Chapter 3 which is my personal
favorite explores what I believe is

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:10.560
a deep and profound relationship
between language and music.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.160
I suggest that you will get
a lot more out of listening

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:19.920
to Africa music if you know African
languages or are at least alert

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.870
to the imprints of language as
both sound and sense on music.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.910
The topic is huge so I
focus on just six subtopics.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:35.580
First the relationship between
speech tones and melody and this

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.170
because as you know many
indigenous African languages are

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.470
tone languages.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:45.290
Second, talking drums that
is rendering speech on drums

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.910
or mimicking the rendition
of speech on drums,

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.890
it's the second level pretend
talking drum if you like.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:57.560
Third song which is an amalgam
of word and tone and those

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.630 position:56%
of you who'd think I'm old-fashioned
will find a discussion here

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:06.160
of a hip life song by Omanhene
Pozo a Ghanaian rapper.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.720
Chapter, then the fourth
thing is meta-language

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.630
which is language about language.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.210
The fifth is idiophones
or picture words,

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:22.080
the Germans call it cloud's
builder, these are marked words

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.910
that vividly depicts
sensory perception

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.750
and it's a linguistic phenomenon
that has a musical dimension.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:38.060
And finally a certain linguistic
residue in performance sensibility,

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.580
is one of those things where,
I think there's something there

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:45.850
but I can't really nail it down and
so I put it there as a suggestion.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.090
Chapter four is about Rhythm
which I will return to,

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.140 position:56%
chapter five makes a case for Melody

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:57.600
because African music surprisingly
is not normally credited

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.160
with great melodic imagination.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.090
One scholar says that "melody is
not one of the essential features

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.870
of African traditional
music", while another,

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:11.790
a very distinguished
one writes I quote

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:16.730 position:56%
"rhythmic interest often compensates
for the absence of melody

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.090
or the lack of melodic
sophistication",

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:25.930
this is actually a textbook but I
will not mention the author's name.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.490
These claims ought
to be interrogated

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.530
and not accepted on face value.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:35.850
So by way of a counter
assertion I analyze a few songs,

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:41.830
an Akah entertainment song, a
lullaby [foreign language] a song

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:46.850
by Fella, and an Ewe dirge to show
that if you approach melody as

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:51.880
and meaningful utterance then the
idea that there're any deficits

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.830
in Africa melodic imagination
becomes frankly unintelligible.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:02.970
Chapter six discusses form, another
of those domains was elaboration

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.250
by African musicians has
not garnered much praise

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:10.970
but all you have to do is pay
close attention to the ingenuity

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:14.430
with which performers
deployed techniques like call

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:20.450 position:56%
and response variation form and
even moments form to see how nuanced

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:23.750
to this aspect of Africa
music can be.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.060
I end the chapter with a suggestion

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:29.910
that many African forms
are strategically partial,

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:36.400
that is to say they incorporate
holes HOLES not phantom WHOLES.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:43.060
You see if you have a music
that is implicated in society,

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:47.590
it's traces will always require
completion outside the narrow

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.000
confines of the music itself.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.880
Chapter 7 deals with harmony,
forms of simultaneous doing,

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.680
singing together, playing
together and I explore varieties

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.990 position:56%
of parallelism like singing in
parallel thirds or parallel fourths,

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.100
parallel fifths in different
performing practices.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.010
I also touch on modality and
inevitably on the influence

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:19.100
of European functional harmony,
mostly it's Handel and Mendelson.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.690
The book ends with a
chapter on Appropriation,

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.800
we all know that African
music has gone global

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:32.370
that it is regularly appropriated
by musicians around the world,

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.770
musicians in the popular music
business as well as composes

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.910
of art music like Steve
Rise [phonetics].

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:45.430
What are the ethics and aesthetics
of such acts of appropriation?

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:49.660
I suggest the terms in which
such questions might be answered

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.960
and I conclude by acknowledging
the work

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.480 position:56%
of Africa's own arts music composers

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.830 position:56%
in this case two Nigerian
composers Joshua Ozoigbe [phonetics]

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.240
and Fred O [phonetics].

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.120
So these are some of the topics
covered in the African imagination

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:12.540
in music for a mere $27.95
you can explore them further

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.440
if you are so inclined.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.670
So let me turn now to my main
task this evening which is to talk

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:23.760 position:56%
about rhythm, I'm going to read you
parts of the four, play you a number

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:30.520
of recorded examples, and then we
can have a discussion afterwards.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.610
So the Rhythmic Imagination
In African Music.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:38.420
By common consent rhythm
is the distinctive element

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.920
in African music, "if European
music is specially marked

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.020
by the rich variety of its forms
and the splendor of its harmonies,

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.340
African music is similarly marked
by the fascination of its rhythms,

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:55.330
Africans have not merely
cultivated their sense

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.390
of rhythm far beyond ours
but must have started

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.570
with a superior sense of rhythm".

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.620
This has to be a British
writer, right?

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:10.750
"says WF Ward" Here's one from
[inaudible] who's well known

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:16.100
as a conductor, scholar of jazz
composer and so on "in respect

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.820
to rhythm, African music is
unquestionably the world's most

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:22.210
complex music."

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:28.170
And finally here's a colorful
one from a book review,

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:32.810
the book is A.M Jones's magnum
opus, it's a book called Studies

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.250
in Africa Music it's from
1959, it's a newer book by now.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:40.570
The review is by a chap who was
actually a missionary to Nigeria

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:47.610
in the 1950s and 60s
"Jones's book introduces us

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:53.160
into a strange enchanted world of
pure sound made up almost entirely

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.610
of complex patterns
of drum and gong taps

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.630
to call these complex is an
understatement, the very thought

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.950
of them makes one dizzy, imagine
two drummers playing together

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:10.140 position:56%
and cross rhythm, three against two,
now stagger them so that they're

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.870
out of phase, now add two
other drummers and a singer

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:18.010
and clap accompliments all
rhythmically at cross purposes

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.470
and out of phase with one another.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.290
And I was actually tempted to
play you that Agbadza example

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:28.760
but that's the kind of thing
that he was thinking about.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.500
So now the reviewer's dual
invocation of the mystical

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:37.170
and the technical, the mystical
being a strange enchanted world

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.590
of pure sound and the
technical being three

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:46.990 position:56%
against two cross rhythm, this dual
invocation I would say book ends the

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:51.850
thematic content of the larger
discourse on African rhythm

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:55.440 position:56%
and there're many stages in between.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.810
If you want more of
these quotations,

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.700 position:56%
they're kind of entertaining you
can look them up in my earlier book,

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.810 position:56%
the one called Representing
African Music which David mentioned.

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.400
Now despite such wide
widespread affirmation,

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.980
rhythm remains a contested topic
in African musical research, why?

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:21.310 position:56%
Well, for one thing scholars bring a
variety of disciplinary backgrounds

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:25.600 position:56%
so psychology, aesthetics, religion,
phenomenalogy, mathematics,

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.440
music theory, musicology,
ethnomusicology and so on.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.880
While this could in
principle be enriching,

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.530
it has also spawned a
proliferation of terminology

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:40.350
that does not always promote good
understanding, we encounter temps

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:44.700
like metrical inversion,
conmetric accents as opposed

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:50.690
to contra metric accents, poly
meter, multimeter, African 44,

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:54.040
simultaneous multidimensionality
and so I like that one

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.350 position:56%
because there are so many syllables.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:01.170
There is an unproductive
excess here, I think.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.670
Second, scholars disagree
about the nature

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.590
of the actual organizing principles
and how best to represent them,

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:13.620 position:56%
is there a pulse of the beats and
if so, are they equidistantly placed

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.650
and can they be grouped into
meters like 4 4 and 12 8?

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.620
Is there a one, what is an accent,

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.280
what about the so-called
master drummer,

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.940
how does he come up
with his patterns?

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.240
And these are not rhetorical
questions by the way,

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.070
they can be and have been answered.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.900
The real issue is why they keep
coming, you know, coming up.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.710
Third, to make matters worse,
there's not even a word

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:44.590 position:56%
in many indigenous African languages
for rhythm, you could not go to eleo

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:49.670 position:56%
or a yuroba or an Ewe drummer and
say "I'd like to discuss the subject

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.390
of rhythm with you, mate."

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.770
Fourth, understanding
rhythm seems to me

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:02.480
to demand a performative stance
not normally required of analysts

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:07.240
of pitch for tumber or texture,
rhythm after all is movement,

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.720
it embraces the general time
aspects of music, it is felt,

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.680
it is sensed, it is heard.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.870
So without the mediation of
performance I think the gap

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:22.260
between the phenomenon and its
representation grows and fifth

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.080
and finally Africa is huge.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.830
Over 1 billion people as
you know, 2000+ languages,

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.410
2000 ethnic groups, 54
countries and so on.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.710
While some have suggested that West

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:40.080 position:56%
and Central Africa are the elaborate
rhythm areas as distinct from east

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.070
and southern Africa what are
the elaborate polyphony areas

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.020
that generalization is
already problematic.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:52.970
Indeed it seems unlikely that there
exists a single rhythmic practice

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.000
given the extraordinary
variety of expressive modes some

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.800
of which have resulted from
sedimentation's of style

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.260
through trade and migration and
from influences both across Africa

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.770
and between it and other
regions of the world.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.860
These amounts to big
challenges for anyone attempting

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.160
to characterize the scope

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.960
of the rhythmic imagination
in a short lecture.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.210
So let me set idealism aside,
I always find it convenient

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:26.230
to do that, and do what's
doable in the 30 minutes

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:30.750
or so that I have left and I'm just
going to identify four principles,

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:33.360
or concept that I consider
fundamental

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.960
to African rhythmic expression.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.650
First is the distinction between
rhythms of speech and rhythms

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:42.050
of the body, second is polyrhythm,

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.530
third is the so-called
timeline pattern,

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:50.300
and fourth are the master
drummer's rhythmic narratives.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.650
So my interest here is
in the foundations rather

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:56.650
than their decorative
exterior, the base if you

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.260 position:56%
like rather than the superstructure.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.530
I suggest that the complexity

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:06.030
of African rhythm the so-called
complexity is an orderly

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:10.780
and rational complexity not
the outcome of happenstance

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:14.490
or a vaguely defined
improvisory [phonetics] process.

00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:18.480
By attending to its structural
aspects through analysis,

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.600
we can appreciate better the
real intellectual achievements

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.860
of African musicians.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.540
So first rhythms of speech
and rhythms of the body.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.840
So the world of rhythm
is made up of two kinds,

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.190
rhythms of speech,
and rhythms the body.

00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:39.370
Rhythms of speech are that
gyrational, accentual,

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:43.150
and periodic patterns
that result from speech

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:47.410
in everyday verbal communication,
syllabic durations alternate

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:51.720
between long and short,
accentual patterns emerge either

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.730
from phenomenal stress
associated with timbre

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:58.630
or from tonal change
while periodicity is says

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:02.870
in the asymmetrical successional
segments of performed speech.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:07.990 position:56%
Be it a greeting, the swearing of an
oath, a town crier's announcement,

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.920
the pouring of libation,
the minister's sermon,

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.000
a radio announcer's interview,
the Chiefs linguists admonition,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.380
or a traditional healers
incantations.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.910
The rhythms of spoken language
may be reproduced directly

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.570
in a speech mode of
instrumental performance

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.870
or incorporated into song.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:34.100 position:56%
Rhythms of the body are showcased in
the scores of dances performed daily

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.890
across the continent [inaudible]
in Uganda, Kpanlogo in Ghana,

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.920
Nganda in Gambia, [inaudible] in
Cameroun, Sindimba [phonetics]

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.480
in Tanzania, [inaudible]
in Nigeria and so on.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:52.870
These repetitive rhythms enable,
motivate or accompany movements,

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:57.060
whereas rhythms of the body are
modes of communal expression,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.910
rhythms of speech are modes
of individual expression,

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.300
whenever speech takes on
a mode of communality,

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:10.350
it submits to regulation and
is molded into poetry or song.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.280
The rhythms of the body then act
closer to music than to speech

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:17.820
because their purpose is
to carve time in response

00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.520
to movements while rhythms
of the body have the capacity

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:23.660
to communicate verbal messages,

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:28.040
their primary purpose is
to make play possible.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.610
Now distinguishing the
rhythms of speech from those

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:36.200
of the body allows us to
present their conjunction

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.760
as a basic syntactical
unit in African performers.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:47.170
A favorite organizational device is
the succession speech mode followed

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.800
by song mode where song may
include dance which serves

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.190
as the external form
for many genres.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:58.650 position:56%
Here's an example from the Ewe dirge
repetition and I should just say

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:04.060
by the way I don't intend anything
funny by singing for you tonight.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.360
So [singing in foreign language],

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.970
so [foreign language] is
a pretend sympathizer,

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:13.380
somebody who is pretending
to be sympathizing with you,

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.510
but is actually laughing
at you behind your back.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:30.790
[ Singing in Foreign Language ]

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.090
It's like speech, right?

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.890
You can basically

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:43.450
[ Singing Continues ]

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.130
So free rhythm if you
like, speech rhythm,

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:51.420
it's declamatory rhythm,
it's on its way to song.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.450
Now this lower material may be
played on a drum or a xylophone

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:58.810
or a flute or some other
instrument and it's often valued

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.890
for its contemplative
or philosophical import.

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:07.080
Proverbs, deep thoughts and
an enigma's put performance

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.140
and listeners in mind of
those things that lie beyond,

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:14.540
powers that exceeds their
own and this in order

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.420
to underline the solemnity
and spirituality

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:20.810
of the performance occasion.

00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:26.050
Only after this acknowledgment has
been made do the performers proceed

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:30.380
to a second main section are
the section featuring rhythms

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.290
of the body.

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.580
So this dirge Afakwei
[phonetics] continues

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.510
with a call and response pattern.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:58.130
[ Singing ]

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.760
You see you didn't do it.

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:06.480
Anyway, now we're now in the realm
of strict rhythm, metrical rhythm,

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.210
gentle movements accompany
this second part of the dirge

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.850
as befits their status
as elements of a genre

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.150
of crying songs [foreign language].

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:19.410
I don't have time really to
pursue this model further,

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:23.240
it's common in many traditional, in
your traditional forms but I want

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.450
to turn now to polyrhythm which
many consider the quintessential

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:33.270
manifestation of rhythms
of the body.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:36.930
So rhythms of the body
are typically elicited

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:41.080
by an ensemble producing
distinct rhythms formed

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.500
into a polyrhythmic constellation.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:49.660
While there is no single ensemble
that obtains throughout Africa,

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:56.350 position:56%
the idea of an ensemble delivering
a highly coordinated musical message

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.090
refracted through a set

00:26:58.090 --> 00:27:01.880
of contrasting tumblers
is the standard.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.430
Whether it's a large ensemble

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:07.060
like a thirty piece Mozambique
xylophone orchestra or a small one

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.880
like a four piece like
Yuroba [inaudible] ensemble,

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.390
whether it is made up of
the same instrument type

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:16.830 position:56%
or different instruments the
ensemble as a collective intends one

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:22.190 position:56%
and only one thing, namely to
create the conditions of possibility

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.280
for shared meta rhythmic expression

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:30.440
around a common point
of temporal reference.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.590
Now you all know what polyrhythm
is so let's prove it tonight

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:37.930
by doing a little exercise
and I'm going to just ask you

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:42.940
to speak the constituent
rhythms of a southern Ewe dance,

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.450
this is a Gahu [phonetics]
dance in the version

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.190
that David Locke has taught us.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:52.210
So if I could just have the first
three rows to my right, yeah?

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:59.510 position:56%
So we're just dividing it here and
you're the bell so you're just going

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.880
to go gon, gon, gon, gon,
gon, gon gon, gon, gon,

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.200
just choose any pitch
you want, gon, gon,

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.250
gon and the compliment
here you're the rattle,

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.120
gon gon, please keep going.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.250
It's going to be a
long night, I know.

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:19.820
Pati pati pati papa, pati pati

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:23.500

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.940
So starting with you
Emefa and folks,

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:36.930
the last three rows,
so let's start again.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:38.500
Gon gon, gon, gon, gon,

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:50.830

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:55.040
dentonton, dentonton,
dentonton, dentonton.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:03.370
Raise the level dentonton,
dentonton,

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:09.360
and listen to the others
[inaudible sounds], very good.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:13.090
David, can you help me here?

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:19.410
Okay, so I'm just going to play you
a recording to make you feel bad

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.290
of what you just performed.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.820
[inaudible], ah okay.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:44.590
[ Music ]

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:48.090
That was you, the bell,
that was you.

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:49.550
Very good, huh?

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:51.510
You're better.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:30:25.080
[ Drumming and Singing ]

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.250
Okay, so goes on, yeah?

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:33.890
So polyrhythm manifests
a many in one ethos,

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:39.080
it is a form of simultaneous
doing rather than uniform doing,

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.250
its effectiveness derives in
part from the different shapes

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:46.920
of the component rhythms,
the non-coincidence of points

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.570
of instantiation and termination

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:55.480
and extensive often unvaried
repetition of the patterns.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.510
And again there many many
polyrhythmic ensembles I won't be

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:03.120
able to illustrate all of
them but you did very well.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.340
So what kind of ecology
sustains the cultivation

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.910
of this prominent musical device?

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.210
Plurality, yeah?

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.590
The plurality enshrined
in polyrhythmic playing

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:22.080
or singing is a disciplined
plurality.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:26.380
Each player maintains the
integrity of his part while

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.880
at the same time ensuring
the coordination

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.730
of the ensemble as a whole.

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:35.980 position:56%
This is an impressive ability
cultivated that over many centuries,

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:38.330
this kind of polyrhythm is not

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:43.830 position:56%
for weak minds although superficial
acquaintance may lead one to suppose

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:46.600
that the ensemble is
a loose configuration

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.910
in which individuals
do their own thing,

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.250
correct performance is
typically constrained

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.520
by a central point of reference.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:58.500
One that is always felt but
not necessarily sounded,

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:04.600
that is why we speak of polyrhythm,
many rhythms not poly meter,

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.340
many meters or many
points of reference.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.210
Then deep connection to dance,
the most profound response

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:16.090
to polyrhythmic drumming, as
the example you just heard

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:20.100 position:56%
and performed is found in the dance,
well I'm not going ro ask you to do

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:25.110
that tonight, watch the dancers
and in particular the feet

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:28.030
and you will see how these
rhythms are embodied.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:32.480
A good dancer distills the
metrical essence of the music

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:35.490
and expresses it in movement,

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.600
the body grounds the
apparent diversities

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.490
of timbres and onsets patterns.

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:46.900
Dance conveys a synoptic sense
of locus of beat and weight.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.630 position:56%
The music is translated, interpreted

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.790
and at the same time
generated by the dancer.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:57.560
So if as is sometimes said
in the beginning was rhythm,

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:02.240
then dance was not too far
behind, and here I'd to say shame

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.980
on all those 19th-century Christian
missionaries to West Africa

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:09.760
who told the converts that it
was a sin to dance and indeed

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.000
that their dancers were evil.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.390
Don't worry, my father
was a minister

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:17.170
so I'm allowed to say these things.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:22.530
The idea of polyrhythm has
occasionally elicited some rather

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.340
fanciful associations.

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:32.540
Here is John Collins expeciating on
what he calls the poly sided life

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.370
"relativism and pluralism
permeate many aspects

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:41.890
of traditional African life, things
must come and be done in multiples,

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:46.490
no single rhythm deity or
timescale should steal the show,

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:48.490
African music is polyphonal
[phonetics],

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:53.560
their religions are polytheistic,
their calendars polycyclic,

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:56.050
the plastic arts poly angled

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:59.620
and their social organization
polycentric.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.370
You can almost fill in
for me when I come to it.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:05.850
This poly sided African
view even applies

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:07.910
to traditional domestic life,

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:13.130
marriage is customarily polygamous
just as no single rhythm is allowed

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:17.210
to dominate the African beats
so two no single deity, soul,

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:21.130
or timescale is allowed
to hog all the limelight

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:25.920
of the African ritual cosmos" You
know I almost didn't read you this

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.220
quote because I was very worried

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:31.040
that it'll be the only thing you
remember from my lecture tonight.

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.310
I'm not sure, this is me now, I'm
not sure that this has been taught

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:39.020
through sufficiently, are
these analogies or homologies

00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:43.700
or simply systems supporting
similarly structural rhythms,

00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:46.680
but Collins is not the
only one seduced by polies,

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.980
here is BB Bakari [phonetics]
Yusif's quote,

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:52.480
"although a contemporary
Nigerian society

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:57.050
and contemporary Yuroba culture
is on the surface divided in terms

00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:00.750
of Christian and Islamic
faiths, the deep structure

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:05.740
of the society is polytheistic
and ordered by the spirit world

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:09.150
of the accommodative
traditional gods,

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:13.450
this theological background
is revealed most readily

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:17.640
in aesthetic practices
such as dance and music,

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:24.660
polytheism in spirit translates
into the aesthetics of polyrhythm"

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:31.060
but if, sorry, ahead
of myself there.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:35.590
But if polyrhythm is normally
constrained at some sort

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.290
of background level, the level

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:41.290
of deep structure then surface
plurality should always be

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:45.160
understood in relation to
subsurface singularity.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:50.500
Bakari Yusif's wish to reject
conceptual monotheism is

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.710
understandable but here
argument is somewhat inconvenient

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:59.530
by the existence of an
ineliminable mono somewhere

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.900
at the back of ensemble playing.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.200
Moreover explanations such as
Collin's and Bakara Yusif's

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.940
that seek to align processes from
different domains; from religion,

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.930 position:56%
architectural, linguistics, biology,
sociology and so on must contend

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:18.710
with the possibility
that discontinuities

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:25.220
between domains have just as strong
claims to nomativity as continuity.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.380
Timelines.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.820
So now with the sound of
polyrhythm ringing in your ears,

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.440
I'd like to just zero in
on one of its components

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:39.650
on the so-called timeline
pattern and observe

00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:43.190 position:56%
in a little bit more technical
detail, I hope you'll grant me that,

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:46.890
some of the workings of
the rhythmic imagination.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:50.220
Now anyone who's listened to any
of the varieties of African music,

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.760
being it traditional,
neo traditional

00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:56.920
or popular is probably already
familiar with timelines.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.300
So what is a timeline?

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:04.680
A timeline is a rhythmic pattern
of modest length that is repeated

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:09.390 position:56%
in a manner of austinato [phonetics]
throughout a particular dance

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.690
drumming, yeah?

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:12.510
So if I do the one
that you guys did.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:17.100
[ Drumming and Singing ]

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:20.890
You could be doing that for
a hundreds of times as long

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.340
as the dance is lasting
but that's a timeline.

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.510
Another one very common one is;

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:32.040
[ Drumming and Singing ]

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.820
That one is the 221 2221 pattern.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.120
Do you know how I got that?

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:41.150
Those are just the gyrations, yeah?

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:46.650
Okay, normally entrusted to
the bell or custonet or sticks

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:50.840
or stone timelines often
project a distinct perhaps even

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.160
memorable shape.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:57.180
Although there are bells and sticks
made up of unchanging pulsation,

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.410 position:56%
the majority of timelines display at
least two contrasting node values,

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:05.750
a long and a short if you like,
this by the way is another sign

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:11.460
of the minimalist impulse that's
widespread in African creativity.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:15.240
Although the function of timeline
patterns is sometimes likened

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:19.270
to that of a metronome, there's
a significant difference.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:24.970
Unlike metronomes which mark time
and thus help to locate patterns

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:30.770
against a wall of accentless
strikes, timelines carve time,

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.220
they are integral to the music.

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:38.370
Each individual timeline is in
principle structurally dependent

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:43.360
on prior metronomic foundation.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.400
There's a lot to say
about timelines,

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:50.140
about the historical origins,
their geocultural distribution

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.700
and their association with speakers

00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.450
of Bantu languages who're
also exponents of polyrhythm

00:38:56.450 --> 00:39:00.490
but I'm going to for go all of
that in the interest of time.

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:03.990
In my book you'll find a
discussion of 12 of these timelines

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:07.530
out of possibly hundreds
from West and Central Africa,

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:12.570
but I'll only talk about
four of them tonight and the,

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:15.530
let me just say that
the structural features

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:17.790
that I think are worth noting are:

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:25.290
first inter onset interval
structure, which I said 221 2221,

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:28.060
that just means the distance
between onsets, yeah?

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:33.130
Second is the meter, is
it 12 8 4 4 and so on.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:40.160
Third is a possible notated
mnemonic and fourth is the grouping

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:42.830
with the thing, it's grouping
So I'm going to do this

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:45.970
as a little oral exercise
with you, yeah?

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:54.870
So let me start off with
the archetypal clap pattern

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:57.410
which is [clapping]
now when I'm doing this

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:00.060
and you're sitting there
looking at me, it feels weird.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:05.380
That's all, I know
it's an imposition.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:11.720
Okay, what's the inter onset
interval pattern there?

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:20.740
Sorry? Well three shorts and
two longs, right [clapping]?

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:29.530
So it's 222 333, yeah?

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:30.830
You okay with that?

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:32.130
Very good.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:35.690
So I'm going play you
some examples of this

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:39.720
and I'll explain why I think it's
an archetypal pattern actually

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.160
because it combines
twos with threes,

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.370
it has a generative capacity.

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:47.810
Once you have two and
three you're okay for a lot

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:49.800
of Africa rhythm by the way.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.130
So let me just play you
some instantiations of this.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:56.380
In fact the Agbadza
that I played you

00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:00.510
at the beginning has
that clap pattern.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:21.040
[ Music and Clapping ]

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:26.380
Okay, good, very good Now it
doesn't always come in that form,

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:34.820
here is another instantiation
[music],

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.850
this is from Liberia,
the first one was Ghana.

Let's go to the Central
Africa Republic,

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:48.390
this is a little more motivic

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:58.160
same thing 222 333.

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.510

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.790
You have to hold on, so
once those drums come in.

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:20.150
So that's one timeline
and if you want to pursue

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.800
that through a whole host of
repertories, you'll find it there.

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.940 position:56%
Here is another one, this one is the

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:29.510
so called standard

[ Clapping and Singing ]

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:44.290

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:47.690
So this is one of the
best-known of all timelines,

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.500
I'll play you a couple of examples,

here is just the timeline
by itself on there.

if I asked you what the beat was,
you probably wouldn't know it,

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:04.570
it just keeps going,
shorts and long, yeah?

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:10.510

that makes the beat.

[ Drumming ]

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.080

operating on a budget,

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:51.510
here is one on a bottle for you.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:44:03.280

From Liberia, no reflection
on the economy there.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:11.280
So the standard pattern has a
number of interesting properties,

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.800
it retains a high degree of
invariance under rotation,

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.390
this is all music theory speak,
but I know you're ready for it.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:23.770
It has a maximally even
distribution of those seven onsets

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:30.020
within the 12's span and that is
to say it samples the space evenly.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.980
It is isomorphic with respect
to the interval structure

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:39.030
of the diatonic scale, the scale
that you guys use [singing]

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:49.210
if you take the interval
structure is 221-2221, okay?

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:51.340
Don't get too excited about that.

00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:54.950
And then for us mortals,
it will be enough

00:44:54.950 --> 00:45:00.530 position:56%
to observe the patterns never ending
or never settling down quality,

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:03.060
this is just speaking
metaphorically,

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.860
not metaphorically I just
mean it is kind of latent,

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:10.710
it is perpetually forward-looking
as if endowed with a permanent

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:14.850
and acoustic feeling and when
it is danced to by Ewe dancers,

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:19.050
the operative reference point
is four dotted quarter notes

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:20.350
in a 12 8 meter.

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:31.880

underlying beat structure.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:36.160 position:56%
The third one, this one I think will
be familiar to you because it is the

a very clear shape in the form

00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:53.550
of the mini beginning, a middle
and an ending, its groupings

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:57.160
and metrical structures are
aligned and it may be related

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:02.320
to the standard pattern through
a process a person calls analog

won't want to go into that.

sixteen pulse of four beat span

these Ghanaian examples,

And so on, yeah?

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:51.170
So what is, one of
the interesting things

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:55.720
about this particular timeline
is that, are you ready for this?

00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:03.980 position:56%
There are 4368 possible rhythms with
five onsets from among 16 pulses.

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:05.750
I wish I could say
I came up with that

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:08.720
but it's only a mathematician
who's working things out and put,

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.530
in other words if you imagine
16 pulses and you're going

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:16.400
to do five onsets anyhow
4368 possibilities.

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.900
So it would be interesting to find
out why African musicians and some

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:25.640
of their relatives abroad have
chosen this particular arrangement

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.850
and forsaken almost all others.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:32.920
Godfred Toussiant who is a
mathematician who's been writing

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:37.270
about the geometry of rhythm has
answers to this and other questions

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:40.830
so instead of giving you
the answers I'll have you go

by his book, anyway TOUSSAINT.

00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:48.940
And then one more timeline
I wanted to put this one

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.730
in as a cool timeline and
you'll see what I mean

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:54.510

on it at water drum.

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:32.650
could be, I could play
you many more of these

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:34.820
but I think you get the
point about timeline,

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:37.920
the nature of the timeline,
the properties, I like to think

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:42.440
of timelines as pearls of
African musical wisdom.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:46.340
Although they're part of the
ordinary unmarked musical language

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:50.260
of many African communities,
experienced in everyday genres

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:55.010
of song and dance, they are
also extraordinary in the extent

00:49:55.010 --> 00:50:00.250
to which the pack in poetry, the
extent to which the pack in poetry,

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:05.020
they pack in tight organization
and characteristic profiles.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.260
Ultimately, these timelines
will have to be returned

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.800
to the polyrhythmic textures
to which they belong in order

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.460
for their full significance
to be grasped.

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:18.860
And just to say a few things

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.630
about the so-called lead
drum or the master drum.

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:27.220
So the West African drum ensemble
often features a lead drummer

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:32.130
or master drummer who enacts
various rhythmic narratives.

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:33.780
Now those who are enamored

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:37.590
of big men may well associate
the master drummer's role

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:41.940
with a characteristic complexity
of African rhythm, but I have dwelt

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:44.020
in this talk on more modest roles

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:48.210
because I believe the foundations
are not always properly understood.

00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:52.220
Still, I think it would be perverse
if I did not say a few things

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:54.480
about the lead drummer's art.

00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:59.090
So all I'm going to do here
is play you three themes

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:06.600
from an Akan dance called "Adowa"
in Willy Anku's digitalized version

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.690
which will show how the
master drum elaborates

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:13.580
or develops its themes, okay.

00:51:13.580 --> 00:51:16.510
So here is theme 1.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:21.420

00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:22.720
Okay so that's the theme.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.510
Now, let's hear what the master
drummer actually does with it.

00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:41.230

00:52:13.060 --> 00:52:16.510
Okay, and then theme C.

00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:40.600
[ Music ]

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:45.410
Okay, so a seasoned lead
drummer arrives at the scene

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:49.100
of performance armed with knowledge
of procedures to be deployed

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.890
in the course of whatever
dance he is beating.

00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:53.830
In Adowa which we just listen to,

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:57.730
a typical performance would feature
a succession of thematic areas

00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:01.010
and the space between different
theme areas would be occupied

00:53:01.010 --> 00:53:03.500
by a conventional bridge passage.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:07.770
Within each area, a verbally-based
thematic pattern is subjected

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:10.000
to motivic elaboration.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.160
How long the drama
dwells in a given area,

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:17.520
which specific devices he employs,
will depend on the dynamics

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:20.920
of his interaction
with dancers, his mood,

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:24.210 position:56%
his sense of the location and so on.

00:53:24.210 --> 00:53:26.950
Now, it is in the specific
technical manipulation

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:30.120
of the grouping structure
of individual themes

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:35.320 position:56%
that the sophistication of the lead
drummer is evident Working with sets

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:37.540
of 12 and always aware
of the position

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.000
of the ostinato bell pattern,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.220
the drama devices patterns whose
spans sometimes equal 12 8 notes,

00:53:45.220 --> 00:53:49.170
sometimes exceed it or
sometimes fall short of it.

00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:55.970
Anku calls these sets, supersets,
and subsets respectively;

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:58.320
they behave in just the
ways you would expect.

00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:02.870
If a pattern introduced by the
lead drummer exceeds the 12th span,

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:04.880
he carries forward the surplus.

00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.850
If the pattern is a
subset of the 12th span,

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:11.210
he knows that a compensatory
gesture will be forthcoming

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:14.700
and whether pattern is perfectly
aligned with the rating 12,

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:17.570
no credits or debits
are carried forward.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:20.370
In this way, the performance
proceeds logically

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:23.570
and in full awareness of
the shifting relationship

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:26.330
between bell and lead drum.

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:30.260
The result is a deep level
of coherence that may come

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:35.860
as a surprise to those who may have
underestimated African intellection

00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:39.500
or indeed, disappoint those
who would prefer mystical

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:44.780
or affective explanation
to a rational one.

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:48.280
Now, it bears emphasizing,
that lead drumming

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:52.520
and ensemble playing take
place within aural cultures.

00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:56.020 position:56%
No traditional lead drummer worth
his salt plays from charts or scores

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:59.350
or notation, so all of
the modulo 12 arithmetic

00:54:59.350 --> 00:55:05.270
that Anku describes takes place in
the heads of drummers not on paper.

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:08.540
Paper rhythms answer
to different orders.

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:12.070
Indeed, they can reach
heights of complexity unheard

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:15.200
of in musical aural tradition.

00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:17.480
Aurality, au all right?

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:23.120
Aurality enforces a regime
in which shape, placement,

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:28.850
and presentational vividness
dictate the basis of play.

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:32.760
The vibrant life of African
rhythm derives precisely

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.880
from this incredible
awareness of the aural

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:41.660
and choreographic potentialities
of its constituent patterns.

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:45.150
And so just to close, this
is a little parting example.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:52.730
In 1965 Simha Arom and Genevieve
Tourelle published a recording

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:56.520
of the music of the Ba-Benzele,
one of the so-called pygmy groups

00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:03.210 position:56%
of Central Africa which included a
little flute tune labeled, Hindewhu.

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:07.810
In 1973, Herbie Hancock in a
signature album fusing jazz

00:56:07.810 --> 00:56:13.730 position:56%
and funk, appropriated this tune for
his own remake of Watermelon Man.

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:15.240
You probably all know the story

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.310
because it's been told quite
a few times I buy Steve Feld,

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:21.160
Steve Pon [assumed spelling] among
others and that is the Bill Summers

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:26.540 position:56%
who was Hancock's drummer, imitated
the Hindewhu sound on a beer bottle.

00:56:26.540 --> 00:56:34.510
So here first, is the Hindewhu.

00:56:34.510 --> 00:57:02.040
[ Music ]

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:08.510
Okay. Now, listen to what
Herbie Hancock has done with it.

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:58.650
[ Music ]

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:05.070 position:56%
I had to wait for that moment with
the bass guitar before I stopped it.

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:07.390
So what Herbie Hancock has done,

00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:10.870
not only is the metrical
multiplicity gone,

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:13.290 position:56%
a jungle atmosphere has been created

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:16.500
to enhance the exotic
effect of the appropriation.

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:21.280
In effect, if you like, a new
rhythmic regime has been imposed.

00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:23.710
Now, Herbie Hancock is
entirely within his rights

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:26.770
to appropriate this idiom of
African music and to incorporate it

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:28.970
into his own language
as he sees fit,

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:32.950
so questions of propriety
are not my concern here.

00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:37.140
My concern rather, is with a
purely musical transformation.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.300
If the shapes of African rhythm

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:42.880
that we've been exploring
today are anything to go by,

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:47.100
complete with their
silence, or short down beats,

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:51.520
their symmetry disrupting kinks,
their nonalignment between grouping

00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:57.090
and meter and so on, then Hancock's
appropriation imposes as I said,

00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:02.330
a new rhythmic regime perhaps and
this is only gently hyperbolic,

00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:06.530
it represents a form of
metrical colonization.

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:10.450
There is an overall
change away from subtlety

00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:14.510
and a hierarchized
multiplicity to overtness

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:18.080
and singularity, hegemony
if you like.

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:25.460
The winks and knowing smiles
had gone, on difference.

00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:27.850
So although African music
has often been portrayed

00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:31.620
as being radically different
from Western music based

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:36.350 position:56%
on an entirely different principles,
Horn Bussell wrote in 1928,

00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:40.030 position:56%
and more recently one of her
colleagues down in the South, wrote,

00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:44.220
"A different way of
being in the world."

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:48.160 position:56%
There is essentially, that is to say
at a certain level of abstraction,

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:52.910 position:56%
no difference between the organizing
principles of African rhythm

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:55.010
and those of Western rhythm,

00:59:55.010 --> 01:00:00.670
both sets of repertories features
speech rhythms, a palpable tactics,

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:03.860
symmetrical as well as
asymmetrical rhythmic phrases,

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.990
superior beats and groups of beats.

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:09.240
Periodicity is governed
by processes distributed

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.960
across multiple dimensions, degrees
of polyrhythm, and the interplay

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:17.050
between pre-composed
and improvised material.

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:22.850
African rhythm indeed manifests the
same kind of hierarchic patterning

01:00:22.850 --> 01:00:24.950
that one finds in Western music.

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:31.090
Namely, an elaborate surface held
in place by a simpler subsurface,

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:35.090
a foreground subtending
a background.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:39.380
What differences there
are, stem from idiomatic

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:43.400
and aesthetic choices made
by individual communities

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.350 position:56%
for particular genres and locations.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:51.210
For example, it is not that Western
music lacks offbeat patterns,

01:00:51.210 --> 01:00:53.920
if you know Beethoven you
know that cannot be true.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.340
It is rather that some
African music,

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.340
especially drum-base repertoires
that have acquired symbolic status

01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:04.900
as exemplars of authentic
African music, invests heavily

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.030
in persistent offbeat patterning.

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:11.850
It is not that African
music lacks down beats,

01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:16.230 position:56%
it is rather that some African music
takes the weight off the down beats

01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:19.820
in order to create a more
fluid or mobile process.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:23.670
It is not that Western instrumental
music is not the dependent

01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:28.010
on language, it is rather that the
speech mode in instrumental music

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:29.580
of the 18th and the 19th centuries

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:32.650
for example has been obscured
I think in the writings

01:01:32.650 --> 01:01:36.270 position:56%
of theorists with different agendas.

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:39.090
Comparisons like these
can seem naïve

01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:43.380
or counterintuitive especially
for people for whom the sound

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:49.270
of African music is self-evidently
different from that of Western,

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:51.050
but peering beneath the surface

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:54.620
to behold the specific
organizational procedures,

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:59.970
will reveal a significant degree
of subsurface convergence.

01:01:59.970 --> 01:02:05.730
Western and African rhythm share
patterns of well-formedness.

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:10.450
It is in thematizing than
well-formed that preferences,

01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:14.420
some of them marked, are exercised.

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:19.100
The African rhythmic genius
is best appreciated not

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:23.750 position:56%
from separatist accounts postulating
radically different foundations

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:28.480
and premises but from comparative
studies showing how African

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.720
musicians excel at
the things we all do.

&gt;&gt; Hi, you spoke about language
influencing the rhythms,

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.870
could you speak some
different African languages

01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:21.620
to show us examples of that.

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:26.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so for example, the
Adowa, the one that I played you,

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:31.510
the theme, see if I
can find, oh this one.

01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:37.810
[ Music ]

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:43.730
What the drummer is saying is "Tome
ku me, menie, tome ku me, adanpa.

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:45.740
Tome ku menie."

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:54.040
I'm not a Twi speaker but, buy me
and kill me, "menie" this is me.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:04:00.010 position:56%
So that's an example of a rhythmic
pattern that has a verbal component.

01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:02.910
Now, so it's a slightly more
complicated issue than that

01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:08.360
because although this is
research that was done by Anku,

01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:13.450
we're lacking historical work
on these sorts of patterns

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:19.180
so it is not clear whether in
fact, the verbal component came

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.430
after the rhythm had been devised.

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:23.550
Now you know that sometimes
people playing

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:27.580
in orchestras say will put words
on a sudden rhythmic pattern

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:31.640
to make it easy for them
to play that rhythm,

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:38.360 position:56%
but we need to know whether "Tome ku
me" was the origin of this pattern

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.830
but that's one example in which
the language is aligned with it.

01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:46.250
But the entire phenomenon of
talking drums is precisely that.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.530
That's what talking drums do.

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:54.080
If I say, "Mema mo atenase,
nana ne mpanyinfo," he palyed

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.380
on the drum, [mimics drum playing].

There's nobody explaining it to you,
you're just hearing it on the drums

01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:15.510
and you're supposed
to know what it means.

01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:19.410
[ Inaudible question ]

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:23.300
In that case, in that particular
case the language is being

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:28.250
reproduced, yeah, absolutely
but you know,

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:32.760
if you follow that if you like,
derivational process you'll see

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:36.680
that it's not always a
straightforward thing because even

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.790
within talking drumming,
they're waiting patterns,

01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:47.070
for example waiting signals, you
know, and very soon you will see

01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:50.130
that what started as
something lexical, you know,

01:05:50.130 --> 01:05:53.640
with a semantic component
actually begins to lose some

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:57.750
of that in a musical situation.

01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:02.200
So it's a huge, I talk a little bit
about this in the fourth chapter

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.740
of my book about, sorry, in third
chapter, the chapter on language

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:09.290
and music which I said
was my favorites

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:13.600
but yeah, that's how it works.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:20.250
I think that the language sediment
is something that can be elusive

01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:23.090
and it doesn't because you know,

01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:26.000
these are languages
that are now mediated.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.930
If you put people a language
or some linguistic utterance

01:06:28.930 --> 01:06:31.610
in a musical context, there is
something else claiming your

01:06:31.610 --> 01:06:35.900 position:56%
attention, right, so it would not be
correct as one of my students wrote

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:38.980
in her final but I still passed
her the other time, to say,

01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:44.400
"Anyone who can speak an African
language can understand the talking

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.910
drum," you see, that's
a freshman talking.

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:53.690
It's on the right track but it's
a little simplified, you know,

01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:57.490
because the talking drum
language itself is already

01:06:57.490 --> 01:07:00.460
in a very compressed
universe, you know.

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:01.970
Oh how many lexical items?

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:07.400
Nketiah says there are 500 words
in the Akan you know, lexicon,

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:11.070 position:56%
we're talking about 500 words and
you think about your spoken language

01:07:11.070 --> 01:07:13.430
and how many you have you
see, so you're already dealing

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:16.390
with a restricted universe.

01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:19.110
Which then, sorry, you didn't
ask me about talking drums.

01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:23.000
Yeah, but you wanted to know

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:30.860
about how language
influences rhythmic patterns.

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:51.040
[ Inaudible question ]

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:57.940
Yeah, well, I've two responses
on what you just asked.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:00.530
Absolutely, that's what I've heard.

01:08:00.530 --> 01:08:04.950
I'm not a pattern expert,
but the relationship

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:11.340
between international patterns
and spoken international patterns

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:16.210
and melody for example, in
Hungarian, is very strong

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:19.290
and that certainly parallels what
you find in the African continent,

01:08:19.290 --> 01:08:27.590
but here is the issue, Africa has
conservatively 2500 languages.

01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:31.750
Why are we not spending more
time with these languages?

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:34.330
Why are we not, sorry,
now I'm beginning to sound

01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:37.490
like I'm chastising
you for something.

01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:40.100
There is a wealth there that
we're not talking about.

01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:43.620
So I guess my response is that no,

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:48.290
I don't think that the issue is
different in kind from the example

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:53.870 position:56%
that you brought but I do lament the
fact that for a continent so rich,

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:56.750
you know, in the linguistic
sphere, you know,

01:08:56.750 --> 01:09:01.060
I see so many people you know,
who are you know, they're there,

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:04.470
some are abroad or you know,
semester abroad and they're hanging

01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:08.080
out with other people who are
speaking English, you know,

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.930
they don't want to
learn a little Yoruba,

01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:11.520
it'll you do you a lot of good.

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.390
And when I said that if
you know African languages,

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:20.410
it will enhance your
appreciation of African music,

01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:24.760
I mean that there will be certain
terms, there is a certain sort

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:30.080 position:56%
of contours for example, that you
will immediately recognize as things

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.170
that come from the spoken language.

01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:35.950
It's a mannerism, it's a
sensibility, they're very subtle

01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:38.510
but they're no less
important, you know.

01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:52.010
[ Inaudible ]

01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:54.470
Yeah, there's a supplement
there that,

01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:57.400
but these things need
to be studied I think.

01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:00.200
That's really, all I'm saying.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:06.450
As you know from the remarks
with which I close my lecture,

01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:13.650
I think we should unburden Africa
of difference, in other words,

01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:16.090
you know, people will say "Well,
but that happens everywhere,

01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:20.410
that what we all do so, well so you
mean we shouldn't talk about it?"

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:23.510
No, we will keep talking about
it because if you burden Africa

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:26.480
of difference, then you're saying
the only things worth talking

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.790
about as far as Africa is concerned
is that which is different.

01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:33.180
So you don't want to talk about
the regular flute but you talk

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:38.770
about a nose flute, you
know, that can't be right

01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:43.180
and this is what the
literature for the most part,

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:45.540
I may be exaggerating, but this
is what the literature is saying,

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.070
burdening you so that, that
which seems like it's shared, no,

01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:56.360
no we don't want to hear that.

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:03.240
But that one is different, you
know, what kind of life is that?

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.540
&gt;&gt; In your book, is
there a guide as to

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:08.950
where one might find audio examples
to follow the analysis in the book?

01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:12.960 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yes, so here's the thing, I'm
glad that you asked me that question

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:16.470
because one of the things about
the book is that I referred

01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:20.420 position:56%
to many recordings of African music.

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:24.370
Alan Lomax said famously I
think, it was already in the 50s

01:11:24.370 --> 01:11:27.980
that Africa is the best
recorded continent.

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:30.020
You know, it will come to
you as a surprise but I mean,

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:32.060
there are masses of recordings.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.290
Why are we not using
those recordings?

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:38.700
Because there is a
scholarly sect that at least

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:42.800
at a certain point discouraged
you from using those recordings

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:44.710
as a basis of any kind of research.

01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:47.450
You have to go in there,
make your own recordings,

01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:50.200
get those mosquito bites,
you know, and come back.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.220
You can't sit here and be an
armchair person and cheat,

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:58.300
so this incredible resource
has been sitting there.

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:00.800
Some of them are commercially
available, some of them

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.190 position:56%
and especially nowadays my
students go on Spotify or something,

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:08.150
they subscribe to this and they
tell me they found lots of things

01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:13.510
so close to the beginning of my
book, there is a list of 100 CDs

01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:17.170
and I don't mean this
trivially, I just say you know,

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:18.850
if you listen to these 100 CDs,

01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:21.420
you'll have a pretty good
idea what African music,

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:25.190
mostly traditional music,
is about and my students set

01:12:25.190 --> 01:12:30.020
about listening some of them and
discovering many of them, you know.

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:34.600
So there is also at
companion website

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.380 position:56%
to the book that has a few examples.

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.680
Those are the ones that I talk

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:41.810
about in some detail
in the book and places.

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:45.310
So if you have a copy of the book
you'll get a code that tells you

01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:50.510
where to go to find those
but many of the recordings

01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:55.660 position:56%
that I referred to, you know, you'll
find them in a standard library.

01:12:55.660 --> 01:13:00.400
In the old days we we're doing
LPs and then the CDs came along

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:03.740
and the entire record
shut and then you know,

01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.760
but these things are about.

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:10.120 position:56%
So yeah, I'm glad you asked me about
that and I should make it clear

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:16.710
that yes, a lot of what I referred
to is in the recorded you know,

01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:22.890
the literature of recorded music
and there are footnotes in the book

01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:25.980
that will tell you where
particular things are.

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:30.190
It's nothing obscure; I think
we should share our texts.

01:13:30.190 --> 01:13:40.930
&gt;&gt; I had a question.

01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:45.030
You didn't mention that I
heard any Senegalese music

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:50.410
but that's the African music I'm
most familiar with and that's

01:13:50.410 --> 01:13:53.660
of course just a little bit.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:59.500
The bones or the, and they do
a lot of talking drums as well.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:06.160
Can you speak on, I don't
know what you call the bones

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.840
that they use to drum with.

01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:16.000
Yes, but I thought well,
they call them bones I think.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.530
&gt;&gt; Yes, so I'm afraid no,
I cannot speak specifically

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:27.660 position:56%
to Senegalese music, I know a little
bit about it but it's not, you know,

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:36.100 position:56%
and I actually hadn't heard that
they refer to those sticks as bones,

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:40.350
although I can say that there
are traditions as one in Nigeria

01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:46.330
where they drum with bones and they
claim that these are, you know,

01:14:46.330 --> 01:14:52.530
bones of people they you
know, okay, you know,

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:58.370
but yeah so there is actually
an interesting article,

01:14:58.370 --> 01:15:01.800
I forgot now the author's
name but these kinds

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.920
of intimidation tactics
are there lot.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.890
You know, you will see like the
northern area, we have a big drum

01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:10.690
and you'll see at the top of
drum is a drum called Adabatram

01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:16.700
and you'll see these gorge-like you
know, things you know, draped with,

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:19.210
they're all covered with a
cloth but if you ask them,

01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:23.740 position:56%
they'll say they're skulls you know,

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:26.630
some of us think they're
calabashes but that's okay.

01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:30.640
But that's meant to tell you that
you don't mess with these guys

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.830
because look at the skulls
on a drum that they're using.

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:37.240
But this pattern of, and
I'm not saying, I mean,

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:40.550
they may well have started off as
skulls, they may well be skulls,

01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:45.380
I don't know because you cannot see
these things with the naked eye,

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:50.310 position:56%
but these are the sorts of patterns
that happen I think in any you know,

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:54.530
kind of social system, you
have to build up your own sort

01:15:54.530 --> 01:15:58.860
of symbolic capital, ways in which
you are going to showcase things,

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:04.730
ways in which you are going
to intimidate, you know,

01:16:04.730 --> 01:16:09.280
your competitors and so on and
that's just a very normal thing

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.540
as you know from living
today in Washington DC.

01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:16.680
So, sorry, were you...?

01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:24.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a question about
the lexical items that you refer

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.820 position:56%
to in response to a question earlier
and you talked a bit in the chapter

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:31.700 position:56%
and then the talk about the
importance of understanding language

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:34.360
to understand what's going
on, and I'm wondering

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:40.810
if you have any insights into the
making of traditional music today

01:16:40.810 --> 01:16:43.280
by musicians who may have
a different relationship

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:46.740
to traditional languages
than what's had in the past.

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:51.740 position:56%
Whether it's because young musicians
today are learning English primarily

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:53.700
in addition to only to
speak to their parent

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:58.680 position:56%
in traditional languages or for any
other reason that their relationship

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.620
to traditional languages and
meaning behind them might affect

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:02.920
their [inaudible].

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:04.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, that's
an excellent question.

01:17:04.980 --> 01:17:09.560
So the other week, one, sorry I
keep talking about my students,

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:15.500
I live with them, I work
with them, so retiring.

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:21.140 position:56%
The other week, one of my students,
we were talking about tone languages

01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:27.400
and she said, this is a student who
speaks, I won't mention the country

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.610
but comes from a country and speaks
a tone language, she said you know,

01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:34.700
I didn't know until I took this
course that I was a speaker,

01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:40.880
she is 19 years old, that I
speak a tone language, you know.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.480 position:56%
This was news to her that okay, I
had to confess, yes so it's the Twi.

01:17:45.480 --> 01:17:48.680
The Twi that she was
speaking is a tone language.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:53.280
Because once she was alerted

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:58.650 position:56%
to how differential pitch can make a
difference to meaning, she realized,

01:17:58.650 --> 01:18:00.000
"Oh I've been doing
this all my life."

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:05.730
I suppose it be like prose, what is
that thing about message or down,

01:18:05.730 --> 01:18:08.850
whatever it is, not knowing
what they've been speaking all

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:10.150
their lives.

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:15.270
So that is the happening and as
you say, a lot of young people

01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:18.590
who have maybe a slightly
different, in some cases,

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:24.620
a more tenuous relationship
to language and to the way

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:27.070
that language features
in traditional music.

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:30.130
I don't think one wants to
be legalistic about this,

01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:31.760
because the nature
of these influence,

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.780
I mean all you can do is wish,
you know, wish that many more

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:38.650
of these young people would
speak these languages,

01:18:38.650 --> 01:18:42.520
understand them better, and
still have a better appreciation.

01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:46.770
But having said that, they're
also doing interesting things

01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:49.330 position:56%
in a way they know how to, you know.

01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:53.010
There are mixtures now
and of course if we got

01:18:53.010 --> 01:18:58.110
into the whole popular music realm,
there you'll see whether you think

01:18:58.110 --> 01:19:02.380 position:56%
of it as a cosmopolitan spirit or
whatever it is, it's coming together

01:19:02.380 --> 01:19:04.940
in some very interesting,
very creative ways.

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:12.800
I still lament, you know,
the fact that there is a kind

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:19.500
of linguistic sediment that is
lost and all I can do is lament it.

01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:22.690
I can't really say, you know,

01:19:22.690 --> 01:19:25.570
that means everything is
bad or anything like that.

01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:29.650 position:56%
I do think though, and this is sort
of from an African nationalist point

01:19:29.650 --> 01:19:33.510
of view, but I do think that
if we move the goalposts

01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:36.620
to privileged people who do
actually speak these languages,

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.420
maybe we could win a few victories
over our historical oppressors

01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:43.910
but maybe that's a little
too trivial for you.

01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:46.620
So yeah, I think what
you're pointing

01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:50.180
to is a very real phenomenon
and I don't know

01:19:50.180 --> 01:19:56.540 position:56%
that I have a straightforward you
know, answer to how to deal with it.

01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:01.980
There's somebody at the back, yeah.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:07.560
&gt;&gt; You talked about Watermelon
Man sampling, I'm not sure,

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.360
sampling, what it was but...

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:10.660
&gt;&gt; Hindewhu.

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:16.530
&gt;&gt; Okay, I was wondering whether
you know of African music,

01:20:16.530 --> 01:20:21.150 position:56%
simply non-African music and whether
the nature of African music allows

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.650
that accommodation to happen

01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:27.360
like how well can it
integrate non-African music?

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:30.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah, again that's
an issue that comes up.

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:35.950
I myself have not pursued it,
I think probably for more,

01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:39.890
for ideological reasons,
that is to say

01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:44.870
that people ask me all this time,
what about African appropriations

01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:46.420
of other music, you know?

01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:51.950
Yeah, there are people who
are interested in, you know,

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:55.860
are you appropriating I don't
know, James Brown or Elvis

01:20:55.860 --> 01:20:58.440
or you know what that mean

01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.810
and so the reason I just have
a little trouble with it is

01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:07.920
that the historical situation, you
know, you can't trivialize the way

01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:14.610
that power, you know, has
flown in the sort of historic

01:21:14.610 --> 01:21:18.460
and in other words,
basically if I start singing,

01:21:18.460 --> 01:21:22.820
what is it that the Kenyan
girls were singing, you know,

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:26.250
"Three blind mice, three blind
mice, see how they run," you know,

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:30.180
and I'm doing it in a funny way
and you are not seeing the tragedy

01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:33.460
of that but rather
what you're seeing is

01:21:33.460 --> 01:21:37.690
that I am also speaking back,
you know, here I'm speaking back

01:21:37.690 --> 01:21:41.770
because I'm taking your
tune and I'm modifying it.

01:21:41.770 --> 01:21:44.010
That's kind of a joke
to me, I'm sorry,

01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:46.750
I get very upset about
this, you know.

01:21:46.750 --> 01:21:50.130 position:56%
That is not to deny agency, but it's

01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:56.900
to downplay an underlying condition
you know, that I don't see how

01:21:56.900 --> 01:21:59.750
that can be put aside so
it is difficult for me

01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:01.400
to wrap my head around that.

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:03.930
I'm acknowledging that there's
creativity at all levels

01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:06.010
so don't misunderstand
what I'm saying,

01:22:06.010 --> 01:22:08.680
I didn't answer your question
because you wanted real examples

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.980
of this kind or something.

01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:13.940
I know that there are people who do
that kind of work but I just think

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:17.290
that there is a kind
of problem with it,

01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:20.790
with the kind of assumption
that underlies it.

01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:22.630
That's really the frustration
I'm expressing

01:22:22.630 --> 01:22:25.240
and I'm sorry I got
sort of caught up.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:32.830
So no answer to your question
but it gave me a chance to...

01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:34.220
Yes.

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:36.520
&gt;&gt; I really appreciate
the last two questions

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.410
because that was what I
wanted to ask and also,

01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:44.700
I appreciate just everything you
spoke on today and your chapter 8

01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:46.000
that you talked about,

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.520
this appropriation piece really
intrigued me and especially

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:50.820
when you mentioned the quote

01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:57.180
where you were saying this could
be a hyperbole in terms of,

01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:00.450
I can't remember how you phrased it

01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:03.350
but like imposing this
structural kind

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:06.630 position:56%
of colonialism to its original beat.

01:23:06.630 --> 01:23:12.520
And I'm a migration scholar, I
migrated from Kenya, I grew up here

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:21.870
but I have very much African
nationalist parents and what I fell

01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:24.630
after hearing everyone
asking questions

01:23:24.630 --> 01:23:31.270
and you speaking back is almost
a theme in terms of as scholars

01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:34.610
of African or anything African, we
just want to be heard and we want

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:36.210
to show that our work is important.

01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:38.410
I don't know if you feel
that way but I'm curious

01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:43.740 position:56%
to know how you see your work in
the larger context not just in music

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:52.590
but in terms of promoting African
culture, promoting African legacy,

01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:54.880
and I don't know if you
think of it that way

01:23:54.880 --> 01:24:02.720
but I'm just curious
to hear your thoughts.

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:08.390
&gt;&gt; I think some of that will
be for other people to decide.

01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:11.250
I think I want to get it
right, whatever it is,

01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:14.080
so if I write something,
I want to get it right,

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:21.510 position:56%
it's really the main concern, follow
whatever the scholarly protocol is.

01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:28.680 position:56%
Yeah in idle moments of course, it's
possible to talk about these things

01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:34.390 position:56%
and you know, but I don't know that
I am, sorry I'm just stammering here

01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:37.460
because I'm not quite sure how
to answer that bigger question

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.320
about you know, the
larger scheme of things.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:43.690
The world is huge you know,
I happen to work in music

01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:47.180 position:56%
which is a very small field, you
know, it's not like literary studies

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:48.730
or anthropology and so on,

01:24:48.730 --> 01:24:51.830
bigger fields [inaudible]
but it's a small field.

01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:55.690
It's a field with some sort
of technical requirements also

01:24:55.690 --> 01:25:00.770
that sometimes if you're
drawn to those, discourage you

01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:05.460
from seeking certain kinds
of publicity for example,

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:10.320 position:56%
when you get into technical
detail, you know, about say a dirge,

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.090
which I do in the book unashamedly

01:25:12.090 --> 01:25:14.370
and I will continue
doing that, you know.

01:25:14.370 --> 01:25:16.570
People say oh why are
you doing that?

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:19.580
Do the people think
that way, you know?

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:24.760
That's not what I'm about,
I'm saying let's see what kind

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:28.280
of insight comes from thinking
about it this way you know,

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.820
and then you can decide what to do,

01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:32.280
but if you think everything
originates and do you think

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:34.370
that when you say that
people think that way,

01:25:34.370 --> 01:25:36.300
that their thinking is static?

01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:39.090
You know, that somehow their
thinking doesn't evolve,

01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:42.360
there's a lot of silly things
that people say, you know,

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:47.620
basically to discourage certain
kinds of honest inquiry, you know,

01:25:47.620 --> 01:25:51.790
and to the extent that I'm
above anything is simply

01:25:51.790 --> 01:25:55.230
to say I think these things
are worth talking about openly.

01:25:55.230 --> 01:25:56.700
You can decide what you want to do.

01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.880
I mean, when I told you
don't get too excited

01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:03.100
about this parallelism between, the
isomorphism between diatonic scale

01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:06.530
and this, and so it's like wait
so God gave the Africans rhythm,

01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:10.600
you know so they have their 221221
and then gave the Europeans pitch,

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.140
you know, so they are the 221221

01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:17.450
so we know the Europeans don't
have any rhythm, right, and so on

01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:19.060
but then, I don't like
the other one,

01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:21.810 position:56%
then we know that Africans don't
have pitch, no I don't like that one

01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:24.550
because we have some
amazing you know,

01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:25.940
approaches to pitch organization.

01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:31.560 position:56%
But if more of us I think would just
get these things right, you know,

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.370
and then let the ideological
things take shape.

01:26:35.370 --> 01:26:42.050
It's not something I spend very
much time thinking about but thanks

01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:50.780
for asking it because maybe I will
think a little bit more about it.

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:53.500
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much for your talk.

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:56.580
Who are your favorite musicians

01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:03.260
and what musical instruments
do you play well?

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:06.830
I'm sure you play all of them

01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:14.130
but which ones did you
concentrate on in your studies.

01:27:14.130 --> 01:27:16.890
&gt;&gt; Who are my favorite musicians?

01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:19.510
I don't know that I could
answer that, really, honestly...

01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:25.180
[ Inaudible ]

01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:31.390
Yeah, that's if I mention
one now, the problem is not

01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:34.410
with the one I mention but
the ones I don't know mention.

01:27:34.410 --> 01:27:35.710
&gt;&gt; Well make it [inaudible].

01:27:35.710 --> 01:27:41.930
&gt;&gt; No, it's going to take
too long and I grew up,

01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:45.670
well at a certain point when I
was sort of actively in music,

01:27:45.670 --> 01:27:47.100
I thought I was going
to be a composer,

01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.510
that I was composing mostly, yeah.

01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:53.740
[ Inaudible ]

01:27:53.740 --> 01:27:57.020
Notes...[laughs] and silences.

01:27:57.020 --> 01:28:04.160
Well, very early on I was
writing lots of choral music.

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:07.640
As a minister's son, you
don't have a choice there

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:10.280
and things could be done.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:15.270
I was writing things for my
school, we had a school orchestra,

01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:18.810
I wrote little pieces
with...you know,

01:28:18.810 --> 01:28:22.320
that's where African rhythms thrown
in but well always modulating

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.980
to the dominant and
that sort of thing.

01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:29.250
As an undergraduate, I was a
composition major essentially,

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:34.040
but I got to a point where I
realized that what I was hearing

01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.790 position:56%
and writing was already out of date.

01:28:37.790 --> 01:28:42.140
So my friends and my peers who were
winning all the competition prizes

01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.810
where writing things that
I knew they didn't hear.

01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:48.730
I could not write something that
I didn't hear because I thought

01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:54.660
that was a lie and so the idea that
you could just explore in this way,

01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:56.160
you know, it's not like
you ask one of them,"

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.560
So who are you writing this for?

01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:02.420
Or what are your writing it for?

01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.000
Or we're writing it to win a
prize or something like that,"

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:09.420
whereas I was very constrained
in the way that I was brought up.

01:29:09.420 --> 01:29:14.590
You're writing this for, that you
know, it's an anthem for Christmas

01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:19.970
or you know, [inaudible]
but it's all very modest

01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:23.700
and so I didn't have
the kind of if you like,

01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:26.430
freedom which other people had.

01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:29.010
It's mixed in with other things
and I know we don't want to get

01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:31.020
into you know, compositional
ethics and so on.

01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:34.690
David you'll probably have
a lot to say about that

01:29:34.690 --> 01:29:36.730
so that's anyway, that's that.

01:29:36.730 --> 01:29:39.800
Every once in a while I bring
out some of the things I wrote

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:43.950
when I was 18 or 19 and say, "hey,
that one isn't bad," I actually

01:29:43.950 --> 01:29:46.820
but no, I mean, and
also by the way, I mean,

01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:48.910
composition can be
a means to an end.

01:29:48.910 --> 01:29:53.990
So for me the year spent
composing were years alerting me

01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:58.700
to certain ways of
appreciating what composers do.

01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:01.780
So that's why I think you know,
musicology students for example,

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:05.070
should be forced to compose
because at the end of the day,

01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:07.820
they probably won't write some of
the things they're writing today

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:09.970
if they understood music
more from the inside,

01:30:09.970 --> 01:30:12.630
and if they took this
more sympathetic approach

01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:13.930
to what a composer does.

01:30:13.930 --> 01:30:19.290
So that's what it all led to
for me in the end but I would,

01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:23.060
to the extent that there's anything
that I was say sort of was useful

01:30:23.060 --> 01:30:27.330
to me, it was that
compositional path but a lot

01:30:27.330 --> 01:30:30.710
of what I do now is
analytical and orientation.

01:30:30.710 --> 01:30:35.040
I like to think that it's in
sync with some of the ways

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:37.510
in which composers think.

01:30:37.510 --> 01:30:42.770
[ Inaudible ]

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:50.510
You said well and the answer
is none, [laughs], none well.

01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:54.690
[ Inaudible ]

01:30:54.690 --> 01:30:59.260
Yeah, somebody has
betrayed me but [laughs].

01:30:59.260 --> 01:31:01.880
&gt;&gt; One last question.

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.970
&gt;&gt; I just want to follow
up on a couple

01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:08.410
of questions that have been asked.

01:31:08.410 --> 01:31:15.100
I take issue with the maybe the
slightly negative connotation

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:19.500
of the Herbie Hancock
appropriation just personally;

01:31:19.500 --> 01:31:24.860
I'm not make an argument but...

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:28.980
I see maybe it's an homage that
takes us from the starting point,

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:32.880
just something new with it,
but my question to you is,

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:47.310
in your perspective, how should one
best take this African polyrhythmic

01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:52.940
heritage and create with
it while still honoring it?

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:55.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wish I have the
answer to that question.

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:59.800
I did write a whole chapter on
appropriation and at one point,

01:31:59.800 --> 01:32:04.270
I said maybe the question of
appropriation is moot and it's moot

01:32:04.270 --> 01:32:09.510
after all because we are all, if
you like trapped into these sort

01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:14.760 position:56%
of inter-textual spaces you know, to
compose is to recompose, you know,

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.700
how are you going to stand outside
the things that you remember,

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:22.410 position:56%
the things that you know you
learned, and so on, in order to say,

01:32:22.410 --> 01:32:27.490
okay this is mine but this
one is not mine and so on.

01:32:27.490 --> 01:32:30.320
So I think there's
something very problematic

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:33.400
about the idea of appropriation.

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:37.390
However, there are degrees of
appropriation but that's one thing.

01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:40.770 position:56%
There are traditions that are based
on, somebody asked me about sampling

01:32:40.770 --> 01:32:45.600 position:56%
for example, where the compositional
method actually is premised

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.920
on sampling things, you know.

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:53.330
A lot of the hip life now that we
find coming out of Ghana, you know,

01:32:53.330 --> 01:32:56.710
these kids are sampling old you
know, like supposal that example

01:32:56.710 --> 01:32:59.230
that I mentioned so
there is old highlife

01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:02.830
and then there's what I'm doing
now which is all those rap stuff,

01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:09.690
we're bringing old and new together
and so on in this overt sampling

01:33:09.690 --> 01:33:12.480
if you like, in this
overt appropriation.

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:17.320
I do think that there are
some political sides to this

01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:24.410
that my task really was to air the
issues and then let people talk

01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:26.180
about things from you know,

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:30.150
whichever angle they
find appropriate.

01:33:30.150 --> 01:33:34.180
So for example, Steve Reich, a lot
of people talk about Steve Reich

01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:38.360
because as you know, he had a deep
interest not only in African music

01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:42.870
by the way, in Indonesian music,
in Indian music but he you know,

01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:47.270
went to Ghana in 1970 or
thereabout, studied some music,

01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:49.280
actually most of that time,
I think he had malaria

01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:52.230 position:56%
so he was ill [laughs] but you know,

01:33:52.230 --> 01:33:54.350
we have ways of dealing
with these people.

01:33:54.350 --> 01:34:00.410
But his work is influenced
by African music.

01:34:00.410 --> 01:34:03.700 position:56%
Sometimes they are of a quotational
sort, you know, so taking a timeline

01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:10.520
like in clapping music or you
know, I don't know, there you know,

01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:13.940
and he said, "What I wanted
to do was to think African

01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:16.280
but not to sound African."

01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:21.610
To think African, that is you know,
to internalize that way of thinking

01:34:21.610 --> 01:34:24.120 position:56%
but to speak my own musical language

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:26.480
because he said that's
what he wanted to do.

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:27.780
You know, composers say all kinds

01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:30.050
of interesting things,
sometimes very poetic.

01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:32.490
I don't know how you are able

01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:36.810
to finally test whether he achieved
his aim and so on, you know,

01:34:36.810 --> 01:34:39.350
but that's not for me to say.

01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:44.560
Ligeti is another one,
interesting case where in the book,

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.750
Martin Scherzinger whom you
mentioned has actually done some

01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:49.050
interesting work on this.

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:52.210
He actually went and spent
some time in Basel looking

01:34:52.210 --> 01:34:58.190
at Ligeti's sketches and he found
that you know, how you know,

01:34:58.190 --> 01:35:01.230
people keep like shopping
this on their sketch

01:35:01.230 --> 01:35:02.530
in the corners and so on.

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:07.260
Ligeti had all of the stuff that he
was reading from various journals

01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:10.610
on African music, he was
fascinated by this stuff.

01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:13.270
Does Ligeti's music sound African?

01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:16.690
Not to my ears, I've
never heard anything

01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:20.330
that I would say it's conformative
with the repertoires that I know,

01:35:20.330 --> 01:35:24.760
you know, he had a deep interest,
he pursued it but in the end,

01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.060
all of this was if you like,

01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:30.530
domesticated within his
particular idiolect, you know.

01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:33.410
I think Scherzinger in writing

01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:37.030
that article thought he was
exposing Ligeti in a way,

01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:38.550
you know he doesn't
quite put it as crudely,

01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:42.480
he's a very sophisticated
thinker, but for us, you know,

01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.420
who are not as sophisticated,

01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.970
we see him saying you
see you thought this is

01:35:46.970 --> 01:35:50.280
like your avant-garde and pulls
up but let me show you how much

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:54.500 position:56%
of a debt to Africa there is and
it's not on the surface of the music

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.340
but we have to go and
look at these sketches,

01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:01.870
these private biographical
note in order to expose this.

01:36:01.870 --> 01:36:05.310 position:56%
When all of that is done, you know,
whatever you read, whether you stood

01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:08.350
on your head three times before you
wrote this with journals you read

01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:12.280
and so on, you write a piece
and people decide they like it

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:13.930
or they don't like it, you know.

01:36:13.930 --> 01:36:21.010 position:56%
So really, it would be inappropriate
for one thing for me or I think

01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:25.690
for maybe, well, certainly for me,
to be offering any prescriptions

01:36:25.690 --> 01:36:28.420
about how you deal
with these things.

01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:32.790
I do think however that, a good
understanding of the phenomenon

01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:37.230
so a good understanding of
polyrhythmic to me is useful,

01:36:37.230 --> 01:36:39.490
and what you do with it
if you're a composer.

01:36:39.490 --> 01:36:43.740
Are you a composer?

01:36:43.740 --> 01:36:45.040
&gt;&gt; Oh no.

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.340
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:48.830
&gt;&gt; I'm a drummer, player...

01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:53.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because you got the
metrical thing in the Hindehwu,

01:36:53.670 --> 01:36:56.300
which is good, very impressive.

01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:59.050
Anyway, so yeah that's, I mean,
I've gone on at length but that's

01:36:59.050 --> 01:37:03.010
where I'm coming so the chapter
on appropriation is not you know,

01:37:03.010 --> 01:37:05.050
pointing fingers at these bad guys.

01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:08.670
There is a piece by David Fanshawe
which some of you may have heard,

01:37:08.670 --> 01:37:13.760
maybe it was done in high schools
in a song called African Sanctus.

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:20.840
It's a piece from the 70s and the
Kyrie of that piece has a call

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:24.540
to prayer, an Arabic call to
prayer and then there's a sort

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:29.270
of renaissance-type polyphony that
he composes on top of it, you know.

01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:31.800
If you read what the composer
says, he says I'm trying

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.410
to bring together these two faiths.

01:37:33.410 --> 01:37:35.820
I'm trying to show that the
Christian faith you know,

01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:40.490
and the Muslim faith
you know, can coexist.

01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:44.900
That's his idealization
but if you're, you know,

01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:48.170
a kind of mischievous
hermeneuticist and you want

01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:51.700
to read this thing closely,
it's not so straightforward

01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:55.980
because somebody starts, somebody
finishes, so how do you determine

01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.680
who gets the first word
and who gets the last word?

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:06.250
Why is the Arabic call to prayer
represented by a recording?

01:38:06.250 --> 01:38:07.820
So no presence, right?

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.620
It's always done with a recording.

01:38:09.620 --> 01:38:13.060
[ Background conversation ]

01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:15.450
Very good, yeah.

01:38:15.450 --> 01:38:23.360
On his own original
recordings, this is what he does.

01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:28.270 position:56%
And you know, and then you can go on
and sort of worry this as you know,

01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:32.730 position:56%
unemployed, most colleges want to do
hermeneutics, we'll have a lot read

01:38:32.730 --> 01:38:34.220
but that's the beauty of music.

01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:36.760
It makes possible these sorts

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:40.810
of call them idle you
know, speculations.

01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:47.900 position:56%
you know, it's a feel-good thing but
I think we should just sort of open

01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:50.990
out those issues and as I say,

01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:55.480
if one has a secure understanding
whether it's with the language,

01:38:55.480 --> 01:38:59.190
which Martha was asking
me about or whether it's

01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:02.120
of the rhythmic principles
that are at work,

01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.460
that's the way they are, yeah.

01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:09.590
&gt;&gt; All right let's thank
Kofi Agawu so much for...

01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:11.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:15.630
