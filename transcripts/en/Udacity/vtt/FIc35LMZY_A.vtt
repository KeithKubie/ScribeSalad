00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.840
So first let's talk about what a dynamic
range is in the real world and

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.230
what kind of images we're talking about.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.833
Let's use that to situate our problem.

00:00:08.833 --> 00:00:12.905
I'm going to show you a bunch of
pictures that I took all around my house

00:00:12.905 --> 00:00:13.625
a while ago.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:17.471
And again, it was a sunny day so I was
able to capture images under the sun,

00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:20.712
but at the same time I was able
to find different dark corners.

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:24.388
And the goal here is to showcase to
you a variety of pictures taken under

00:00:24.388 --> 00:00:26.208
different lighting conditions.

00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:30.250
So for example this is my first image
where I took basically in a dark corner.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.266
I took it inside,
there are no lights, you know,

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.167
kind of,
illuminating any part of that scene.

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:39.786
And even with the long exposure you can
see basically it's a dark image with

00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:41.560
nothing there.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.230
Second image I took was
basically again inside, but

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.470
with regular inside incandescent bulbs.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.760
You can see a little bit of the scene,
it's a little bit kind of darkish

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.530
orangish, reddish kind of
stuff are visible, but

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.990
you can see that there's
not much detail here.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.780
Moving up, then we go, still remain
inside, but this time I'm actually near

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.950
a window, which basically means that
the scene is now naturally lit.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.810
So there's a little bit
of detail in the scene.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.970
Now you can actually see the character
and the book and everything.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.580
Next one I basically now move
the same two objects outside, but

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.980
this time I'm under a shade.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.280
Again you can notice that from going
here the amount of light is increasing.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.120
Finally move to the outside,
now this time under the sun of course,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.560
I've intentionally made it still
that there are no shadows or

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.890
anything else like that.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.610
But you can see now the scene is much,
much better lit.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.490
Of course in none of these images
I'm playing around with any

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.630
external lighting source like flash or
anything else like that.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.520
Another whole instance would be as
I can now just take the camera and

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.000
point it straight into the sun.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.287
Of course the complete opposite
of this dark image here,

00:01:50.287 --> 00:01:52.625
everything is just completely bright.

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:54.442
So you notice now that, you know,

00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:57.767
there are lots of different types
of lighting conditions, and

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:01.292
the light actually plays a role in
what kinds of images we capture.

00:02:01.292 --> 00:02:04.488
And we've discussed this when
we talked about illumination.

00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:07.620
But now let's try to understand and
quantify some of this, so we

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.520
can understand, what are the different
ranges of light intensity that's

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.420
actually in the natural environment
that we're trying to capture?
