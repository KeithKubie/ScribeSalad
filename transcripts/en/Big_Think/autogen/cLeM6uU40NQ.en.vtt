00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.540
So women entrepreneurs currently are getting
about 2.5 percent of all venture capital.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.300
It’s not the only source of funding, but
it’s a really great indicator on how we

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.650
fare in the space.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.869
And that’s a fairly commonly understood
statistic.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.630
But the statistic that I like to feature—which
is the one that nobody ever talks about—is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.140
what percentage of funding is actually going
to Women of color, and that’s a much more

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.310
dismal number.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.350
That’s actually—depending on what city
you look at it’s between 0.1 percent or

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.110
0.2 percent, which is to say that women of
color and companies founded by women of color

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.850
aren’t really even statistically relevant
as well.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.360
The fact that women of color and companies
founded by women of color don’t really even

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.270
play in the space is particularly jarring
if you think about the fact that most companies

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.880
in this country are actually founded by women
of color.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.320
So it’s bad that we’re not getting funding,
but it’s particularly bad given that we

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.670
seem to be the source of innovation and probably
the most entrepreneurial community of all.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.940
So venture capital is I often call it like
the house flipping version of investments,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.940
right.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.932
Like house flipping shows, it has become the
most popular and the most visible and the

00:01:18.932 --> 00:01:24.050
most sort of prolific version of investing
that’s out there, or even of capital sources.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.500
But there’s way more to the world of investing
and securing capital than just venture capital,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.500
right?

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.140
There’s long view investments, there’s
debt, there’s crowdfunding.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.890
There are many different options when it comes
to getting funding, but the one that dominates

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.500
the headlines is venture capital.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.950
You get to be on the cover of things when
you’ve secured a big series A. You don’t

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.350
really get a whole lot of press when you secure
a line of credit or a loan; it’s just not

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.980
perceived as sexy.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.560
And yet companies need debt in order to be
successful.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.700
Companies that are women-led tend to be more
successful at getting crowdfunding dollars

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.380
than they are at getting venture capital dollars.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.560
So in these areas, funding that don’t get
a lot of publicity are actually really critical

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.780
because they are doing a better job of servicing
women who own businesses.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.650
And so the thing that I always tell founders
is that VC might be for you, it might not

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.650
be.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.040
But let’s not romanticize what it is and
how it works.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.459
Please do not take venture capital from any
investor, no matter what terms they’re giving

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.989
you, unless you’re willing to be fired from
your own company—which is what happens to

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.900
a lot of people who end up taking venture
capital.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.010
The bottom line for me is that there are many
different sources of capital.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.079
It’s not a one size fits all regime, and
we get fed one single product.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.409
And the reality is is a smart founder has
to look around to see what their other options

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.409
are.

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.400
And I would say that this is not just a “nice
to have,” this is a critical, critical thing.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.129
And part of the reason that I worry about
that, there’s a hack in my book that comes

00:02:55.129 --> 00:03:00.760
from an amazing investor called Don Rayvon,
and he talks in the book about how he knows

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.260
“how this movie is going to end,” which
is this idea that we don’t have enough women

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.279
and people of color getting debt, for example.

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.840
And what I’m worried about, and what he’s
worried about, is that in ten years we’re

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.691
going to look back at the statistics and we’re
going to see that we had too many women and

00:03:15.691 --> 00:03:22.239
people of color accepting—blindly—horrible
terms and horrible venture capital packages.

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.989
And in ten years when we look back what’s
that going to produce?

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.309
It’s going to produce a whole series and
maybe even a whole generation of entrepreneurs

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:32.389
that were disproportionately more likely to
fail.

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.620
And I worry that in ten years when we look
back at a statistic like that, people aren’t

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.730
going to blame an unbalanced capital stack.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.819
They’re not going to blame the fact that
people should have taken debt and they didn’t.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.629
They’re going to look at stats that simply
say that women and people of color fail at

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.719
a greater rate than anyone else.

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.319
And I want that not to be the end of our movie.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.829
Some of my favorite alternatives in terms
of getting funding are things like loans,

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.129
are things like lines of credit.

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.919
But there are some that are even less [negatively]
impactful to your business.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:08.709
They’re a little more work, but the country
is now speckled—all the country, I can’t

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.019
think of a state that doesn’t have competitions,
that doesn’t have pitch events where you

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.120
can go spend a little bit of time and energy
and get money for your company—especially

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.370
in those early days—because you tell a good
story, because you have a great idea and especially

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.849
money that doesn’t actually have to require
that you give away equity in your company.

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.560
Another one of my favorite sources of funding
is crowdfunding.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.190
And there are a couple of different kinds,
right?

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.780
There’s crowdfunding where you give people
T-shirts or you presell whatever product you’re

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.920
trying to manufacture.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.919
In that case you’re not giving up any equity.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.030
You’re giving people good will, you’re
giving people product, you’re giving people

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.950
a sneak preview into what you’re working
on, and in exchange you’re getting meaningful

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.950
capital.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.860
Women tend to be disproportionately more successful
at crowdfunding campaigns.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.150
There are different studies that say why that
might be, and I suspect that it’s because

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.110
their social networks are strong, and I also
suspect it’s because we’re shut out of

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.080
other forms of capital.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.870
But there’s also equity crowdfunding where
you are actually giving a piece of your company

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.699
away much like you’re doing with venture
capital.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.830
But in the equity crowdfunding space the terms
tend to be better, so you’re not giving

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.979
away as much and you’re not giving away
nearly as much control.
