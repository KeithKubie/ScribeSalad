I think of trust and hope as being

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240
I think of trust and hope as being
 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.980
I think of trust and hope as being
really quite closely related and

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990
really quite closely related and
 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.169
really quite closely related and
oftentimes we trust we trust without

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179
oftentimes we trust we trust without
 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.400
oftentimes we trust we trust without
really having to worry too much about

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410
really having to worry too much about
 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.390
really having to worry too much about
whether the person we're trusting is

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400
whether the person we're trusting is
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.580
whether the person we're trusting is
able to do what we're trusting them with

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590
able to do what we're trusting them with
 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.340
able to do what we're trusting them with
maybe they're very reliable type and you

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
maybe they're very reliable type and you
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.500
maybe they're very reliable type and you
know we've trusted them in the past with

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
know we've trusted them in the past with
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.630
know we've trusted them in the past with
this sort of thing and we don't really

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
this sort of thing and we don't really
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.790
this sort of thing and we don't really
we're not too worried about their

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
we're not too worried about their
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.410
we're not too worried about their
capacity for living up to that trust but

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420
capacity for living up to that trust but
 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.560
capacity for living up to that trust but
very often we're having to trust under

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
very often we're having to trust under
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270
very often we're having to trust under
conditions where a little more uncertain

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
conditions where a little more uncertain
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.899
conditions where a little more uncertain
or where we think there's some sort of

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909
or where we think there's some sort of
 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:49.399
or where we think there's some sort of
as it were almost moral obligations

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409
as it were almost moral obligations
 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.410
as it were almost moral obligations
certainly it can be a sort of parental

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
certainly it can be a sort of parental
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.889
certainly it can be a sort of parental
obligation to trust for example our

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
obligation to trust for example our
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.979
obligation to trust for example our
children when we think maybe they're not

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
children when we think maybe they're not
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.950
children when we think maybe they're not
fully reliable yet and they may well

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
fully reliable yet and they may well
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.899
fully reliable yet and they may well
disappoint us but it's certainly

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909
disappoint us but it's certainly
 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.359
disappoint us but it's certainly
important part of being you know raising

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
important part of being you know raising
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.120
important part of being you know raising
those children to understand that they

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
those children to understand that they
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.240
those children to understand that they
are going to be asked to do things they

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
are going to be asked to do things they
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.190
are going to be asked to do things they
are going to be relied on various ways

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200
are going to be relied on various ways
 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.499
are going to be relied on various ways
it's a it's a way of allowing them to

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509
it's a it's a way of allowing them to
 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.719
it's a it's a way of allowing them to
develop those capacities to be

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
develop those capacities to be
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.179
develop those capacities to be
responsive to trust which is a very

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
responsive to trust which is a very
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.920
responsive to trust which is a very
important feature of human social life

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930
important feature of human social life
 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.670
important feature of human social life
and there I think we do need to energize

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
and there I think we do need to energize
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.330
and there I think we do need to energize
our trust with our own capacity to hope

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340
our trust with our own capacity to hope
 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.999
our trust with our own capacity to hope
where that means something very

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
where that means something very
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.450
where that means something very
particular for me that is to say when we

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
particular for me that is to say when we
 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.849
particular for me that is to say when we
hope for things we are always facing the

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859
hope for things we are always facing the
 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.359
hope for things we are always facing the
fact that we could be disappointed and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
fact that we could be disappointed and
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.120
fact that we could be disappointed and
we're facing that disappointment sort of

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
we're facing that disappointment sort of
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.830
we're facing that disappointment sort of
in a clear-eyed way that is if we're

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
in a clear-eyed way that is if we're
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.380
in a clear-eyed way that is if we're
hoping well and we're saying you know I

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
hoping well and we're saying you know I
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.289
hoping well and we're saying you know I
understand what the stakes are here but

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299
understand what the stakes are here but
 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.029
understand what the stakes are here but
I think this is an important thing to do

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039
I think this is an important thing to do
 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.029
I think this is an important thing to do
and it's important to regulate my own

00:01:59.029 --> 00:01:59.039
and it's important to regulate my own
 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.340
and it's important to regulate my own
anxiety about this so I use my hope to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
anxiety about this so I use my hope to
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.819
anxiety about this so I use my hope to
put certain worries offline as a word to

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829
put certain worries offline as a word to
 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.399
put certain worries offline as a word to
just not focus on them to focus instead

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:10.409
just not focus on them to focus instead
 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.620
just not focus on them to focus instead
on what could be

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630
on what could be
 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.420
on what could be
under the right sort of conditions and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430
under the right sort of conditions and
 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.520
under the right sort of conditions and
giving whatever support is necessary to

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530
giving whatever support is necessary to
 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.460
giving whatever support is necessary to
make that come about but of course I

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470
make that come about but of course I
 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.980
make that come about but of course I
have to as a hope or realize that I

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990
have to as a hope or realize that I
 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.790
have to as a hope or realize that I
could be disappointed and also therefore

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800
could be disappointed and also therefore
 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.680
could be disappointed and also therefore
that I have the kind of capacity to

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690
that I have the kind of capacity to
 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.600
that I have the kind of capacity to
recover from disappointment that's a

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610
recover from disappointment that's a
 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.470
recover from disappointment that's a
very important part of hoping well

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480
very important part of hoping well
 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.460
