00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.070
Before I introduce the fundamental law,
I've got to define a few terms.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.200
Let's start with information ratio.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.940
So recall, the return on our portfolio
for a particular day is equal to

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.910
the market component of the return,
which is beta for that portfolio,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.290
times the return on the market for
that day, plus this residual return.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.150
Another way to look at that is to say
that this component of the return

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.360
is due to the market, and this component
is due to the skill of the fund manager.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.920
Remember, alpha is about skill.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.990
Now, we want to focus
on the skill component.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.510
In other words, what is the fund
manager bringing to the table?

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.060
And we can calculate the Sharpe ratio,
essentially, of this component,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.840
just like we can calculate the Sharpe
ratio of an entire portfolio.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.960
But we can focus on this skill
component, and essentially the Sharpe

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.340
ratio of this skill component
is the information ratio.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.970
It works like this.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.510
So the information ratio is
the mean of all of the alpha

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.160
components divided by the standard
deviation of the alpha components.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.820
So this is our reward component.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.840
That's our risk component.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.220
And by the way, this is calculated
by looking back historically

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.220
at the daily values of alpha.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.800
And we take the mean and the standard
deviation of them over time.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.540
You can find these by finding beta for

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.730
the portfolio, calculating what
the market return component was for

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.550
each day, and then the difference
is this residual or skill.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.290
So that's how you can
compute historically

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.450
the value of this information ratio.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.600
Now by the way, this information ration
applies in many different cases,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.140
not just in this fundamental law case.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.790
People use information
ratio as a measure

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.830
of manager performance all the time.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.400
It's fair to say that information
ratio is essentially a Sharpe ratio

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.580
of excess return,
this part that's due to skill.
