00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.539
So let's discuss the solution for our speedup

00:00:02.539 --> 00:00:06.255
averaging quiz. We only have the speedups for the

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:09.995
two applications, and we have said previously that

00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:14.260
an arithmetic average of speedups does not make sense.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.127
You should not use arithmetic averaging for speedups,

00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:20.115
because they are ratios of execution times. So the

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:21.882
only thing that does make sense to use

00:00:21.882 --> 00:00:24.760
in speedups, in this case, is a geometric mean.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.030
Thus, the speedup we need is a 2 times 8, and then there are two values,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.110
so we take the second root of that. And we get a number 4. So the correct

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:40.470
answer here is the speedup is 4. Again, doing something like 2 plus 8 over 2 is

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.894
not correct here, because these are ratios. You

00:00:43.894 --> 00:00:47.590
should not use the normal arithmetic mean for that.
