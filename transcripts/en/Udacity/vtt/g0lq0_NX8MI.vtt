00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.590
Sometimes we'll need to perform some extra steps to isolate the square before

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.080
taking the square root, like in this equation. We have something next to our

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.955
square. We want to get this square quantity alone, so that way we can take the

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:16.529
square root of both sides of our equation. So what do you think we'll need to

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.796
do here? When you think you have the solutions for x ,enter them here using

00:00:19.796 --> 00:00:24.450
your plus or minus sign. And don't forget to simplify your root if you can.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.890
Good luck.
