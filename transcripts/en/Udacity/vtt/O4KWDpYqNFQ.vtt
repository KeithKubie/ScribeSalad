00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's my solution: I break up this data to its components.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Then I hold if the pending score is greater than or equal to the x,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
or if I've already won

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
if my current score plus the pending score is already greater than or equal to the goal.

00:00:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Otherwise, I return roll as my move.
