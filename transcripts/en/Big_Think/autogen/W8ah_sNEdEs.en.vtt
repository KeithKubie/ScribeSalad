i would say that we're still on the

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709
i would say that we're still on the
 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.590
i would say that we're still on the
learning curve on every piece of that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600
 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.240
we're probably one of the greatest

that we sort of we knew at the front end
 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.800
that we sort of we knew at the front end
that we didn't have the answers and we

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810
that we didn't have the answers and we
 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.560
that we didn't have the answers and we
set out to find them and have been just

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570
set out to find them and have been just
 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.720
set out to find them and have been just
so open and responsive and really

this and continue to be so our program

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240
this and continue to be so our program
 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.900
this and continue to be so our program
has evolved just completely dramatically

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910
has evolved just completely dramatically

feedback from experienced teachers and
 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.920
feedback from experienced teachers and
educators and such and and the same is

true at every on every dimension of what

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810
true at every on every dimension of what
 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.260

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360
just learn many lessons along the way
 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.320
just learn many lessons along the way
and and so I think that embracing you

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330
and and so I think that embracing you
 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.840
and and so I think that embracing you
know the process of constant learning

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850
know the process of constant learning
 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.850
know the process of constant learning
and continuous improvement is honestly

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860
and continuous improvement is honestly
 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.680
and continuous improvement is honestly
probably part of the core of our success
