00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
The Greyglers is a group of approximately

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.089
200 Googlers, a little less than that, most
of us of a certain age.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.160
And this is our first big public event.
So thanks very much for coming.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.990
Just wanted to give you a really fast overview
of our primary goals.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:34.149
They are to raise awareness of age diversity
at Google and in our user base, to help attract

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:42.420
experienced talent to Google, and to help
make Google culture and Google products and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.789
services welcome to people of all ages.
Anyone who can relate to our mission is welcome

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.100
to join.
You don't have to have gray hair, or even

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.699
gray roots, like some of us.
[ Laughter ]

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:05.210
&gt;&gt;&gt; And today we're running a one-time special.
There's a goto address on the screen if you'd

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.620
like to join.
It's goto/join-Greyglers.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.590
The first 50 people who join will get one
of these way-cool tee shirts.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.520
So don't forget to do that.
So we are honored that Vint is a Greygler,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.640
and he's also our executive advisor.
Speaking of the main attraction, Vint will

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.080
be taking questions via Dory at the end of
his talk.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.250
So if you have questions, please be sure to
go and submit them.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:49.119
The address is up on the screen.
It's goto/Vinttalk -- one word -- hyphen questions.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.649
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi.
As a Greygler, I can remember what things

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.149
were like -- as a Greygler, I can remember
what things were like before the Internet

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.939
existed.
Everybody had a lot of free time on their

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.290
hands.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.679
&gt;&gt;&gt; And no one had any information at their
fingertips.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.540
But Vint Cerf has done a lot to make that
change.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.069
With Bob Kahn, he invented the TCP/IP protocols
and the basic architecture that allow computers

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:25.510
all over the world to link together and communicate.
And he spent most of his career providing

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.510
leadership to develop the technology into
the Internet that we all know and love today.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.151
Because of his contributions, he is frequently
called one of the fathers of the Internet.

00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:45.090
And he has received quite a few awards of
recognition from lofty organizations.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.510
He received the Turing Award from the ACM.
He received the National Medal of Technology

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.340
from President Clinton.
And, in a show of bipartisanship, he received

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.069
the Medal of Freedom from President George
Bush.

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.720
He's also --
[ Laughter ]

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.470
&gt;&gt;&gt; He's also been designated one of the most
intriguing people of the year 1994 by "People

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.810
Magazine."
[ Laughter ]

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:27.060
&gt;&gt;&gt; So his talents span a broad spectrum.
He's been an advisor of many boards and organizations.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.849
He's received many, many awards, at least
two of which include the word "legend" in

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.470
their title.
And he serves Google as our chief Internet

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.200
evangelist.
So today he's going to share with us some

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.629
of his insights into how the whole Internet
evolved and how we could have done it better

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:59.070
if we had only had known these things in advance.
So with no further ado, here's Vint.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.930
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: You know, I always get nervous

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.420
when people clap before you say anything.
It makes me want to just sit down, because

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.319
it won't get any better than that.
[ Laughter ]

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.690
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: I -- really, I'm stunned at this
overwhelming turnout.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.389
I do recognize, however, that theorem 208
might apply.

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.110
It says, if you feed them, they will come.
I know there's food out there.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.350
So that's part of it.
The other thing I'm very conscious of.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:38.210
You probably have no idea how daunting it
is for me to confront a bunch of really smart

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.660
Googlers.
I don't know how many of you know about the

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.560
talking dog, some guy finds a dog that can
talk and he takes it around to various places.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.050
And everybody's all excited about the fact
that this dog can talk.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.930
It doesn't matter what the dog says.
It's just the fact that he can talk is amazing.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.030
I feel like the talking dinosaur.
I've been around since the Jurassic Period.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.860
I hope I have something of interest to say.
Two things.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.560
First of all, if you get bored, I won't be
offended if you leave.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.900
And probably some of your folks around here
will appreciate it if somebody went away because

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.270
of the density.
And then second, when we get into Q&amp;A, I really

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.990
invite people to raise issues, to challenge
things I might have said.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.720
The fact that you're around for a long time
does not necessarily give you vision.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.470
In fact, in some respects, if you've been
around for a long time, you can't necessarily

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.009
either predict the future or see what's coming.
There is -- I forget who said this, but he

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:43.990
said, you know, if an old and distinguished
scientist tells you you can do that, the chances

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.539
are pretty good that you can.
But if that same individual says you can't

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:52.330
do that, there's a good chance he's wrong.
So I may be wrong about some of the things

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.070
I'm going to say.
And I invite some interaction about that.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.060
Let me start out by just reminding you that
the thing that you're working with started

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.891
out in a predecessor program called ARPANET
with four nodes, just four computers and four

00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:12.140
routers or, actually, packet switches.
I used to be at UCLA as a graduate student.

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:18.280
And had the responsibility for writing the
software to connect a Sigma 7 computer to

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.349
the first router that was installed at UCLA
in September of 1969.

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.930
The Sigma is in a museum somewhere.
And some people think I should be there along

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.190
with it.
[ Laughter. ]

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.660
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: If you fast forward a few years,
you see an Internet that looks like this.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.030
This was generated automatically by looking
at the global routing tables and assigning

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.449
a different color to each autonomous system
and showing something about the connectivity.

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:48.259
This is Bill Cheswick, formerly of AT&amp;T Labs,
generated this.

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.770
And I'm sure if we looked at the 2010 version,
it would be very much like this, maybe bigger

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.669
and more colorful, but still very complex.
One of the things that it's important, I think,

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:03.520
for you to take away from this picture is
that it does represent a very large number

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.889
of autonomous systems, each one of them operated
independently.

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.300
This system is not centrally controlled.
It is something that is collaborative.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.950
It's something that people voluntarily interconnect
in order to gain benefit.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.960
And so even if we argue about whether Metcalfe's
Law should be N squared or N log N, the reason

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.310
this works -- yes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; (inaudible) this is based on --

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.870
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: No.
The colors, the colors represent different

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.470
autonomous systems.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The colors maybe.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.199
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: And, of course, the connectivity
is clearly I.P.

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:39.050
But that's an A.S. -- each color is a different
A.S.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.639
Okay.
Are we square on that?

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.240
See, it's okay to interact.
[ Laughter ]

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.000
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: Somebody throw the -- all right.
[ Laughter ]

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.330
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: All right.
So that's -- the point here is that it is

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:59.240
voluntarily a collaboration of global proportions.
This doesn't happen unless a lot of people

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.110
want it to happen.
So an important other takeaway is even though

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:08.290
Bob Kahn and I did do the original design
work, this wouldn't have happened if, literally,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:13.629
millions of people didn't decide they wanted
it to happen.

00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:17.680
Here's just kind of a picture of how quickly
the number of machines on the network has

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.620
grown over time.
It started out in -- with the four nodes that

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.150
I mentioned on the ARPANET.
When the network was first -- Internet was

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:33.800
first released, it was January of 1983, there
were 400 computers on the network in January

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.890
of '83.
And it was a hard problem to get everybody

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.130
to switch over from the older NCP protocols
to the TCP/IP protocols.

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.350
And I don't want to waste your time telling
you how we did that.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.160
But it was coercive.
It was not cooperative.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.649
It was one of those I'm turning your funding
off if you don't switch over to TCP/IP.

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:53.770
Fortunately, I was at DARPA at the time and
could actually say that.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.470
Today you can't do that.
That's harder.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:02.930
The number of machines on the net now that
are publicly visible is approaching 750 million.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.180
The number of machines on the Net, in fact,
is much larger than that.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.660
We're an example, because there are lots of
machines behind firewalls that people can't

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.740
see through the public DNS.
The number of users now is estimated by Internet

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.230
world stats at 1.8 billion.
Again, that's an estimate.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:24.010
The other thing which has been going on that
we are all very much participant in is the

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.210
mobiles that have shown up in the telecom
environment.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:32.771
Extremely rapid innovation and penetration.
A lot of those mobiles are Internet-enabled.

00:09:32.771 --> 00:09:37.260
And, of course, we care a lot about that because
we've offered Android as an operating system,

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.360
and we are wanting very much to offer and
let others offer applications that take advantage

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.040
of mobile access to the network.
If we look at where the Internet is right

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.650
now, or where the users are, it's actually
a fairly stunning revelation that North America

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.640
is only third on the list now.
It used to be at the top, because this is

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.810
where the first penetration occurred.
We're still the highest percentage penetrated.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:04.270
But as you can see, Asia represents the largest
single grouping.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:12.010
And of the 764 million people on the Net in
Asia, about half of them are in mainland China.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:16.410
So the largest grouping of users on the Internet
today is in China.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:20.380
Now, we all recognize that there have been
interactions between Google and China and

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:25.520
there's policy questions.
But it is an inescapable fact that the largest

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.160
population of users on the Net today is in
China.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.660
And that will continue to grow, because their
percentage penetration, Asian penetration,

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.210
is only 20%.
So you understand when it gets to 75 or 76%,

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:41.680
the number will be dramatically bigger.
We care a lot about these kinds of statistics

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.320
because it tells us where our products and
services have to go, where they have to serve,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.280
what kinds of users, cultures, languages,
scripts, and everything else we have to be

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.170
prepared to deal with.
These are just another way of displaying the

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.850
same kind of information.
So I'll kind of skip through all of that.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:01.690
You'll notice at the bottom here that the
average penetration around the world is slightly

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.530
over 26%.
As the chief Internet evangelist at Google,

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.290
I have the feeling I have three-quarters of
the world to convert still.

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:12.620
There's a lot of work to be done to get Internet
in place.

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:18.900
Mobiles are actually helping a lot in some
respects, because their economics is so attractive.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:24.930
When Bob Kahn started this -- I want to emphasize,
it was Bob Kahn that started the project.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.360
He was at the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:33.710
I was still at Stanford.
And he had some simple ideas about what he

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.820
wanted to accomplish in the interconnection
of networks.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:43.020
Each network would have to stand on its own.
There wouldn't be any changes permitted to

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.910
the networks that were part of the original
Internet in order to make them part of the

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.680
Internet.
Which led to the need for gateways in between.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.350
Because the networks had no way of referring
to any other nets.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:56.560
Their addressing structure thought they were
the only network in the world.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.360
Later on, we'll see a similar situation coming
up with clouds.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.010
This is all best efforts communication.
And in a sense, that was really important.

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.240
We made no guarantees at all.
If you could get a packet from point A to

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:11.760
point B with some probability greater than
zero, that's all we were asking of the underlying

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.140
system.
There would be these black boxes, which we

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.940
called gateways at the time, because we didn't
know they were supposed to be called routers,

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:27.230
and we assumed they would be able to send
objects, packets, through each of the networks

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:32.620
that interconnected and that the Internet
packets would be encapsulated inside those

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:36.080
packets of each individual network.
That turned out to be a very important tactic,

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.970
because it allowed arbitrarily large numbers
of different kinds of packet networks to be

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:45.580
part of the system, because we were simply
encapsulating and decapsulating the Internet

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.520
packets that went end to end.
And, finally, there's no global control at

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.310
the operational level.
That was important from the military point

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:58.100
of view, because we didn't want a central
place that could be attacked and the network

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.750
disabled.
So there's global addressing was needed, because

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.000
the networks didn't have a way of referring
to other nets.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.630
Gateways were forwarding packets.
There were algorithms to recover from lost

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.730
packets.
We didn't assume everything was reliable.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:14.560
And some of the initial networks that were
involved were actually quite unreliable.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:20.040
Packet radio was a mobile system.
Ethernet was not necessarily a reliable transmission

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.210
scheme.
We provided pipelining so that there could

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:28.080
be a stream of packets flowing from end to
end, which is where those of you doing TCP

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.790
stuff know about Windows, about how many packets
can be outstanding before you have to stop

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.710
and wait.
There were some end-to-end check zones.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:40.470
We assumed things would be reassembled.
We knew we needed host flow control, although

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:45.620
we'll see that we didn't do as good a job
then as we could probably do now.

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:48.830
And then interfacing to a variety of operating
systems and other things.

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:53.280
There were some other secondary concerns like
efficiency, performance, and, by the way,

00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:00.050
security, although, in fact, we didn't focus
very heavily at all on security, and we might

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:03.460
look back on that and regret it.
But I have to say that if we had tried to

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:09.010
focus heavily on security in these early days,
we might never have even gotten anything built

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:12.520
that we could test.
We honestly did not know whether this system

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:17.040
would actually work.
One of the nice things about the Net is that

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:22.591
we didn't make any assumptions about applications.
And, you know, the old expression, if you

00:14:22.591 --> 00:14:27.110
don't know where you're going, any road will
take you there, if you don't know what application

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:31.820
you're running, any packet will take you there.
And in a very funny way, the Internet has

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.920
survived and thrived because of the fact that
it wasn't designed to do any particular thing.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.280
A lot of the historical networks, like the
telephone, telegraph net, the television broadcast

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.470
networks, the cable networks, were purpose-designed.
And that purpose design limited what they

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.320
could do.
The Internet didn't have that limitation.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:57.580
And as the capacity of the Net has grown,
as the economics of electronics has dropped,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:02.110
it's been possible to make the packet-switched
net do a lot more than it did when we were

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:10.090
working, you know, with 50 kilobit backbones.
I mean, the word 50 kilobit and backbone in

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.950
the same sentence sounds, excuse me?
That's a dialup modem today.

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.870
The other thing that's interesting is, the
Internet layer, the Internet packets, have

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:21.700
no idea what they're carrying.
They don't know how they're being carried.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:27.800
They don't care if it goes over a satellite
link, an optical fiber, or submarine cable.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.290
Only the edge devices that can interpret the
contents of the packets understand what it

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:38.740
means.
There is no national indicator in the I.P.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.560
address space.
That was a deliberate decision on my part.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.040
Remember, I'm doing this at the Defense Department
or for the Defense Department.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:51.480
I wanted not to have any binding of the networks
to any particular geographical location.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.820
Now, we all understand that the domain name
system has a very specific potential binding,

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.220
because we have, you know, country codes,
like .DE, .FR.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:06.710
And a lot of us have worked hard to make it
possible to associate locale with I.P. addresses

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:13.740
because we're interested in geographic -- applications
that have some knowledge of geographic location.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.040
But when the design was done, I didn't want
to have any such binding, because I didn't

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.050
want any national authority to interfere with
the military's ability to deploy a network

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:25.320
wherever it needed to go.
I didn't want some third party to say, "I'm

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:31.810
sorry, you can't have address space because
we think you're an aggressor or an enemy."

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:37.350
So I didn't want that to be a problem.
And, finally, our performance targets, again,

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:41.220
were best efforts.
Now, there are some changes going on in the

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.810
Net.
And we're involved in some of them very intimately.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:47.010
IPv6 is one.
And I'll show you a chart that motivates why

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:51.740
we need to have a different I.P. address space
than the IPv4.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:55.180
Some of the people in this room -- I saw Lorenzo
here.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.010
I don't know if Eric is here.
But you have some -- a group of people here

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:04.220
at Google that have single-handedly pushed
us to implement IPv6.

00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:09.179
The reason that's so important is that the
IPv4 address space only has 32 bits.

00:17:09.179 --> 00:17:16.170
It's 4.3 billion terminations.
I made the decision in 1977 that the address

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:20.860
space could be 32 bits and it would be enough.
I thought we were doing an experiment.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.800
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: I thought, you know, that we

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.280
didn't know if this thing was going to work,
and surely 4.3 billion terminations is enough

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.080
for an experiment.
I mean, even the Defense Department probably

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.370
couldn't use that many termination points.
So I thought what would happen is if we demonstrated

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:40.030
this capability, then we would in fact do
a production engineering job of it.

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:44.220
Well, the experiment never ended.
Here it is 2010, we're running out of address

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.530
space, we need larger address space.
We actually argued 32 bits, 128 bits, and

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:52.100
variable length.
The variable-length guys lost, because the

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.750
programmers said it's going to chew up a bunch
of computer cycles to find the fields and

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:59.260
the packets, and so they didn't want to do
that, so that was out the door.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:04.200
And finally, because nobody could make up
their minds and I'm sitting there in the Defense

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.650
Department trying to get this program to move
ahead, we haven't built anything, I said,

00:18:08.650 --> 00:18:09.690
it's 32 bits.
That's it.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.690
Let's go do something.
Here we are.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:12.760
My fault.
[ Laughter ]

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:19.130
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: On the other hand, you know,
if I had stood up and said we need 128 bits

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.971
of address space because this is going to
be the world's backbone in 25 or 30 years,

00:18:22.971 --> 00:18:27.800
they'd look at me and say, "Boy, are you out
of --" internationalized domain names.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.661
Remember I showed you all the distribution
of users in the Internet?

00:18:31.661 --> 00:18:36.940
There are more users who don't use Latin character
sets than there are people who use Latin character

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.732
sets.
So internationalized domain names are a way

00:18:38.732 --> 00:18:41.880
of writing domain names in scripts other than
Latin characters.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:48.700
So Cyrillic and Chinese and Hebrew and Arabic
and so on are all scripts that are now available

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:52.190
for IDNs.
And they're being introduced now by the Internet

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.460
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
The domain name system, as I'm sure you are

00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.010
all very well aware, has got a bunch of vulnerabilities
in it.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:05.960
One aspect of that is that it's possible to
poison the cache of a DNS resolver.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.970
It's possible to, in fact, invade the name
servers.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:14.280
And so getting digital signatures that you
can use to confirm the binding of a domain

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.940
name and address is actually an important
and useful step.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:19.610
It doesn't solve all problems.
But it's an important one.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.790
That's starting to happen now.
The root zone will be, in fact, signed sometime

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:27.340
during the summer this year.
And then, finally, the routing system has

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:32.570
the awkward problem that it's possible to
lie about what you're connected to.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:37.550
And if you want to avoid having -- introducing
lies into the routing tables, one way to do

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:42.990
that is to have tables that show which entities,
which autonomous systems are allowed to announce

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:46.530
what connectivity they have.
If it turns out that you received a routing

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:51.620
update which isn't confirmed by a digitally
signed entry in a table that should be publicly

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:55.620
available, you might discard that particular
update and maybe even raise a red flag and

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.780
say somebody is trying to spoof the system
into directing traffic where it doesn't belong.

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.360
There are sensored networks that are coming
up and being connected to the net.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.670
I'm give you an example.
The smart grid is an activity that we are

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.910
very much involved with because we have a
power meter program.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.060
I'm personally involved in this in a variety
of ways because the smart grid interoperability

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:21.620
panel has a governing board and I'm on that,
and the whole point here is to try to find

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:27.180
ways of letting electricity-consuming devices
be more cooperative in the event you're reaching

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.200
a peak load.
One of the ways is to go through the Internet.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:38.000
So they will be, increasingly, on the network.
And, finally, mobiles, as you all know.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.490
We have a bunch of problems -- I'm not going
to catalogue all the problems.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.690
I'm not going to talk you through all of them.
Because you know most of them.

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.080
The thing I want to emphasize here is that
as soon as you turn a system like this over

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.560
to the general public, you have to deal with
the general public.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:55.881
You have to deal with the motivations of the
general public.

00:20:55.881 --> 00:21:01.470
And not everyone in the general public necessarily
has everyone else's best interests in mind.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:09.680
And so one of the facts of life is that the
network began with a fairly homogeneous, uniform

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:15.400
collection of academic types, research types,
engineer types, who more or less shared a

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.940
common view of what it was they were trying
to accomplish, and they more or less trusted

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:24.670
each other to do the right thing.
We are now faced with the consequences of

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.390
commercialization.
And spread of the Net to the general public.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:33.540
Now, I was a big proponent in 1988 of commercializing
the Internet.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.260
And I know my colleagues, many of them, anyway,
thought I was crazy.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.600
Why would you let the general public, you
know, this great unwashed, into our wonderful,

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.830
you know, sandbox?
And the honest answer to that is that I didn't

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:48.740
think it would ever be available to the general
public if we didn't build a commercial engine

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:52.960
underneath it to support it.
And so I was very much in favor of trying

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:59.620
to find commercial businesses models that
would allow the Internet to grow, because

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.260
the general public and industry wanted to
be on it.

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.240
So, indeed, that's what happened.
I'm not trying to claim any credit.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:12.700
Just for having been much -- an advocate of
that particular thing happening.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:18.180
So the point I also want to make here is that
in spite of all the vulnerabilities and everything

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:24.750
else -- and these are not just technical vulnerabilities
 -- you know, bad passwords, social engineering,

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:29.210
and things of that sort -- some of the worst
things that happen to the Internet are mistakes

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:32.670
that we make.
You know, half the Net falls off the Net,

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:37.580
or YouTube disappears because somebody in
Pakistan creates a black hole that everyone

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.570
routes to, not just the routers that are in
Pakistan.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.060
It's amazing how we can screw things up without
even trying.

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:48.590
And so one of the big problems with design
of systems like this is how to make them more

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:53.420
resilient and more conscious of errors in
configuration.

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.400
This is probably one of the hardest problems
that I can think of.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.460
It's figuring out that a configuration is
wrong.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.200
It's easy if some part of that configuration
has a parameter value which is outside of

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.410
a valid range.
That's the easy case.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:12.600
The hard case is some ensemble of configuration
parameters that turn out to add up to bad

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:15.650
things.
Figuring out that that's the case, at least

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:21.130
in my experience, is very, very difficult.
So that's a problem worthy of serious thought

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:26.190
and consideration.
There are other serious security weaknesses

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:30.170
in the system.
We have operating systems that are much too

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:37.110
willing to be invaded, in effect, to allow
their resources to be attacked or coerced.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:42.731
Browsers which are very naive about software
that they download or that -- the Web pages

00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:46.331
they download and then interpret.
That's why we released Chrome, because we

00:23:46.331 --> 00:23:52.840
think we did a better job of building sandboxes
for the interpretation of downloaded Web pages.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:58.450
But we are still far from having what I consider
to be a completely secure environment.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:03.501
We never will.
But we can probably improve beyond where we

00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:06.050
are now.
We don't have very good access control practices.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:10.290
I talked about improper configurations.
A lot of the botnets that cause trouble, that

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:14.270
generate spam, do denial of service attacks
and everything else are a direct consequence

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:22.420
of laptops and PCs and increasingly now mobiles
that have been coerced and invaded and become

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:28.900
tools of the botnet herders.
So even trying to detect and go after botnets

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:34.890
is -- is going after the symptom.
The real issue is that we allow these resources

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:39.880
to be coerced by people who don't own them
and have no business using the cycles.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:44.950
And, of course, there are all kinds of parties,
including organized crime and state-sponsored

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:50.580
agencies, that want to exploit these vulnerabilities
in the network for their own advantage.

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:54.070
There are lots of privacy problems.
And, again, they cover the gamut.

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:59.570
And I want to get -- because it's already
20 minutes into this thing, I want to get

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:05.070
beyond the list of problems and get to the
things that we really need to do.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:11.190
I do want to mention cloud collaboration.
That is to say, interactions between clouds.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:15.309
This is important to us because we are committed
to data liberation.

00:25:15.309 --> 00:25:18.120
We're committed to letting people get data
out of the cloud.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:23.010
The question is, how do they get it out?
First of all, where do they put it?

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:26.630
And second, if they want to move it to another
cloud, how do they do that?

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:32.360
And without going into terribly long diatribe
here, I believe that cloud interaction in

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:37.820
2010 is about where we were with networking
in 1973.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.860
We had networks.
They were proprietary.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.380
You could make all the IBM machines interact
with each other, the Digital machines interact

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:50.180
with each other using DECnet.
But we did not have much interaction between

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:55.150
networks of different manufacturers.
Internet was intended as a nonproprietary

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.070
solution to that problem.
Today we have proprietary clouds.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.930
In fact, most of the clouds have no idea that
other clouds exist.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:08.790
The best they can see is another cloud possibly
because it looks like a Web server somewhere.

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:12.830
But clouds have properties.
And the different clouds that are built have

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:16.740
different properties.
Some of you just go back into history for

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.470
a moment, will remember a protocol called
TELNET.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:25.420
TELNET had a very interesting property.
It had a thing called a network virtual terminal.

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:29.470
This was a thing that never existed.
The problem was that the computers at the

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:34.680
time had a whole variety of different terminals,
and they all had different encoding schemes

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.980
and different conventions for what new line
is and so on.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.800
So the guys doing the ARPANET said why don't
we invent a thing which doesn't really exist

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:47.420
but we'll call it a network virtual terminal.
It has a set of properties.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:51.940
We will map our terminals on a given host
into that network virtual terminal behavior.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:57.120
And what we would like to do is to say, for
everyone who's out on the Net, as long as

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.380
you can handle the network virtual terminal,
then you can interact with any terminal on

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.860
 -- any host in the ARPANET.
Maybe we need a network virtual cloud.

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.500
We need something that all clouds can pretend
to be.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:15.850
It won't exercise every functional capability
of every cloud, but it might exercise sufficient

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.059
commonality that we can move data back and
forth.

00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:23.890
Maybe we're capable of actually getting processes
to run in two clouds that are interacting

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:29.290
with each other concurrently.
What about data that's in a cloud and it's

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.660
access-controlled and we want to move it to
another cloud?

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:36.690
What metadata do we have to move to the other
cloud and how will it be interpreted and will

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:41.410
that access control continue to be observed?
These are all questions that don't yet have

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:45.880
answers or maybe, in some cases, too many
different answers, because we have so many

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:53.559
different options, you know, SOAP and UDDP
and all -- UDDI and so on from the Web world,

00:27:53.559 --> 00:27:59.630
and a variety of other options.
So we don't have any agreed standards on letting

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:03.000
clouds interact with each other.
So I think there's a rich area for research

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.420
and development there.
So here are the kinds of problems that we

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.511
did not solve and have not solved adequately
in the Net.

00:28:10.511 --> 00:28:15.610
One of security at all levels in the architecture.
There's no one place in the Net where you

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:20.610
can guarantee all the security you need.
We don't actually have a very good understanding

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:27.610
of the statistical nature of the network.
In fact, it's very hard, I think, to characterize

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:33.540
the Internet or even pieces of it in a statistical
way, because unlike the telephone system,

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:36.900
the dynamic range of demand on the Net is
extremely broad.

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.000
You could be clicking a mouse for a little
while, sending almost no data at all, and

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.420
the next thing you know, it's a 150-megabit
file transfer.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:48.130
Unlike the telephone system, where no matter
how much you talk, you can only consume 64

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:51.429
kilobits per second on average, not counting
compression.

00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:57.450
So erelong formulas for the Net that will
help you design pieces are hard to come by.

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.980
There are lots of debates about whether there
should be quality of service mechanisms in

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:04.120
the network.
Right now all we have is best efforts.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.530
And there are valid arguments that sometimes
you want more than best efforts.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:13.080
The problem is, you can't rely on everybody
wanting to or being capable of offering more

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.320
than that.
So the question is, how do you build that

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:20.790
in so that multiple networks can somehow participate
in anything other than best effort?

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.580
I mentioned Internationalized Domain Names.
Distributed algorithms.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:30.360
I don't think that we have done a very, very
good job in the R &amp; D community of developing

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.590
distributed algorithms.
There are some.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:37.100
The routing algorithms are an example.
Their stability is sometimes in question.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:41.200
We do a lot of distributed computation, but
it's more like parallel stuff; right?

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:47.520
When we do a search, it's, you know, one engine
is running the search algorithm.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:55.179
We don't have a lot of stuff going on in parallel
except for the fact that we can do our searches

00:29:55.179 --> 00:30:00.100
by splitting the data up into a large number
of different places and letting everybody

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:05.000
run in parallel.
There aren't very many examples of distributed

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.250
algorithms that work well.
Some of ours are wonderful.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:13.740
Presence, which showed up originally in chat
kinds of things, could be quite rich in its

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.400
character.
It's not just whether you're online or not

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.700
online, but where are you online or what are
you doing online.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.850
These are all kinds of variations in Presence
that we can exploit.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:30.309
We've done a rotten job of dealing with mobility.
If there's anything that I think we really

00:30:30.309 --> 00:30:38.600
messed up, it's that.
The problem that happened is that the example

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:43.490
of mobile in the original Internet design
was the packet radio network.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:47.180
This was a mobile network that was operating
here in the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:53.010
We had some radio store and forward repeaters
up in the mountaintops and we had mobile devices

00:30:53.010 --> 00:31:01.290
down on the Bayshore freeway or driving around
Palo Alto and Mountain View and so on.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:09.110
The network itself took care of dealing with
the mobility of the devices below the Internet

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:12.400
Protocol layer.
It's not too different from what happens with

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:17.250
mobiles today, because what happens in a mobile
today is that the binding of the telephone

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.561
number happens below the level of the phone
number.

00:31:20.561 --> 00:31:25.570
The consequence of that is that I thought,
wrongly, that we had dealt with the mobile

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.210
problem.
I didn't take into account that a device,

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:33.900
a host on the network, might actually move
physically from one place to another.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.810
Because at the time, they were big computer
centers that didn't get up and move around.

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:42.340
Well, now they're in your pocket or maybe
they're even a chip that you've got inserted

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:50.360
in your arm or it's in the dog.
So the problem here is that I failed to recognize

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:55.290
that we might actually have nodes whose I.P.
addresses had to change depending on where

00:31:55.290 --> 00:32:00.160
they were accessing the network.
If we had -- I'll give you an example of possible

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:04.990
kinds of solutions.
Multihoming, we did a terrible job of multihoming.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:10.040
Because every port on the computer had a different
I.P. address.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:15.250
It wasn't as if we had an address of the device
and then, you know, spokes pointing out.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:19.429
Every one of them had a different I.P. address.
That means that if you are getting service

00:32:19.429 --> 00:32:23.890
from two different ISPs, it's not exactly
clear that you can set up a TCP/IP connection

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:30.290
with packets flowing along both of those in
order to assemble them together as one stream.

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:34.990
Broadcast is another rant.
We did a terrible job of dealing with broadcast

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.380
media.
In fact, we turned broadcast media into point-to-point

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.650
links.
Think about 802.11, for example.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:47.020
So I would love to see some serious effort
put into, for example, a satellite system

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:52.150
that could rain I.P. packets down on 100 million
receivers at the same time.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:56.450
For information that everybody wants, that
has a large number of interested recipients,

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:00.080
broadcast is really good stuff.
And we don't do that.

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.400
We're busy, you know, with these point-to-point
TCP connections.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.950
We do that with YouTube, we do that with a
lot of other applications.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.140
And I imagine if we were trying to pump out
a large number of software updates, it would

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.820
be really nice if everybody would say, okay,
at 8:00, we're all going to listen for the

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:20.860
next update of the -- of that software, and
then I only have to transmit it once.

00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.840
Okay.
Some people would have to say, hey, I missed

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.490
a couple of packets.
Please send them to me on a unicast basis.

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:30.880
But the bulk of the delivery could be done
very, very efficiently.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:37.270
So I want to keep going here.
Another huge issue is identity, authentication,

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.760
and authorization.
Those are all three different things.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:45.880
We don't do a very good job of authenticating
the components of the network.

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:49.360
We don't know whether a router over there
is really one that we should be talking to

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:53.820
or not.
There isn't any built-in, inherent ability

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.450
in the Net to authenticate various sources
and syncs.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:03.309
And if I were doing this over again, I would
have wanted to put in tools for strong authentication.

00:34:03.309 --> 00:34:08.290
This doesn't mean that I believe that anonymity
is a bad thing or that it should be banned

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.530
or anything like that.
I think anonymity is important.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:16.570
But there are times when you really need to
know what it is that you're interacting with

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:20.889
at various layers in the protocol.
So if we're having a simple little chat, I

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:25.210
may not care exactly who you are.
But if you say, "I want to borrow $50,000,"

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:30.040
I care a lot more about who you are and whether
you can pay me back and how do I find you

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.300
again.
So authenticity and identification turn out

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.080
to be really important.
And I would submit to you that for Google's

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:44.909
own range of applications, that investing
in good-quality identity and authentication

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:49.139
is really important, because that's the only
way we will convince people that it's okay

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:53.860
to use the cloud, that we have a strong way
of identifying the users, and that we have

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:58.350
a good way of preventing people from getting
access to information that they shouldn't

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:02.100
have access to.
So we need these kinds of technologies to

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:07.620
convince our users that it's safe to use the
cloud and that we know how to protect their

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.230
information from others.
Well, okay.

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:15.000
So multicore processors.
This is another little headache.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.740
Moore's Law is broken.
The clock speed is not going up at the rate

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.109
that it used to.
Now our problem is how do I use a larger number

00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:28.690
of cores running at a fixed clock speed.
I think a lot of algorithms don't know how

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:33.210
to take advantage of that.
So this is another rich place for us to evolve

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:37.380
our applications.
I'll come back to delay and disruption tolerance.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:41.980
Let me just say that in the mobile world,
one of the big problems is that you don't

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:45.619
have guaranteed solid connectivity or reliable
connectivity.

00:35:45.619 --> 00:35:48.710
Frequently, it's interrupted.
Frequently, there's packet loss.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:52.430
And most of the algorithms in the Internet
are not as good as they could be and should

00:35:52.430 --> 00:36:01.200
be in order to overcome those problems.
Governance is a nontechnical problem space.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:07.740
Now, if you and I think that technical decisions
are hard, imagine what it takes to make political

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:12.600
decisions associated with who's in charge
of what.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:17.310
These don't necessarily have quantitative
metrics.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:27.090
And so you wind up having to argue, coerce,
cajole, you know, demand and all these other

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:32.480
things in order to come to some kind of agreements.
Sometimes they're international in character.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.850
Sometimes they're national in scope.
Sometimes they might be corporate.

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:40.320
But governance questions are policy-related
questions, and they're very, very hard to

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.070
deal with.
There's a bunch of them here.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:48.090
I won't go into any further detail there.
Finally, mobile operation again.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:54.580
What I would love to see, frankly, is some
ability to let a device move around from one

00:36:54.580 --> 00:37:01.140
termination point to another in I.P. terms
and still maintain its connectivity to the

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:05.869
higher-level protocols.
There are some applications or protocols for

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:09.340
that purpose that are being looked at in the
Internet Engineering Task Force.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:15.859
This was a mistake that I made, a really bad
one, that I didn't recognize at the time.

00:37:15.859 --> 00:37:24.100
When we split I.P. from TCP, I thought it
was very clever to use the I.P. address as

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:30.770
part of the end-point connection identifier.
So TCP was bound very, very strongly to IP.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:34.180
And I was patting myself on the back, thinking,
"Look, I saved all these bits.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:38.930
I didn't have to have another set of identifiers
at the TCP or UDP layer."

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:42.119
And I thought, boy, I was really smart, it
was very efficient, blah, blah, blah.

00:37:42.119 --> 00:37:47.780
Turns out to have been a bad mistake.
It screwed up multihoming, it screwed up mobility

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:53.040
where I.P. addresses were changing.
Now, this leads to a different kind of a problem.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.800
Think about it for a moment, that you're moving
around and getting different I.P. addresses.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:03.091
And so at some point, you have an end-point
identifier distinct from the I.P. address,

00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:06.820
and you've established, let's say, a TCP connection
using those end-point identifiers.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:12.200
Now you move to a different I.P. location,
and you say to the other guy, hi, it's me

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:15.380
again.
I'm just at a different I.P. address.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:20.730
Well, that looks like a hijack, doesn't it?
So the real question is, how do you reauthenticate

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:24.900
so the guy on the other end says, well, I
know you said it's you, but, you know, can

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:29.550
you take this encrypted challenge and send
it back to me properly encrypted in my public

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:35.340
key, blah, blah, blah.
You need to have mechanisms that reestablish

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:39.370
authentic trust between the two parties if
you're going to allow this kind of dynamics

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:44.460
to happen.
We don't do a very good job of routing in

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.770
general.
But more importantly, in the mobile world,

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:53.320
if topologies are changing, getting an routing
algorithm that works, when the topology keeps

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:59.250
changing -- it's not just a question of it's
a fixed topology and links are up and down;

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:03.581
this is a topology which is varying -- that
gets to be a really hard problem.

00:39:03.581 --> 00:39:08.340
And it hasn't been well solved in my view.
We don't even have the idea of persistent

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:10.670
connections.
I can open up a connection and things are

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:15.850
running, and I lose connectivity.
And when I come back again, I would like to

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:20.210
reestablish the session that I had.
We don't have a session layer in the formal

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:25.970
sense in the Internet architecture.
And that, too, might be a useful development.

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:29.400
And then, finally, in the mobile world, there
is a great deal of interest in being able

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.780
to self-organize.
You throw a bunch of nodes down and they're

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.560
wandering around and they discover each other.
This is all wonderful until you start worrying

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.130
about the possibility that one of them isn't
supposed to be there because it's the bad

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:44.030
guy.
And if you have a self-organizing network,

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:47.020
the bad guy might look like a good guy because
you didn't know the difference.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.740
So he's part of your environment and all of
a sudden you have a problem.

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:53.900
So figuring out who are the good guys and
the bad guys in a self-organizing network

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:58.609
are -- that's a particularly interesting problem.
In the military world, this is called the

00:39:58.609 --> 00:40:01.450
overrun problem.
I have a whole bunch of nodes, they were all

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.359
okay.
Then the bad guys overran the good guys and

00:40:04.359 --> 00:40:09.090
the bad guys got ahold of their devices and
said, hi, we're still good guys.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:13.570
And, of course, they're not, but they're taking
advantage of your assets to defeat you.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:19.119
So figuring out how to make that all work
in a way that is reliable and trustworthy

00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:23.280
is tricky.
Performance.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.221
Well, the original Internet design was best
efforts.

00:40:26.221 --> 00:40:30.160
And here I'm going to invoke Greg Chesson.
He is back there.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:32.640
Wave your hand.
You doesn't have any hair, either.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:37.770
You don't have your tee shirt on, though.
So Greg --

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:42.900
&gt;&gt;&gt; That's the -- Greglers.
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: You get two points for that.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:48.910
Very good.
So Greg is, like a lot of our senior management,

00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:53.780
intensely concerned with performance, particularly
inside the data centers.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:41:00.950
And so what I want to observe to you is that
for a long time, performance on the Internet

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:06.910
was not as -- was not viewed as critical as
just getting it to work at all.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:10.440
And so now we're at the point where this thing
has been around for a long time and every

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.810
one of us and our customers and users are
relying on this thing working reliably and

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:19.470
quickly.
One of the things I want to emphasize to you

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:25.080
is that I am not an I.P. bigot.
I'm not a TCP bigot.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.450
Just because I happen to have been involved
in designing and building that stuff does

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:34.619
not mean that it is the place to stop.
It means it might be the end of the beginning.

00:41:34.619 --> 00:41:38.510
But the important thing is here that none
of you should be afraid to say, maybe we should

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:42.490
do something different.
That's not irreligious.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:45.051
Or heretical.
I know I'm the Internet evangelist.

00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:50.310
But, you know, I feel like the Pope and the
heretic.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.660
Right?
The real answer here is that you should not

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:57.869
be afraid to think differently, to branch
out into new areas, to think about things

00:41:57.869 --> 00:42:05.470
that may not even be compatible.
When people think about what might come next,

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:09.920
they think, oh, how in the hell are we ever
going to deploy this in the existing Internet?

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.640
And I would remind you that before the Internet,
there was this big network called the telephone

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.720
network.
And you could have said, how in the heck would

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.670
you ever deploy the Internet?
We already have a global network.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.540
It's called the telephone net.
You'd never be able to do this.

00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:28.900
Well, it did take a few decades.
But it happened.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:33.609
And there's no reason why it couldn't happen
again with good ideas that work better.

00:42:33.609 --> 00:42:39.691
So I want to somehow, if I can empower you
to not be afraid to think differently.

00:42:39.691 --> 00:42:44.359
And Greg I know already is fully capable of
doing that, because he's got ideas inside

00:42:44.359 --> 00:42:51.170
our data center that work better than the
conventional TCP mechanisms.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:54.400
We have -- this is not an entirely internal
meeting.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.970
We have some folks from outside.
So we're not going to go into any details

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:02.200
about that, unless Greg chooses to.
But the point I want to make is that this

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.099
guy is fearless.
He's looking at, you know, 80 gigabits a second

00:43:06.099 --> 00:43:10.820
worth of traffic going in two different directions
to figure out what the heck is going on inside

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:16.210
the TCP.
And he's done a brilliant job of making this

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:20.170
work a lot better.
Now, there is another area of real interest

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:23.210
here.
Addresses in the Internet are bound mostly

00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:27.780
to edge devices.
And Bob Kahn and I have had this long-standing

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:33.930
debate about what should have an address.
Why should we stop at the box?

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.270
Could we talk about the things that are inside
the box?

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:39.700
What about logical addresses of objects that
are inside the box?

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.780
Should the routing tables be able to route
not to a box, but to something inside that

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.590
might move around?
Well, I don't have an answer to you.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:52.369
But I can tell you that thinking about addressing
other than just termination at a box may turn

00:43:52.369 --> 00:43:56.990
out to be a very rich way of dealing with
some of the cloud issues that we face, because

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:01.440
the data in the cloud is what has to move
around.

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:07.250
So this means, by the way, that the domain
name system may not necessarily be the sole

00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.820
means of binding an identifier to an I.P.
address.

00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:14.619
And this is another example of don't be afraid
to think differently.

00:44:14.619 --> 00:44:20.430
So instead of using DNS, it may very well
be that some other label which has a different

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:27.590
meaning than the DNS might be useful and might
be worthwhile implementing in addition to

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:32.450
or even instead of the DNS.
So the DNS isn't necessarily fixed in the

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:37.430
universe of Internet architecture.
I'm going to skip over policy considerations

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:43.230
in the interest of time here.
I do want to bring up a couple of other major

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:48.960
problems, though, for us at Google.
Intellectual property treatment is troublesome,

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:55.680
because the history has been rooted in hard
copy of things.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:45:04.390
In fact, if you read the copyright law, it
talks about the fixing of a work in a physical

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:09.940
manifestation.
So it's a CD, or it's a tape, or it's a hard

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:15.220
drive, or it's a memory stick, or a book,
or a magazine.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:20.540
And when we start dealing with digital information,
we have to cope with the fact that, A, it's

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:27.670
easy to replicate, and, B, it's easy to distribute.
And the notion of controlling copies as the

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:35.080
means of recovering value from intellectual
property collides with this ease of distribution

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.570
and copying.
In fact, if you think about the way the Web

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:42.810
works in particular, what does a router do?
The first thing it does is go out and copy

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:47.150
whatever the home page is on the Web site.
It's a giant copying engine.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:51.800
No wonder the people who think of intellectual
property protection as controlling copies

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:58.150
are a little unnerved by this, you know, global
spread of this giant copying machine.

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:06.730
It's, you know, sort of Xerox written large.
So the problem here is that the current rules

00:46:06.730 --> 00:46:13.300
are rooted in the wrong kind of concepts.
And we really need to rethink how people can

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:20.380
recover value from intellectual property in
addition to or instead of simply controlling

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.330
copies.
Now, I don't have a magic answer for you here.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:28.000
I mean, the usual easy one is, well, just
encrypt everything and then sell people the

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.070
keys.
Yeah, that's all fine, unless somebody buys

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:34.270
one key and puts it up on the Net.
And then everybody has a copy to it, and so

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:38.170
much for that.
I would point out, however, even in that scenario,

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:43.820
that somebody who puts the key up is -- morally,
 -- has morally created a copyright violation

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:49.020
of the same order of magnitude as making copies
of music CDs or making copies of books and

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.840
distributing them.
The problem, of course, might be finding that

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:58.410
person in order to somehow inhibit that sort
of behavior.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:02.060
The semantic Web is something that Tim Berners-Lee
I know has been working on very hard.

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:09.240
In fact, it came up in the CIO meetings that
we hosted here yesterday.

00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:15.220
This problem is that there is a lot of unstructured
information on the Web right now.

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:20.010
But there's also a lot of structured information,
except that we can't see it, because it isn't

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.680
expressed in a form that the crawler can detect
it.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.680
So when we have a lot of structured data,
it's kind of like dark matter in the universe.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.280
We know it's there but we can't quite detect
it.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:36.140
So there's dark information in the Internet.
And finding a way to make it more visible

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:41.980
so that our crawlers can find it and our users
can discover it is a nontrivial exercise.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:47.400
We have to find ways of labeling content that's
consistent across a large number of different

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.080
bins full of information.
This is a hard thing.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:56.130
It's the data dictionary collision problem
for people who speak databases.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:48:04.369
The other two things on this slide have to
do with my recurring nightmare that our digital

00:48:04.369 --> 00:48:10.910
history will be lost in not very many years.
So let me give you the long-term example.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:14.430
It's the year 3000.
And you've just done a Google search.

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:21.099
And you find a 1997 PowerPoint file.
That's even -- let's pretend you're using

00:48:21.099 --> 00:48:23.970
Windows 3000, just for the sake of argument.
[ Laughter ]

00:48:23.970 --> 00:48:28.380
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: The question is, does Windows
3000 know how to interpret a 1,000-year-old

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.760
PowerPoint file.
And the chances are pretty good that it can't.

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:37.710
The question is even if we were using open
source software, it isn't necessarily clear

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:41.870
that the versions of the open source software
that we might be dealing with in the year

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:46.090
3000 know how to interpret files that are
1,000 years old.

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:50.480
The reason I'm so exercised about this is
not the thousand-year problem.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.960
It's the next year or the third or fourth
or fifth-year problem.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:49:00.710
I'm already seeing image formats that are
noninterprettable by current-day software.

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:04.040
I see this happen a lot between the Macs and
the PCs.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:08.050
I do a presentation on a Mac and then show
it on a PC, and a big thing comes up saying

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:13.170
"We don't know how to interpret this thing."
So it's a big blank in the slide.

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:19.250
So I am worried that our descendents 100 years
from now or maybe even our kids 20 years from

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:23.990
now won't actually have any idea what the
beginning of the 21st century was like, because

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:29.800
none of the digital objects that we have created
and stored away are interpretable.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.880
So the question is how to solve that problem.
This is hard, because it's not just a question

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.910
of hanging on to the application software.
If somebody says, "I'm not going to support

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:45.930
that software anymore," and it runs on that
version of an operating system, is there any

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:50.660
way that we can hang on to not only the application,
but the operating system it ran on and maybe

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:54.500
the emulation of the hardware that the operating
system ran on that ran the application that

00:49:54.500 --> 00:50:03.410
knew how to interpret the complex bits?
The question is, what rules reasonably apply

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:09.880
to, let's say, not coerce, but encourage people
to make sure that objects that were created

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:15.880
in earlier forms are still interpretable?
And this gets all mixed up in motivations,

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:22.320
in business ethics, in business practices,
and in intellectual property management.

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:26.080
So if we don't do something about this in
a conscious way, we will end up with a lot

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.770
of rotten bits that won't be interpretable.
And that can't be the right outcome.

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:37.770
I am particularly personally embarrassed about
this because when I work with librarians and,

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:42.190
you know, we walk in with our fancy CDs and
DVDs and everything else, they say, "How will

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:44.990
these last?"
I'm not sure I actually have a good answer

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:49.270
to that.
And then they kind of walk out with a 1,000-year-old

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:55.970
vellum manuscript which is magnificently illuminated
and if you happen to read Greek or Latin,

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:00.670
you can still read it.
And they hold this up and say, talk to me

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:05.240
again about these digital formats and how
long you think they're going to last?

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:10.119
I want to shrink down and walk out the door.
This is serious.

00:51:10.119 --> 00:51:14.950
And it's serious for us at Google.
Because we are offering to people to put their

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:20.490
stuff in our clouds.
And we're offering to allow them to get it

00:51:20.490 --> 00:51:23.859
back.
And the question is, when they get it back,

00:51:23.859 --> 00:51:28.050
in what form will it be delivered to them?
And will they be able to interpret it?

00:51:28.050 --> 00:51:29.730
Okay.
I'm going to do just a couple more slides

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:34.200
and then I want to do some Q&amp;A.
This picture many of you have already seen.

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:39.359
It's my way of saying, there's some weird
stuff on the Internet that I didn't expect

00:51:39.359 --> 00:51:42.230
to be there, you know, like picture frames
and refrigerators.

00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:46.230
It was the farthest thing from my mind.
The Internet-enabled surfboard is my favorite

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:49.869
one.
Some guy in The Netherlands -- I haven't met

00:51:49.869 --> 00:51:54.230
him -- I just have this picture, he's sitting
on the water, waiting for the next wave, thing,

00:51:54.230 --> 00:52:00.570
if I had a laptop on my surfboard, I could
be surfing the Internet while I'm waiting.

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:07.750
He put a Wi-Fi service in the rescue shack
and he surfs the Net while waiting for the

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.490
next wave.
If you're interested in that, that's the product

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:14.200
for you.
I mentioned earlier that there are sensored

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.770
networks showing up on the Net.
Some of them are being driven by smart grid

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:25.160
ideas, some are driven by being more thoughtful
about dealing with efficient use of energy.

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.400
I have a sensored network at home.
And I'm proud to say it's a commercial thing.

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:34.820
It's not me with a soldering gun.
It's from Arch Rock.

00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:39.901
It's running IPv6.
It's sampling temperature, humidity, and light

00:52:39.901 --> 00:52:42.221
levels in all the rooms of the house every
five minutes.

00:52:42.221 --> 00:52:45.460
And there is a server that's accumulating
that stuff.

00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:47.671
Now, one of the rooms in the house is the
wine cellar.

00:52:47.671 --> 00:52:52.730
And it's very important that the wine not
get up above 60 degrees Fahrenheit and the

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:59.369
humidity not drop below about 50%.
That particular room is alarmed so that if

00:52:59.369 --> 00:53:03.890
the temperature is -- exceeds 60 degrees,
I get an SMS on my mobile.

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:11.330
And it happened when I went to the -- a laboratory
 -- Argon National Laboratory.

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:15.140
Just as I was walking in the door for a three-day
visit, my mobile goes off.

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:20.640
It's the wine cellar calling.
"You've just breached the 60 Fahrenheit barrier."

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:25.020
So every five minutes, I kept getting reminded
my wine was warming up.

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:30.190
Unfortunately, my wife was away on some trip,
so she couldn't go and reset the cooler.

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:34.750
So I called the guys at Arch Rock, and I said,
"Do you make actuators so I could do some

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:37.599
remote actuation?"
They said, "Yes, that's a little project for

00:53:37.599 --> 00:53:41.830
the weekend."
I did think, though, that I could infer some

00:53:41.830 --> 00:53:44.140
things about what was going on when I wasn't
at home.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.970
For example, if somebody goes into the wine
cellar and turns on the lights, I might be

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:50.310
able to detect that.
Of course, I don't know what they did in there.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:54.740
So the next step is to put RFID chips on all
the bottles.

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.990
[ Laughter. ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: That way, I can do a rapid inventory

00:53:56.990 --> 00:54:01.520
to see if any bottles have left the wine cellar
without my permission.

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:04.630
Somebody did debug this for me, though.
He pointed out, you could go into the wine

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:06.859
cellar and drink the wine and leave the bottle.
[ Laughter. ]

00:54:06.859 --> 00:54:12.900
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: Clearly, I have some work to
do to debug the architecture.

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:17.119
So we're going to have sensored networks everyone.
The data is going to be flowing to us.

00:54:17.119 --> 00:54:22.390
That's simply going to be another part of
our Internet universe, huge amounts of information

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:27.310
either flowing to consumption places or devices
just talking back and forth to each other.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:29.630
Okay.
So last thing I want to do is quickly mention

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:33.080
the Interplanetary Internet.
I know many of you have heard me talk about

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.440
this.
I'm very excited about it.

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.119
It's not a Google project.
We're not planning to take over the solar

00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:41.320
system as part of our business model, at least
not as far as I've been told.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:46.230
But I am interested in the problem of being
able to give richer communication for manned

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:51.090
and robotic space exploration.
Some of this is driven by our visits to Mars

00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:57.400
with the Rovers and others -- since 1976,
actually, we've been sending equipment to

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:01.360
Mars.
And most of the communication with the spacecraft

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:05.550
have been with point-to-point links.
One of the things that my colleagues at the

00:55:05.550 --> 00:55:09.560
Jet Propulsion Lab and NASA have been wanting
is a richer networking environment so that

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:14.450
we can support much more complex missions
with many different devices, lots of different

00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:19.200
orbiters, things on the ground that are moving
around, sensored networks that are self-organizing.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:25.910
So this is just a view of Google Mars, which
is a beautiful piece of work.

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:33.360
What you might know is that when the Rovers
landed several years ago on Mars, the original

00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:38.930
plan was to transmit data direct to Earth.
And the radios overheated.

00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:43.820
And so they decided that they'd have to reduce
the duty cycle to keep the radios from damaging

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:47.021
themselves.
And that reduced the data return, which is

00:55:47.021 --> 00:55:53.079
already rather limited at 28 kilobits a second.
Now, remember, these things are 35 million

00:55:53.079 --> 00:55:57.890
to 235 million miles away.
At the speed of light, it takes three and

00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:02.260
a half minutes for a signal to go from Earth
to Mars when we're closest together and 20

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:05.710
minutes when we're farthest apart.
So my colleagues and I were thinking, okay,

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:08.220
why don't we use Internet protocols.
It works here.

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:10.480
It ought to work there.
And that's true.

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:16.710
But it doesn't work very well in between.
Imagine TCP with flow control with a 40-minute

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:19.619
round-trip time.
Then there's the other problem of celestial

00:56:19.619 --> 00:56:22.190
motion.
The planets are rotating, and we haven't figured

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:23.540
out how to stop that, either.
[ Laughter. ]

00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:27.830
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: The problem is, there's a thing
on the surface of Mars, and it rotates around,

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:29.609
and you can't talk to it until it comes back
around again.

00:56:29.609 --> 00:56:36.990
And the same thing happens with orbiters.
The Jet Propulsion Lab guy said, "We have

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:40.710
orbiters around Mars already.
They were used to map the surface of Mars

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:45.400
to decide where the Rover should land."
They reprogrammed the Rovers and the satellites

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:50.589
to do store-and-forward relay back to Earth
at 128 kilobits a second using a different

00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:52.950
radio.
So store-and-forward is the way all the data

00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:57.410
has been coming back from Mars.
When the Phoenix lander arrived, in May of

00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:01.369
2008, it was going to the North Pole.
It didn't have any director or path.

00:57:01.369 --> 00:57:05.730
So they deliberately did store-and-forward.
So my colleagues and I thought, well, why

00:57:05.730 --> 00:57:07.369
don't we just use TCP.
But it doesn't work.

00:57:07.369 --> 00:57:11.329
So we had to invent a whole new suite of protocols
that we call Delay and Disruption Tolerant

00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:15.740
Networking Protocols.
Those not only have been made to work at interplanetary

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:20.339
distances using the Epoxy spacecraft, which
is not on its way to rendezvous with a comet

00:57:20.339 --> 00:57:26.070
and will be using the new DTN protocols, but
it also has been applied to military tactical

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:29.470
communications.
The Defense Advance Research Agency that funded

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:34.400
the original interplanetary work and the original
Internet work has adapted these Delay and

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:39.570
Disruption Tolerant Protocols to Tactical
Com, which is a highly hostile environment.

00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:43.640
So what we're hoping, frankly, is that the
standards that we have been developing for

00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:47.730
interplanetary communication will be adopted
by all the countries around the world.

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:53.060
If they do, then everybody's spacecraft could
potentially interwork, which means when they

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:58.250
have completed their initial missions, they
might well be repurposed to be part of an

00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:01.369
interplanetary backbone.
Over the course of the next several decades,

00:58:01.369 --> 00:58:05.941
assuming the standardization is adopted, we
may actually see an interplanetary backbone

00:58:05.941 --> 00:58:09.230
emerge out of the space exploration that goes
on.

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:11.390
Okay.
So I really overshot my time.

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:15.250
But let me stop here and invite questions.
I know we've got some Dory things.

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:27.710
And in any event, thanks a whole bunch for
letting me take up an hour of your time.

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:34.180
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me read the first question on the

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:38.740
Dory.
We have a lot of our distributed offices VCed

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:41.940
in, including the West Coast, plus Boulder,
plus New York.

00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:47.619
So let's just get to one of those, at least.
Comcast recently had a court victory in their

00:58:47.619 --> 00:58:51.250
effort to own the Internet and control traffic
on it.

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:55.570
Murdoch has similar ambitions.
And I suspect that the military will make

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:59.520
a similar claim.
Can a free and open Internet be effectively

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:02.460
defended?
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: Wait a minute.

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:09.170
I was too busy stabbing myself in the gut
here.

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:11.859
Wow.
Okay.

00:59:11.859 --> 00:59:17.310
So I don't think that Comcast quite had the
victory that's characterized here.

00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:24.010
What they basically said was, when the FCC
told us that we should cease and desist interfering

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:29.640
with BitTorrent, that the FCC didn't have
a basis for making that demand.

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:34.080
Now, you need to have a little context.
A few years ago, Internet was considered a

00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:38.931
telecommunications service and it was regulated
in what's called Title II of the Telecom Act,

00:59:38.931 --> 00:59:46.750
as amended in 1996.
In its infinite wisdom, FCC, upon hearing

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:54.790
debates between the telcos and the cable companies
on the differences in their regulation, said,

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:58.560
"I hear you.
We realize that you are regulated differently,

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.810
but you're both offering Internet service.
We are going to move Internet service into

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:09.119
what's called Title I of the Telecom Act."
This is essentially applications.

01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:13.900
It's an information service.
And it was treated as a vertically integrated

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:21.240
service, so there was no notion of telecommunications.
There was no notion of common carriage anymore,

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:30.440
because it was treated as this unitary thing.
Well, within Title I, the court ruled that

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:36.900
the FCC did not have any authority deriving
from that title that would allow them to tell

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:41.300
Comcast to cease and desist.
Now, I want to defend Comcast just a little

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:46.099
bit here.
What they had -- what was happening to them

01:00:46.099 --> 01:00:50.040
is that they have an asymmetric network; right?
You can't push data into the cable system

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:53.340
as quickly as you can pull it out.
So they're faced with a problem with people

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:57.849
doing BitTorrent, because some people who
are running multiple TCP connections to do

01:00:57.849 --> 01:01:02.190
the BitTorrent application are consuming much
more bandwidth than everybody else.

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:06.540
So they're kind of freezing everybody out.
So Comcast is saying, well, we have to do

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:11.099
something to make it more fair for everyone
to get access to the limited resources that

01:01:11.099 --> 01:01:15.021
we can make available.
And their way of doing the network management

01:01:15.021 --> 01:01:18.200
was, let me say, not very ept.
They --

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.860
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: -- chose to do deep-packet inspections,

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:28.890
see which guys were doing the BitTorrent protocol
and then generate fake reset messages to both

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:33.579
people, leaving them both thinking the other
guy hung up.

01:01:33.579 --> 01:01:37.880
That was a particularly crude way of trying
to do network management.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:44.430
In subsequent conversations with them, I urged
them to consider an alternative, which was

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:49.829
to look at the bandwidth that was being consumed
by these parties in a, you know, nonprotocol-centric

01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:55.329
way and simply limit the amount of bandwidth
that anybody could get if the system had gone

01:01:55.329 --> 01:01:57.800
into congestion.
And that, as I understand it, is what they

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:03.609
have chosen to do.
So the court case basically says to the FCC

01:02:03.609 --> 01:02:10.260
that Title I may not be a very good way of
preserving fairness and choice for users.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.250
What do we want?
At Google, what we want is every user has

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:17.190
the ability to go anyplace on the Internet
and run any applications that he or she wants

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:21.762
to.
We understand that it's not right for a user

01:02:21.762 --> 01:02:25.069
to get more resource than they are paying
for.

01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:29.099
We understand that people have to do some
network management to deal with, you know,

01:02:29.099 --> 01:02:35.660
potential denial of service attacks, to deal
with fair allocation of the resources.

01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:44.640
But we don't want them to abuse their access
to and control over a broadband conduit that

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.100
gets the consumer into Internet services.
In particular, for example, if you're a cable

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:53.930
company that's offering television as a service
and you're being paid for that, and you're

01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:59.349
also offering Internet, broadband Internet
service, and you're being paid for that, we

01:02:59.349 --> 01:03:05.730
wouldn't want YouTube, for example, to be
somehow interfered with over the Internet

01:03:05.730 --> 01:03:10.020
part of the channel in order to favor the
other application that that company offers.

01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.660
Now, I'm not picking on Comcast or any other
cable company.

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:20.240
I'm just saying that we are looking for fair
and equitable access for users and for suppliers

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:26.839
of service on those underlying broadband facilities.
The likely outcome of this particular situation

01:03:26.839 --> 01:03:35.069
is that the FCC will choose to reclassify
Internet service as a Title II kind of service.

01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:39.840
Some of you who know anything about this could
conceivably levitate skyward, because there

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:45.510
are a huge number of things in Title II that
are all about telephony, all about universal

01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:49.069
service and taxation and tariffing and all
this stuff.

01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:57.990
The FCC has the ability to forbear from applying
some of the possible controls, remedies, and

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:02.300
regulations in Title II.
They always have the freedom not to do something.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:07.470
And so if anything does happen to reclassify
Internet as Title II, my hope and expectation

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:12.940
is that only a small number of the terms and
conditions of Title II would apply to the

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.550
Internet service.
One of the things I'm very attracted to is

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:19.200
common carriage.
Common carriage basically says you have to

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:24.430
apply the same rules to everybody, all customers
are served under the same terms and conditions.

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:28.130
There is no favoritism.
And I think that's important for our business.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.520
Okay.
Next Dory question.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.869
I don't know how to --
&gt;&gt;&gt; How about if we --

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:34.460
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: There we go.
Why don't I read it.

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:38.869
That way, I'll pay attention.
That's terrible, isn't it?

01:04:38.869 --> 01:04:42.470
How would the Internet be different if there
had been native support early on for user

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:46.010
identification and for content signing and
for encryption?

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:49.160
This turned out to be hard to be retrofit.
Yeah, it has been hard.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:56.099
I actually think it would have been very helpful
and powerful not only to have users able to

01:04:56.099 --> 01:05:01.150
authenticate themselves, but have devices
able to say, yes, I'm getting control from

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:06.839
somebody I recognize.
I will accept the exchange or demand for information.

01:05:06.839 --> 01:05:10.090
I wish that we had done that.
The problem is, the technology to do it wasn't

01:05:10.090 --> 01:05:17.790
available at the time that the Internet standards
were being finalized in 1978.

01:05:17.790 --> 01:05:23.290
Public key crypto was invented in 1977 by
Whit Diffie and Marty Hellman at Stanford.

01:05:23.290 --> 01:05:28.170
And I knew all about what they were doing.
But it was an idea at the time.

01:05:28.170 --> 01:05:33.710
It wasn't -- RSA hadn't been implemented yet.
So by the time those things matured, the Internet

01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:40.310
had raced on into, you know, such a deployment
that we couldn't force those things in.

01:05:40.310 --> 01:05:43.660
If we were doing it over again, I would have
wanted to have the advantage of that.

01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.319
Okay.
How long did the government want to keep TCP/IP

01:05:46.319 --> 01:05:49.079
a secret technology?
Zero milliseconds.

01:05:49.079 --> 01:05:52.599
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: Never.

01:05:52.599 --> 01:05:54.589
And I have to tell you, I'm really proud of
this.

01:05:54.589 --> 01:06:01.800
Bob and I, Bob Kahn and I, deliberately set
about to make TCP/IP visible to the public,

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:06.619
to anyone in the world.
We visibly wanted it to be unconstrained,

01:06:06.619 --> 01:06:10.510
fully accessible, fully documented from the
get-go.

01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:14.990
And the reason is very simple.
Our rationale was that if -- this was ever

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:20.349
going to be an international standard, if
it was ever going to be adopted by the proprietary

01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:24.000
community, there had to be zero barriers,
no excuses.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.080
You can't say, well, we couldn't get the documentation,
or, no, we didn't have access to a reference

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:33.109
implementation.
Our conclusion was, make this so available

01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:35.820
that there are no excuses for not adopting
it.

01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:39.470
And we didn't put any patent constraints on
it.

01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:43.240
We didn't do anything other than to make it
fully and widely available.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.950
And I think that openness served us well,
because, ultimately, it did get adopted as

01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:54.120
an international standard.
What's the one thing you wish you had been

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:59.790
 -- No -- oh, wish had been properly separated
into two or more things from the beginning.

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:03.980
Well, the one thing I did mention was this
separation of identifier at the end points

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:07.000
from the I.P. addresses.
I really wish I had done that.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.890
By the way, we can still do that.
There is absolutely nothing stopping us from

01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:17.220
implementing protocols that have that property.
And, in fact, one of the things that is interesting

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:19.800
about the Internet is that you can keep changing
it.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:25.420
You can keep adding new capabilities.
And I hope that we actually get there someday

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.400
so that we have this flexibility that we don't
have today.

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:32.839
How do I get this little thing to scroll down?
There we go.

01:07:32.839 --> 01:07:36.960
Okay.
What's -- Let's see.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:41.500
Something to think about at the end of the
discussion: If the Internet's original design

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:46.109
had been different in the ways we've discussed,
how would its evolution have been different?

01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:49.900
Boy, that's a DNA question, isn't it, as opposed
to a DNS question.

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:51.589
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: I know.

01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:58.340
Bad -- minus 2.
Well, I think probably, if we had done some

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:03.339
of the things I suggested, we would have had
strong authentication available to make the

01:08:03.339 --> 01:08:07.810
system a little more secure.
We would have had better mobility, multihoming,

01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:12.369
ability to use multiple routes to push data
across the Net faster, taking advantage of

01:08:12.369 --> 01:08:18.779
multiple paths at the same time.
I think we might have had a good shot at making

01:08:18.779 --> 01:08:24.859
the network more resistant to various forms
of attack, because we had put in authentication

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:30.139
in places where it could usefully be applied.
And, again, I want to remind you that it's

01:08:30.139 --> 01:08:33.449
not impossible to put some of those things
in again.

01:08:33.449 --> 01:08:37.849
There's an activity in the National Science
Foundation called FIND, Future Internet Design.

01:08:37.849 --> 01:08:46.089
And there are ideas that are being pursued
with support from NSF, some of which touch

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:51.079
on the ideas I've talked about.
Some are even more elaborate than that.

01:08:51.079 --> 01:08:56.069
And there's nothing stopping us from trying
some of those ideas out, either in the existing

01:08:56.069 --> 01:08:59.609
Internet or, in fact, in something which is
independent.

01:08:59.609 --> 01:09:06.050
So my sense right now is that we are not constrained
to live the history of the network.

01:09:06.050 --> 01:09:09.539
We have the freedom and flexibility to change
that if we want to.

01:09:09.539 --> 01:09:13.699
Let's see.
What choices would you have made if you'd

01:09:13.699 --> 01:09:19.829
known that the Internet would eventually be
used for commercial purposes?

01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:24.489
I don't think I would have made different
choices, to be honest with you, since I was

01:09:24.489 --> 01:09:30.049
a big proponent of trying to turn various
parts of the network into commercially useful

01:09:30.049 --> 01:09:33.579
things.
I was very happy to see Cisco and Proteon

01:09:33.579 --> 01:09:38.339
and others make commercial routers.
Because the way we made routers before that

01:09:38.339 --> 01:09:42.259
was to take a computer and a graduate student
and wrap the graduate student around the router.

01:09:42.259 --> 01:09:44.389
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: And we were running out of graduate

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:47.269
students.
So seeing commercially available routers was

01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:51.000
great.
And finally came Internet services that were

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.150
commercially available.
And that didn't happen until we broke a policy

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:59.650
logjam in 1988.
I asked permission from the federal government

01:09:59.650 --> 01:10:04.120
to allow me to connect the commercial MCI
mail system to the Internet in 1988.

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:09.639
Up until that time, 15 years of the Internet
program, nobody was allowed to put commercial

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:13.969
bits on the government-sponsored backbone.
So I was really happy when they said, yes,

01:10:13.969 --> 01:10:18.230
you can do that.
Within a year, we had gotten the MCI mail

01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:20.840
system connected.
All the other e-mail providers said, wait

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.159
a minute, those MCI guys shouldn't have that
privilege alone.

01:10:24.159 --> 01:10:28.500
So they jumped on, telemail, and Ontime, and
CompuServe, and so on.

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:34.139
An odd side effect, they hadn't been able
to talk to each other before, because they

01:10:34.139 --> 01:10:37.219
were closed e-mail systems, but they could
all talk to the Internet.

01:10:37.219 --> 01:10:39.880
In consequence, they could talk to another
through the Internet.

01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.840
That was a surprise for everybody.
Holy cow, I just got a message from some guy

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.289
on a different e-mail system.
How did that happen?

01:10:46.289 --> 01:10:52.480
The side effect of having allowed the commercial
use of the government-sponsored backbone is

01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:56.309
that commercial providers of service didn't
have to build their own backbone.

01:10:56.309 --> 01:11:00.920
So that meant they had a relatively low barrier
for offering commercial service that could

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:03.709
use the government-sponsored backbones for
a time.

01:11:03.709 --> 01:11:07.840
It didn't take very long.
That was 1989 when we saw the first commercial

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:13.999
Internet services come along.
By 1995, just a few years later, the National

01:11:13.999 --> 01:11:17.969
Science Foundation shut down the NSFNET because
it didn't need it anymore.

01:11:17.969 --> 01:11:22.719
It could buy, the universities could buy commercial
service more cheaply than they could get it

01:11:22.719 --> 01:11:24.940
from a specially operated network.
Sorry?

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:29.780
Yes.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I asked this question a few weeks ago

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:34.300
at TGIF, and I got completely shot down.
But --

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:40.189
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: Can you use the microphone?
You'll be on record, by the way, so you should

01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:44.159
be aware of that.
&gt;&gt;&gt; But basically, I was just wondering what

01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:51.099
your thoughts were on where the Internet will
be in the future maybe ten, 50 years down

01:11:51.099 --> 01:11:54.869
the road, and what our relationship with the
technology will be then.

01:11:54.869 --> 01:11:59.200
I won't hold you to it.
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: That's a nice, simply-asked question

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.699
with a really easy answer; right?
The short answer is, beats the hell out of

01:12:03.699 --> 01:12:07.090
me.
I wish I was eight years old so I could actually

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:10.300
wait around to see the answer.
Honestly, I think two things.

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:14.599
First of all, mobility, high bandwidth.
The network will disappear.

01:12:14.599 --> 01:12:17.659
You won't see it.
It will just be part of the environment in

01:12:17.659 --> 01:12:21.050
the same way that we don't think very much
about electrical power.

01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:23.739
We just plug into the wall and expect it to
be there.

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:26.459
We will expect networking to be part of the
environment.

01:12:26.459 --> 01:12:32.170
It will always be available.
All of the devices that we use will be networkable.

01:12:32.170 --> 01:12:38.050
And the thing that I think is the most exciting
possibility is the possibility that the network

01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:43.989
will be able to interface to our neural systems.
Now, before you think I've gone all Ray Kurzweil

01:12:43.989 --> 01:12:49.590
on you.
I'm not quite there.

01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:54.170
But I will -- I need to finish with this comment,
even though there are other questions, because

01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:58.830
it's already way over time.
But I love to tell the story, many of you

01:12:58.830 --> 01:13:04.280
have heard this before, but I'll tell it anyway.
My wife was born with normal hearing, but

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:07.630
she lost her hearing when she was three.
She had spinal meningitis.

01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:12.709
So she was deaf for 50 years.
Then she got a cochlear implant.

01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:17.689
Now, this is a device that interfaces to the
inner ear, the cochlea.

01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:22.260
It has electrodes that touch the auditory
nerve.

01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:28.610
The speech processor that she wears takes
in sound, does a Fourier transform to figure

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:35.209
out what frequencies are present, then generates
electrical impulses in the inner ear to fake

01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:38.920
the brain out into thinking that the inner
ear is working.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:45.090
Now, the implication of that is that we understand
enough about sensorineural processes to imitate

01:13:45.090 --> 01:13:50.320
them electronically.
Now, I had been thinking, why not program

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:54.659
 -- reprogram the speech processor so that
it can do TCP/IP?

01:13:54.659 --> 01:13:58.530
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: And now -- I'm not trying to

01:13:58.530 --> 01:14:02.949
get TCP/IP stuck in her brain.
We aren't there yet.

01:14:02.949 --> 01:14:09.189
But what I am interested in is the possibility
that she could ask a question, speak out loud,

01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:12.840
the microphones that normally are hearing
sound to help her hear could pick up what

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:16.300
she says.
We could digitize that, packetize that, send

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:20.499
it as voice-over-IP to a speech-understanding
processor.

01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:22.989
Guess what?
We make some of those; right?

01:14:22.989 --> 01:14:26.679
So she could ask a question.
The answer would come back through the Internet,

01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:31.119
go into the speech processor and go straight
up into her auditory nerve electronically

01:14:31.119 --> 01:14:34.179
and then, you know, the brain interprets that
as sound.

01:14:34.179 --> 01:14:39.230
So we could Internet-enable my wife.
That's pretty amazing.

01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:44.309
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vint Cerf: So there -- I think, honestly,

01:14:44.309 --> 01:14:52.699
that our ability to network ourselves in the
sensory sense is quite likely.

01:14:52.699 --> 01:14:56.249
Whether we ever get cognitive interaction
is a whole other story.

01:14:56.249 --> 01:14:59.769
And it's one which is at the moment still
science fiction.

01:14:59.769 --> 01:15:05.510
But sensory, neural and sensory motor possibilities
are very strong.

01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:09.550
And, finally, something that you all know
about, augmented reality.

01:15:09.550 --> 01:15:15.249
When we think about things like my wife's
cochlear implant, this is remediating a problem

01:15:15.249 --> 01:15:17.469
that she had.
Otherwise, she can't hear.

01:15:17.469 --> 01:15:23.329
But there's no reason why we can't extend
the range of people's ability to sense the

01:15:23.329 --> 01:15:25.739
environment.
Why can't we see x-rays?

01:15:25.739 --> 01:15:29.229
Why can't we hear at the frequencies that
dogs can?

01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:32.360
There's no reason why we can't augment our
abilities.

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:39.150
So I think if we're looking 30, 40, 50 years
into the future, we will see a lot of augmentation

01:15:39.150 --> 01:15:43.429
of our abilities, some of them sensory motor,
some sensory neural.

01:15:43.429 --> 01:15:47.719
Whether we ever get to the point where we
have cognitive interactions with computers,

01:15:47.719 --> 01:15:50.800
I don't know.
But I think it's very possible that we might

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:56.719
have conversations with computers that are
richer than the ones that we have today, which

01:15:56.719 --> 01:16:03.780
are mostly command and control.
I think if you saw the TED lecture where the

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:12.170
guy was wearing a projector and had a television
camera, he had a headset and a microphone,

01:16:12.170 --> 01:16:15.920
and instead of carrying a mobile around, he
carried a piece of paper.

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:21.280
That was his display screen.
And he projected stuff onto the paper, or

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.429
in one case he projected stuff on his hand.
It was the telephone dialing pad.

01:16:26.429 --> 01:16:30.739
And he dialed by just, you know, poking on
his hand.

01:16:30.739 --> 01:16:36.280
And, of course, what was going on is that
there was a video receiver that was watching

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:41.280
the gesture and interpreting it.
This is the first time I have thought about

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:47.939
and seen a computer-based system that was
participating in the same sensory environment

01:16:47.939 --> 01:16:50.940
that I am.
It's observing what I'm observing.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:56.619
It's seeing gestures and interpreting them.
So that kind of -- It was a really moving

01:16:56.619 --> 01:17:02.769
example of what happens when you let a computer
participate with you in the real world.

01:17:02.769 --> 01:17:08.070
If we see anything arrive out of that in 20
or 30 years' time, I bet it's going to be

01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:12.119
because we've got common, shared experiences
with our computers.

01:17:12.119 --> 01:17:13.869
Okay.
That's really all the time we've got.

01:17:13.869 --> 01:17:21.520
But thanks, again, for letting me be here
this afternoon.
