00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.812
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Considering the answer to the last quiz, that 2 and 3 are the numbers that

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:10.012
add to equal 5 and multiple to equal 6, and also reflecting on the factored form

00:00:10.012 --> 00:00:15.212
of this polynomial up here, the general one, what's a way we can write x squared

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:20.295
plus 5x plus 6 in this form? Think about what a and b each equal, and then try

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:23.269
to replicate that in these two parantheses.
