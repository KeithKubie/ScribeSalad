00:00:09.352 --> 00:00:11.935
(lively music)

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.120
- Welcome to another
episode of In the Arena.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.400
I'm Jonathan Stein.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.210
Our guest today is Andrea Headley.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.330
A UC Presidential Post
Doctoral Fellow for 2018,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.350
here, at the Goldman
School of Public Policy

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.210
and, an incoming professor
at the policy school

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.660
at the Ohio State University.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.180
Her research focuses on
criminal justice, and,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.520
specifically, their
relationship between police

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.060
and, the communities they serve.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.040
Andrea, welcome.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.873
- Thank you.

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:56.706
- Thank you for being here.

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:57.560
- Thanks for having me.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.270
- One of the themes of
In the Arena has been

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.860
that the scholars and the
researchers and the advocates

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.430
that we talk to, often, have
a, deeply, personal connection

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.470
with the work that they do,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.380
or, the research they're investigating.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.960
They have something inside of them,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.540
that motivates them to do
the work that they're doing.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.140
Do you feel like that's
true for you, as well?

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.900
- Yeah, so, I, actually,
definitely, feel that that is true.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.540
I've always been interested,
just, generally, speaking,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.390
in doing work that made a difference

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.270
for solving public problems.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.010
But, the criminal justice
aspect of my research,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.500
in particular, was rooted
in me from a very young age.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.710
I thought I was going to be an attorney,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.050
so, I'd be like you, right.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.900
And, I thought, particularly, I was going

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.240
to be a public defender.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.170
And, I wanted to be a public defender

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.250
because of my family and friends

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.140
that I've seen that had involvement

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.690
with the criminal justice system,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.640
and, the experiences
that they shared with me,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.530
or, their experiences that I witnessed.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.670
And, I thought that I can,
you know, make a difference.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.860
It was when I went to undergraduate

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.890
that I got involved in research

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.440
and, I realized that research
can be another avenue

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.850
to affect change, not
just becoming an attorney

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.680
or, a lawyer, and, so, that,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.930
really, propelled my research trajectory.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.620
And, in terms of policing, in particular,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.180
when I started my doctoral program, I

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.400
actually, though that I was
going to research incarceration

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.004
or, juvenile detention centers,

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:17.680
but, a year after I started my program,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.830
it is when Ferguson happened, so, in 2014,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.750
and, it, really, put a lot
of spotlight on the tensions

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.260
between police and communities.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.660
And, it also, showed the need for research

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.200
to try and help to solve
some of the problems

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.380
that we we're seeing in the community.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.330
- So, let's dig into your research,

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.910
and, let's start with a topic
that Ferguson surfaces, right?

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.174
You've studied cities
that have high levels

00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:46.490
and, low levels of police
community conflict.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.120
What are some of the
factors that determine

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.640
whether a city and a police department

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.840
have high levels or low
levels of that conflict?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.520
- Yeah, so, and, one part of my research

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.984
I was able to try and understand

00:02:56.984 --> 00:03:01.200
what the community socioeconomic
characteristics were,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.954
that were correlated with the high

00:03:02.954 --> 00:03:05.080
or low police citizen conflict.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.700
And, what I found was that communities

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.510
that had higher poverty,
higher unemployment,

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.740
higher violent crime,

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.300
and, higher female headed
housing levels, also had,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.000
really, high levels of
police citizen conflict.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.920
And, that those communities that

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.100
had low police citizen conflict were,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.450
usually, associated with
higher median income,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.120
higher median ages, higher
levels of owner occupied housing.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.210
And, so, I think, the
community characteristics,

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.430
really, do make a difference in trying

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.760
to understand police citizen conflict.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.140
But, I wouldn't go as far as to say

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.961
that it predicts, you know,
police citizen conflict.

00:03:41.961 --> 00:03:42.794
- Right.

00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:44.300
So, what are some of the characteristics

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.720
of police departments,
where there are low levels

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.090
of police community conflict?

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.960
- So, what my research found,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.130
was that, in terms of
police citizen conflict,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.850
when we're looking at things
like police use of force,

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.000
civilian complaints about police officers,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.170
assaults against officers,
that there are certain factors

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.215
that are correlated, and, in particular,

00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:09.370
my research has found that
the police departments

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.320
that had much high levels
of racial representation,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.580
meaning that they had a
lot of people of color

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.710
on the police department, as it pertained

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.350
to the level of people of
color in the community,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.160
and, police departments
that also were engaged

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.520
in community partnerships,
those departments

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.630
had much lower levels
of police use of force.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.330
Also, what my research found,
was that police departments

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.862
that higher percentages of officers

00:04:34.862 --> 00:04:38.130
that were dedicated to
community policing roles,

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.190
or, problem solving roles,
had much lower levels

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.900
of civilian complaints, as well.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.833
So, in terms of what
police departments can do

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:47.740
I think that it points to one, the role

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.280
of community policing,
and, community partnerships

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.960
but, also, the role of
racial representation,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.520
and, hiring people of color,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.400
and, having a diverse police force.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.700
- And, just for our
watchers who might not know,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.450
can you define community policing,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.060
and, what it means for
police officer to be

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.870
in a problem solving role,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.410
as opposed to something else?

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.670
- Right, so, what it means for an officer

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.300
to be in a problem solving role, means

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.960
that that police officer, is,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.310
specifically, dedicated
to engaging the community

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.070
and, positive enforcement activity,

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.020
I mean, positive
nonenforcement activities.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.830
Meaning, that they're not
necessarily responding to call

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.460
for service, or an allegation
about criminal activities,

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.100
but, rather, they're going out

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.830
and, meeting with community stakeholders,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.610
they're attending community events,

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.810
they're walking the beat, for instance,

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.320
and, building relationships,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.310
and, that's what their
role is, primarily, for.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.160
- You're research identifies solutions,

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.340
in addition, to identifying
these characteristics

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.920
of police departments
that have high levels

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.460
and low levels of community conflict.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.730
You also identify solutions.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.020
And, you have a number of
organizational solutionS.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.270
Organizational reform,
also some other things,

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.230
that are more about the
individual police officer.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.370
and, one thing, I found interesting,

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.640
is that your research calls

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.670
for increased soft skills,
for police officers.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.330
And, soft skills are not something people,

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.330
traditionally, think of as
prerequisite for being a cop.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.500
But, your research shows that,

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.570
actually, they can be,
critically, important.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.170
- Right, so, that was,
actually, one of the findings

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.460
that surprised me a little bit,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.740
when I was doing this research.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.540
So, I went in to this, really, thinking

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.560
that the organization mattered,

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.230
and, so when I was doing
a lot of this research,

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.010
I was trying to, specifically, focus

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.530
on the organizational,
administrative, managerial factors

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.750
of police departments.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.960
And, what I found was that yes,
the organization may matter,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.460
but, also, it's the individual
that matters, as well, right,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.090
the individual police officer.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.710
And, that's, really, where the
soft skills, came in to play.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.604
And, two soft skills, in particular,

00:06:41.604 --> 00:06:45.240
that were important, were
the communication skills

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.040
of the officer, and then
an officer's character.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.450
So, in regards to the communication skills

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.540
of an officer, I would hear officers,

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.330
often, say things like community relations

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.510
is communication, right.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.017
It's about winning the community over,

00:06:58.017 --> 00:06:59.960
one community member at a time,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.720
or one incident, at a time.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.840
And, I think that's really in alignment

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.840
with a lot of the procedural
justice literature,

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.190
that has come out, about how you engage

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.840
with civilians, how you
can talk civilians down,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.730
how you can deescalate, et cetera.

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:15.360
And, then, in terms of character,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.280
often what was brought up was the respect

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.860
that an officer has for the community,

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.170
whether or not they are empathetic,

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.609
they're caring, they're compassionate.

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.960
And, community members were often the ones

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.200
to talk about these things,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.970
and, they would often suggest,

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.300
that the character that an officer has,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.390
can be displayed in their actions,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.860
and, that when there is
not respect, or, empathy

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.150
or, care and concern, that
the community loses trust,

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:41.060
in the police department, and,

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.780
that hinders police community relations.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.080
- So, let's talk more about body cameras.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.913
- Okay.

00:07:45.913 --> 00:07:46.800
- Your research on body cameras,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.250
have found a number of things.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.609
One is, they often result
in better resolutions

00:07:50.609 --> 00:07:53.415
of incidents, between police officers,

00:07:53.415 --> 00:07:57.040
and, members of the public,
fewer incidents of violence,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.600
for example, it doesn't result
in substantial de-policing,

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.560
- [Andrea] Right.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.110
- But, also, it increases
officers' skepticism, over time.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:07.100
And, over time, a number
of officers, some officers,

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:10.240
begin to not use or not
turn on their body camera.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.370
So, it's a bit of a mixed bag there.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.640
And, there are some reformers
who say it's band-aid

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.900
on a, much, larger problem.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.455
So, in your view, body cameras,

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:20.780
legitimate reform, band-aid,
or, something else?

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.270
- Yeah, so, I actually,
think the body worn cameras,

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.990
are a tool, to help us to
get to a place, where we can

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.610
have relationships between
police and the community

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.190
that are built on, you know, transparency,

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.940
and, accountability and things like that.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.870
I don't think that it
is the end all, be all,

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.700
or, the panacea to, really, solve some

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.999
of the underlying issues,

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:43.230
that have resulted or that
have been brought to light,

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.210
recently, with police
in minority communities.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.550
But, I do think that it's a tool

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.710
that can be used to help the situation,

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.055
and, I think, right now,
it's too soon to say

00:08:53.055 --> 00:08:55.800
whether or not body cameras, as a whole,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.300
are having the intended impacts,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.710
because a lot of the research
has produced mixed findings,

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.770
particularly, because of the variations

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:05.410
and, policy contexts in
which the body cameras

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.243
have been deployed.

00:09:06.243 --> 00:09:08.550
So, different departments
are deploying cameras

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.470
and, have different types
of policies on cameras,

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.610
so, when you're trying
to compare the findings,

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.830
it's hard to have an conclusive evidence.

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.090
So, I wouldn't shut the
door on body cameras

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:19.340
just yet, but, I think that it's a tool

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.040
that has to be coupled with
other accountability mechanisms,

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.690
and, other reform mechanisms, as well.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.330
- So, situating body
cameras in a larger context

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:31.163
of accountability mechanisms, right?

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.356
One, of the things that reformers

00:09:34.356 --> 00:09:37.340
and, policy makers, hear
from law enforcement

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.320
and, police officers, is,
in the face of body cameras,

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.290
increased scrutiny, et cetera,
we're going to de-police.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.890
Can you explain what de-policing is?

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.145
And, whether it,
actually, happens when you

00:09:49.145 --> 00:09:51.790
have additional oversight
or accountability,

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.820
over police departments
and law enforcement?

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.410
- Yeah, so I think that's a great question

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.870
because that is, definitely, a narrative

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.800
that we've head a lot, and, that was one

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.350
of the things, that the police department

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.710
that I was working with,
actually, said a lot.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.300
De-policing, also referred to
often as the Ferguson Effect,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.710
is, essentially, a concept
that came about after Ferguson,

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.790
because of the rise in crime,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.010
in particular, we saw rises
in homicide rates across

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.850
a variety of cities, in the United States.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.070
And, so, the narrative, is that officers

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.880
are not, necessarily, doing their jobs as

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.060
effectively, or as proactively
as they once was, once were

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:31.370
because of the tensions
that have been present

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.680
between police and communities.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.115
The assaults against
law enforcement officers

00:10:35.115 --> 00:10:37.700
that have happened in places
like, Dallas, for instance.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.430
And, so police officers,
are shrinking back due

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.010
to this anti-policing
sentiment, and, so crime rate

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.820
is going up, right, so,
that's the general idea behind

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.630
the notion of de-policing.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.910
In regards to whether
or not this is a thing

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.210
or, if this is, really, happening,

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:53.960
I think that depends on what type

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.660
of indicators you are looking at.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.760
And, when we're looking at qualitative

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.900
or perceptual accounts,
from officers, for instance,

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.283
there is real and legitimate
concerns about them

00:11:05.283 --> 00:11:08.730
going above and beyond,
and, being very proactive

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.050
and, doing a lot of the
self-initiated activities

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.600
such as pedestrian or traffic stops.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.260
However, they often do say,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.170
that, you know they're
still responding to calls,

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:19.470
and, doing the things that
they have to do, but, not,

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:21.910
necessarily, going above and beyond.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.540
And, they say that because
there is a low morale,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.132
there's lack of motivation, there's lack

00:11:26.132 --> 00:11:29.140
of enthusiasm to do
their job, there's fear

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.600
of punishment, et cetera.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.670
- Because of all the scrutiny,
accountability mechanisms,

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.290
- Right, exactly, and, I bring that up

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:36.610
because I think it's important

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.820
to validate officers'
concerns and perceptions

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:41.940
because the psychological
literature does show

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:46.030
that the perceptions and
attitudes can impact behavior.

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:48.350
But, when you look at quantitative studies

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.910
or, quantitative indicators,
that try and see,

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.140
well, our police officers,

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.110
really, not doing their jobs, right?

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:55.840
There's some differences that we see.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.210
So, for instance, in Baltimore,

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.300
after the Freddie Gray,
the death of Freddie Gray,

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.470
what we saw was that
police may have pulled back

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.950
on their proactive policing activities

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:10.240
and, there was a spike in homicides

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.530
that was, immediately,
following, you know,

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:15.260
the years after the Freddie Gray incident.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.928
However, in places like
Milwaukee, after the beating

00:12:18.928 --> 00:12:22.430
of people of color, in
particular, a black man,

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:26.310
what we saw there, was
that 911 calls dropped,

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:29.110
significantly, immediately
following those incidents.

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.500
And, when you're looking
at both of these incidents

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.970
as it pertains to de-policing, as a whole,

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:38.140
what this, really, points
to is that it may not,

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.850
necessarily, be all on
the police shrinking back

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.210
from their responsibilities or not,

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:47.104
necessarily, being as
proactive, but, it may also be

00:12:47.104 --> 00:12:48.930
in terms of the community,

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:50.970
not calling the police, as much, right.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:53.730
So, it's important to,
really, get at the mechanisms

00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:56.140
by which this phenomenon, if occurring,

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:57.940
how it's occurring, why it's occurring,

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.600
when it's occurring, and, so forth.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.463
- So, you've talked to
innumerable police officers,

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.320
body cameras won't work if
they're turning them off,

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.300
accountability mechanisms won't work

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.518
if they're choosing to withdraw

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:13.351
- Right.

00:13:13.351 --> 00:13:16.350
- from the community
interactions they used to have.

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.380
As, the qualitative research suggests,

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.935
may be not the quantitative research,

00:13:19.935 --> 00:13:23.196
how do you implement,
how can policy makers,

00:13:23.196 --> 00:13:28.196
implement reforms, accountability
measures, oversight,

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.490
without encountering, the
sort of negative impacts

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.330
that we're talking about that,
actually, hurt the cause,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.040
that hurt the cause of public safety?

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.610
- Right, yeah, so, I think that takes

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.440
a real collaborative effort
with police department

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.160
and community stakeholders.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.320
I don't think that it can be
all on the police department,

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.200
to, you know, employ a body camera program

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.140
without getting community input, without

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.440
having a community oversight board

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.700
that's able to see what's happening,

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.140
internally, in the police department,

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:59.130
and, likewise, sometimes there's
civilian oversight boards

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.350
that are, completely, detached
from the police department

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.150
and, then they can't
get access to the type

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.460
of data that they need.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.270
So, I think that there's, really, a need

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:07.960
for an effort that's collaborative,

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.100
that works together, not so
much that there's anything,

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.700
you know, funny going
on, but to the extent

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.310
that they can provide checks and balances

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:19.250
on each other, but, I also,
think that one of the things,

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:21.120
that we realized in the body camera study

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.470
that I conducted, was that officers,

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.700
being regularly, monitored
by their supervisors,

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.113
to ensure compliance was important,

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.240
and, as soon as officers were not being

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.360
regularly, monitored, to
see if they were complying

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.560
or what have you, that's
when compliance dropped

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.960
and, I think that alludes to the point

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.250
that there needs to be
someone that's watching

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.110
someone that's making
sure these activities are

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:47.840
actually, being conducted in
the way that they're intended

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.810
to be conducted, at least
until, it becomes normal,

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:52.820
and, everyday behavior.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.940
- So, let's talk about
a different subject:

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.730
profiling by proxy.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.840
So, profiling by proxy is when

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:05.111
the police are in a position
where they have to respond

00:15:05.111 --> 00:15:09.350
to a call, made by a
community member where

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.440
the community member themselves,
are racially profiling.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.350
And, so we've seen innumerable
examples of this in the news.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.450
But, a young black man
is eating a sandwich

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.340
in a campus plaza and someone says,

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.290
why is that person on the campus?

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.300
Not realizing they're a graduate student,

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.040
and, calls the police to investigate.

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.280
That's a hypothetical I made up,

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.390
but, there's countless examples

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.770
of real life instances of this.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:35.870
So, I think if someone is, let's say,

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.320
not aware of histories
of race and interactions

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.350
between communities of color and police,

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.460
they might say to themselves,

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:45.620
well there's an easy
solution, to profiling

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.230
by proxy, the police officer arrives,

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.780
realizes that this is nonsense,
they admonish the caller,

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:54.390
for wasting their time, and,

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:56.220
probably, being a little but racist,

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.300
and, go about their day.

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.370
I think that assumption
that that can be the easy,

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.770
quick, simple, harmless
solution to the situation

00:16:04.770 --> 00:16:07.280
misunderstands the role
the police officers

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.780
and, police departments have played

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.370
in sort of enforcing racial codes

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.350
over the course of American history.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.890
I'm wondering if you can
respond to the well-intended

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.410
community member who says to themselves,

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.730
why aren't the police in position to,

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.770
simply, diffuse the situation,
sniff out the racism,

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.790
and, resolve the situation,
positively, for everybody.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.530
- Right, so, I think
you hit it on the head,

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:29.470
and, I think that that
response, really, ignores

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:34.470
the complex, and often
conflicted relationship

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.300
that has existed throughout time,

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.550
between disadvantaged communities,

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:41.880
people of color, and, law enforcement.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.870
It misunderstands the history

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.720
that has over-policed
communities of color,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.749
it misunderstands the issues
around police brutality

00:16:52.749 --> 00:16:55.360
and, aggressive policing practices

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.680
that have been displayed
in various communities.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.260
And, I think it also, misunderstands

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:06.100
the notions between assuming
that there's criminality

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.260
that's associated with
certain groups of people

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.970
certain races or ethnicities,

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.560
or, religious groups, or what have you.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.040
I also think that that statement,

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.040
although well intended, one,
takes away the responsibility

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.590
of the person who's calling, and, I think

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:26.800
as civilians, we have a responsibility,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:29.403
as well, to make sure that we're calling

00:17:29.403 --> 00:17:32.560
about legitimate concerns
and legitimate behaviors,

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.160
and, are questioning ourselves.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.140
And, it also assumes that the same biases

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.523
that are present in the caller,

00:17:39.523 --> 00:17:41.650
are absent in the police officer,

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.460
and, it's not to say that that's not true,

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.960
but, we don't know that that's the case,

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.570
until after the situation
has already escalated.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:50.230
Often times, what we've seen is that

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.640
it takes very small situations

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.670
to lead to very escalated situations.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.600
And, it happens very quickly.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.530
And, the last thing I'll say about this

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.460
is that it also ignores the fact

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.930
that there may be an inherent fear,

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.470
in the person the police was called on,

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.140
because of their prior
experiences with police officers

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.660
because what they've seen
on the tv or what have you,

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.828
and, how that fear may
then, impact their response

00:18:16.828 --> 00:18:19.850
when the police officer shows up, so.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.680
- Right, I think the first question

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.930
that a policy analyst, or
somebody with a policy brain

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:27.751
is going to ask, is
what's the intervention?

00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:31.781
What is the policy solution
to policing by proxy

00:18:31.781 --> 00:18:36.140
or uh profiling by proxy?

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.730
But, some of your research shows that it's

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:40.240
actually, not legislation that's going

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.010
to solve the problem,
it's something softer.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.250
- Right, yeah, so, I think that

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.420
honestly, for this issue
of profiling by proxy,

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.110
there's always things that we can say

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.010
have policy implications, right?

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.860
But, I think, really, to get
at the root of the problem,

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.300
it would be forcing community members,

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.350
people who call the
police often, ourselves,

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.270
to ask the hard questions, right?

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:03.550
Ask yourself why are
you calling the police,

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.060
is there criminal activity being exhibited

00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:07.990
that you're seeing, right?

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:09.990
Is there a threat or a danger?

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.030
Are you calling the police

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:15.290
because your own fears are also associated

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:17.860
with certain demographic
groups or certain behaviors

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.440
by certain demographic
groups that are not,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.320
inherently, criminal,
but just don't fit well

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.440
with what you think should be displayed.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.640
Asking yourself if the police come

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.610
is it going to make the situation better?

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.940
Asking yourself how would I feel if this

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.750
was a member of my family?

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.890
If the police coming an
appropriate response?

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.790
And, I think, if we can ask
ourselves these tough questions,

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:41.390
and, really, get to the root of it,

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:45.040
that can help, hopefully,
to eliminate some

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.050
of the problems that we're seeing.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.240
I will say, though, that there is a role

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:54.120
that policy can play,
particularly, as it pertains

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.210
to the role of 911 dispatchers,

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:59.670
and, how information is received

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.960
from the callers, right, so, making sure

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.020
that there's appropriate
training and protocol

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.760
to ask probing questions,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:07.060
when someone is calling the police,

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:08.930
to try and get at the root of the problem.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:10.280
And, then how that information

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.340
is, then, transmitted to officers.

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:17.077
But, I know 911 dispatchers
is bag in itself,

00:20:17.077 --> 00:20:19.450
and, there's a lot of
things that go in to that.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.263
But, I do think that
there could be a role,

00:20:21.263 --> 00:20:24.043
for policy to play, but,
I don't necessarily know

00:20:24.043 --> 00:20:25.310
that the first role, at least.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:28.170
- Right, so let's talk about
two big picture questions

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.650
here as we begin to wrap up.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:31.912
The first is, some of
your research has found

00:20:31.912 --> 00:20:35.840
that if you put body
cameras on police officers,

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.040
some portion of them are going to turn

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.340
those body cameras off.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.330
Another has found that
when considering complaints

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:42.780
against police officers, the race

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:44.380
of the complainant makes a difference.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.100
And, African Americans who complain

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.570
about police officers, are much more,

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.591
likely, to have their complaint dismissed,

00:20:49.591 --> 00:20:51.693
than other complainants.

00:20:53.094 --> 00:20:56.420
Also, you found that if you have more,

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.330
as we discussed earlier, if
you have more people of color

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:01.560
on the police force, it's
going to improve relationships

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.215
with communities of color.

00:21:03.215 --> 00:21:05.910
Do you ever find yourself thinking

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:07.480
I'm using data to find things

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.551
that any community member in East Oakland

00:21:09.551 --> 00:21:12.570
could've told me or anyone if
we had taken the time to ask,

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:13.420
I'm sure you do.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.410
- Right.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:15.900
- And, can you speak to the importance

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:20.868
of data and research, that
validates community narratives

00:21:20.868 --> 00:21:24.230
when some of those community
narratives go ignored?

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.280
- Right, yeah, so, I,
actually, remember hearing

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:30.300
a scholar, giving a keynote
and the scholar said

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:34.740
essentially, that scholarship
is not about finding truth,

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.450
it's about providing evidence
to underscore truth, right.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.050
And, it's this idea that scholarship

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:43.900
really, just confirms what
the community already knows,

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.370
or, seeks to at least to understand,

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:46.370
it doesn't always confirm.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:48.160
So, scholarship seeks to understand

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:50.810
what the community may or
may not already know, right.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.550
And, I think that quote,
really, resonates to this,

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.751
what you're talking about,
what you're asking about.

00:21:56.751 --> 00:21:59.230
But, I think data is important

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.200
and, research is important for
a variety of reasons, right.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.350
So, the first one, is that
it, really, like you said,

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.560
it validates community member experiences,

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.290
often times it can help
to inform decisions,

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:12.320
and, inform solutions.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.970
It may shed light on the
magnitude of the issue,

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.280
so, maybe there's a couple
community experiences,

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.580
but, we don't know how
large this problem is.

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.320
Or, on the other end, maybe
this is just, you know,

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.660
a very unique problem for a
very specific group of people

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.030
or a specific street in the community.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:29.670
And, it's not as widespread,

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.630
as maybe a narrative may say it is, right?

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.380
And, I think both of those are important

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.230
to be able to tease out, you know,

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.650
what's really going on, right.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.514
What the mechanisms by
which, whatever problem

00:22:39.514 --> 00:22:41.960
whatever phenomenon is being exhibited,

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.730
what are the mechanisms by
which it's, actually, you know,

00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:46.300
occurring or happening to get

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:48.180
to some of the policy solutions.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.440
And, some people love data,

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.460
some people love community narratives,

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.970
and, I think it's about
knowing what to use,

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:59.780
to which audience to try,
and, get whatever solution,

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.520
or, change, or, whatever
argument you're trying

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.480
to put forth, and, I think
that is, really, key.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:10.420
- I always think about a story
I read about an individual,

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.370
who had cognitive and mental disabilities.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:19.370
Who lived in a back of a
convenient store that was

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.580
he lived there, basically,
because of the grace

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:23.930
of the convenient store owner who knew

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:27.040
he was marginally housed,
and, needed a place to stay,

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.330
and, did some odd jobs
around the convenient store

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.520
in order to make a little bit of money.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.650
And, he was sort of on
the margins, in many ways.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.250
And, the police department,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:38.100
in order to meet their
quotas were arresting him,

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.410
like 20, 30 times, every couple months,

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.360
just to get the numbers and
then they'd release him back,

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.910
and, they'd come and just
pick him up the next day.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.630
And, it was always some new reason.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.110
And, it was sort of a tragic story.

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:54.900
That individual isn't
going to build a narrative

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.310
in advocacy for himself,
and, for his community

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.880
that's going to change the
local police department

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.530
or, change policing on the whole.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.500
And, frankly, other members
of that same community,

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.510
aren't going to disrupt their lives

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.180
in a way that is going
to like force reform

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.320
on the police department.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.120
It's not something that
they should have to do.

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.090
But, those stories in combination

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:18.810
with, as you're saying, in
combination with research,

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:21.560
that maybe has purchase,
among policy makers,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.040
among law makers, among
police chiefs, and so on.

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:25.820
Put all that together,
and, now all of a sudden,

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:27.460
you have maybe something that

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.410
it brings positive changes, so.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:32.580
- Last question, the biggest question,

00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:34.540
I think, in your field.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.240
We've talked about what results

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:42.030
in positive police community relations,

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:43.450
what characteristics can result

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.930
in negative police community relations,

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:48.790
what is the ideal state?

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:50.770
What is it that through all the reform,

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:52.966
the legislation, the
scrutiny, and, the oversight,

00:24:52.966 --> 00:24:55.000
what is it that we're trying to achieve

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.580
when it comes to policing
and the communities

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.770
that police serve?

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:01.730
- Yeah, so that's always
the million dollar question.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.043
And, I think the ideal state
for police community relations

00:25:06.043 --> 00:25:09.270
is one that's symbiotic, in nature, right?

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:12.560
It's based on mutuality,
and, mutual respect,

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.083
mutual trust, mutual cooperation.

00:25:16.769 --> 00:25:19.700
And, it's one in which the
police and the community

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.130
are, really, working,
collaboratively, together, right.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:26.360
And, it's this idea that the community,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.950
essentially, right, are the
owners of government, right,

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.960
and, they're the ones
that are supposed to,

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:35.780
at least, be directing how they want

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.190
their community services to be delivered,

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.110
or what have you, policing
being one of those services.

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:43.810
And, in my opinion, and,
based on the research

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.240
that I've done, I think when
you're talking about police

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.700
and communities working
together, in particular,

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.650
there's three different types of ways

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.800
that police and communities
can work together.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.835
And, the first way, is what we often see

00:25:56.835 --> 00:26:00.740
which is police, maybe showing
up at community events,

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:02.520
maybe a certain designated officer who's

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.040
a community policing officer,

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.590
or, the public relations
officer, will show up,

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:08.220
and, participate in certain events,

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.020
and, be present in the community,

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:11.840
and, I think that's
great and that's needed.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:14.160
I don't think that's, necessarily, enough.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.380
The second thing is, what we've seen

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.170
is police, and, this is
I think, rarely seen,

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:21.320
but, it's still evident in some places,

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.920
where police departments
open up their doors

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.720
to the community to come in, right.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.287
So, in Hartford, what they would do

00:26:27.287 --> 00:26:29.170
was they would have a public CompStat,

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:32.130
which they would have a day
where the community members

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:33.620
could come in, and they could go over all

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.700
of their crime statistics,
they could go over

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.740
the different patrol activities
that they are doing to,

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.480
really, show the community
this is what we're doing,

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:42.630
this is why we're doing
it, this is where we are.

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.110
Likewise, when they had
a high profile incident,

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.777
they would would call
community leaders in,

00:26:46.777 --> 00:26:48.870
and, debrief the community leaders,

00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:51.810
immediately, after and say
you know, this is what happen,

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.090
our officers did this,
this is the video we have,

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.700
this is whatever, whatever, right?

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.960
And, so that's, really, different,

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.130
than just the police
showing up at events, right.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:01.420
It's bringing the community members

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.080
in to the police department.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.360
And, then, the last thing,

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.557
is where the police department

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:09.110
and the community identify
problems, together,

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.030
and, work to build solutions, right.

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.860
So, whether there is a certain community

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:15.133
a neighborhood within the community

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:17.860
or a certain group, or,
block within the community,

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.470
that's, really, causing problems,

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.963
or, maybe needs a little extra
attention, or what have you,

00:27:22.963 --> 00:27:25.730
it's the police and, the
community coming up together,

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.660
to see what is the best approach for this,

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:29.370
how can we best deal with this,

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.930
and, listening to both sides,

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.232
rather than the police thinking,

00:27:32.232 --> 00:27:34.130
you know, let's just over-police, and

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.380
aggressively, police this behavior,

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.640
or, rather than the
community trying to get

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.950
what they call street justice,

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.473
and, going to take things
in to their own hands.

00:27:43.364 --> 00:27:44.870
- Thank you so much.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:45.703
- Thank you.

00:27:45.703 --> 00:27:47.400
- Andrea, I appreciate you being here.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.430

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:53.070
