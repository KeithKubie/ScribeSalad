00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
Going through all the steps of the quadratic formula gives us 9, plus or minus

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.353
i. Or, in other words, our zeroes are 9 plus i and 9 minus i. Interesting. So I

00:00:10.353 --> 00:00:14.700
guess that cubic functions, like the one we started out with, can have

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.530
imaginary zeros too. That's pretty cool. Think for a second about what this

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.100
means for the graph of Grant's profit function.
