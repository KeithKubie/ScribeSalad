Funding for this program is provided by

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.250
Additional funding provided by

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.590
When we ended last time

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.400
we were discussing Locke's idea of government
by consent

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.420
and the question arose

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.830
what are the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.910
limits on government

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.110
that even the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.480
the agreement of the majority can't override

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.760
that was the question we ended with

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.860
we saw

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.600
in the case of property rights

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.420
that on Locke's view

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.760
a democratically elected government has
the right to tax people

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.850
it has to be taxation with consent

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.030
because it does involve the taking of people's
property

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.630
for the common good

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.470
but it doesn't require

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.850
the consent of the each individual

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.870
at the time the tax

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.549
is enacted or collected

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.120
what it does require

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.060
is a prior act of consent

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.090
to join the society

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.720
to take on the political obligation

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.430
but once you take on that obligation you agree
to be bound by the majority

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.960
so much for taxation

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.000
but what, you may ask

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.110
about

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.610
the right

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.380
to life

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.340
can the government conscript

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.170
people and send them into battle

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.659
what about the idea that we own ourselves

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.349
is the idea of self possession violated

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.529
if the government

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:18.559
can through coercive legislation and enforcement
powers say

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:22.799
you must go risk your life to fight in Iraq

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.039
what would Locke say? does the government have
the right to do that?

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:29.249
yes

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.699
in fact he says in one thirty nine

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.189
he says

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.120
what matters

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.159
is that the political authority

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.939
or the military authority

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.519
not be arbitrary that's what matters

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.049
he gives a wonderful example he says a

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.930
a sergeant even a sergeant

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.110
let alone a general, a sergeant

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.899
can command a soldier

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:03.489
to go right up to the face of a cannon

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.019
where he is almost sure to die

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.219
that the sergeant can do

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:18.760
the general can condemn the soldier to death
for deserting his post or for not obeying

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.469
even a desperate order

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.779
but with all their power over life and death

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.779
what these officers can't do

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:30.040
is take a penny

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.679
of that soldier's money

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:37.299
because that has

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.489
nothing to do with the rightful authority

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.109
that would be arbitrary

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.749
and it would be corrupt

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:48.989
so consent winds up being very powerful in
Locke, not consent of the individual to the

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.219
particular tax or military order,

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:57.180
but consent to join the government and to be 
bound by the majority in the first place

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.159
that's the consent that matters

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.849
and it matters so

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.839
powerfully

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:09.319
the even the limited government created by
the fact that we have an unalienable right

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.449
to life liberty and property

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:17.669
even that limited government is only limited
in the sense that it has to govern by generally

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.549
applicable laws, the rule of law, it can't
be arbitrary

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.809
that's Locke.

00:04:25.809 --> 00:04:27.770
well this raises a question

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.650
about consent. Why is consent such a

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.439
powerful moral instrument in

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:41.439
creating political authority and the obligation
to obey

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.029
today we begin to investigate the question
of consent

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.749
by looking at a concrete case

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:52.460
the case of military conscription.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.279
now some people say

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:58.829
if we have a fundamental right

00:04:58.829 --> 00:05:00.610
that arises from

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.069
the idea that we own ourselves

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.870
it's a violation of that right

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.629
for a government

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:15.110
to conscript citizens to go fight in wars.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.289
others disagree others say that's a legitimate

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:19.479
power

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.629
of government, of democratically elected government
anyhow,

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:28.409
and that we have an obligation to obey

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:31.530
let's take the case

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.610
the united states fighting a war in Iraq.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.860
news accounts tell us

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.809
that the military

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:44.560
is having great difficulty meeting its

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.300
recruitment targets

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.499
consider three policies that the

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:53.799
US government might undertake

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:56.360
to deal with the fact that it's not

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.620
achieving its recruiting targets

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.199
solution number one

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:06.759
increase the pay and benefits

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.430
to attract a sufficient number

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.419
of soldiers,

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.900
option number two

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.229
shift to a system of military conscription

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.330
have a lottery

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:21.860
and who's ever numbers

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.939
are drawn

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:30.279
go to fight in Iraq,

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:33.109
system number three

00:06:33.109 --> 00:06:36.720
outsource, hire

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.020
what traditionally have been called mercenaries

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.920
people around the world who are qualified,

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.470
able to do the work, able to fight well

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.269
and who are willing to do it

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:51.229
for the existing wage

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:53.169
so let's take a quick

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:54.300
poll here

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.300
how many favor increasing the pay?

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.949
huge majority.

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:09.610
how many favor going to conscription?

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.379
all right maybe a dozen people in the room

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:14.379
favor conscription.

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:21.379
what about the outsourcing solution?

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:23.989
okay so there maybe 

00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:28.710
about two, three dozen.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.330
during the civil war

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.879
the union

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:35.949
used

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:38.159
a combination

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:40.080
of conscription

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.689
and the market system

00:07:43.689 --> 00:07:47.599
to fill the ranks of the military to fight in
the civil war

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:49.580
it was a system that

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.879
began with conscription

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:53.669
but

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:55.209
if you

00:07:55.209 --> 00:07:56.120
were

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.740
drafted

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.379
and didn't want to serve

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:05.089
you could hire a substitute take your place

00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:07.779
and many people did

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:11.889
you could pay whatever the market

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:14.839
required in order to find a substitute

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:16.990
people ran ads in

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.599
newspapers in the classified ads

00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:21.060
offering

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.879
five hundred dollars

00:08:22.879 --> 00:08:26.679
sometimes a thousand dollars

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:29.389
for a substitute who would go fight the civil war

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:32.099
in their place

00:08:32.099 --> 00:08:32.979
in fact

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:35.590
it's reported that Andrew Carnegie

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.270
was drafted

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.080
and hired a substitute to take his place

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.600
for an amount

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.410
that was

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:51.410
a little less than the amount to spend for
a year on fancy cigars

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.720
now I want to get your views

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.270
about this civil war system call it the a hybrid
system

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.740
conscription but with the buyout provision

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:09.740
how many think it was a just system how many
would defend the civil war system?

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.210
anybody?

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.570
one, anybody else?

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.430
to three

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.570
four five.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:20.880
how many think it was unjust?

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.750
most of you don't like the civil war system
you think it's

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.720
unjust, let's hear an objection

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:34.720
why don't you like it? what's wrong with it?

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.839
yes. well by paying

00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:40.770
three hundred dollars for

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:46.400
to be exempt one time around you're really putting
a price on valuing human life

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.730
and we established earlier that's really hard
to do so

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:53.740
they're trying to accomplish something that
really isn't feasible.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.940
good, so

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:59.480
so paying someone three hundred or five hundred or a
thousand dollars

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.449
you're basically saying that's what their life
is worth you. that's what their life is worth

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:05.630
it's putting a dollar value on life

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.370
that's good, and what's your name? Liz.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.020
Liz.

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.449
well who has an answer

00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:13.329
for Liz

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:15.430
you defended the civil war system

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.920
what do you say?

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.500
if you don't like the price then

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.110
you have the freedom to

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.170
not be sold or for  so it's

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.300
up to you and I don't think it's necessarily
putting

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.380
a specific price on you and if it's

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:35.870
done by himself I don't think there's anything
that's really morally wrong with that.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.860
So the person who takes

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.320
the five hundred dollars let's say,

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.880
he's putting

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.109
his own

00:10:44.109 --> 00:10:46.310
price on his life

00:10:46.310 --> 00:10:49.250
on the risk of his life

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.360
and he should have the freedom to choose to
do that. exactly.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.899
what's your name? Jason.

00:10:54.899 --> 00:10:56.750
Jason thank you.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.950
now we need to hear from another critic of
the civil war system. yes.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.190
it's a kind of coercion almost of people who
have lower incomes

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.090
for Carnegie he can

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.839
totally ignore the draft three hundred dollars
is

00:11:10.839 --> 00:11:14.910
you know irrelevant in terms of his income, 
but for someone of a lower income they are

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:17.280
essentially being coerced

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.930
to draft to be drafted or

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.050
I mean it's probably they're not able to find a
replacement the

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.030
tell me your name. Sam.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.619
Sam, all right so you say Sam

00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:29.580
that

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.070
when a poor laborer

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:37.180
buys his, accepts three hundred dollars to fight
in the civil war

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.710
he is in effect being coerced

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:41.869
by that money

00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:44.600
given his economic circumstances

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.670
whereas Carnegie can go off pay the money

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:51.070
and not serve

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.730
I want to hear if someone has a reply

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.840
to Sam's

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.160
argument

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.150
that what looks like a free exchange

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.140
is actually

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.410
coercive

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.360
who has an answer to

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:08.980
to Sam. go ahead

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:10.680
I'd actually agree with him. You agree with him

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.580
I agree with him in saying that

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.020
it is coercion

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:18.020
in the sense that it robs an individual

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.350
of his ability to reason properly

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.980
okay and what's your name? Raul.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.380
ok so Raul and Sam 

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.090
agree

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:30.620
that what looks like a free exchange, free choice
voluntary act

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.770
is actually coercion it involves coercion

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:38.430
it's profound coercion of the worst kind because
it falls so disproportionately

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.280
upon one segment of society

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.700
good, all right so Raul

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.550
and Sam have made a powerful point

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.100
who would like to reply

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.890
who has an answer

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.250
for Sam and Raul? Go ahead

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:59.050
I just I don't think that these drafting systems are
really terribly different from you know all

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.650
volunteer army sort of recruiting strategies

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.380
the whole idea of

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.110
you know having benefits in pay for joining the
army is you know sort of a coercive strategy

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.580
to get people to 

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.890
join

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.440
it is true that

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:17.330
military volunteers come from disproportionately,
you know, lower economic

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.250
status

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.450
and also from certain regions of the country
where you can use the patriotism

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:25.279
to try and coerce people,
if you're like it's the right thing to do to

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:27.040
volunteer to go over to Iraq.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.880
and tell me your name. Emily.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.450
alright Emily 

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.770
says 

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:37.150
and Raul you're going to have to reply to
this so get ready

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:39.790
Emily says

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.270
fair enough

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:42.839
there is a coercive element

00:13:42.839 --> 00:13:46.680
to the civil war system when the laborer

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.400
takes the place of Andrew Carnegie for five
hundred dollars

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.260
Emily concedes that

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.780
but she says

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.399
if that troubles you

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:57.610
about the civil war system

00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.160
shouldn't that also trouble you

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.040
about

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.980
the volunteer army today?

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.520
and let me, 

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.939
before you answer, how did you vote on the
first poll,

00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:10.960
did you defend a volunteer army?

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.330
I didn't vote.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.540
you didn't vote.

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.289
either way

00:14:16.289 --> 00:14:17.640
you didn't vote

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.680
but did you sell your vote to the person sitting
next to you?

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.080
no, all right

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.240
so what would you say to that argument?

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.310
I think that the circumstances are different and
that

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.580
there was conscription

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.340
in

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.420
the civil war there is no draft today

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.790
and I think that

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.150
the volunteers for the army today

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:45.550
have a more profound sense of patriotism that is
of an individual choice

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:47.710
than those who

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:50.870
were forced into the military in the civil war

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.330
somehow less coerced. less coerced. even though 

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:59.090
there is still inequality in American society
even though as Emily points out

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.520
the make-up

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.260
of the American military is not reflective
of the population

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.700
as a whole. Let’s just do an experiment
here

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:09.190
how many here

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:12.090
have either served in the military

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:13.750
or have a family member

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.420
who has served in the military

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.709
in this generation

00:15:16.709 --> 00:15:18.540
not parents

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.310
family members in this generation

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:23.960
and how many have neither served

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:30.960
nor I have any brothers or sisters who have served

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:36.450
does that bear out your point Emily?

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:38.090
Alright now we need

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.980
we need to hear from

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.580
most of you defended

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.240
the idea

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.580
of the

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.390
of the all-volunteer military overwhelmingly

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.870
and yet overwhelmingly people

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:58.110
consider the civil war system unjust

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:00.420
Sam and Raul 

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.580
articulated

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.890
reasons for objecting to the civil war system

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:07.709
it took place against a background of inequality

00:16:07.709 --> 00:16:12.640
and therefore the choices people made to
buy their way into military service

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.320
were not truly free

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.490
but at least partly coerced

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.660
then Emily extends that argument

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.700
in the form of a challenge

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.090
all right everyone here who voted

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:29.010
in favor of the all-volunteer army

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:31.280
should be able

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.030
should have to explain

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.730
well what's the difference in principle

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:38.300
doesn't the all-volunteer army 

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.920
simply universalize

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.600
the feature that almost everyone find objectionable

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.050
in the civil war buy-out provision

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.690
did I state that challenge fairly Emily?

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.400
ok, so we need to hear from

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.060
a defender

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.490
of the all-volunteer military who can address

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.060
Emily's challenge

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.200
who can do that? Go ahead

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.959
the difference between the civil war system
and the all-volunteer army system is that

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.360
in the civil war

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:12.810
you're being hired not by the government but
by individuals

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.270
and as a result different people to get hired
a different individuals, get paid different

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:21.040
in the case of the all-volunteer army
everyone who gets hired is hired by the government

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.709
and gets paid the same amount

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:26.390
it's precisely the universalization of all

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.560
of essentially paying your service you pay your
way to the army that makes the all 

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.350
volunteer army just.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:41.070
Emily? I guess I'd frame the principal 
slightly differently, on the all-volunteer

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.600
army

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.720
it's possible for somebody to just
step aside and not really think about, you

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.390
know, the war at all. it's possible to say well I 
don't need the money,

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:54.210
you know I don't need to have an opinion about this
I don't need to feel obligated to take

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.560
my part and defend my country with a

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.430
coercive system, I'm sorry, 

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:59.179
with an explicit draft,

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:00.210
then

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.830
you know there's the threat at least that every
individual will have to make some sort of

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:04.679
decision

00:18:04.679 --> 00:18:09.150
you know, regarding military conscription and you
know perhaps in that way it's more equitable you know

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.770
it's true that

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:15.740
Andrew Carnegie might not serve in any case
but in one you know he can completely step

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.640
aside from it and in the other there is some level
of responsibility.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.070
While you're there Emily, 

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:23.380
so what system do you favor

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.860
conscription

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.520
I would be hard to say but I think so
because it makes the whole country feel a

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.470
sense of responsibility for the conflict instead
of you know having a war that's maybe ideologically

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.780
supported by a few but only if there's no

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.330
you know, real responsibility.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:43.020
good. who wants to reply, go ahead.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.440
so I was going to say that 

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.910
the fundamental difference between the 
all-volunteer army

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.290
and then the

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.390
army in the civil war is that

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:56.600
in all volunteer army if you want to volunteer
that fact comes first and then the pay 

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.570
comes after whereas in

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.200
the civil wars system

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.820
the people who are volunteering, who are

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:05.290
accepting the pay aren't necessarily doing it

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.160
because they want to, they're just doing it for
the money first.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.490
what motivation beyond the pay do you think

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.370
is operating in the case of the all volunteer army?

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.500
Like patriotism for the country.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.600
patriotism

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.140
well what about pay. And a desire to

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.990
defend the country and 

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.879
there's some motivation in pay but

00:19:25.879 --> 00:19:28.250
the fact that

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.180
it's first and foremost in an all-volunteer army
will motivate them first, I think personally

00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:33.300
okay

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.360
you think it's better, and tell me your
name. Jackie.

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.500
Jackie do you think it's better if people
serve in the military out of a sense of patriotism

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.770
than just for the money

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:45.460
yes definitely because that people who

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.320
that was one of the main problems in the civil
war

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.060
I mean is that the people that you're getting
to go in it

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:51.570
or to go to war

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.500
aren't necessarily people who want to fight and
so they won't be as good soldiers as they

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.570
will be had they been there because they wanted
to be

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.760
all right what about Jackie’s

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:04.610
having raised the question of patriotism

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.750
that patriotism is a better or a higher motivation
than money

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.970
for military service

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:11.960
who, who

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:17.480
would like to address that question?

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:22.320
patriotism absolutely is not necessary
in order to be a good soldier because mercenaries

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.830
can do just as good of a job of

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.310
the job as anyone who

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:31.040
waves the American flag around and wants
to

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.360
defend what the government believes that
we should do.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.460
did you favor the outsourcing

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:42.600
solution? yes sir.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.600
all right so let 

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.860
Jackie respond, what's your name? Phillip

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:49.500
what about that Jackie?

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.340
so much for patriotism

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.590
if you've got someone who's heart is in it more

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:57.160
than another person's they're going to do a
better job

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.309
when it comes down to the wire

00:20:58.309 --> 00:21:00.070
and there is like

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.070
a situation in which

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.840
someone has to put their life on the line

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:05.140
someone

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.820
who is doing it because they love this country

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.640
will be more willing to go into danger than
someone who's just getting paid they don't care

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.220
they've got the technical skills

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.150
but they don't care what happens because the
really have

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.010
they have nothing, like,

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.880
nothing invested in this country

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:26.549
there's another aspect though once we
get on to the issue of patriotism

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:28.480
if you believe patriotism

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.720
as Jackie does, should be the foremost consideration

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.610
and not money

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.070
does that argue for or against

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.350
the paid army we have now

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:42.420
we call it the volunteer army, though if you
think about it that's

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:43.980
a kind of a misnomer

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.960
a volunteer army as we use the term is
a paid army. so

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.640
what about the suggestion

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:53.040
that patriotism should be

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.760
the primary motivation for military service

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.900
not money?

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.980
does that argue in favor

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.070
of the paid military that we have

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.450
or does it argue

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.950
for conscription

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:13.790
and just to sharpen that point building on Phil's
case for outsourcing

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.510
if you think

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:19.870
that the all-volunteer army, the paid army

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.390
is best

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:25.060
because it lets the market allocate

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:28.109
positions according to people's preferences
and willing

00:22:28.109 --> 00:22:31.190
willingness to serve for a certain wage

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.070
doesn't the logic

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.110
that takes you

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:37.570
from a system of conscription

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.770
to the hybrid civil war system

00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.680
to the all-volunteer army

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.550
doesn't the

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:47.490
the idea of expanding freedom of choice

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.910
in the market

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:54.750
doesn't that lead you all the way if you followed
that principle consistently

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:59.260
to a mercenary army?

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:01.200
and then if you say no

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.570
Jackie says no, patriotism

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:04.399
should count

00:23:04.399 --> 00:23:09.289
for something

00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:11.090
doesn't that argue

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:16.750
for going back to conscription if by patriotism
you mean a sense of civic

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:20.730
obligation

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:22.680
let's see if we can step back from

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.830
the discussion that we've had

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:28.680
and see what we've learned

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.160
about

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.559
consent

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:39.210
as it applies to market exchange.

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:41.640
we've really heard two

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.100
arguments

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.559
two arguments against

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:48.720
the use of markets

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.210
and exchange

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:55.760
in the allocation of military service

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.860
one was the argument raised

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.080
by Sam and Raul

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.270
the argument

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:06.700
about coercion

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.450
the objection

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.770
that

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:14.560
leading the market allocate military service

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.070
may be unfair

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.800
and may not even be free

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.540
if there is

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.120
severe inequality in this society

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.800
so that people

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:29.140
who buy their way into military service

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.509
are doing so

00:24:30.509 --> 00:24:31.830
not because

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:35.480
they really want to

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.330
but because they have so few economic opportunities
that that's their

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:42.100
that's their best

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.480
choice

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.370
and Sam and Raul say there's an element of coercion
in that

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:51.780
that's one argument.

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:53.749
then there is a second objection

00:24:53.749 --> 00:24:59.190
to using the market to allocate military service

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.760
that's the idea

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.610
that military service

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:06.330
shouldn't be treated as just another job for
pay

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.810
because it's bound up with patriotism

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.010
and civic obligation

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.580
this is a different argument

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.610
from the argument about unfairness and inequality

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:18.610
and coercion

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:23.080
it's an argument that suggests that maybe
where civic

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.680
obligations are concerned

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.090
we shouldn't allocate

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.120
duties and rights

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.679
by the market

00:25:36.679 --> 00:25:38.880
now we've identified two

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.070
broad objections

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.110
what do we need to know to assess those objections

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:51.110
to assess the first the argument from coercion
inequality and fairness, Sam,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.860
we need to ask

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:58.050
what inequalities in the background conditions
of society

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.030
undermine

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.330
the freedom

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:03.250
of choices people make

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:07.570
to buy and sell their labor

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.220
question number one.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:14.190
question number two, to assess the civic obligation
patriotism

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:15.340
argument

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.020
we have to ask

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.490
what are the obligations of citizenship

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.110
is military service

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:22.860
one of them

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.049
or not

00:26:25.049 --> 00:26:32.049
what obligates us as citizens what is the
source of political obligation

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.630
is it consent

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:34.969
or are there some

00:26:34.969 --> 00:26:38.630
civic obligations we have

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:41.080
even without consent

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.710
for living in sharing

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.410
in a certain

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.180
kind of society.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.980
we haven't answered either of those questions

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:51.060
but our debate today

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.950
about the civil war system and the all-volunteer
army

00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:55.520
has at least raised them

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:02.520
and those are questions we're going to return
to in the coming weeks.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.090
Do you think you should be able to

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:13.470
bid for a baby that's up for adoption?

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.360
That's Andrew's Challenge.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:21.070
Do I think that I should be able to bid for a baby?

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:23.180
I'm not, sure.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:27.640
it's a market.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.029
today at I’d like to turn our attention

00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:37.120
and get your views

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.210
about an argument over the role of markets

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:47.210
in the realm of human reproduction and procreation.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.850
now with infertility clinics

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.640
people advertise for egg donors

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.760
and from time to time in the

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.020
Harvard Crimson

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.529
ads appear for egg donors, have you seen
them?

00:28:04.529 --> 00:28:06.130
there was one that

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:09.180
ran a few years ago

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:15.330
it wasn't looking for just any egg donor,

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:19.500
it was an ad that offered a large financial
incentive for a donor

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.270
from a woman

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.200
who was intelligent

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.900
athletic

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.139
at least five foot ten

00:28:29.139 --> 00:28:30.790
and with

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.039
at least

00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:36.430
fourteen hundred or above on her SAT's

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:41.220
how much do you think

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:46.559
the person looking for this together was willing
to pay for an egg from a woman of that

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:47.970
description

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:50.130
what would you guess?

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:53.570
thousand dollars?

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:57.300
fifteen thousand? ten?

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:04.300
I’ll show you the ad

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.280
fifty thousand dollars

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:12.140
for an egg

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.160
but only

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.770
a premium egg

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:20.460
what do you think about that?

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.760
well there are also sometimes ads

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.070
in the Harvard crimson and in a other college
newspapers

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.950
for sperm donors

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.660
so the market

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.760
in reproductive

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.520
capacities

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.380
is an equal opportunity market

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:51.380
well not exactly equal opportunity they're
not offering fifty thousand dollars for sperm

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.880
but there is a company

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:57.560
a large commercial sperm bank

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.640
that markets sperm

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.200
it's called California cryobank

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.500
it's a for-profit company

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.310
it imposes

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:17.470
exacting standards on the sperm it recruits

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:20.610
and it has offices

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.510
in Cambridge between Harvard and MIT

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.870
and in Palo alto near

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.480
Stanford

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.960
cryobank's marketing materials

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.110
play up

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:40.740
the prestigious source of its sperm

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:41.930
here is 

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.020
from the web site

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.170
of cryobank

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:52.559
the information

00:30:52.559 --> 00:30:55.630
here they talk about the compensation

00:30:55.630 --> 00:31:00.900
although compensation should not be the only
reason for becoming of sperm donor

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:06.830
we are aware of the considerable time and
expense involved in being a donor

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.110
so you know what they offer?

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:17.470
donors will be reimbursed

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.400
seventy five dollars per

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.730
specimen

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:27.730
up to nine hundred dollars a month if you
donate three times a week

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.470
and then they add, we periodically offer incentives

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:33.200
such as

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:42.400
such as movie tickets

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:47.700
our gifts certificates for the extra time
and effort expended

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.670
by participating donors

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:51.910
it's not easy

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.970
to be a sperm donor

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:59.760
they accept fewer than five percent of the
donors who apply

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.720
their admission criteria are

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.300
more demanding than Harvard's

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.680
the head of the

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.290
sperm bank said the ideal sperm donor

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:12.910
is six feet tall

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.760
with a college degree

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.820
brown eyes

00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.450
blond hair

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:21.470
and dimples

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.240
for the simple reason that these are the traits

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.760
that the market has shown

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.730
the customers want

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:33.410
quote, quoting the head of the sperm bank, if our
customers wanted high school dropouts we would

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:37.990
give them high school dropouts.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:43.310
so here are two instances

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:48.419
the market in eggs for donation and the market
in sperm

00:32:48.419 --> 00:32:50.480
that raise a question

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.430
a question about

00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:53.820
whether

00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:55.630
eggs and sperm

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.210
should or should not be bought and sold

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.760
for money.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.640
as you ponder that

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:05.640
I want you to consider

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.780
another

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.150
case

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:10.520
involving

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.220
a market

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.570
and in fact a contract

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:17.260
in human

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.740
reproductive, in the human reproductive capacity

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.560
and this is the case

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.830
of commercial surrogate motherhood.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:28.490
and it's a case that wound up in court

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:32.630
some years ago it's the story of baby M

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:35.340
it began with William and Elizabeth

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.350
Stern, a professional couple

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:38.429
wanting a baby

00:33:38.429 --> 00:33:40.680
but they couldn't have one of their own,

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.630
at least not without medical risk to Mrs. Stern.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.230
they went to an infertility clinic

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:50.090
where they met Mary Beth Whitehead

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.460
a twenty nine-year-old mother of two

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:55.150
the wife of a sanitation worker

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.660
she had replied to and ad

00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.790
that the center had placed

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:01.050
seeking the service

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:05.670
of a surrogate mother

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:06.840
they made a deal

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.099
they signed a contract

00:34:09.099 --> 00:34:11.619
in which William Stern

00:34:11.619 --> 00:34:12.739
agreed

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:13.909
to pay

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:17.879
Mary Beth Whitehead a ten thousand dollar
fee

00:34:17.879 --> 00:34:20.359
plus all expenses

00:34:20.359 --> 00:34:22.759
in exchange for which

00:34:22.759 --> 00:34:27.170
Mary Beth Whitehead agreed to be artificially
inseminated with William

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.779
Stern's sperm,

00:34:28.779 --> 00:34:31.469
to bear the child and then

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:33.309
to give the baby

00:34:33.309 --> 00:34:35.879
to the Sterns

00:34:35.879 --> 00:34:37.429
well you probably know

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:39.690
how the story unfolded

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:42.239
Mary Beth gave birth

00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:43.739
and changed her mind

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:47.049
she decided she wanted to keep the baby

00:34:47.049 --> 00:34:49.769
the case wound up in court

00:34:49.769 --> 00:34:51.519
in New Jersey

00:34:51.519 --> 00:34:52.949
so let's take

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:54.989
put aside

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:56.690
any legal questions

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:58.190
and focus on

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:02.380
this issue as a moral question

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.660
how many

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:04.739
believe

00:35:04.739 --> 00:35:07.299
that the right thing to do

00:35:07.299 --> 00:35:09.969
in the baby M case

00:35:09.969 --> 00:35:11.409
would have been to uphold

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:16.289
the contract, to enforce the contract?

00:35:16.289 --> 00:35:20.379
and how many think the right thing to
do would have been

00:35:20.379 --> 00:35:26.059
not to enforce that contract?

00:35:26.059 --> 00:35:29.140
so it's about the majority say enforce

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:30.669
so

00:35:30.669 --> 00:35:35.879
let's now hear the reasons that people have either
for enforcing or refusing to enforce this

00:35:35.879 --> 00:35:36.749
contract

00:35:36.749 --> 00:35:40.160
first from those, I want to hear from someone
in the majority,

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.150
why do you uphold the contract

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.109
why do you enforce it?

00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:51.109
who can offer a reason? yes. stand up.

00:35:57.339 --> 00:35:59.460
it's a binding contract

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.729
all the parties involved

00:36:02.729 --> 00:36:07.809
knew the terms of the contract before any action was
taken

00:36:07.809 --> 00:36:09.739
it's a voluntary agreement

00:36:09.739 --> 00:36:12.829
the mother knew what she was getting into

00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:18.609
all four are intelligent adults regardless of
formal education or whatever so

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:21.719
it makes sense if you know what you're getting into
beforehand and

00:36:21.719 --> 00:36:22.969
you make a promise

00:36:22.969 --> 00:36:27.650
you should uphold that promise in the end. Ok, a deal
is a deal in other words?

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:29.529
Exactly. And what's your name? Patrick

00:36:29.529 --> 00:36:32.849
is Patrick’s reason the reason that most of
you

00:36:32.849 --> 00:36:34.659
in the majority

00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:37.769
favored upholding the contract? yes?
 
0:36:37.769,0:36:38.969
all right now let's hear

00:36:38.969 --> 00:36:43.430
from someone who would not enforce the contract

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:50.430
what do you say to Patrick? Why not? Yes

00:36:51.929 --> 00:36:55.039
well I mean I agree I think contracts should
be upheld when

00:36:55.039 --> 00:36:57.630
all the parties know all the information
but

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.309
in this case I don't think

00:36:59.309 --> 00:37:01.369
there's a way a mother

00:37:01.369 --> 00:37:03.769
before the child exists

00:37:03.769 --> 00:37:04.989
could actually know

00:37:04.989 --> 00:37:08.199
how she's going to feel about that child

00:37:08.199 --> 00:37:10.890
so I don't think the mother actually had all
the information

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:13.529
she didn't know the person that was going
to be born

00:37:13.529 --> 00:37:15.510
and didn't know how much she would
love that person

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:17.109
so that's my argument

00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:18.950
so you would not, and what's your name?

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:20.080
Evan Wilson

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.759
Evan he says he would not uphold the contract
because

00:37:23.759 --> 00:37:26.569
when it was entered into

00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:30.309
the surrogate mother couldn't

00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:33.809
be expected to know in advance how she would
feel

00:37:33.809 --> 00:37:36.599
so she didn't really have

00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:38.060
the relevant information

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:40.819
when she made that contract

00:37:40.819 --> 00:37:42.799
who else

00:37:42.799 --> 00:37:49.799
who else would not uphold the contract?

00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:57.309
I think, I also think that a contact should
generally be uphold but I think

00:37:57.309 --> 00:38:01.489
that the child has an inalienable right to 

00:38:01.489 --> 00:38:02.349
its actual mother

00:38:03.729 --> 00:38:07.899
and I think that if that mother wants it then that  
child should have a 

00:38:07.899 --> 00:38:13.119
right to that mother. you mean the biological
mother not the adoptive mother. right.

00:38:13.119 --> 00:38:16.319
and why is that, first of all tell me your name. Anna.

00:38:16.319 --> 00:38:18.509
Anna, why is that Anna?

00:38:18.509 --> 00:38:21.069
because  I think that

00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:26.450
that bond that is created by nature is stronger than  
any bond that is created by

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:29.029
you know a contract.

00:38:29.029 --> 00:38:32.849
good thank you. Who else, yes.

00:38:32.849 --> 00:38:36.249
I disagree I don't think that a child has a

00:38:36.249 --> 00:38:38.709
inalienable right to her biological mother

00:38:38.709 --> 00:38:42.680
I think that adoption and surrogacy 
are both  trade offs

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.459
and I agree with the point made

00:38:45.459 --> 00:38:50.519
that day it's a voluntary agreement, an individual
made,

00:38:50.519 --> 00:38:52.439
and you can't

00:38:52.439 --> 00:38:54.509
apply coercion to this argument

00:38:54.509 --> 00:38:56.720
you can't apply the

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.959
objection from coercion to this argument.

00:38:59.959 --> 00:39:01.039
correct. what's your name?

00:39:01.039 --> 00:39:01.869
Kathleen

00:39:01.869 --> 00:39:03.529
Kathleen, what do you say to Evan,

00:39:03.529 --> 00:39:07.689
that though there may not have been, Evan
claimed that the consent was tainted

00:39:07.689 --> 00:39:08.950
not by coercion

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:12.259
but by lack of adequate information

00:39:12.259 --> 00:39:17.359
she couldn't have known the relevant information
namely, how she would feel about the child

00:39:17.359 --> 00:39:18.549
I don't think her emotion content plays into this

00:39:18.549 --> 00:39:23.329
I think the emotional content or her feelings
plays into this, I think in, you know, in a case

00:39:23.329 --> 00:39:25.939
of law, in the justice of this scenario,

00:39:25.939 --> 00:39:31.279
her change of feelings are not relevant
if I give up my child for adoption and then

00:39:31.279 --> 00:39:35.529
I decide later on that I really want that
child back

00:39:35.529 --> 00:39:37.150
too bad, it's a trade-off

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:39.690
it's a trade off that the mother has made.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:46.690
so a deal is a deal, you agree with Patrick? I agree
with Patrick, a deal is a deal, yes.

00:39:47.979 --> 00:39:49.749
good, yes. I would say that

00:39:49.749 --> 00:39:52.349
though I'm not really sure if I agree with 

00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:54.939
the idea that the child has a right to their mother

00:39:54.939 --> 00:39:58.569
I think the mother definitely has a right
to her child.

00:39:58.569 --> 00:40:05.089
and I also think there are some areas where market  
forces shouldn't necessarily penetrate, I think that

00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:06.519
the whole surrogate mother

00:40:06.519 --> 00:40:07.509
area

00:40:07.509 --> 00:40:08.200
smacks a little bit

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.849
of dealing in human beings

00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:12.589
it seems dehumanizing

00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:14.369
and it doesn't really seem right

00:40:14.369 --> 00:40:15.180
so

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.569
that's my main reason

00:40:16.569 --> 00:40:19.779
and what is could, tell us your name.

00:40:19.779 --> 00:40:20.619
I'm Andrew. Andrew.

00:40:20.619 --> 00:40:22.949
what is dehumanizing

00:40:22.949 --> 00:40:24.499
about

00:40:24.499 --> 00:40:25.989
buying and selling

00:40:25.989 --> 00:40:27.739
the right to a child

00:40:27.739 --> 00:40:30.769
for money, what is the humanizing about it?

00:40:30.769 --> 00:40:32.119
well because

00:40:32.119 --> 00:40:33.680
you're buying

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:33.930
someone's

00:40:33.859 --> 00:40:36.209
biological right

00:40:36.209 --> 00:40:38.729
I mean you can't

00:40:38.729 --> 00:40:39.349
and the law

00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:44.129
as it states you can't sell your own child
like were you to have a child

00:40:44.129 --> 00:40:46.959
I believe that the law prohibits you selling
it

00:40:46.959 --> 00:40:51.199
to another person. so this is like baby selling?

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:55.829
Right. To a certain extent, I mean though
there is a contract with another person, you've made

00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:57.099
agreements and whatnot

00:40:57.099 --> 00:41:01.660
there is an undeniable emotional bond that takes
place between a mother and child

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:06.749
and it's wrong to simply ignore this because you've
written out something contractually.

00:41:06.749 --> 00:41:09.779
you want to reply to Andrew? to stay there

00:41:09.779 --> 00:41:12.979
you point out that there is an undeniable emotional  
bond

00:41:12.979 --> 00:41:16.500
I feel like when in this situation
we're not necessarily against

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.239
adoption

00:41:18.239 --> 00:41:21.959
or surrogacy in itself we're just sort of pointing 
out

00:41:21.959 --> 00:41:23.760
the emotional differences

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.779
well but wait, it's easy to break everything down to  
just numbers and say

00:41:27.779 --> 00:41:30.579
well we have contracts like you're buying and selling a
car

00:41:30.579 --> 00:41:33.520
but there are underlying emotions I mean
you're dealing with people

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:38.090
I mean these are not objects to be bought and sold
but what about Andrew's claim that

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.900
this is like baby selling I believe that adoption and
surrogacy should be permitted whether I actually

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.109
will partake in it 

00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:48.140
is not really relevant but I think that
the government should, the government should

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:50.489
give its citizens the rights to

00:41:50.489 --> 00:41:56.839
allow for adoption and surrogacy. But adoption,
adoption is not according to.. Is adoption

00:41:56.839 --> 00:41:58.869
baby selling?

00:41:58.869 --> 00:41:59.640
well

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:01.509
do you think you should be able to

00:42:01.509 --> 00:42:05.079
to bid for a baby that's up for adoption

00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:06.859
that's Andrew's challenge

00:42:06.859 --> 00:42:11.379
Do I think that I should be able to bid for a baby?

00:42:11.379 --> 00:42:14.660
I'm not... sure.

00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.960
it's a market I mean,

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:19.150
I feel like the extent to which it's been
applied

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.199
I'm not sure if the government

00:42:21.199 --> 00:42:25.789
should be able to permit it and I have to think about  
it more but, 

00:42:25.789 --> 00:42:27.339
Alright fair enough, are you satisfied

00:42:27.339 --> 00:42:30.710
Andrew? well ya, I think surrogacy should
be permitted

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.720
I think that people can

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.709
do it

00:42:33.709 --> 00:42:36.260
but I don't think that it should be forced upon
people

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.800
that once a contract is signed it's absolutely
like

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:40.919
the end-all

00:42:40.919 --> 00:42:43.059
I think it's unenforceable

00:42:43.059 --> 00:42:47.180
so people should be free, Andrew, to enter into
these contracts

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.570
but it should not be enforceable in a court

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:50.819
not in a court no.

00:42:50.819 --> 00:42:56.109
who would like to turn on one side or the other

00:42:56.109 --> 00:43:00.779
I think I have an interesting perspective
on this because my brother was actually one

00:43:00.779 --> 00:43:03.529
of the people who donated to a sperm bank 

00:43:03.529 --> 00:43:05.750
and he was paid a very large amount of money

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:07.580
he was six feet tall, but not blond

00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.880
he had dimples though,

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:14.979
so he actually has, I'm an aunt now and he has a  
daughter

00:43:14.979 --> 00:43:19.240
she donated sperm to a lesbian couple in Oklahoma
and 

00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.740
he has have been contacted by them and he 
has seen pictures of his daughter

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:27.380
but he still does not feel an emotional bond
to his daughter

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:32.430
he just has a sense of curiosity about what
she looks like and what she's doing and how

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:33.339
she is

00:43:33.339 --> 00:43:36.220
he doesn't feel love for his

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.769
child

00:43:37.769 --> 00:43:41.739
so from this experience I think the bond
between a

00:43:41.739 --> 00:43:43.039
mother

00:43:43.039 --> 00:43:43.909
and a child

00:43:43.909 --> 00:43:48.259
cannot be compared to the bond between the
father and the child. That's really interesting.

00:43:48.259 --> 00:43:50.039
what's your name? Vivian.

00:43:50.039 --> 00:43:50.830
Vivian

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:56.319
so we've got the case of surrogacy, commercial
surrogacy

00:43:56.319 --> 00:44:01.759
and it's been compared to baby selling and
we've been exploring whether that analogy

00:44:01.759 --> 00:44:04.640
is apt and

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:07.939
it can also be compared, as you point
out

00:44:07.939 --> 00:44:10.499
to sperm selling

00:44:10.499 --> 00:44:12.049
but you're saying

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:14.059
that sperm selling

00:44:14.059 --> 00:44:18.629
and baby selling or even surrogacy are

00:44:18.629 --> 00:44:21.599
very different. Because they're unequal services.

00:44:21.599 --> 00:44:23.669
they're unequal services

00:44:23.669 --> 00:44:24.909
and that's because

00:44:24.909 --> 00:44:28.769
Vivian you say that the tie, the bond,

00:44:28.769 --> 00:44:31.759
yes and also the time investment 

00:44:31.759 --> 00:44:34.839
that's given by a mother, nine months

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:36.290
cannot be compared to

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.799
the man, you know going into a sperm bank

00:44:38.799 --> 00:44:40.779
looking at pornography

00:44:40.779 --> 00:44:47.779
you know, and depositing into a cup. I don't think  
those are equal

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:56.160
good. Alright so we, Because that's what happens in a  
sperm bank.

00:44:56.759 --> 00:45:00.879
alright so, this is really interesting we have

00:45:00.879 --> 00:45:03.769
notice the arguments that have come out so
far,

00:45:03.769 --> 00:45:05.229
the objections

00:45:05.229 --> 00:45:07.159
to surrogacy

00:45:07.159 --> 00:45:09.459
the objections to 

00:45:09.459 --> 00:45:11.259
enforcing that contract,

00:45:11.259 --> 00:45:13.430
are of at least two kinds

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:15.569
there was the objection

00:45:15.569 --> 00:45:17.140
about tainted consent

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:18.179
this time

00:45:18.179 --> 00:45:19.869
not because of

00:45:19.869 --> 00:45:22.339
coercion or implicit coercion

00:45:22.339 --> 00:45:23.869
but because of

00:45:23.869 --> 00:45:26.009
imperfect or 

00:45:26.009 --> 00:45:28.159
flawed information

00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:31.079
so tainted or flawed consent

00:45:31.079 --> 00:45:33.519
can arise either

00:45:33.519 --> 00:45:36.469
because of coercion or because of

00:45:36.469 --> 00:45:38.409
a lack of 

00:45:38.409 --> 00:45:39.590
relevant information

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:42.459
at least according to one argument that we've
heard

00:45:42.459 --> 00:45:44.589
and then a second objection

00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:47.429
to enforcing the surrogacy contract

00:45:47.429 --> 00:45:49.479
was that it was somehow

00:45:49.479 --> 00:45:51.070
the humanizing.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.880
now when this case was decided by the court

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.839
what did they say

00:45:56.839 --> 00:45:59.039
about these arguments?

00:45:59.039 --> 00:46:00.999
the lower court 

00:46:00.999 --> 00:46:04.139
ruled that the contract was enforceable

00:46:04.139 --> 00:46:07.469
neither party had a superior bargaining position

00:46:07.469 --> 00:46:11.489
a price for the service was struck and a bargain
was reached

00:46:11.489 --> 00:46:13.689
one side didn't forced the other

00:46:13.689 --> 00:46:15.770
neither had disproportionate

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:17.130
bargaining power

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:20.470
then it went to the new Jersey supreme court

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:23.759
and what did they do

00:46:23.759 --> 00:46:27.489
they said this contract is not enforceable

00:46:27.489 --> 00:46:29.059
they did

00:46:29.059 --> 00:46:32.309
grant custody

00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:33.749
to Mister Stern

00:46:33.749 --> 00:46:37.350
as the father because they thought that would
be in the best interest of the child

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:39.319
but they restored

00:46:39.319 --> 00:46:40.619
the rights

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:42.479
of Mary Beth Whitehead

00:46:42.479 --> 00:46:43.849
and left it to

00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:47.139
lower courts to decide exactly what the visitation

00:46:47.139 --> 00:46:49.189
rights should be

00:46:49.189 --> 00:46:52.719
they invoked two different kinds of reasons

00:46:52.719 --> 00:46:55.649
along the lines that Andrew proposed

00:46:55.649 --> 00:46:56.579
first

00:46:56.579 --> 00:46:59.859
there was not sufficiently informed consent

00:46:59.859 --> 00:47:01.090
the court argued

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:04.920
under the contract the natural mother is irrevocably  
committed 

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:08.029
before she knows the strength of her bond
with her child

00:47:08.029 --> 00:47:09.030
she never makes

00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:12.099
a truly voluntary informed decision

00:47:12.099 --> 00:47:15.109
for any decision prior to the baby's birth

00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:17.129
is, in the most important sense,

00:47:17.129 --> 00:47:19.929
uninformed. that was the court

00:47:19.929 --> 00:47:21.089
then

00:47:21.089 --> 00:47:22.730
the court also

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.489
made a version of the second argument

00:47:25.489 --> 00:47:28.140
against commodification

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.469
in this kind of case

00:47:30.469 --> 00:47:31.109
this is this

00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:33.519
the sale of a  child the court said

00:47:33.519 --> 00:47:34.839
or at the very least

00:47:34.839 --> 00:47:38.899
the sale of a  mother's right to her child

00:47:38.899 --> 00:47:44.449
whatever idealism may motivate the participants,
the profit motive predominate, permeates and

00:47:44.449 --> 00:47:45.310
ultimately

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:45.879
governs

00:47:45.879 --> 00:47:47.549
the transaction

00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:52.779
and so regardless the court said, regardless
of any argument about consent or flawed consent

00:47:52.779 --> 00:47:54.789
or full information

00:47:54.789 --> 00:47:57.360
there are some things in a civilized society

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.989
that money can't buy, that's what the courts
said

00:47:59.989 --> 00:48:03.309
in voiding this contract

00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:07.229
well what about these two arguments

00:48:07.229 --> 00:48:07.640
against

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:12.259
the extension of markets

00:48:12.259 --> 00:48:12.960
to procreation

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:18.079
and to reproduction

00:48:18.079 --> 00:48:21.049
how persuasive are they?

00:48:21.049 --> 00:48:23.359
there was, it's true,

00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:30.239
a voluntary agreement a contract struck
between William Stern and Mary Beth Whitehead

00:48:30.239 --> 00:48:36.299
but there are at least two ways that consent
can be other than truly free

00:48:36.299 --> 00:48:37.279
first

00:48:37.279 --> 00:48:40.010
if people are pressured or coerced

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:42.119
to give their agreement

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:46.819
and second

00:48:46.819 --> 00:48:50.769
if their consent is not truly informed

00:48:50.769 --> 00:48:54.469
and in the case of surrogacy the courts said

00:48:54.469 --> 00:48:57.219
a mother can't know

00:48:57.219 --> 00:48:59.559
even one who already has kids of her own,

00:48:59.559 --> 00:49:00.769
what it would be like

00:49:00.769 --> 00:49:06.400
to bear a child and give it up for pay.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.079
so in order to assess

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:10.749
criticism, objection number one,

00:49:10.749 --> 00:49:13.189
we have to figure out

00:49:13.189 --> 00:49:15.799
just how free

00:49:15.799 --> 00:49:21.680
does a voluntary exchange have to be with
respect to the bargaining power

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.759
and equal information

00:49:23.759 --> 00:49:25.719
question number one.

00:49:25.719 --> 00:49:27.459
how do we assess

00:49:27.459 --> 00:49:29.239
the second objection?

00:49:29.239 --> 00:49:31.569
the second objection

00:49:31.569 --> 00:49:34.679
is more elusive, it's more difficult

00:49:34.679 --> 00:49:37.309
Andrew acknowledged this right?

00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:41.269
what does it mean to say there's something
dehumanizing

00:49:41.269 --> 00:49:43.429
to make

00:49:43.429 --> 00:49:44.729
childbearing

00:49:44.729 --> 00:49:46.550
a market

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.660
transaction?

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:50.039
well one of the philosophers

00:49:50.039 --> 00:49:54.299
we read on this subject Elizabeth Anderson

00:49:54.299 --> 00:49:59.759
tries to give some bring some philosophical
clarity to the unease

00:49:59.759 --> 00:50:02.890
that Andrew articulated

00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:05.789
she said by requiring the surrogate mother

00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:07.080
to repress

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.839
whatever parental love she feels for the child

00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:12.380
surrogacy

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:16.919
contracts convert women's labor into a form
of alienated labor

00:50:16.919 --> 00:50:19.209
the surrogate’s labor is alienated

00:50:19.209 --> 00:50:22.309
because she must divert it from the end

00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:23.640
from the and

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.699
which the social practices of pregnancy

00:50:26.699 --> 00:50:28.409
rightly promote,

00:50:28.409 --> 00:50:30.320
namely an emotional bond

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.640
with her child

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:39.609
so what Anderson is suggesting is that

00:50:39.609 --> 00:50:41.779
certain goods

00:50:41.779 --> 00:50:44.510
should not be treated as open to use

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:46.329
or to profit

00:50:46.329 --> 00:50:49.160
certain goods are properly valued

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.979
in ways other than use

00:50:51.979 --> 00:50:54.149
what are other

00:50:54.149 --> 00:50:58.130
ways of valuing and treating?

00:50:58.130 --> 00:51:00.809
good that should not be open to use?

00:51:00.809 --> 00:51:01.690
Anderson says

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.379
there are many,

00:51:03.379 --> 00:51:05.119
respect,

00:51:05.119 --> 00:51:06.309
appreciation,

00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:08.449
love,

00:51:08.449 --> 00:51:10.269
honor, awe, sanctity

00:51:10.269 --> 00:51:13.289
there are many modes of valuation

00:51:13.289 --> 00:51:15.559
beyond use

00:51:15.559 --> 00:51:18.829
and certain goods are not properly

00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:20.400
valued

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.010
if they're treated

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:25.059
simply as objects of use.

00:51:25.059 --> 00:51:28.319
how do we go about evaluating that argument
of Anderson?

00:51:28.319 --> 00:51:30.650
in a way it takes us back to the debate

00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:34.789
we had with utilitarianism

00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:35.820
is use

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.900
the only, in utility

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:38.849
is use,

00:51:38.849 --> 00:51:40.809
the only proper way

00:51:40.809 --> 00:51:42.869
of treating goods?

00:51:42.869 --> 00:51:44.529
including life

00:51:44.529 --> 00:51:46.459
military service

00:51:46.459 --> 00:51:47.619
procreation

00:51:47.619 --> 00:51:49.659
childbearing?

00:51:49.659 --> 00:51:51.390
and if not,

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:54.209
how do we figure out

00:51:54.209 --> 00:51:55.880
how can we determine

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:58.029
what modes of valuation

00:51:58.029 --> 00:51:59.150
are fitting

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:01.049
are appropriate

00:52:01.049 --> 00:52:03.499
to those goods

00:52:03.499 --> 00:52:06.959
several years ago there but the scandal surrounding
a doctor

00:52:06.959 --> 00:52:12.469
an infertility specialist in Virginia named
Cecil Jacobson

00:52:12.469 --> 00:52:15.799
he didn't have a donor catalog

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:21.259
because unknown to his patients, all of the sperm he  
used to inseminate his patients

00:52:21.259 --> 00:52:23.479
came from one donor

00:52:23.479 --> 00:52:27.209
doctor Jacobson himself.

00:52:27.209 --> 00:52:30.990
at least one woman who testified in court
was unnerved

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:32.220
at how much

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:34.119
her newborn daughter

00:52:34.119 --> 00:52:38.149
looked just like him

00:52:38.149 --> 00:52:40.859
now it's possible to condemn

00:52:40.859 --> 00:52:44.289
doctor Jacobson for failing to inform the
women

00:52:44.289 --> 00:52:45.909
in advance

00:52:45.909 --> 00:52:48.679
that would be the argument about consent

00:52:48.679 --> 00:52:50.889
the columnist Ellen Goodman

00:52:50.889 --> 00:52:54.289
described the bizarre scenario as follows

00:52:54.289 --> 00:52:58.299
doctor Jacobson, she wrote, gave his infertility
business

00:52:58.299 --> 00:53:01.509
the personal touch

00:53:01.509 --> 00:53:03.390
but now the rest of us,

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:04.939
she wrote,

00:53:04.939 --> 00:53:07.930
are in for a round of second thoughts

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:11.859
about sperm donation

00:53:11.859 --> 00:53:15.140
Goodman concluded that fatherhood should
be something you do

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.140
not something you donate,

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:20.079
and I think what she was doing

00:53:20.079 --> 00:53:23.660
and what the philosopher Elizabeth Anderson
is doing

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:28.879
and what Andrew was suggesting with this argument
about dehumanization

00:53:28.879 --> 00:53:33.780
is pondering whether there are certain goods
that money shouldn't buy

00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.199
not just because of tainted consent

00:53:36.199 --> 00:53:38.299
but also perhaps

00:53:38.199 --> 00:53:40.299
because certain goods are properly

00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:42.219
valued

00:53:42.219 --> 00:53:43.380
in a way a higher

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:44.699
than mere use

00:53:44.699 --> 00:53:49.719
those at least are the questions we're going
to pursue with the help of some philosophers

00:53:49.719 --> 00:53:56.719
