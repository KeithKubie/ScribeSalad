00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:07.530
MALE SPEAKER: Good
afternoon and welcome to

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.520
Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.880
Today it is my
privilege and pleasure

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.800
to introduce two guests from
the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.000
Managing Director, Mark
Volpe, and Music Director,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.650
Andris Nelsons.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.700
This is the part
where I usually do

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.910
a lot of talking
about the guests,

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.290
but really isn't music
what this is all about?

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.128
So hold on just one second.

00:00:42.128 --> 00:00:44.104
[MUSIC - RESPIGHI, "PINES OF
 ROME"]

00:02:28.712 --> 00:02:30.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.980
MARK VOLPE: For those
who are curious,

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.670
that was Respighi's
"Pines of Rome."

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.750
That was the inaugural
concert of Andris

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.190
as our music director
for the Boston Symphony.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.150
And that concert was seen
all over the United States

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.210
on Public Broadcasting
and all over the world

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.260
through a variety of networks.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.207
So it's launched an
incredible relationship

00:03:08.207 --> 00:03:09.290
or an incredible marriage.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.640
It's now over a year,
little over a year old.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.456
So what I thought we could
do-- and obviously we're

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:17.080
always curious in
what you're thinking.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.700
But what I thought I'd do
is ask Andris a little bit

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.220
about his background, a little
bit about the art of conducting

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.060
as well as the
discipline of conducting,

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.170
and then possibly open it up
for questions from you all.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.990
So I'll start just a little
bit about where-- you know,

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.024
I'll ask Andris to talk
about his earliest exposure.

00:03:39.024 --> 00:03:41.190
I think you conducted your
first Ring Cycle when you

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.444
were five years old in Riga.

00:03:42.444 --> 00:03:42.944
No.

00:03:42.944 --> 00:03:44.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.680
But your first exposure to
classical music was Wagner.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.090
Your mother was a musicologist.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.860
But she took you to
a concert in Riga.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.300
Can you talk a little bit
about that experience?

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.133
ANDRIS NELSONS: Yes.

00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:01.760
It was very interesting
because you know,

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.560
for many, many
kids and children,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.170
you know, the first musical
experience, listening

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.260
is probably a bit
milder than mine

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.280
was because I was
taken to the opera

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.600
and I was only five years old.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.997
And it was Wagner's
"Tannhauser," you know.

00:04:16.997 --> 00:04:26.680
Four and a half hour long opera
with not the most happy finish

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.760
of the opera, as we know.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.230
But I was so amazed
and so touched

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.240
by the great, great music
of Wagner on one hand.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.410
And from the other hand,
being in the opera theater,

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.010
experiencing lights
went down and all

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.600
of this mystic atmosphere.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.990
Conductor coming on and
raising his hands and something

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.392
starts to sound and happen
and then this beautiful music.

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:53.850
And then, you know,
poor Tannhauser

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.320
died at the end of
his crying, you know.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.800
So it was a very big
emotional show for me.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.640
You know, I couldn't
sleep afterwards.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.892
And then you know.

00:05:04.892 --> 00:05:07.350
MARK VOLPE: But you went from
that and you started singing.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.740
And then you played
the trumpet as--

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.810
and continues to
play the trumpet.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.170
It's-- Andris now has
a-- what do you have?

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.900
A C trumpet?

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.890
And now you-- did you just
get your E flat trumpet?

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.080
Different-- trumpets
come in different keys.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.820
And so-- before every
rehearsal and concert

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.710
you hear him practicing
and playing little things.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.160
And the BSO players
want everyone

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.930
to understand that
it's not them.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.328
I don't know if
that's a commentary

00:05:32.328 --> 00:05:35.572
on your current quality
level, but-- but anyway, so

00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:37.280
talk a little bit
about how you picked up

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.450
the trumpet on your
whole-- the Russian system,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.280
their Latvian system
of music education.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.710
ANDRIS NELSONS: Well, you know,
since that first experience--

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.940
firstly of course, my
parents are musicians.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.510
So I was always
surrounded by music.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.110
One or other way I always
heard music around.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.660
Is it Bach Renaissance music,
Bach, or choir singing.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.440
Was always around.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.140
But of course, this
first influence

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.850
of Wagner opera age of
five made this huge impact.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.220
And then I-- that
the same year I

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.860
started to-- the piano studies.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.810
A music school.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.540
So I studied for-- until age
of 12, I studied as a pianist.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.290
And then I started
to study trumpet.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.700
And trumpet age of 12.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.520
And then I-- as part of
the early-- studied singing

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.640
in music school and trumpet.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.350
And then it all got that I got
the audition, won the audition.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.414
And I got a job at age
of 17 in national opera.

00:06:33.414 --> 00:06:35.580
At the same opera I saw
this "Tannhauser," you know,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.860
in the same opera house.

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.850
And I got a job.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.070
And I was so happy of course.

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:45.650
And I played there for five
years as a trumpet player.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.610
And in the meantime I also
partly studied conducting.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.870
And--

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.520
MARK VOLPE: How do
you study conducting?

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.580
ANDRIS NELSONS: You know, the
conducting is a very mystical,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.850
I think for one side, a
very mystical profession.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:03.890
As you can see, it-- you can
see so many different conductors

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.420
doing the same piece
but so different ways.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.870
It's all either technical waving
of arms or facial expressions

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.806
or tempo or anything.

00:07:15.806 --> 00:07:16.930
But they are all different.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.250
And it's not because necessarily
wanting to be different,

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.190
but it means there
is-- professional

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.920
conducting from one
hand is very mystical

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.880
because of communication
with people.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.540
You communicate in a
concert without words.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.210
You just communicate
the gestures

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.132
and you assume that the
orchestra understand

00:07:38.132 --> 00:07:38.840
what do you mean.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.920
And of course or not
understand. [LAUGHS]

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:48.730
Because in your gestures, in
your energy, in your facial,

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.540
you know, body
expressions, you encourage

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:59.330
them one or other character
or dynamic or anything what is

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.660
present in music at that point.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:04.034
And of course, all of that
happens after intensive work

00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:05.450
in the rehearsal,
of course, where

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.490
you make your relationship
with orchestra

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.180
and you build the
interpretation in rehearsal.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.790
And I think it's
mystic because you

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:19.590
as a conductor don't perform
any note in the concert.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.590
They are all playing.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:27.670
So in the meantime, orchestra
could do without-- I mean,

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.450
conductor can't do
without orchestra.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.500
Orchestra could do
without conductor.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.440
MARK VOLPE: Conductor
without orchestra

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.106
is just moving your arms looking
like, well, never mind, a crazy

00:08:35.106 --> 00:08:36.851
person.

00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:39.100
ANDRIS NELSONS: So this is--
that's why it's mystical.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.640
But there is also a very
practical and very important

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.670
part of studying conducting.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.170
You can of course-- there are
many things you can and should

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:49.630
study and everyone studies.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.510
The technique.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.420
You read about the composers.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.440
You study the score.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.880
You analyze.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:57.950
You compare.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.120
You develop.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.630
You think.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:01.240
You don't sleep nights.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.750
And because you're not
knowing what to do.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.180
All of these things happen
when you develop as a conductor

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.360
and as a musicians generally.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.440
And of course you develop
your skills as a conductor.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.520
But I think that most important
is this mystical chemistry what

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.650
happens between
conductor and orchestra,

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.590
and then of course conductor
and orchestra and audience.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.860
Because this is another
extremely important,

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.620
crucially important part
of what we do in music.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:35.780
And if that happens,
there is a miracle.

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.580
And if it doesn't happen, we
sometimes can't explain why,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.790
but if you go to the
concerts and you think,

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.740
oh, it did not touch me.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.787
I didn't-- obviously,
we did something wrong.

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:50.120
If you go to the concert and
after the concert you feel,

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.170
I didn't understand
anything, but I feel great

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:55.150
because it was so
emotional or so depressive

00:09:55.150 --> 00:10:01.130
or so-- whatever emotional
reaction you got-- if you got

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:05.040
back fulfilled
with a feeling, it

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.650
means that we did right things.

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.520
So, you know, I think
this is so much, I think,

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:14.340
what I think the
profession of conducting

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.384
or actually the essence of
music really brings to us.

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:19.925
MARK VOLPE: But
what's interesting is

00:10:19.925 --> 00:10:21.591
if you're a violinist,
you're a pianist,

00:10:21.591 --> 00:10:24.460
you can go in a practice
room and you can sit and play

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.510
scales and arpeggios
and then repertoire.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.184
But if you're a
conductor, you can study

00:10:30.184 --> 00:10:32.350
and you can learn your
theory and your music history

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:33.360
and all that.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.520
But the mysticism,
the psychology,

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:39.010
the leadership in
terms of-- you can only

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:40.520
do that with an orchestra.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.130
So it's-- when did you
start conducting orchestras?

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:46.940
And what was that like for you?

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.630
And were you surprised?

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:50.940
I mean you obviously
were a serious musician

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:52.399
and a family of musicians.

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:54.940
But when you actually get up on
a podium for the first time--

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:56.670
you have any recollection
when you got up

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.870
on a-- in front of an orchestra?

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.870
ANDRIA NELSONS: Yeah, the
first time I remember.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.060
That was a-- you know,
you absolutely right.

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:06.530
The first step, of
course, is studying

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:10.340
the score and the
technique and you prepare.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:12.810
But it does not absolutely
guarantee that you actually

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:14.540
can be a conductor
and if you would

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.150
come in front of the
orchestra or it would work.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.760
You don't know it
until the moment

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.990
when actually first time come
in front of the orchestra.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.410
And I experienced it.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.202
It was at age of 17.

00:11:26.202 --> 00:11:27.410
It was high school orchestra.

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.780
I was playing myself
in that orchestra.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.450
The conductor who actually was
my teacher, my first teacher,

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.640
did not come to rehearsal
for some reason.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.840
And we thought,
well-- I actually

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:44.350
thought, why should
be [LAUGHS] go home?

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.600
I should-- oh, let's rehearse.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.330
I know the piece because
I'm studying conducting.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:50.974
Let's rehearse.

00:11:50.974 --> 00:11:52.390
It was Beethoven's
First Symphony.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.810
I remember.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:57.550
And I went on the
podium and I felt--

00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.421
I felt so, so much at home.

00:11:59.421 --> 00:11:59.920
You know?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.086
I can't explain the feeling.

00:12:01.086 --> 00:12:05.490
It's not because of feeling
of, oh, now I'm on podium,

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.050
so I can say some
things and these things

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.260
have to be done because
the way I'm saying.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:14.520
It's not anything
to do with power

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:20.780
or-- but the joy of sharing
what I feel about music

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.110
with these musicians
and the chance

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.630
to express what I felt about
that music, in that case,

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.900
Beethoven, was so fascinating
that I thought, yes.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:34.880
Now, even after have studied,
have been three years

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:39.040
since I studied my technique
since that moment I first

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.940
conducted orchestra
in rehearsal.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.280
But then I only
realized, yes, I want

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.640
to continue studying conducting.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.440
I want to become a conductor.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.400
Because I think
before experiencing,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.660
you can't really say whether
you actually have the ability

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.740
to come in front of
orchestra, because it's

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.070
connected, so many things.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:08.010
Psychology and simply when
you prepare for rehearsal,

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:08.630
you know.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.420
You can prepare
and you can think

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.110
what you will say to the
orchestra, the musicians.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:16.950
But when that moment comes,
whether some people get very

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.010
shy, they can't-- you
know, they shaking,

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:22.440
they can't say anything because
it-- and they think, oh my god,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.670
you know, I was so prepared.

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:24.350
I can't do anything.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.920
Or opposite.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.596
You know, there are some
people who think, oh, he

00:13:27.596 --> 00:13:28.720
would never be a conductor.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.740
I mean, I would--
I would think--

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.240
see people thought about
me that I-- because I was

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.310
and I am still
basically a shy person.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.125
I'm not a person
who likes to, you

00:13:38.125 --> 00:13:41.257
know-- I'm really a shy person.

00:13:41.257 --> 00:13:42.840
I think everyone was
really surprised,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.130
they saw, you conducting?

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.340
You know.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.505
But-- and I was and when--

00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:50.209
MARK VOLPE: Did that
include your mother or no?

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:51.750
ANDRIS NELSONS: On
the podium, I felt

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.860
that I can express
myself as a musician

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.750
through conducting the best way
because I forget about myself.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.320
I'm not shy.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.600
I just think about music.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.160
And I enjoy sharing
what I feel about music.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:10.720
And I enjoy actually the
feeling of this great teamwork

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.550
because we see-- for
me it's a teamwork.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.420
You know, conductor,
orchestra, musicians

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:19.500
and to interfere to-- to
work together, you know.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.465
That was--

00:14:20.465 --> 00:14:22.340
MARK VOLPE: But one of
the things you said,

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.050
you know, you know
right away when

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.850
a conductor has done
his preparations

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:32.130
and has a few standard
stock things they want

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.720
to share with the orchestra.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.300
But orchestras
actually-- speaking

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.050
of someone who played
in orchestra and you

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.490
played in orchestras.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:42.240
That's much less effective than
someone who's in the moment

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.307
and reacting to what
was going on stage.

00:14:44.307 --> 00:14:46.140
Because sometimes you
prepare for something.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.740
You think there's always a few
passages in all these pieces

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:50.970
that are tricky,
that are rhythmically

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:55.140
tricky or harmonically difficult
and in terms of balance

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.100
and all of that.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.960
And some orchestras-- you're
prepared to correct something

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.840
and it's perfect.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.749
And then the conductor
still corrects it.

00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:03.790
ANDRIS NELSONS: Yes, yes.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.010
MARK VOLPE: You know,
what-- you know, I mean.

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.566
And you-- like they were so
prepared for that moment,

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:08.690
they can't help themselves.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.010
And one of the great-- you
know, I hear this from all

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.046
the orchestras in Europe
and that work with you,

00:15:15.046 --> 00:15:16.670
is that you're
absolutely in the moment

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.720
and you're-- whatever's
happening is something

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.590
you've inspired, but
it's not something

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:28.230
that's so premeditated
that it isn't effective.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.340
Talk about-- a few
questions that came to me.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:33.500
What's going on-- I mean,
these are all scientists.

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.770
So they're all thinking.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.490
What are you thinking about
when we do our Google plays?

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:42.640
The Malher 6, the Bartok
"Miraculous Mandarin",

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.370
the Tchaikovsky Sixth Symphony.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.810
What's going on-- we're
speaking, "Pines of Rome."

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.975
What's going on in your head?

00:15:49.975 --> 00:15:51.350
ANDRIS NELSONS:
You know, I think

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:57.710
it's very interesting because
for one hand of course,

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:04.130
music is so directly connected
to our emotional world

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.880
and what we feel about
music, whether it's

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:10.600
sad or happy or
loud or aggressive

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.410
or-- you have all
ranges of music.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:19.470
And of course that
you immediately,

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.850
your body reflects to
all of these feelings.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:29.340
But if you analyze more,
then actually the human body

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:33.720
is a biological-- there's
a certain mathematics

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.690
and a huge science involved.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:39.480
Of course, what-- we
thought, what is human being?

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.230
MARK VOLPE: It starts
with your heartbeat.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.480
ANDRIS NELSONS: You know,
but it's-- but I think still

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.470
it's for us is,
for musicians is,

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:53.094
do we want to touch the hearts
of the listeners or musicians

00:16:53.094 --> 00:16:54.510
on the stage and
of the listeners?

00:16:54.510 --> 00:17:05.109
And what happens in my head,
it's-- I am trying to imagine

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.225
as deeply as I can how the
composer-- what we perform,

00:17:08.225 --> 00:17:12.500
who we perform each
night-- either it's Mahler

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:16.900
or Tchaikovsky what we
already or we already--

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.839
it's already on Google Play or
on many other things which we

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:24.079
will-- will be possible also
to hear for Boston Symphony

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.020
on Google Play.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.910
But any other composer,
I imagine that?

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.720
I'm living a life
of that composer

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.100
on that day when it was
performed or composed.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:36.440
And that night
when we perform, I

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.180
have a feeling that the
piece was composed yesterday

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.240
and we are premiering
in the piece.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.150
And also all these emotions
come through the head.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.730
And what is the piece about?

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:52.780
What the composer experienced
in his life at that time.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:57.030
So it's a huge emotional
and intellectual baggage

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.400
what you experience
being, at least in your--

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.670
in my mind and my body.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:04.980
And of course,
when performing it,

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:10.010
you-- this is a
mystic how you get it

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.160
out of your body to the-- to
transfer to the musicians.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:17.010
And that's where,
of course, it's

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:21.100
a combination of brilliant
fantastic orchestras, Boston

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.300
Symphony Orchestra.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.100
Our brilliant relationship
with the orchestra,

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.900
our trust to each other,
trusting the professionality.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.880
Also, trusting human
musicality and also

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.360
their trust in my subjective
vision about the piece.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.240
So it's all, again, teamwork.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:43.520
But there is also not-- it's
not like a exaggerate democracy

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.760
in terms of, anyone can
do whatever you feel.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.470
Because then it's all chaos.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:53.160
So it's-- I think we all are
focusing our minds and I think

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.720
the engine has to come from
me, that we are focusing

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.120
on the composer's idea, what
the composer want to present.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.470
MARK VOLPE: But
how do you balance

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:07.710
the need for collective
thinking, but yet

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.640
you don't want to stymie the
individual personalities,

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.530
especially in solos?

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:16.760
So how does that-- you try
to establish a culture,

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.312
a way of doing it, and then you
let them give a-- you give them

00:19:20.312 --> 00:19:21.020
a little freedom.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:22.080
You give them-- how--

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.399
ANDRIS NELSONS: Yeah,
because every musician--

00:19:24.399 --> 00:19:25.940
I mean, they are--
or the orchestras,

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.690
they've studied many years.

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:28.940
Some 20 and then more.

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:29.440
And played.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.790
Some were playing for
already, you know, 50 years.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.420
So-- and they've played
it so many times.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:42.080
So you can't-- you know, I
think it's a giving and taking

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.580
constantly.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.030
So when you are the conductor,
you play some certain place,

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.460
you conduct.

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.350
Let's say it's a first oboe
or first trumpet or cello,

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.220
there is a solo moment.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:58.400
And I personally listen, like
listen to the soloist, how

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:02.540
he or she presents the
phrasing or-- and I listen

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.100
and I say, and I often
think, oh that's great.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.850
I will follow her
or his heartbeat.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.380
And then again, I take
initiative a little later.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.900
And then sometimes
maybe I suggest, well,

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.800
maybe let's try to go that
route together or-- you know,

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.340
this is a constant
giving and taking

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.590
and respecting and searching
together and trusting.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:31.270
It's somehow-- and
psychologically feeling when do

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.950
they need you as a conductor?

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:34.880
When do they need the beat?

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.494
And when they don't need
to be disturbed, you know.

00:20:37.494 --> 00:20:38.410
It's very interesting.

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.350
There's a great
conductor, Karajan, told--

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:45.310
you know, it's at least like
riding a horse, horse jumping,

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:45.810
you know.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:49.055
You don't have-- I don't ride
the horse, so I can't tell--

00:20:49.055 --> 00:20:50.430
MARK VOLPE: We're
not encouraging

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:52.900
you to jump on horses
either, if that [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:53.730
ANDRIS NELSONS: So
when you conduct,

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.700
it's when, you know,
you riding the horse.

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:56.600
MARK VOLPE: Rhythm.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.910
ANDRIS NELSONS: And then
you have this barrier.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:00.660
And then you have to
find the right moment

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:02.360
where you push
the horse in order

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.120
to-- because the horse is
jumping himself of course.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.709
But you have to
give the-- is it?

00:21:07.709 --> 00:21:08.500
Or is it right to--

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:09.208
MARK VOLPE: Yeah.

00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:10.000
You pull back and--

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:10.999
ANDRIS NELSONS: Go back.

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:13.170
And then he-- if you
constantly pull the horse,

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:15.044
he will throw out
you from the back.

00:21:15.044 --> 00:21:16.710
And the same he does
with the orchestra.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:21.720
If you constantly are
disturbing the orchestra,

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.930
but not in the moments
when they really need you,

00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:27.900
you-- they don't need the
conductor at that point.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.220
And it's so difficult. I
think it takes all your life

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:34.770
to really find where is this
moment where they really

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:39.870
need you as a conductor in
terms of purely technically

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.710
beating and also more
emotional support

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.540
and where are the moments
where you stepping out?

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.070
Not out.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:51.400
But stepping aside
and letting things--

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:57.040
and in initiative, individuality
of each orchestra position

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:57.840
come forward.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:02.050
And then again, where you take
initiative to take the-- all

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.640
the complex
individualities together.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:10.140
So it's a very confusing,
exciting, mystical and the--

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.970
also, scientistic, I--
in that sense, I find,

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:18.680
because it is to do
with the heartbeat.

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:25.380
And the heartbeat goes
according to our inner state

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:31.400
of-- if you are excited,
obviously it goes fast.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.810
If you are-- your time is
comes to leave this world,

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.710
obviously it goes
a little slower.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:39.650
And so on, you know.

00:22:39.650 --> 00:22:40.983
MARK VOLPE: Eventually it stops.

00:22:40.983 --> 00:22:41.990
That's the bad moment.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.807
ANDRIS NELSONS: You know, there
is a-- and the music same.

00:22:44.807 --> 00:22:46.640
You know, the music
gets agitated of course.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.410
Your heartbeat was faster and
then it's-- so, in that sense,

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:53.530
it's not mathematical,
I believe.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.820
But it is scientistic.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.320
Scien--?

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:56.700
What is the word?

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.658
MARK VOLPE: Scientific.

00:22:57.658 --> 00:23:01.840
ANDRIS NELSONS: It's scientific
because already biological,

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.420
the body, it is a science.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.800
It's not mathematical
maybe in that way.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:09.320
But it is scientistic.

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.170
MARK VOLPE: Close enough.

00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:15.880
It's interesting because for--
relatively speaking, I mean,

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.500
we had last week on the
podium, Christoph von

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.470
Dohnanyi who is 86.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:22.582
And we were talking
about you and talking

00:23:22.582 --> 00:23:23.540
about different things.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.570
And I've talked to
Haitink who's 86.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:30.220
It took them awhile to learn
how to trust orchestras.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.980
And you know right
away and the orchestra

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.770
knows right away when they're
not trusted, you know,

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.269
when everything has
to be controlled

00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:38.225
and there's no--
as you know, there

00:23:38.225 --> 00:23:40.840
are passages-- you know
better than anybody--

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.900
that they need you.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:45.302
But there are other-- and to
your grade, it's a maturity.

00:23:45.302 --> 00:23:47.760
Talk a little bit-- I mean,
you walk through this building,

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:51.130
you get a sense of
a Google culture.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:54.330
We talk a little bit with
our board about culture

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.400
at the Boston Symphony.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.670
Every orchestra-- I mean,
you were just in Amsterdam.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:23:59.500
You conduct Berlin.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.130
You conduct in London.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:06.030
Talk a little bit about the
culture that you are trying

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:10.350
to create and the trust and
all that and relationship

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:12.730
because it's-- when
you think about it--

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.450
I don't want to alarm
you-- but you know,

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.540
we're obviously
a sonic art form,

00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:22.250
yet the most important
person makes no sound,

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:29.620
and so has to inspire or has to
motivate people to do what you

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.120
want.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.360
Talk a little bit about how
you create that kind of--

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.860
ANDRIS NELSONS: You know it's,
again very, I think, individual

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:38.360
in a way.

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.735
And I think it's probably--
I mean, as a huge company

00:24:43.735 --> 00:24:49.660
as Google of course, it's more
than 120 people who-- I mean,

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.441
I have orchestras
120 or something.

00:24:51.441 --> 00:24:52.440
They have bigger chorus.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.100
And so-- but anyway,
they-- I think--

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.600
MARK VOLPE: Google's
bigger than us.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.744
We'll concede that right away.

00:24:57.744 --> 00:24:59.017
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:59.017 --> 00:25:00.850
ANDRIS NELSONS: Well,
I'm think-- but anyone

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:05.376
who is in charge, I think, if
you constantly dictate and say,

00:25:05.376 --> 00:25:07.640
you should do that
because I want.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:13.680
And if you don't make
the musicians to believe

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.980
or to trust or, you know,
maybe not agree as well,

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.160
but to say, OK, I
don't agree with him,

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.720
but actually the
idea is interesting.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.440
I will follow.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.180
At least you get to that
point because human beings

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:29.540
are different than--
music is so subjective.

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:32.852
You cannot say, one is right
and one is absolutely wrong.

00:25:32.852 --> 00:25:34.810
I mean there are obvious
things with the tempos

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:38.500
or dynamic, of course,
or wrong notes probably.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.930
It is a wrong note
at that moment.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:44.650
I mean philosophically
maybe not, but-- [LAUGHS]

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:53.550
But you know, that
thing of trust

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:58.180
is very, very important
thing for conductor, I mean.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:05.630
But you know, but it's
from both sides, you know.

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.080
If orchestra feels the
conductor doesn't trust them,

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.830
the orchestra doesn't
trust the conductor.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:13.657
If the orchestra doesn't trust
the conductor, then-- for me,

00:26:13.657 --> 00:26:15.240
I was playing in the
orchestra myself.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.570
I mean it was a joke.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.090
You know it was a bad joke.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:21.830
But I think if the
conductor-- I was

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.519
a trumpet player at that
point and moment in orchestra.

00:26:24.519 --> 00:26:26.810
When the conductor-- it's
the worst thing for conductor

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.000
was to stop and say,
well, please follow me.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.375
And as soon as the
conductor did that--

00:26:32.375 --> 00:26:33.740
MARK VOLPE: The game's over.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.531
ANDRIS NELSONS: That's--
is you're finished

00:26:35.531 --> 00:26:38.470
because everyone literally
starts to follow you.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:42.540
And of course we know that
physically, physiologically,

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:46.860
or what-- the beat, the timing
between that-- when you're

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.770
in the show, it can't
be-- it's not really

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.517
to do with the physics.

00:26:51.517 --> 00:26:52.225
MARK VOLPE: Yeah.

00:26:52.225 --> 00:26:55.620
Light and sound travel, as you
all know, at different speeds.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.150
So [INAUDIBLE] right away.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.941
ANDRIS NELSONS: So
therefore you can't, you

00:26:58.941 --> 00:26:59.880
can't really say that.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.040
And you shouldn't say that.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.480
It is rather-- I always think
it's rather the orchestra

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.520
musicians, I think
in my opinion,

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.950
is like a big, big
chamber music group.

00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:11.237
So they hear each other.

00:27:11.237 --> 00:27:12.320
They listen to each other.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.660
They know what
happens in a family.

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:18.300
What the harps play, when-- they
know when the double bass is

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.322
or the flute plays.

00:27:19.322 --> 00:27:21.280
And then they can follow
the line of orchestra.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.162
And then this is like a
big, big family and organism

00:27:24.162 --> 00:27:25.620
when you are in
the symphony, which

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:27.050
play-- you know, there
is one instrument group,

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:27.710
another instrument group.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.626
And it's-- and it's very
interesting, I think,

00:27:29.626 --> 00:27:32.910
also for orchestra to be
part of this organism.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:38.290
And of course the
conductor, me, I

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:41.670
sometimes feel like a
drawing with the colors,

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:45.840
with this great
orchestra we have.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.610
It's just emphasizing
one color or some darker.

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:50.490
Or-- and we have all
brilliant players.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:52.450
And I'm just so lucky.

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:53.960
So that's how I operate.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.650
I've been really lucky to have
such a great, great team, which

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.020
is again a team.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.300
It's a teamwork with
great management

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.530
and a great orchestra and
a great, great audience

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.540
and fantastic concert hall.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:13.340
And also I really,
really feel-- and we all

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:20.480
feel-- so honestly privileged
and very naively happy

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.300
that we can be part of this
wonderful project which

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.380
is Google Play,
and now presenting

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.327
these live
possibilities to listen

00:28:29.327 --> 00:28:31.160
to these concerts of
these great orchestras.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.590
And of course, Boston Symphony
Orchestra and other orchestras

00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.250
because I think it is
so-- it makes us so,

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:42.580
so happy because it's
so important for present

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:49.270
and for future to share
our-- first, our great music,

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:49.940
classical music.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:53.280
But to share it, not
only as a document,

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.650
but to share it as
an emotional act

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:58.560
because every concert
is really emotional act.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.880
And every concert is different.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:07.700
And then with your great help
and your great inspiration,

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.110
we make these
concerts capture them.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.300
And then each of these
concerts are different.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.540
And because they are live, you
can't experience it anywhere

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.090
else but just listening.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.200
Then I think-- so I'm just
really very, very happy

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:23.170
about this fact because I think
there is a-- there absolutely

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.710
is a future for classical music.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.340
And actually the future for
classical music or any-- it

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:31.430
is in cooperation
and in actually

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:38.970
looking into the
similarities, collaboration.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:42.210
What is in between the art
forms-- and not only art

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:46.420
forms-- between other
institutions, we can find.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:49.940
I mean, of course, a
great, great company

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.470
as Google Play is, is of course
a lot of science, of course.

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.130
But we have also little
science, you know.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.267
And it's-- you-- I think
you can see the parallels,

00:29:58.267 --> 00:29:59.350
how it works in the music.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.870
MARK VOLPE: Sure.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:01.640
ANDRIS NELSONS: Maybe
it's more mystical.

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.230
But we cooperate.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:09.250
And we have this great
platform to perform

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.810
and to show how we perform
and to be proud of that.

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:17.860
You have a platform to share
that with their audience.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:20.490
We are already doing
great things together

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.220
for classical music
and for future

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:24.930
of the education of humanity.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.270
I mean, this is maybe a--

00:30:26.270 --> 00:30:28.470
MARK VOLPE: Well, one of
the interesting dimensions

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:33.139
of this relationship is the
Android platform does very well

00:30:33.139 --> 00:30:34.430
in emerging parts of the world.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.000
They do well everywhere.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.290
And where you see an
emerging middle class,

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:40.920
whether it be
China or whether it

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.879
be various parts
of South America

00:30:43.879 --> 00:30:45.920
and other parts of the
world, all of a sudden you

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.900
see classical music.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.060
I mean, there are 60 million
kids in China right now playing

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.190
either violin or piano.

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:54.584
I mean, that was
unthinkable 25 years ago,

00:30:54.584 --> 00:30:56.750
certainly unthinkable during
the Gang of Four reign.

00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.850
You know, so all
of a sudden, you

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:02.330
see a little capitalism,
maybe a lot of capitalism.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:07.830
And you see real development of
classical music infrastructure.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.980
We were there right prior
to Andris' ascension

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.080
as our music director.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.247
And it's just amazing.

00:31:14.247 --> 00:31:16.080
When Boston Symphony
was the first orchestra

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.607
to play China-- first orchestra
to play Soviet Union in '56

00:31:18.607 --> 00:31:20.565
courtesy of Khrushchev
and then first orchestra

00:31:20.565 --> 00:31:23.540
to play China after
normalization of relationships.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.730
And back then they could play
in a big gym, a college gym,

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:29.300
and then The People's
Hall because there

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.190
was no place to play.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.870
And now you go--
you've been to China.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.514
There are five halls in
Beijing, including a few

00:31:35.514 --> 00:31:36.680
they built for the Olympics.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.050
There are three halls
in Shanghai, Guangzhou.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:41.250
All this infrastructure
they're building.

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.367
And then they're looking
to us as a model,

00:31:44.367 --> 00:31:46.075
not necessarily to
replicate because it's

00:31:46.075 --> 00:31:47.960
a completely different culture.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.460
A lot of these folks
I think, I have

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.637
a sense The Room
of Bindu concerts

00:31:52.637 --> 00:31:53.720
and The Hall and all that.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.428
But there are going
to be people watching

00:31:55.428 --> 00:31:58.120
this that might
not have been-- so,

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:01.060
talk to someone who's not
heard the Boston Symphony,

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.140
not heard classical music.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:06.550
What-- you've already talked
about the emotional release.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:08.980
Talk a little bit about
how they should approach it

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.840
and-- because there's certain--
especially in America,

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.030
there's a certain,
oh, it's highbrow,

00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:19.100
or it's intellectually too
difficult. I can't get there.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.530
I didn't have it in school.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.260
How do you overcome that?

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:24.724
ANDRIS NELSONS:
Yes, well I think--

00:32:24.724 --> 00:32:26.390
I would start with a
metaphor, you know.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:31.850
When we think about the
food for our physical body,

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:35.600
we think of certain products.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.692
I mean, some people
like more vegetables.

00:32:37.692 --> 00:32:38.650
Some people like fruit.

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.610
Depends what diet
you-- but you need,

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:46.940
certainly you need something
to eat in order to survive.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.350
And you don't question this.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.980
You choose what you eat.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.010
But I think the
same is-- we have

00:32:56.010 --> 00:33:01.960
with our emotional world
and the soul, which

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.760
is part of this-- our body.

00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:13.680
It also needs a
source for feeding.

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.990
And I think through music
and art and culture,

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:24.840
this is a way you
can feed your soul.

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:27.960
And you can choose
whether your soul prefers

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:32.750
Beethoven or Mahler
or any other composer

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.790
or actually by eating
a lot of Mahler,

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:39.547
you actually enjoy it more.

00:33:39.547 --> 00:33:41.630
And with some, it is
actually eating as a dessert,

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.440
not too much.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.420
But I think, this is
that kind of metaphor

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.770
which generally, really
I can see in my life.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:53.820
And I really would say
that the music is a food,

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.290
a nourishment for our souls.

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:56.500
It's really necessary.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:02.400
We don't see it so obvious
as-- now I got a tea-- as this.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:05.510
But actually when
you go to the concert

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.950
and you listen to
certain piece, you

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:14.690
feel you've drank a ten of the
really English breakfast, very

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:15.239
strong teas.

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:17.149
Much more than this cup.

00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:18.116
And you can't explain.

00:34:18.116 --> 00:34:18.699
What happened?

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:20.630
But you feel energized.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.870
You can-- you know.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:23.924
And that's just
because of the concert.

00:34:23.924 --> 00:34:25.590
And even if you don't
know the composer.

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:30.010
But that's what the music can
give, and what the music gives.

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:33.699
And there's a wide
range of emotions.

00:34:33.699 --> 00:34:40.840
If you are in love, you know,
as a teenager or as a old lady

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:46.440
or gentleman, you are again in
love with your husband or wife,

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:48.360
you can-- you go to the concert.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.790
I don't know you go to
listen Puccini's music

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.925
or you go to Richard
Strauss or-- and then

00:34:52.925 --> 00:34:54.460
you-- so beautiful melodies.

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:55.320
You start to cry.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.040
You think, oh my god, oh, it's
so great I married this person.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:59.240
Always.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.720
It reminds-- music
reminds of some things

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.780
and reflects to
your emotionality.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.375
And that's the
way how actually I

00:35:06.375 --> 00:35:09.657
believe you can become
better and more sensitive.

00:35:09.657 --> 00:35:11.740
And that's what I think
we also need in our lives.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:19.900
A sensitivity and compassion and
that is what the music gives.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.970
There is lot of ranges.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:21.470
I told.

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:24.500
It's also-- you can-- there's
aggression in music sometimes.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.670
There is a power.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:31.080
But there is all the variety of
what you can get through music.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:36.460
And the most important that
I think either children--

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.730
and it's great if it
starts in the young age,

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:43.880
but at any age-- that
people are simply informed

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:47.580
and they have this chance to
experience by either coming

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:50.130
to concerts or this is--
therefore, I'm saying

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:55.170
is such a great way also
with the great support

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:55.860
of Google Play.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:01.330
Now many people I'm sure will
listen to these concerts.

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:03.896
And I really encourage
them to listen to--

00:36:03.896 --> 00:36:06.480
for the first time
hearing it, an orchestra--

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.230
and I'm sure they
will find something

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.450
close to their hearts.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:15.190
And that will be a reason
for them to listen again

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:18.719
or actually to come to the
concert or to ask mom, oh, mom,

00:36:18.719 --> 00:36:19.760
I don't know what was it.

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.676
I really enjoyed that.

00:36:20.676 --> 00:36:22.607
Can you put it again?

00:36:22.607 --> 00:36:23.690
It's like for my daughter.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:27.000
I have a small, almost
four-year-old daughter,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.690
which is the biggest, you
know, most important thing

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:30.330
in my life.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.300
And I play-- you know, she
doesn't know what the name.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.369
But when I play, I
actually-- I got my trumpet.

00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:36.910
MARK VOLPE: You
brought your trumpet.

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:37.020
ANDRIS NELSONS: Back.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.720
But after 50 years not playing
it, I got it, the present.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.640
So it-- and I play something.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.500
Something.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.650
She said, no, no, not that.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.699
Can you do-- and I play
the slow movement of Haydn

00:36:47.699 --> 00:36:48.740
and the trumpet concerto.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.494
And she, yes, that's--
can you play that?

00:36:50.494 --> 00:36:51.660
She doesn't know what it is.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:52.980
MARK VOLPE: She's
already a critic.

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.530
ANDRIS NELSONS: But she says--
and I play something, ta, la,

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:56.072
ram, ta, dam.

00:36:56.072 --> 00:36:56.571
No.

00:36:56.571 --> 00:36:57.420
Dad, please shut up.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:57.919
You know.

00:36:57.919 --> 00:36:58.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:59.660
So there is all--

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:00.550
MARK VOLPE: So she
likes the lyrical,

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:01.790
the smoother and beautiful.

00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:03.664
ANDRIS NELSONS: You see
that there is a soul.

00:37:03.664 --> 00:37:07.300
Maybe it asks for that kind
of food which is more lyrical.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.290
And that's the way.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.030
I think it's just
evolved that we

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:14.320
introduce these-- the
children or any age people

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.840
with the music.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:21.070
And I think there is no--
there should be no worries

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.550
or reservations because
thinking that the music is

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.730
so-called for more intellectual.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:30.710
It is absolutely not like that.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.010
It is really for everyone.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.150
It is absolutely for everyone.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:39.580
And it talks to everyone
in very individual ways.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.674
When you go to listen
to, for example,

00:37:42.674 --> 00:37:44.090
Tchaikovsky's "6th
Symphony" which

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:48.780
is our first release
in Google Play,

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.840
we know the story
of Tchaikovsky.

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.884
But when you listen
to that symphony,

00:37:53.884 --> 00:37:55.050
whether you talk to people--

00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:56.840
MARK VOLPE: Last movement
is just torturous.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.800
ANDRIS NELSONS: And this
movement talks, but to everyone

00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.860
it talks in different way.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.276
It actually talks
very personally.

00:38:01.276 --> 00:38:03.810
Everyone starts to
thinks about their lives.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:08.430
And-- so there's never a
one way how the music really

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:11.850
approaches one, the same
people the same way.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:18.300
So it is therefore-- I
just can encourage, just

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.900
take care of your soul as
well as much as your body.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.700
Well, I can't-- don't
care of my body, you know.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.740
But take care of your souls.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:29.950
And concerts and music is a--
and art is a great, great--

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.600
and I would say, the
only way of really

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:37.020
getting to caring about that
part of your human being.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.510
There is another part with
the intellect and other part,

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.000
which you need to take care.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.151
And the--

00:38:43.151 --> 00:38:44.900
MARK VOLPE: Music can
help with that, too.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.983
ANDRIS NELSONS: And music
can help with that, too.

00:38:46.983 --> 00:38:48.910
So, you know-- so just
come to the concerts.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:52.540
And I am really
thankful for Google

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:54.260
for this great
opportunity to share.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.100
And that is one of the ways
to get even closer to people

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:02.360
hearts through sharing and
through media, through that--

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.120
you are so great.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.264
You really helping
and supporting

00:39:05.264 --> 00:39:06.930
that because I think
this is the future.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:08.346
MARK VOLPE: It's
funny when Andris

00:39:08.346 --> 00:39:12.360
was talking about how
certain moments in music

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:15.510
can remind you of falling
in love with your spouse

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:17.345
or partner, whatever,
that I was thinking

00:39:17.345 --> 00:39:19.470
that in the last run of
concerts, which we did here

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:23.729
in Boston, and Carnegie, we did
"Elektra" which is about kids

00:39:23.729 --> 00:39:25.020
who want to kill their parents.

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:29.504
So I mean it kind of covers
the whole spectrum there.

00:39:29.504 --> 00:39:31.170
It's the old Greek--
it wasn't something

00:39:31.170 --> 00:39:32.680
that actually Strauss did.

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.030
It was something the Greeks
did 2,300 years ago or there

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.980
abouts.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:37.840
Any questions?

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.940
Sir?

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:41.440
AUDIENCE: I just want to say
I'm so thrilled with everything

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.140
you've done so far
to energize the BSO,

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.070
both in programming
and their performance.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.970
It's been fantastic.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:52.310
I'm also really thrilled that
we got your wife along with you.

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:54.910
It seems like the best
two for one deal ever.

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.230
And that is actually
relevant to my question.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:02.030
It's a good segue from
Mark's last comment, too,

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:05.680
because the two concerts
that I've personally

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:10.710
found most exciting have
been "Salome" and "Elektra."

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:12.660
It's just been
fantastic that you

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:16.020
brought those operas
to the BSO and had

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.140
such amazing
performances of them.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.440
I wonder if you
could-- just a two part

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.380
question-- if you could talk
a little bit in general.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.520
I know you obviously have a
deep connection with opera

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:30.060
from your childhood, your
wife, and all kinds of things.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.580
I wonder if you could talk a
little bit about the challenges

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:38.860
of conducting opera on stage
in a place like Symphony Hall

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:42.770
as opposed to an actual
opera stage, first of all.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:47.600
And secondly, what's the next
one that we're going to see?

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.737
And I have a suggestion if you
don't have one planned yet.

00:40:50.737 --> 00:40:52.070
MARK VOLPE: It's already booked.

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.410
But we'll listen
and see what you--

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:53.590
AUDIENCE: Oh, good.

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:54.650
I'd like to hear that.

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:55.550
I'd like to hear it.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:57.100
I really want to
know what it is.

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.360
I'd also love to hear you do
something like "Bluebeard's

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.690
Castle" sometime.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:03.469
I think that would be fantastic.

00:41:03.469 --> 00:41:04.760
MARK VOLPE: Have you done that?

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.519
The Bartok?

00:41:06.519 --> 00:41:07.310
ANDRIS NELSONS: No.

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:08.271
Thank you.

00:41:08.271 --> 00:41:10.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah. "Bluebeard's
Castle" is a short.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:11.810
It's Bartok's only opera.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:13.440
It's deeply psychological.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.620
It's also fairly easy
to stage because it only

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.170
has two singers.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.910
And there isn't a lot of
movement on the stage.

00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:22.920
So you could really do it.

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.440
I think it'd be fantastic.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.860
Anyway, go ahead.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:26.600
You talk.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.167
MARK VOLPE: New
music advisor here.

00:41:30.167 --> 00:41:31.000
ANDRIS NELSONS: Yes.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.370
No, no.

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.870
Thank you.

00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:36.400
I'm absolutely
thrilled to be here.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:42.500
And, as I told, amazing team I
experiencing and more and more

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:47.520
how great this institution is,
the orchestra and the team.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:50.000
And I-- and this works
only because it's

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.720
a great team as well.

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:54.842
And thank you for
saying about the operas.

00:41:54.842 --> 00:41:56.550
I mean, we enjoy every
concert of course.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:42:01.110
But I think opera always
is-- we do it every season.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:03.880
[INAUDIBLE] so far.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.530
And this always a
great excitement

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.220
because orchestra normally
they don't play opera every day

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:14.300
or even every month or-- you
know, it's really not often.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:19.910
And the-- besides, of course,
the musical differences--

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:23.100
because having more soloists
and the different music, which

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:24.940
is not played every
day, or the chorus

00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:29.190
or of course-- the challenge
is which-- the technical

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.990
challenges which it brings.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:38.760
There is also an extra thing
which is so healthy to develop,

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.180
I believe also, in
symphonic music,

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.890
is this way of
listening to each other

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:50.410
because-- and following
your-- one is heartbeat,

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.450
but actually it's
your breathing.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:55.340
Because when you sing, when
you play opera-- and you,

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.810
of course, as conductor of
orchestra , your company--

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:02.710
a moment of soloist singing--
you can hear the soloist sings

00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:06.480
and the-- and he or she
needs a breath and then--

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:12.580
so it reminds and reminds you
that making music it's to do

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.270
with a live organism, you know.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:19.230
And I think by performing
opera you can really notice it.

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:23.800
And it works so
greatly in advance

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:28.829
for listening to each other,
following, supporting.

00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:30.370
And sometimes you
come out, you feel,

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:31.960
oh, soloist is
running out of breath,

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.340
so we need a little help.

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:35.250
And you can't predict it.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.820
You-- one rehearsal is like this
one rehearsal the other way.

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.890
And one performance
is this-- so you

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.431
need to react for me as a
conductor and the orchestra

00:43:44.431 --> 00:43:44.930
as well.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:46.965
They say, OK, so tonight
probably the soloist

00:43:46.965 --> 00:43:48.510
had a bit of sore throat.

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:51.820
So we have a bit-- or-- I'm
being very, very cynical.

00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:55.670
But these aspects,
being aware, listening,

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:57.230
make it very, very alive.

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:01.880
And I think-- I believe that
we follow that pattern actually

00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:04.390
when we do the symphonic
concerts as well, to be

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:08.720
constantly alert and
dramatic, in terms

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.600
that there's a drama
in each symphony.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.580
You know.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.750
But I think opera is of course
very exciting thing which

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:15.940
we will do every season.

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.670
And then there will be
one next season, too.

00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:19.274
So--

00:44:19.274 --> 00:44:20.690
But thank you for
your suggestion.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:22.650
That's a great opera, too.

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:23.980
AUDIENCE: Which one is it?

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:26.570
MARK VOLPE: Well, I-- we--
because of the camera rolling

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:28.740
here, I can't announce anything.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:29.454
Next year when--

00:44:29.454 --> 00:44:30.120
AUDIENCE: Later.

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.140
MARK VOLPE: If we're over
in the corner, I'll--

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:32.020
AUDIENCE: We'll
talk to you later.

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.478
MARK VOLPE: Yeah,
talk to me later.

00:44:33.478 --> 00:44:36.240
I'll tell you because
it involves you.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.380
You preface your
comments about Andris'

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.470
incredibly beautiful and
talented wife, Kristine.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:44.919
She is going to be
with us at Tanglewood.

00:44:44.919 --> 00:44:46.460
And since we're
announcing Tanglewood

00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.400
on Friday-- Thursday?

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.960
We're going to do the
first two acts of Aida

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:53.787
with the BSO and Kristine.

00:44:53.787 --> 00:44:55.870
And there are a few other
people involved in that.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:56.540
But--

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.790
ANDRIS NELSONS: And
Tanglewood is also--

00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:59.789
MARK VOLPE: Tanglewood I
don't mind telling you.

00:44:59.789 --> 00:45:02.060
Next season, it's
a little premature.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.790
ANDRIS NELSONS:But--
because it's-- opera.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:05.840
And it's great.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.790
But for me, as I have
conducted opera a lot,

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:14.400
and always the symphonic I
have played opera and orchestra

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.410
as well.

00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:20.510
I think that they are not huge.

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.210
I mean, there is a
lot of similarities

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.120
because of the drama and how to
understand the symphonic music.

00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:29.130
I understand it's through
the same idea of breathing,

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:32.150
of heartbeat, and of the drama.

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:35.290
You of course have
more fantasy to think

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:39.020
what this drama is about.

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:44.200
But this is-- there are some
similar elements of making

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.640
music, the way of
making music, but--

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.560
MARK VOLPE: But when we meet
with our artistic committee

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:51.570
from the orchestra,
and we meet with them.

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.570
We're meeting with them
tomorrow morning at 9:00

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:55.170
and showing them repertoire.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:59.430
They-- everyone has their
own-- the brass players love

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:00.790
the Mahler and the Bruckner.

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:02.090
String players Bruckner.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.420
Not so much.

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:06.490
But they all gravitate to the
opera because they don't do it.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.000
We do it once a year, I mean.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.010
And so for them, it's
like when the Metropolitan

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.301
Opera goes and plays a concert.

00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:12.770
It's very special for them.

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:16.040
It's great because--
Andris is absolutely right,

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:17.290
speaking as a former musician.

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:19.706
It's a different-- I mean,
there are so many similarities.

00:46:19.706 --> 00:46:20.500
It's still music.

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.950
But it's a different
approach when you're working

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:25.680
with singers and all of that.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.700
And the breathing is
absolutely critical,

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:29.950
that whole way of approach.

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:33.060
But-- so I think it's
great with Andris,

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:35.820
who is very comfortable in
both the concert as well

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:36.520
as the opera.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.510
And we do a little bit
of staging, but not

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:42.030
too much because this is-- one
of the challenges of Symphony

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:42.530
Hall.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:43.940
It's one of the smallest stages.

00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:44.731
I mean, it's funny.

00:46:44.731 --> 00:46:48.480
When we went to Carnegie and
took "Elektra" to Carnegie,

00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.270
it's so much-- it's probably
twice the size in terms

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:54.910
of square footage of stage
and different-- so it's very--

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:59.362
we can do different things with
that than Symphony Hall where--

00:46:59.362 --> 00:47:00.820
ANDRIS NELSONS:
But also, you know,

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:05.390
this is the privilege to do
like we did this year, "Elektra"

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:08.910
or "Salome" last year
or the year before, I

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:13.710
mean, with such a brilliant
orchestra as Boston Symphony.

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:18.450
You have to have a-- it's
so challenging, you know.

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:18.950
And--

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:21.574
MARK VOLPE: They're reading for
the orchestra being in the pit.

00:47:21.574 --> 00:47:23.783
So you need a really great
orchestra to know how to--

00:47:23.783 --> 00:47:25.907
ANDRIS NELSONS: You know,
so-- and in the meantime,

00:47:25.907 --> 00:47:27.540
the challenge for--
to play, but also

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:31.040
a challenge to be not
overpowering all the time.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.180
And the balancing
is very challenging.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:35.450
It's actually [INAUDIBLE],
in particularly, you

00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:37.340
know, we talk
about "Elektra," is

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:40.270
one of the most
challenging to balance it

00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:43.950
in a concert version,
even in a stage version.

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:47.430
So, but this is all
exciting because-- and then

00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:50.220
also the part that every
concert is different.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:53.950
And you-- and that's-- I love it
so much that even we've always

00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:56.160
prepare of course
for anything we do.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.960
But there is this mystical,
unexplainable moment

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:03.140
of spontaneity, and not
planned spontaneity,

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.570
which-- but it just comes
because of the day-- today's

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:10.080
more sunny than yesterday or--
then your mood is different

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:14.210
than, the tempo's a little
different than-- you know,

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:15.290
I mean, this is exciting.

00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:19.420
That's what makes it so great to
perform the same piece hundred

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.030
times and it always
will be different.

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:24.500
And I think-- and that's
why coming to concerts

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.480
or listening to concerts and, of
course, this great opportunity

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.640
to listen live or not live.

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:34.920
But you never find
two exactly the same,

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:39.787
performances of the same
piece, any orchestra.

00:48:39.787 --> 00:48:41.120
ANDRIS NELSONS: Other questions?

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.602
Two questions back there.

00:48:42.602 --> 00:48:44.560
AUDIENCE: So you talked
a lot about the emotion

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.180
of the music and your role as
a conductor to bring that out.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:52.020
How do you balance
that with the fact

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:54.070
that you're rehearsing
every day and you

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:58.330
have to get the technique right
and like there's a-- Like how

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:01.260
do you keep that
feeling and balance

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:05.399
the kind of practical management
and practice and technique?

00:49:05.399 --> 00:49:06.690
ANDRIS NELSONS: Yes, thank you.

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:07.840
It's a good question.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:12.820
It's a-- because of course by
talking, you know, it's emotion

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:17.730
and it's a constant brain
activization and planning.

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:20.280
One can think, oh,
you know, how long you

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:27.290
can live like that because
it's a-- but this requires

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:36.890
a lot of planning of-- I
mean, for example, of my time,

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:40.840
so I know there's a big
inventive period of working.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.250
And then I know I need
to recharge my batteries.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:49.450
And of course the best ways I--
when other people say, oh, I'm

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.320
going on holiday,
whether they go somewhere

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:55.530
or they fly somewhere or--
when I say I go the holiday,

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:57.190
I go home.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:00.200
I'm with my daughter
and I am with my wife.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:04.530
That's-- it means, can be
as simple as just being home

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:09.590
and playing all day with my
daughter and going to have

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:10.350
a dinner.

00:50:10.350 --> 00:50:12.970
And that's the
most exciting thing

00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:18.120
after a big philosophical
journey of great operas

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:20.280
or symphonies.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:22.180
And then again,
after that period,

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.210
you recharge your batteries
by living a normal life.

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.330
Because I think the music
at the end is also--

00:50:28.330 --> 00:50:29.430
it is about our life.

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:35.260
It's not so much only about the
higher philosophical things.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:41.380
Of course, there are always
questions and philosophy

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.390
and subtext and so on.

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:46.525
But at the end, it is
about what we feel.

00:50:46.525 --> 00:50:47.400
It's about our lives.

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.790
The music it is about our lives.

00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:51.720
So then living normal life and
the charging the batteries,

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.580
from there you come
back and you again,

00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:56.730
you have something
more to say again.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:00.610
So this is a contemplating of
your-- everyone has a different

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:11.700
kind of power and balancing that
the body and mental abilities

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.279
to-- But again this is a--

00:51:14.279 --> 00:51:16.320
MARK VOLPE: But in terms
of technique, you know--

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.486
ANDRIS NELSONS: A technique.

00:51:17.486 --> 00:51:20.235
MARK VOLPE: One of the things
about a Boston Symphony

00:51:20.235 --> 00:51:21.610
that-- it's not
unique to Boston.

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:23.818
There are other, a handful
of other great orchestras.

00:51:23.818 --> 00:51:26.110
But they come in, they
can play everything.

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:31.819
So it's-- Andris' focus is not
on, you have to play E flat

00:51:31.819 --> 00:51:33.610
instead of E. If a
person-- they're mortal.

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:34.401
They make mistakes.

00:51:34.401 --> 00:51:37.330
But that's just a
slip of whatever.

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:38.770
They don't make mistakes.

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:39.271
And--

00:51:39.271 --> 00:51:41.353
ANDRIS NELSONS: That's of
course absolutely right.

00:51:41.353 --> 00:51:43.330
What-- I mean, it's
a privilege having

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:47.060
a great, great, great
instrument, a great team

00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:54.850
because with a huge, huge,
high level of professionality

00:51:54.850 --> 00:51:57.700
which gives a great, of
course, great trust for me,

00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:04.000
and then your concentration's
become more clear,

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.700
where you put your
energy and where--

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:12.510
how you divide your-- you put
your energy and emotionality

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:19.530
more because this is such
a, you know, jubilary

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:22.230
feeling to be in front of
these amazing musicians.

00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:26.350
So of course, that's
also how you apply

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:27.460
in terms of the technique.

00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:31.230
I also realize of course more
and more for the conductor,

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:34.430
even though it's very
mystical as a result,

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:40.910
but a simply clear
technique, whether it's

00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:44.210
with beating or one or
other way or with your face,

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:47.500
but more clear expressions
through your hands

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.381
are always very helpful,
more helpful than talking,

00:52:51.381 --> 00:52:52.380
let's say, to orchestra.

00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:55.090
Because the orchestra
sometimes-- you

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:56.710
as the conductor
would think, OK,

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:58.210
so I would want to
explain-- I mean,

00:52:58.210 --> 00:52:59.543
I know I'm talking now too much.

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:01.880
It's so boring
already, but-- for you,

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.280
but you know if you start
to talk to orchestras,

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:08.570
it's always, oh my god,
[INAUDIBLE] you know.

00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:11.670
So they will say, please
show us what you want.

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:13.971
And this as cynical as that.

00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:15.970
But something's-- it's
very important, you know,

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.640
the technique, the
manual technique.

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.130
So you can put-- you should
put everything in your hands,

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:23.690
in your face, also what
you're feeling in your heart,

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:26.330
you can express with
your hands, on your face.

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:30.730
You know, musicians can see
whether you are being very dry

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:34.360
and there is a beautiful
melody and you just,

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:35.650
you beating right.

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:39.420
Or your heart is also there.

00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.710
And they feel it.

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:44.520
And that's-- also, you
need to have a technique

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.290
and the preparation.

00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:52.630
And I also think-- which
involves a technical

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:56.240
preparation, professional,
and intellectual--

00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:01.720
but I think it's also important
to train-- also to be--

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.870
to train the emotionality
as well, because you know--

00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:07.040
MARK VOLPE: It's
interesting, you know.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:11.050
We try to anticipate
possible roadblocks.

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:12.990
And you have these
younger conductors

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:16.435
who aren't nearly as
sophisticated and musically

00:54:16.435 --> 00:54:18.160
and artistically
developed as Andris.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.800
And we-- it might be
a Brahms symphony.

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:24.030
And we tell them-- and
then they sit there

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:26.640
and talk for 15 minutes about
the history of the Brahms

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.520
symphony.

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.936
You know, this is
orchestra that's

00:54:28.936 --> 00:54:34.450
played it with Bernstein, von
Dohnanyi Mazur, Lavine, Ozawa,

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:35.140
Andris Nelson.

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:36.922
And it's like,
they're-- ballgame over.

00:54:36.922 --> 00:54:38.130
I mean, they're professional.

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:39.070
They get through it.

00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:41.260
But they have--
they're in my office

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.530
at intermissions at the first
break of the rehearsals saying,

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:45.857
what?

00:54:45.857 --> 00:54:46.690
Whose idea was this?

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:47.385
I say, yours.

00:54:47.385 --> 00:54:48.330
No.

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.580
I think one-- do we have
time for like one or two more

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.200
questions?

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:52.080
Anybody?

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.540
AUDIENCE: The need for
music, to some extent,

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:56.780
in developing emotionally
as a human person.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.360
I'd be interested to
hear whether you think

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.310
this is especially
important in children

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:03.390
and, given that there
are many children,

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:05.280
whether it's for
economic reasons,

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:07.890
or you see political
instability in many countries

00:55:07.890 --> 00:55:09.820
don't have access
to that, how would

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:11.690
you like to see the
BSO specifically

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:14.099
and the music community
in general help

00:55:14.099 --> 00:55:16.140
reach children with that
beauty that they do need

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:18.697
at a critical age in
their development?

00:55:18.697 --> 00:55:19.530
ANDRIS NELSONS: Yes.

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:20.030
Thank you.

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.172
That's very-- it's
very, very important.

00:55:23.172 --> 00:55:25.380
Obviously what you say it's
very, very right and very

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:26.255
important, of course.

00:55:26.255 --> 00:55:36.080
It's not only about
music as a-- you know,

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:44.050
as a privilege or as a fortunate
gift what God has given us,

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:46.180
some music or art or any--

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:53.960
But the music actually
can also be very much

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:56.160
like a-- I can't
say word medicine.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.240
But it's like a comfort.

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.110
Like-- and there's
a-- as I say, I

00:55:59.110 --> 00:56:01.290
mean, in particular
periods of life,

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:06.510
or particular groups
of people, or where

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:10.985
the music can solve many,
many problems and can help.

00:56:10.985 --> 00:56:16.960
And I think by reaching
to those people

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.880
or those areas are of
course very important.

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.310
I mean, I know in
the Boston Symphony

00:56:21.310 --> 00:56:25.570
there's a-- of course I met
several times a great team

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:30.100
of education department
who are co-planning

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:36.600
the special activities for
children and for younger

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.480
children, for very
young children.

00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.170
There are involving
different things.

00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:42.370
It's concert, but
also activities

00:56:42.370 --> 00:56:43.950
like children trying
the instruments

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:47.400
or different ways of
activities, how they

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:48.930
can be in touch with music.

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:52.286
And these activities
are regularly

00:56:52.286 --> 00:56:53.410
planned with the orchestra.

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:58.622
And of course, these are things
which in future and present

00:56:58.622 --> 00:57:00.840
are very crucial, of course.

00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:08.609
And I know of course
that from one side,

00:57:08.609 --> 00:57:10.900
concerts and activities
happening in the Symphony Hall.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:14.690
But they also activities where
musicians go to the schools

00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:21.440
or to the communities to find
also the way to those children

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.850
or these people who can't
come to concert hall

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:26.030
simply because of several
reasons, you know,

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:29.110
or sometimes obvious reasons.

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:33.650
So this is very right
and very important.

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:36.167
I mean, we have to--

00:57:36.167 --> 00:57:38.000
MARK VOLPE: It's very
out-- well, I'm sorry.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.800
ANDRIS NELSONS: Oh, please, go.

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:43.880
MARK VOLPE: About eight, nine
years ago the then premier

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.970
of China was visiting
Washington, New York,

00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:48.230
and Boston.

00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:50.650
And I had the privilege
of sitting with him.

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:52.780
And I was curious
because I said,

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:56.890
it's a-- obviously, it's
a capitalist society,

00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:00.530
but it's still strictly
controlled by the party.

00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:02.280
And I was talking to him.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.910
Why music?

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:07.160
Why have you invested so much
in this musical infrastructure

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:10.630
and pedagogy and physical
plant and all that?

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:12.520
And he says, when you
think about music--

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:15.830
and he was actually giving me
a lecture about America's lost

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:19.200
its way because they've
not seen fit to invest

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:23.550
in the same way-- he
says, rhythm is math.

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:26.340
Physics is acoustics.

00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.844
I mean, that's what
we-- group dynamic is

00:58:29.844 --> 00:58:31.260
if you're part of
an ensemble, you

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:35.700
have to subliminate
your ego and be part

00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:38.060
of a greater good, a whole.

00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.420
Then you start talking
about languages.

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.410
I mean, music is an abstraction.

00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:43.120
It's a language.

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:44.510
And if you start
talking opera, they

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:45.750
come in six, seven languages.

00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:47.730
So there's the language element.

00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:51.450
Music is all rooted in whatever
historically was going on.

00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:54.120
Beethoven and Napoleon,
I mean, obviously

00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:55.960
had ambivalent feelings
at a certain point.

00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:57.700
And it's not just
classical music.

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.450
It obviously goes far
beyond classical music.

00:59:00.450 --> 00:59:03.130
And you look at the
negro spirituals and all

00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:06.120
that as political statements
and how people have organized

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:07.570
their movements and that.

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:11.550
So the Chinese have decided
as a matter of public policy

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:14.140
that music, in terms of
training the next generation,

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:15.650
they don't need--
there's not room

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:18.850
for 60 million professional
musicians, even in China.

00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:19.350
You know.

00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:23.310
So-- but they believe, like
the Greeks and like the Romans,

00:59:23.310 --> 00:59:26.184
but more the Greeks, that to be
educated you had to have music.

00:59:26.184 --> 00:59:27.600
It's one of the
seven disciplines.

00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:29.308
They always talk about
seven disciplines.

00:59:29.308 --> 00:59:31.350
And music was one of
those seven disciplines.

00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:33.400
And the Chinese are back there.

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.940
And you go to Beacon Hill
or you go to Capitol Hill.

00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:37.840
And it's not clear our
political leadership

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:42.660
is as savvy and as intelligent
when it comes to such things.

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:44.950
So it's interesting
that music does

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:49.985
have a role beyond obviously
playing and emotionally

00:59:49.985 --> 00:59:51.020
and connecting it.

00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.370
It has played a political role.

00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:54.140
It has played a social role.

00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:55.900
You see where music--
it's interesting

00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:59.620
that the most extremists of
what's going on in the Mideast,

00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:00.920
they ban music.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.710
And you start looking at some
of the fundamentalists who

01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:08.100
are driving some of the--
it's pretty scary notion.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:10.190
But music is
absolutely forbidden.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:14.190
And that suggests something
in terms of the power of music

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:15.270
right there.

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:15.929
Thank you.

01:00:15.929 --> 01:00:17.470
It's been a great,
great opportunity.

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:18.970
And I enjoyed the chat.

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:19.570
ANDRIS NELSONS:
Thank you, everybody.

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:20.070
Thank you.

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:22.620
[APPLAUSE]
