00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.200
Construct a circle
inscribing the triangle.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.870
So this would be a circle that's
inside this triangle, where

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.100
each of the sides
of the triangle

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.550
are tangents to the circle.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.560
And probably the
easiest way to think

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.830
about it is the center
of that circle is going

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.022
to be at the incenter
of the triangle.

00:00:21.022 --> 00:00:22.730
Now what is the incenter
of the triangle?

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.250
The incenter of the
triangle is the intersection

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.580
of the angle bisectors.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.410
So if I were to make a
line that perfectly splits

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.400
an angle in two-- so I'm
eyeballing it right over here--

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.140
this would be an angle bisector.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.910
But to be a little bit more
precise about angle bisectors,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.540
I could actually use a compass.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.850
So let me make this
a little bit smaller.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.130
And what I can do
is I could put this,

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.990
the center of this circle, on
one of the sides of this angle

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.920
right over here.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.200
Now let me get another circle.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.520
And I want to make
it the same size.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.050
So let me center it there.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.590
I want to make it
the exact same size.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.600
And now let me put
it on the other one,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200
on the other side of this angle.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.212
I'll put it right over here.

00:01:08.212 --> 00:01:10.420
And I want to put it so that
the center of the circle

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.220
is on the other
side of the angle,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.400
and that the circle
itself, or the vertex,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.160
sits on the circle itself.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.020
And what this does
is I can now look

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.200
at the intersection of
this point, the vertex,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.120
and this point, and that's
going to be the angle bisector.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.970
So let me go-- I'm going
to go through there

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.030
and I'm going to
go through there.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.550
Now let me move these
circles over to here,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.270
so I can take the angle
bisector of this side as well.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.260
So I can put this one over here.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.360
And I could put this
one-- let's see,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.220
I want to be on the
side of the angle.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.940
And I want the circle to go
right through the vertex.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.070
Now let me add another
straight edge here.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.280
So I want to go
through this point

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.220
and I want to
bisect the angle, go

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.105
right through the other point
of intersection of these two

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:02.572
circles.

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:04.530
Now let me get rid of
one of these two circles.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.250
I don't need that anymore.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.530
And let me use this one
to actually construct

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.651
the circle inscribing
the triangle.

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:12.900
So I'm going to put it at
the center right over there.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.358
Actually, this
one's already pretty

00:02:14.358 --> 00:02:16.640
close in terms of dimensions.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.310
And with this tool, you don't
have to be 100% precise.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.210
It has some margin for error.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.060
And so let's just go with this.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.510
This actually
should be touching.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:29.850
But this has some
margin for error.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.266
Let's see if this
was good enough.

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:32.700
It was.
