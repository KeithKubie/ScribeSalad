talking I think what we need to be doing

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130
talking I think what we need to be doing
 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.190
talking I think what we need to be doing
globally is talking to one another I

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200
globally is talking to one another I
 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.990
globally is talking to one another I
think there needs to be a great deal

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000
think there needs to be a great deal
 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.230
think there needs to be a great deal
more global understanding I think that

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
more global understanding I think that
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.900
more global understanding I think that
is the only way in which we can get to a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
is the only way in which we can get to a
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.910
is the only way in which we can get to a
place where we understand that we are

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920
place where we understand that we are
 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.859
place where we understand that we are
not going to be able to solve some of

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
not going to be able to solve some of
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.310
not going to be able to solve some of
these global problems alone individually

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
these global problems alone individually
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.169
these global problems alone individually
as separate countries we're going to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179
as separate countries we're going to
 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.520
as separate countries we're going to
have to find ways of cooperating

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530
have to find ways of cooperating
 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.430
have to find ways of cooperating
collaborating so that we can see that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
collaborating so that we can see that
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.549
collaborating so that we can see that
we're all in this mess together so I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559
we're all in this mess together so I
 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.400
we're all in this mess together so I
think that what we are not doing enough

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
think that what we are not doing enough
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.790
think that what we are not doing enough
of is finding the common ground that

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
of is finding the common ground that
 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.920
of is finding the common ground that
will bring us together I I think the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
will bring us together I I think the
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.540
will bring us together I I think the
most important thing that each one of us

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550
most important thing that each one of us
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.420
most important thing that each one of us
can do individually is to educate

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
can do individually is to educate
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.459
can do individually is to educate
ourselves about what the issues are

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469
ourselves about what the issues are
 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.670
ourselves about what the issues are
stretch ourselves so that we like the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
stretch ourselves so that we like the
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039
stretch ourselves so that we like the
students at Princeton encounter the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
students at Princeton encounter the
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.510
students at Princeton encounter the
other so that we begin a process of

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
other so that we begin a process of
 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.450
other so that we begin a process of
understanding why people who live in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
understanding why people who live in
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.670
understanding why people who live in
Egypt or in Saudi Arabia or in a rock

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680
Egypt or in Saudi Arabia or in a rock
 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.749
Egypt or in Saudi Arabia or in a rock
fundamentally think differently than we

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
fundamentally think differently than we
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.390
fundamentally think differently than we
do and understanding the history of that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400
do and understanding the history of that
 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.969
do and understanding the history of that
and why that is true so I think we have

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979
and why that is true so I think we have
 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.490
and why that is true so I think we have
an obligation to understand why there is

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
an obligation to understand why there is
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.990
an obligation to understand why there is
so much difference in the world today

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
so much difference in the world today
 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600
so much difference in the world today
and then get to the point of

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610
and then get to the point of
 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.039
and then get to the point of
understanding that despite those

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049
understanding that despite those
 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.749
understanding that despite those
differences we're not going to change

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
differences we're not going to change
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.109
differences we're not going to change
those differences how we are going to

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
those differences how we are going to
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.649
those differences how we are going to
come together and unite to solve some of

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659
come together and unite to solve some of
 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.530
come together and unite to solve some of
the horrible problems we face

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540
 
 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.600
