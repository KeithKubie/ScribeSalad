00:00:06.108 --> 00:00:08.162
How's this for a strange idea:

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:12.416
a day off from work in honor of work itself?

00:00:12.416 --> 00:00:14.377
Actually, that is what Labor Day,

00:00:14.377 --> 00:00:17.380
celebrated in the United States and Canada

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.716
on the first Monday of every September,

00:00:19.716 --> 00:00:21.884
is all about.

00:00:21.884 --> 00:00:23.667
The first American Labor Day

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:25.526
was celebrated in New York City

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:28.441
on September 5th, 1882,

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:30.692
as thousands of workers and their families

00:00:30.692 --> 00:00:34.607
came to Union Square for a day in the park.

00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:36.692
It was not a national holiday

00:00:36.692 --> 00:00:38.608
but had been organized by a union

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:41.025
to honor workers and their hard efforts

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:42.940
with a rare day of rest,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.024
halfway between July 4th and Thanksgiving.

00:00:47.024 --> 00:00:49.608
There were picnics and a parade,

00:00:49.608 --> 00:00:51.943
but there were also protests.

00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:53.442
The workers had gathered,

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:55.776
not just to rest and celebrate,

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:57.712
but to demand fair wages,

00:00:57.712 --> 00:01:00.133
the end of child labor,

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:04.219
and the right to organize into unions.

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:05.682
During the period known as

00:01:05.682 --> 00:01:07.597
The Industrial Revolution,

00:01:07.597 --> 00:01:11.059
many jobs were difficult, dirty and dangerous.

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:13.061
People worked for twelve hours,

00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:14.397
six days a week,

00:01:14.397 --> 00:01:16.063
without fringe benefits,

00:01:16.063 --> 00:01:20.067
such as vacations, health care and pensions,

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:22.572
and if you were young, chances are

00:01:22.572 --> 00:01:24.990
you were doing manual labor

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.991
instead of your ABCs and fractions.

00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:30.170
Children as young as ten

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.513
worked in some of the most hazardous places,

00:01:32.513 --> 00:01:36.209
like coal mines or factories filled with boiling vats

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:38.941
or dangerous machines.

00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:41.797
Trying to win better pay, shorter hours

00:01:41.797 --> 00:01:43.420
and safer conditions

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.670
workers had begun to form labor unions

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.920
in America and Canada,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.903
but the companies they worked for

00:01:49.903 --> 00:01:52.735
often fought hard to keep unions out

00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:54.934
and to supress strikes.

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:57.440
At times, this led to violent battles

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.641
between workers and business owners

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:02.943
with the owners often backed up by the police,

00:02:02.943 --> 00:02:05.311
or even the military.

00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:06.811
In the following years,

00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:09.726
the idea of Labor Day caught on in America

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:13.245
with official celebrations reaching 30 states.

00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:14.968
But then came the violent

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:18.383
Haymarket Square Riot of 1886,

00:02:18.383 --> 00:02:20.670
which led to the deaths of several policemen

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.509
and workers in Chicago

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.096
and the execution of four union leaders.

00:02:26.096 --> 00:02:29.096
After that, many labor and political groups

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:30.593
around the world

00:02:30.593 --> 00:02:34.449
had begun to mark Haymarket Square on May 1st,

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:35.902
which became known as

00:02:35.902 --> 00:02:38.458
International Workers' Day.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.816
In 1894, President Grover Cleveland

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:44.364
signed the law making Labor Day a

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:46.589
federal holiday in America,

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.524
only days after he had sent

00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:50.692
12,000 soldiers to end

00:02:50.692 --> 00:02:52.664
a violent railroad strike

00:02:52.664 --> 00:02:55.871
that resulted in the death of several people.

00:02:55.871 --> 00:02:58.431
The original September date was kept,

00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:02.965
partly to avoid the more radical associations of May 1st.

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:08.066
Canada also created its Labor Day in 1894.

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:10.360
But, in spite of this new holiday,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.682
it would be a long time before the changes

00:03:12.682 --> 00:03:14.318
that workers wanted

00:03:14.318 --> 00:03:16.017
became a reality.

00:03:16.017 --> 00:03:19.423
In 1938, during the Great Depression

00:03:19.423 --> 00:03:21.589
that left millions without jobs,

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:23.565
President Franklin D. Roosevelt

00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:26.696
signed a law calling for an eight-hour work day,

00:03:26.696 --> 00:03:28.754
a five-day work week,

00:03:28.754 --> 00:03:30.698
and an end to child labor,

00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:35.001
some of the first federal protections for American workers.

00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:38.614
As America and Canada celebrate Labor Day,

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:41.153
most of the two countries' children enjoy

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:43.153
a day off from school.

00:03:43.153 --> 00:03:45.069
But it is important to remember

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.569
that there was a time that

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.624
everyday was a labor day for children in America and Canada,

00:03:51.624 --> 00:03:53.153
and unfortunately,

00:03:53.153 --> 00:03:55.153
the same fact remains true

00:03:55.153 --> 00:03:58.422
for millions of children around the world today.
