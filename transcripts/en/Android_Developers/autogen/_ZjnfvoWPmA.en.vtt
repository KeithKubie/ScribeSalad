ask us some QA but nothing too hard so
when we started down the path of playing

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
when we started down the path of playing
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.649
when we started down the path of playing
fair

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659
fair
 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.260
fair
we started with two main goals the first

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
we started with two main goals the first
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.300
we started with two main goals the first
was that we wanted to balance in-app

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
was that we wanted to balance in-app
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.580
was that we wanted to balance in-app
purchase economy so if you think about

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
purchase economy so if you think about
 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.300
purchase economy so if you think about
when you have a game and you have a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310
when you have a game and you have a
 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.219
when you have a game and you have a
currency in your game users pay money

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229
currency in your game users pay money
 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.630
currency in your game users pay money
for that currency and so you're

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
for that currency and so you're
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.460
for that currency and so you're
assigning a monetary value to that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
assigning a monetary value to that
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.980
assigning a monetary value to that
carnist currency and we want to be want

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
carnist currency and we want to be want
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719
carnist currency and we want to be want
you to be able to preserve this so you

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
you to be able to preserve this so you
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.490
you to be able to preserve this so you
control that and you have the full

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
control that and you have the full
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.410
control that and you have the full
control over that so that was the first

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
control over that so that was the first
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.840
control over that so that was the first
objective that we have the second thing

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
objective that we have the second thing
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.280
objective that we have the second thing
is that we want to do the right thing

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
is that we want to do the right thing
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.830
is that we want to do the right thing
for all users and this means that for

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
for all users and this means that for
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.289
for all users and this means that for
good users we want to provide a fair and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
good users we want to provide a fair and
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.539
good users we want to provide a fair and
you know rewarding experience on our

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549
you know rewarding experience on our
 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.150
you know rewarding experience on our
platform but we also importantly want to

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160
platform but we also importantly want to
 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.580
platform but we also importantly want to
deter the bad users and so when we

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
deter the bad users and so when we
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350
deter the bad users and so when we
combine those two objectives we hope

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
combine those two objectives we hope
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.790
combine those two objectives we hope
that we can achieve wins

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
that we can achieve wins
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.450
that we can achieve wins
you the developers the users and us is

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460
you the developers the users and us is
 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.150
you the developers the users and us is
google play so let me talk about our

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160
google play so let me talk about our
 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.640
google play so let me talk about our
principles to achieve us achieve these

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
principles to achieve us achieve these
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.650
principles to achieve us achieve these
goals the first is that we want to do

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660
goals the first is that we want to do
 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.810
goals the first is that we want to do
the right thing for all users all the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820
the right thing for all users all the
 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.270
the right thing for all users all the
time and this sounds like a really big

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280
time and this sounds like a really big
 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.690
time and this sounds like a really big
googly lofty goal but really it starts

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
googly lofty goal but really it starts
 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.400
googly lofty goal but really it starts
with assuming that all users and all

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410
with assuming that all users and all
 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.440
with assuming that all users and all
developers are inherently good and we

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450
developers are inherently good and we
 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.420
developers are inherently good and we
really believe that and so when they're

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430
really believe that and so when they're
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.220
really believe that and so when they're
inherently good we can provide them

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230
inherently good we can provide them
 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.710
inherently good we can provide them
access to all of our services and that's

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720
access to all of our services and that's
 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.950
access to all of our services and that's
a really important trait to us but we

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960
a really important trait to us but we
 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.720
a really important trait to us but we
know from experience in probably you do

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
know from experience in probably you do
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.420
know from experience in probably you do
too that not all users are good and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430
too that not all users are good and
 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.100
too that not all users are good and
there's a very small minority of them

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110
there's a very small minority of them
 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.050
there's a very small minority of them
that aren't good and so we have to

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060
that aren't good and so we have to
 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.000
that aren't good and so we have to
evaluate everything on a case-by-case

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010
evaluate everything on a case-by-case
 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.220
evaluate everything on a case-by-case
basis or an interaction by interaction

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
basis or an interaction by interaction
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.890
basis or an interaction by interaction
basis and sort of to highlight this let

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
basis and sort of to highlight this let
 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.170
basis and sort of to highlight this let
me let me bring up an example so who

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180
me let me bring up an example so who
 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.820
me let me bring up an example so who
here in the audience is made and in-app

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
here in the audience is made and in-app
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.300
here in the audience is made and in-app
purchase before it's a good showing I

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310
purchase before it's a good showing I
 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.780
purchase before it's a good showing I
know I have myself and so let's assume

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790
know I have myself and so let's assume
 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.940
know I have myself and so let's assume
that you know you give a developer some

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950
that you know you give a developer some
 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.350
that you know you give a developer some
money and in turn you get in-game

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360
money and in turn you get in-game
 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.630
money and in turn you get in-game
currency let's call them coins now let's

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640
currency let's call them coins now let's
 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.090
currency let's call them coins now let's
suppose you want a refund for those for

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100
suppose you want a refund for those for
 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.860
suppose you want a refund for those for
your purchase well in today's in-app

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870
your purchase well in today's in-app
 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.540
your purchase well in today's in-app
purchase world you get your money back

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550
purchase world you get your money back
 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.510
purchase world you get your money back
but you also keep your coins which is a

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520
but you also keep your coins which is a
 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.760
but you also keep your coins which is a
little bit weird when you think about

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770
little bit weird when you think about
 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.320
little bit weird when you think about
that in the physical world that would be

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330
that in the physical world that would be
 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.710
that in the physical world that would be
like going to buy a vacuum and wanting

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720
like going to buy a vacuum and wanting
 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.270
like going to buy a vacuum and wanting
to return the vacuum and get a refund

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280
to return the vacuum and get a refund
 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.010
to return the vacuum and get a refund
but actually keeping the vacuum and

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020
but actually keeping the vacuum and
 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.920
but actually keeping the vacuum and
that's a little bit weird and so when

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930
that's a little bit weird and so when
 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.479
that's a little bit weird and so when
you think about a good user who wants a

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489
you think about a good user who wants a
 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.690
you think about a good user who wants a
refund they should be willing we believe

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700
refund they should be willing we believe
 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.190
refund they should be willing we believe
that they should be willing to give up

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200
that they should be willing to give up
 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.070
that they should be willing to give up
their in-game currency and to get their

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080
their in-game currency and to get their
 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.760
their in-game currency and to get their
money back

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770
money back
 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.130
money back
now we think about the bad user and they

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140
now we think about the bad user and they
 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.050
now we think about the bad user and they
might not want to give up their currency

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060
might not want to give up their currency
 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.790
might not want to give up their currency
but it's still the right thing to do and

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800
but it's still the right thing to do and
 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.449
but it's still the right thing to do and
so in all cases both the good the good

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459
so in all cases both the good the good
 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.699
so in all cases both the good the good
user and the bad user giving up the

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709
user and the bad user giving up the
 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.770
user and the bad user giving up the
currency is the right thing to do and we

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780
currency is the right thing to do and we
 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.979
currency is the right thing to do and we
believe that so we took these two

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989
believe that so we took these two
 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.990
believe that so we took these two
principles and we combined them together

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000
principles and we combined them together
 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.430
principles and we combined them together
and we built an API and the API will

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440
and we built an API and the API will
 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.650
and we built an API and the API will
allow you the developer to access all of

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660
allow you the developer to access all of
 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.289
allow you the developer to access all of
your refunds for your games so that you

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299
your refunds for your games so that you
 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.060
your refunds for your games so that you
can take back the currency from the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070
can take back the currency from the
 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.800
can take back the currency from the
users whether they're good or they're

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810
users whether they're good or they're
 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.939
users whether they're good or they're
bad and make your game more balanced

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949
bad and make your game more balanced
 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.469
bad and make your game more balanced
and that's kind of the big product

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479
and that's kind of the big product
 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.999
and that's kind of the big product
announcement we have today so I'm going

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009
announcement we have today so I'm going

talk more about this so thanks John
so it's to Ferdie we're in the basement

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030
so it's to Ferdie we're in the basement
 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.490
so it's to Ferdie we're in the basement
and we're going to talk API school um

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500
and we're going to talk API school um
 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.369
and we're going to talk API school um
yes so what I'm going to do I'm gonna

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:43.379
yes so what I'm going to do I'm gonna
 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.439
yes so what I'm going to do I'm gonna
talk a little bit about like how generic

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449
talk a little bit about like how generic
 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.629
talk a little bit about like how generic
this API works then I'm going to give

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639
this API works then I'm going to give
 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.520
this API works then I'm going to give
you some examples we've been piloted for

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530
you some examples we've been piloted for
 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.770
you some examples we've been piloted for
about ten twelve months now and then

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780
about ten twelve months now and then
 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.270
about ten twelve months now and then
also give you some examples about how

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280
also give you some examples about how
 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.980
also give you some examples about how
some developers we work with have

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990
some developers we work with have
 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.050
some developers we work with have
actually implemented this and made huge

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060
actually implemented this and made huge
 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.939
actually implemented this and made huge
huge gains so I'll do a lot of

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949
huge gains so I'll do a lot of
 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.740
huge gains so I'll do a lot of
simplifications if you have any

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750
simplifications if you have any
 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.469
simplifications if you have any
questions go find Jonna me afterwards

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479
questions go find Jonna me afterwards
 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.249
questions go find Jonna me afterwards
and talk to us so the first thing we did

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259
and talk to us so the first thing we did
 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:09.869
and talk to us so the first thing we did
is we started looking at all the

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:09.879
is we started looking at all the
 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.939
is we started looking at all the
refunded orders right so these are

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949
refunded orders right so these are
 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.980
refunded orders right so these are
orders that you know either we gave a

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990
orders that you know either we gave a
 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.980
orders that you know either we gave a
refund for or that a bank has given a

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990
refund for or that a bank has given a
 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.260
refund for or that a bank has given a
charge back on and we were trying to

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270
charge back on and we were trying to
 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.179
charge back on and we were trying to
think about how can we get our

00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:21.189
think about how can we get our
 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:23.459
think about how can we get our
developers to know about these orders so

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469
developers to know about these orders so
 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.860
developers to know about these orders so
you can actually take that physical

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870
you can actually take that physical
 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.140
you can actually take that physical
vacuum cleaner back all right

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150
vacuum cleaner back all right
 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.610
vacuum cleaner back all right
so what we did is we actually let me

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620
so what we did is we actually let me
 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.809
so what we did is we actually let me
just walk you through an example so what

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819
just walk you through an example so what
 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.300
just walk you through an example so what
we did is we looked at all the other

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310
we did is we looked at all the other
 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.309
we did is we looked at all the other
refunded orders a user comes in to

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319
refunded orders a user comes in to
 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.619
refunded orders a user comes in to
Google Play maybe made a $10 purchase

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:40.629
Google Play maybe made a $10 purchase
 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.579
Google Play maybe made a $10 purchase
for 10,000 coins right if we approve a

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:44.589
for 10,000 coins right if we approve a
 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:46.680
for 10,000 coins right if we approve a
refund there what we do now is we store

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690
refund there what we do now is we store
 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.379
refund there what we do now is we store
those orders in a voided order table so

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389
those orders in a voided order table so
 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.019
those orders in a voided order table so
these orders are labeled as in do not

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:52.029
these orders are labeled as in do not
 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:54.689
these orders are labeled as in do not
deliver or clawback with the API which

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:54.699
deliver or clawback with the API which
 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:56.309
deliver or clawback with the API which
you can do as a developer you can call

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319
you can do as a developer you can call
 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.409
you can do as a developer you can call
this API it's called the voided

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419
this API it's called the voided
 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.809
this API it's called the voided
purchases API you can receive the data

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819
purchases API you can receive the data
 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.540
purchases API you can receive the data
on that order and you can then clawback

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550
on that order and you can then clawback
 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.369
on that order and you can then clawback
the item so what happens is the user

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379
the item so what happens is the user
 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.290
the item so what happens is the user
gets their B from the proof they get

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.300
gets their B from the proof they get
 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.260
gets their B from the proof they get
their $10 right but once you call it API

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270
their $10 right but once you call it API
 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.929
their $10 right but once you call it API
and you have that order you can take the

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:12.939
and you have that order you can take the
 

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.510
and you have that order you can take the
10,000 gems back so we learned that this

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520
10,000 gems back so we learned that this
 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.089
10,000 gems back so we learned that this
works really really well for refunds and

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099
works really really well for refunds and
 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.749
works really really well for refunds and
have a next slide on impact so be

00:06:21.749 --> 00:06:21.759
have a next slide on impact so be
 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.429
have a next slide on impact so be
extending it to other types of orders as

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:23.439
extending it to other types of orders as
 

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:25.709
extending it to other types of orders as
well we looked at cancellations we

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:25.719
well we looked at cancellations we
 

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:28.350
well we looked at cancellations we
looked at banks or issuers giving

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360
looked at banks or issuers giving
 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.540
looked at banks or issuers giving
chargebacks out and we added those as

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.550
chargebacks out and we added those as
 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.809
chargebacks out and we added those as
well and this works really really really

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819
well and this works really really really
 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:35.939
well and this works really really really
well for bad user it also works well for

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949
well for bad user it also works well for
 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.010
well for bad user it also works well for
good users because we believe that as a

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020
good users because we believe that as a
 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.600
good users because we believe that as a
good user you're okay getting back your

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610
good user you're okay getting back your
 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.300
good user you're okay getting back your
and willing to give up the coins that

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310
and willing to give up the coins that
 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.249
and willing to give up the coins that
you purchased with it so here's the

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259
you purchased with it so here's the
 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:47.230
you purchased with it so here's the
impact slide we've been partnering this

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240
impact slide we've been partnering this
 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.879
impact slide we've been partnering this
for about ten to twelve months but a

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889
for about ten to twelve months but a
 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.740
for about ten to twelve months but a
couple different developers we've seen

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750
couple different developers we've seen
 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.290
couple different developers we've seen
really really big impact everywhere so

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:53.300
really really big impact everywhere so
 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.300
really really big impact everywhere so
on average we see refunds decrees with

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310
on average we see refunds decrees with
 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.790
on average we see refunds decrees with
more than sixty percent in about you

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800
more than sixty percent in about you
 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.670
more than sixty percent in about you
know two to three months time because

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680
know two to three months time because
 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.409
know two to three months time because
what happens is it takes time for the

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419
what happens is it takes time for the
 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.119
what happens is it takes time for the
community and it's basically for abusers

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:04.129
community and it's basically for abusers
 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:06.850
community and it's basically for abusers
to find out that this abuse vector is

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860
to find out that this abuse vector is
 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.170
to find out that this abuse vector is
gone so now they get into a little bit

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:11.180
gone so now they get into a little bit
 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.670
gone so now they get into a little bit
more details because of course you want

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680
more details because of course you want
 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.010
more details because of course you want
to know how can I do this for my game so

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020
to know how can I do this for my game so
 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.140
to know how can I do this for my game so
this is an early access API so you have

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150
this is an early access API so you have
 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.580
this is an early access API so you have
to sign up and we'll show you a link

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590
to sign up and we'll show you a link
 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.950
to sign up and we'll show you a link
later on and also send you the detailed

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960
later on and also send you the detailed
 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.420
later on and also send you the detailed
documentation so you don't have to take

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.430
documentation so you don't have to take
 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.029
documentation so you don't have to take
pictures of this but broadly how imports

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039
pictures of this but broadly how imports
 

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.300
pictures of this but broadly how imports
is um you give us the start time and the

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:28.310
is um you give us the start time and the
 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.100
is um you give us the start time and the
end time of a time period for which you

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110
end time of a time period for which you
 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.749
end time of a time period for which you
want to have all the voided purchases

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759
want to have all the voided purchases
 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:35.110
want to have all the voided purchases
call our API we give you back a list of

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120
call our API we give you back a list of
 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.200
call our API we give you back a list of
orders keyed by purchase token and then

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.210
orders keyed by purchase token and then
 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.149
orders keyed by purchase token and then
what you can do with that is you can use

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:40.159
what you can do with that is you can use
 

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:43.809
what you can do with that is you can use
that to revoke access to to those orders

00:07:43.809 --> 00:07:43.819
that to revoke access to to those orders
 

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:46.480
that to revoke access to to those orders
let's talk me a little bit about like

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:46.490
let's talk me a little bit about like
 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.800
let's talk me a little bit about like
the three different approaches that

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:47.810
the three different approaches that
 

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.089
the three different approaches that
we've seen developers use our data I'll

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:52.099
we've seen developers use our data I'll
 

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:53.920
we've seen developers use our data I'll
go from really really simple to more

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:53.930
go from really really simple to more
 

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.170
go from really really simple to more
complicated so the simplest way is user

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:56.180
complicated so the simplest way is user
 

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.809
complicated so the simplest way is user
purchases something like 10,000 coins

00:07:58.809 --> 00:07:58.819
purchases something like 10,000 coins
 

00:07:58.819 --> 00:08:01.719
purchases something like 10,000 coins
for ten dollars right we send you the

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:01.729
for ten dollars right we send you the
 

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:04.689
for ten dollars right we send you the
voided order and what happens is you

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:04.699
voided order and what happens is you
 

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:07.480
voided order and what happens is you
claw back exactly those 10,000 gems from

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:07.490
claw back exactly those 10,000 gems from
 

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:09.610
claw back exactly those 10,000 gems from
the users balance so the user is now the

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:09.620
the users balance so the user is now the
 

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.100
the users balance so the user is now the
current ban is minus 10,000 but of

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.110
current ban is minus 10,000 but of
 

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.589
current ban is minus 10,000 but of
course there's many many games where you

00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599
course there's many many games where you
 

00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:16.570
course there's many many games where you
don't only get 10,000 gems but you get

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:16.580
don't only get 10,000 gems but you get
 

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.329
don't only get 10,000 gems but you get
10,000 gems plus like one or two or

00:08:19.329 --> 00:08:19.339
10,000 gems plus like one or two or
 

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:21.459
10,000 gems plus like one or two or
maybe three special characters so that's

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:21.469
maybe three special characters so that's
 

00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:22.959
maybe three special characters so that's
that's the second case that we've seen

00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:22.969
that's the second case that we've seen
 

00:08:22.969 --> 00:08:25.420
that's the second case that we've seen
is where developers say we don't only

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:25.430
is where developers say we don't only
 

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.999
is where developers say we don't only
clawback the 10,000 gems but also we

00:08:27.999 --> 00:08:28.009
clawback the 10,000 gems but also we
 

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:30.189
clawback the 10,000 gems but also we
take anything that we added on to that

00:08:30.189 --> 00:08:30.199
take anything that we added on to that
 

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:32.709
take anything that we added on to that
some special powers special characters

00:08:32.709 --> 00:08:32.719
some special powers special characters
 

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:35.740
some special powers special characters
and the claw toes back as well the first

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:35.750
and the claw toes back as well the first
 

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.870
and the claw toes back as well the first
case that we see is I guess the most

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:37.880
case that we see is I guess the most
 

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.509
case that we see is I guess the most
complicated case is where you take

00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519
complicated case is where you take
 

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:43.240
complicated case is where you take
snapshots of the user state at the

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.250
snapshots of the user state at the
 

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.370
snapshots of the user state at the
moment of purchase so say this user

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:45.380
moment of purchase so say this user
 

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.189
moment of purchase so say this user
bought these 10,000 gems say two weeks

00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:48.199
bought these 10,000 gems say two weeks
 

00:08:48.199 --> 00:08:50.769
bought these 10,000 gems say two weeks
ago and with those 10,000 gems was able

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:50.779
ago and with those 10,000 gems was able
 

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:53.290
ago and with those 10,000 gems was able
to get two special characters and go up

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:53.300
to get two special characters and go up
 

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.130
to get two special characters and go up
three levels

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:54.140
three levels
 

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.560
three levels
what we've seen is developers who then

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:56.570
what we've seen is developers who then
 

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.540
what we've seen is developers who then
when they get to reform of order take

00:08:58.540 --> 00:08:58.550
when they get to reform of order take
 

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.210
when they get to reform of order take
the user back two weeks right and then

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:01.220
the user back two weeks right and then
 

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.040
the user back two weeks right and then
the user is actually back three levels

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:03.050
the user is actually back three levels
 

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.870
the user is actually back three levels
loses their two to three special

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:04.880
loses their two to three special
 

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.370
loses their two to three special
characters and lose it at ten thousand

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:06.380
characters and lose it at ten thousand
 

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.470
characters and lose it at ten thousand
gems so this worked really well in

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480
gems so this worked really well in
 

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.750
gems so this worked really well in
stopping abuse and we also really

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:10.760
stopping abuse and we also really
 

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.010
stopping abuse and we also really
believe that this works really really

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:12.020
believe that this works really really
 

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:15.370
believe that this works really really
well for good users so the gain axis of

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:15.380
well for good users so the gain axis of
 

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.600
well for good users so the gain axis of
course you need to have a developer

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:16.610
course you need to have a developer
 

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:18.190
course you need to have a developer
account registered with Google Play and

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:18.200
account registered with Google Play and
 

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.050
account registered with Google Play and
you need to have a game that accepts

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:20.060
you need to have a game that accepts
 

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.930
you need to have a game that accepts
in-app purchases so if you want to get

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:22.940
in-app purchases so if you want to get
 

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.810
in-app purchases so if you want to get
started this is the point where I would

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:25.820
started this is the point where I would
 

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.970
started this is the point where I would
take a picture because we don't have

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:27.980
take a picture because we don't have
 

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.890
take a picture because we don't have
this but there's a form that you can

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:29.900
this but there's a form that you can
 

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.110
this but there's a form that you can
fill out and then we'll whitelist you

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.120
fill out and then we'll whitelist you
 

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:35.770
fill out and then we'll whitelist you
for early access so John and I are like

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:35.780
for early access so John and I are like

really really excited to work with you
 

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.790
really really excited to work with you
on this I think this is just the start

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800
on this I think this is just the start
 

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.410
on this I think this is just the start
for us of getting a more balanced

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:41.420
for us of getting a more balanced
 

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.020
for us of getting a more balanced
economy where we really try to make the

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:44.030
economy where we really try to make the
 

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.510
economy where we really try to make the
online experience as fair and as

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:46.520
online experience as fair and as
 

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.310
online experience as fair and as
balanced as it is offline when you buy

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320
balanced as it is offline when you buy
 

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.230
balanced as it is offline when you buy
your vacuum cleaner so kind of going

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240
your vacuum cleaner so kind of going
 

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.630
your vacuum cleaner so kind of going
back to you know the goals we had in the

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640
back to you know the goals we had in the
 

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.250
back to you know the goals we had in the
beginning right we started to create a

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:54.260
beginning right we started to create a
 

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.770
beginning right we started to create a
more balanced in a purchase economy by

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:56.780
more balanced in a purchase economy by
 

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.480
more balanced in a purchase economy by
allowing you to clawback these items

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:58.490
allowing you to clawback these items
 

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.910
allowing you to clawback these items
we're allowing access to all developers

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:00.920
we're allowing access to all developers
 

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.920
we're allowing access to all developers
it's early access now but I'm thinking

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:02.930
it's early access now but I'm thinking
 

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:04.660
it's early access now but I'm thinking
maybe next quarter will open up for

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:04.670
maybe next quarter will open up for
 

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.610
maybe next quarter will open up for
everybody everything goes well and this

part of integrating this API is not the

API it is deciding the right way to
 

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:28.690
API it is deciding the right way to
remove the items from your player so

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:28.700
remove the items from your player so
 

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.090

pull those stones or those Gacha items
 

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:41.890
pull those stones or those Gacha items
away from them and for example in our

and has availability you can hand it off
 

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.330
and has availability you can hand it off
to them and they'd have it done in an

the reason why I say running an ad-hoc

started out fine got into terrible abuse
problems and then

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:55.710
problems and then
 

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.610
problems and then
with hard work managed to get back to a

00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620
with hard work managed to get back to a
 

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.230
with hard work managed to get back to a
more even playing field we have

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240
more even playing field we have
 

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:02.510

when we started bringing all of the kind

00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:06.390
when we started bringing all of the kind
 

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.870
when we started bringing all of the kind
of fraud back into check and removing

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880
of fraud back into check and removing
 

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.700
of fraud back into check and removing

items from them they're like the writing
 

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.440
items from them they're like the writing
and going hey thank you for doing this I

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:12.450
and going hey thank you for doing this I
 

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:13.640
and going hey thank you for doing this I
didn't realize that somebody in my

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:13.650
didn't realize that somebody in my
 

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:15.410
didn't realize that somebody in my
alliance was doing this and we have zero

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:15.420
alliance was doing this and we have zero
 

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.680
alliance was doing this and we have zero
tolerance for that and being thanked for

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:18.690
tolerance for that and being thanked for
 

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.420
tolerance for that and being thanked for
that was a very odd experience it was

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:20.430
that was a very odd experience it was
 

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.070
that was a very odd experience it was
not the response I was expecting to see

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080
not the response I was expecting to see
 

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.370
not the response I was expecting to see
and it's because you're leveling the

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:25.380
and it's because you're leveling the
 

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.750
and it's because you're leveling the
playing field and they no longer feel

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760
playing field and they no longer feel
 

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:28.270
playing field and they no longer feel
like they're playing against themselves

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:28.280
like they're playing against themselves
 

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.610
like they're playing against themselves
yeah that's a that's a really good point

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:30.620
yeah that's a that's a really good point
 

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.840
yeah that's a that's a really good point
you know I think the beauty and the

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:32.850
you know I think the beauty and the
 

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.940
you know I think the beauty and the
simplicity of this API is that you get

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:34.950
simplicity of this API is that you get
 

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:37.400
simplicity of this API is that you get
to take you know what is a very simple

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:37.410
to take you know what is a very simple
 

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.800
to take you know what is a very simple
process which is a refund and apply it

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:39.810
process which is a refund and apply it
 

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.420
process which is a refund and apply it
in the right way to your game because

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:41.430
in the right way to your game because
 

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:43.310
in the right way to your game because
everybody here has a game that's

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320
everybody here has a game that's
 

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.650
everybody here has a game that's
different from each other and it would

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:45.660
different from each other and it would
 

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.540
different from each other and it would
be hard to say like apply this one way

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:47.550
be hard to say like apply this one way
 

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.390
be hard to say like apply this one way
this one method to revoking a currency

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400
this one method to revoking a currency
 

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.130
this one method to revoking a currency
and so you I think have done a really

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140
and so you I think have done a really
 

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.200
and so you I think have done a really
great job of applying this in your game

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.210
great job of applying this in your game
 

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:55.370
great job of applying this in your game
in a way that makes sense for your

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380
in a way that makes sense for your
 

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.520
in a way that makes sense for your
community Emily you're less sort of

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:58.530
community Emily you're less sort of
 

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:00.140
community Emily you're less sort of
familiar with the API I think and like

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:00.150
familiar with the API I think and like
 

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.640
familiar with the API I think and like
wanted to get your initial fee no I'm

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:01.650
wanted to get your initial fee no I'm
 

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:04.370
wanted to get your initial fee no I'm
only familiar with our attempts on web

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:04.380
only familiar with our attempts on web
 

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:06.380
only familiar with our attempts on web
to do something similar so but I'm

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:06.390
to do something similar so but I'm
 

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.510
to do something similar so but I'm
really excited that basically from the

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520
really excited that basically from the
 

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.090
really excited that basically from the
moment that we came to mobile we were

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:10.100
moment that we came to mobile we were
 

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.500
moment that we came to mobile we were
looking to figure out if there was a way

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:12.510
looking to figure out if there was a way
 

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:13.940
looking to figure out if there was a way
we could do something like this and

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:13.950
we could do something like this and
 

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.620
we could do something like this and
there wasn't and now I can't tell you

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:15.630
there wasn't and now I can't tell you
 

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.960
there wasn't and now I can't tell you
how excited I am it's available we're

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:17.970
how excited I am it's available we're
 

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.150
how excited I am it's available we're
excited for you yeah I think maybe

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:20.160
excited for you yeah I think maybe
 

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.190
excited for you yeah I think maybe
taking it a little bit step back into

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200
taking it a little bit step back into
 

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.070
taking it a little bit step back into
conversation we're talking about good

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080
conversation we're talking about good
 

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.140
conversation we're talking about good
users versus bad users right so there's

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:27.150
users versus bad users right so there's
 

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:30.020
users versus bad users right so there's
always a small percentage of bad users

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:30.030
always a small percentage of bad users
 

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.080
always a small percentage of bad users
they will always keep on trying for

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.090
they will always keep on trying for
 

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:36.020
they will always keep on trying for
different types of motives right so how

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:36.030
different types of motives right so how
 

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.660
different types of motives right so how
do you deal with those like do you try

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:38.670
do you deal with those like do you try
 

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.420
do you deal with those like do you try
to identify them and then what are some

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:41.430
to identify them and then what are some
 

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:44.330
to identify them and then what are some
different mechanisms that you use Emily

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:44.340
different mechanisms that you use Emily
 

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.740
different mechanisms that you use Emily
maybe you want to want to go first yeah

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:45.750
maybe you want to want to go first yeah
 

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:50.710
maybe you want to want to go first yeah
you know nothing is ever have proof and

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720
you know nothing is ever have proof and
 

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.580
you know nothing is ever have proof and
so oh and you could work on it forever

00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:54.590
so oh and you could work on it forever
 

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.340
so oh and you could work on it forever
what how we organize our time is to

00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:58.350
what how we organize our time is to
 

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.680
what how we organize our time is to
think about what's the level of impact

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:00.690
think about what's the level of impact
 

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.520
think about what's the level of impact
of the cheating

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:02.530
of the cheating
 

00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:04.080
of the cheating
that comes down is going to be very

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:04.090
that comes down is going to be very
 

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.930
that comes down is going to be very

of it comes down to are you cheating
your own experience are you cheating

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:10.810
your own experience are you cheating
 

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:15.440
your own experience are you cheating
other people's experience the amount of

other people's experience the amount of
 

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:17.880
other people's experience the amount of
fraud and cheating that will tolerate in

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:17.890
fraud and cheating that will tolerate in
 

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:21.120
fraud and cheating that will tolerate in
a competitive multiplayer game is really

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.130
a competitive multiplayer game is really
 

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:23.850
a competitive multiplayer game is really

progress we would like to stop that but
 

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.700
progress we would like to stop that but
we're not going to put as much effort

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:38.710
we're not going to put as much effort
 

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:41.100
we're not going to put as much effort
into it it's not undermining the fun of

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.110
into it it's not undermining the fun of
 

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:45.000
into it it's not undermining the fun of
the game for other people so it's it's

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.010
the game for other people so it's it's
 

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:47.190
the game for other people so it's it's
more situational how much effort we'll

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200
more situational how much effort we'll
 

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:52.470
more situational how much effort we'll
put into it um and the you know there's

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480
put into it um and the you know there's
 

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.360
put into it um and the you know there's
situations that are sort of in between

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:54.370
situations that are sort of in between
 

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.480
situations that are sort of in between
like leaderboards for example in a

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:57.490
like leaderboards for example in a
 

00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.730
like leaderboards for example in a
single-player game that is you know if

00:24:59.730 --> 00:24:59.740
single-player game that is you know if
 

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.470
single-player game that is you know if
you you're playing a game and you see

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:01.480
you you're playing a game and you see
 

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.150
you you're playing a game and you see
nothing but hack scores and the

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:03.160
nothing but hack scores and the
 

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.030
nothing but hack scores and the
leaderboard it's not changing most of

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:06.040
leaderboard it's not changing most of
 

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.730
leaderboard it's not changing most of
your your feeling but then it cheapens

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:08.740
your your feeling but then it cheapens
 

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.950
your your feeling but then it cheapens
your your accomplishment so that's a a

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:10.960
your your accomplishment so that's a a
 

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.400
your your accomplishment so that's a a
lighter touch than a TV you know a pvp

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:14.410
lighter touch than a TV you know a pvp
 

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.770
lighter touch than a TV you know a pvp
competitive multiplayer game but it's

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:16.780
competitive multiplayer game but it's
 

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.140

can't stop it but what we we've done is
 

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.470
can't stop it but what we we've done is
sort of we identify what we think are

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:25.480
sort of we identify what we think are
 

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.710
sort of we identify what we think are
the cheater scores and we show cheater

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720
the cheater scores and we show cheater
 

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.840
the cheater scores and we show cheater
leaderboards to cheaters and we show

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:30.850
leaderboards to cheaters and we show
 

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:32.700
leaderboards to cheaters and we show
non-shooter leaderboards to everybody

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:32.710
non-shooter leaderboards to everybody
 

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:34.890

and get their fun out of that and then
 

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.610
and get their fun out of that and then
people who aren't cheaters get it get a

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:38.620
people who aren't cheaters get it get a
 

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.560
people who aren't cheaters get it get a
true experience and that's how we manage

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:40.570
true experience and that's how we manage
 

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.230
true experience and that's how we manage
it in that situation but but in other

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240
it in that situation but but in other
 

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.490
it in that situation but but in other
situations will be much more

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:44.500
situations will be much more
 

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.870
situations will be much more
zero-tolerance oh you're telling me that

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880
zero-tolerance oh you're telling me that
 

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.030
zero-tolerance oh you're telling me that
my high score that I see all the time

my high score that I see all the time
 

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.250
my high score that I see all the time
actually not a real high score but I

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:50.260
actually not a real high score but I
 

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.110
actually not a real high score but I
fall into the cheater boards uh if

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:52.120
fall into the cheater boards uh if
 

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.030
fall into the cheater boards uh if
you've been cheating ya know when you

legitimate of this level yeah but I
guess I guess in all seriousness what

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:06.190

various degrees of that and when it
impacts my good users to a certain

impacts my good users to a certain
 

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.570
impacts my good users to a certain
extent we talked about like Wars of

extent we talked about like Wars of
 

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.270
extent we talked about like Wars of
different clay

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:16.280
different clay
 

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.370
different clay
hands were like groups together that's

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:18.380
hands were like groups together that's
 

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.740
hands were like groups together that's
when it impacts the bad the right a bad

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:20.750
when it impacts the bad the right a bad
 

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.770
when it impacts the bad the right a bad
news about the good users and and its is

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:23.780
news about the good users and and its is
 

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.870
news about the good users and and its is
it impacting your your sense is it

impacting somebody else's progress
 

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:30.550
impacting somebody else's progress
that's much worse than impacting

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:30.560
that's much worse than impacting
 

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.550
that's much worse than impacting
somebody's sense of achievement and yeah

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:33.560
somebody's sense of achievement and yeah

Regine we were talking about this

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:35.600
Regine we were talking about this
 

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.210
Regine we were talking about this
earlier and you were you were talking

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:37.220
earlier and you were you were talking
 

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.830
earlier and you were you were talking
about some crafty ways that you guys

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:38.840
about some crafty ways that you guys
 

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.810
about some crafty ways that you guys
handled cheaters and some of the ways

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:40.820
handled cheaters and some of the ways
 

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.250
handled cheaters and some of the ways
that you sort of pooled them together I

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:42.260
that you sort of pooled them together I
 

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.450
that you sort of pooled them together I
don't know if you want to share some of

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:43.460
don't know if you want to share some of
 

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.270
don't know if you want to share some of
your experiences they're very similar to

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:46.280
your experiences they're very similar to
 

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.080
your experiences they're very similar to
what she does oh so it's something that

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.090
what she does oh so it's something that
 

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.790
what she does oh so it's something that
apparently we all haven't talked about

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:51.800
apparently we all haven't talked about
 

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.320
apparently we all haven't talked about
but I have a feeling we've been removing

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:53.330
but I have a feeling we've been removing
 

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:54.970
but I have a feeling we've been removing
cheaters from leaderboards for a very

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:54.980
cheaters from leaderboards for a very
 

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.220
cheaters from leaderboards for a very
long time but showing it to them so they

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:57.230
long time but showing it to them so they
 

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:58.840
long time but showing it to them so they
continue to think that they're on it and

00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:58.850
continue to think that they're on it and
 

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.820
continue to think that they're on it and
not try and find other ways to exploit

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:00.830
not try and find other ways to exploit
 

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:04.120
not try and find other ways to exploit
issues but even beyond that it goes

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:04.130
issues but even beyond that it goes
 

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.220
issues but even beyond that it goes
right even down to kids games right you

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:06.230
right even down to kids games right you
 

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:07.900
right even down to kids games right you
have kids cursing in games and what you

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:07.910
have kids cursing in games and what you
 

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.210
have kids cursing in games and what you
do is you actually show them the curse

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:10.220
do is you actually show them the curse
 

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:11.740
do is you actually show them the curse
words to themselves so they get a kick

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:11.750
words to themselves so they get a kick
 

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.300
words to themselves so they get a kick
out of it but you don't show it to the

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:13.310
out of it but you don't show it to the
 

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.500
out of it but you don't show it to the
rest of your players because you're

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:14.510
rest of your players because you're
 

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:16.030
rest of your players because you're
impacting the majority of your player

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:16.040
impacting the majority of your player
 

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.860
impacting the majority of your player
base and in same thing goes with

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:17.870
base and in same thing goes with
 

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:20.290
base and in same thing goes with
cheating if someone is actually using

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:20.300
cheating if someone is actually using
 

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.540
cheating if someone is actually using
scores and they're continually running

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:22.550
scores and they're continually running
 

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.190
scores and they're continually running
up the leaderboard and they look a

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:24.200
up the leaderboard and they look a
 

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.440
up the leaderboard and they look a
little bit out of out of whack you move

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:26.450
little bit out of out of whack you move
 

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:27.790
little bit out of out of whack you move
them into a different leaderboard but

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:27.800
them into a different leaderboard but
 

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.440
them into a different leaderboard but
that's actually how we engaged with you

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:29.450
that's actually how we engaged with you
 

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.050
that's actually how we engaged with you
to begin with we monitor everything in

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:32.060
to begin with we monitor everything in
 

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:34.210
to begin with we monitor everything in
our in our economy and we found somebody

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:34.220
our in our economy and we found somebody
 

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:38.050
our in our economy and we found somebody
who is incredibly out of whack is the

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:38.060
who is incredibly out of whack is the

only way to describe it we look at our

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:39.920
only way to describe it we look at our
 

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.650
only way to describe it we look at our
numbers every single week and we know

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:41.660
numbers every single week and we know
 

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.780
numbers every single week and we know
how many gems they have how many

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:43.790
how many gems they have how many
 

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.610
how many gems they have how many
diamonds they have how many items they

00:27:45.610 --> 00:27:45.620
diamonds they have how many items they
 

00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:47.290
diamonds they have how many items they
have how many items they should have and

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:47.300
have how many items they should have and
 

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.440
have how many items they should have and
given this it was leaps and bounds

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:50.450
given this it was leaps and bounds
 

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:51.700
given this it was leaps and bounds

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:53.690
and you know it was one of those things

they have done it and how out of whack
the economy was that we were able to

do you ever straight out ban users at

do you ever straight out ban users at
 

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:13.090
do you ever straight out ban users at

just a little bit of an advantage and

those are the people that we look at

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:30.860
those are the people that we look at
 

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.289
those are the people that we look at
when we say okay this person is not a

when we say okay this person is not a
 

00:29:32.299 --> 00:29:34.330

good person they are not there to play

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:34.340
good person they are not there to play
 

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.950
good person they are not there to play
they're not there to enjoy it they're

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:35.960
they're not there to enjoy it they're
 

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.419
they're not there to enjoy it they're
there to exploit the systems and they

00:29:37.419 --> 00:29:37.429
there to exploit the systems and they
 

00:29:37.429 --> 00:29:39.039
there to exploit the systems and they
exploit other players and that's why we

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:39.049
exploit other players and that's why we
 

00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:41.350
exploit other players and that's why we
ban I think that's actually a pretty

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360
ban I think that's actually a pretty
 

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.499
ban I think that's actually a pretty
good segue to a next question it is so

00:29:44.499 --> 00:29:44.509
good segue to a next question it is so
 

00:29:44.509 --> 00:29:46.869
good segue to a next question it is so
we're going to launch this API everybody

00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:46.879
we're going to launch this API everybody
 

00:29:46.879 --> 00:29:48.850
we're going to launch this API everybody
is going to sign up what would you

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:48.860
is going to sign up what would you
 

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.610
is going to sign up what would you
advise other developers to like how to

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:51.620
advise other developers to like how to
 

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.110
advise other developers to like how to
charge you to start thinking about fair

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120
charge you to start thinking about fair
 

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:55.450

play what is it like the one two three
 

00:29:55.460 --> 00:30:00.789
play what is it like the one two three
of yeah yeah I mean the there's pretty

00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799
of yeah yeah I mean the there's pretty
 

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:04.240
of yeah yeah I mean the there's pretty
extreme examples depending on on the

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:04.250
extreme examples depending on on the
 

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:07.180
extreme examples depending on on the
type of game adventure capitalist is so

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:07.190
type of game adventure capitalist is so
 

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.090
type of game adventure capitalist is so
different from any other space case yeah

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:10.100
different from any other space case yeah
 

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.810
different from any other space case yeah
an RTS that the the level to which you

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:13.820
an RTS that the the level to which you
 

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.430
an RTS that the the level to which you
need to do things is very different I

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:15.440
need to do things is very different I
 

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.190
need to do things is very different I
mean I think the principle of what's the

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200
mean I think the principle of what's the
 

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.409

impact to others as in how you deal with
 

00:30:20.419 --> 00:30:23.740
impact to others as in how you deal with
it is it's a good guiding principle but

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:23.750
it is it's a good guiding principle but
 

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.869
it is it's a good guiding principle but
to get I don't think I can give you

00:30:25.869 --> 00:30:25.879
to get I don't think I can give you
 

00:30:25.879 --> 00:30:27.970
to get I don't think I can give you
anything more detailed than that because

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:27.980
anything more detailed than that because
 

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:29.889
anything more detailed than that because
it really is about your game and

00:30:29.889 --> 00:30:29.899
it really is about your game and
 

00:30:29.899 --> 00:30:31.769
it really is about your game and
different and different developers have

different and different developers have
 

00:30:31.779 --> 00:30:35.680
different and different developers have
different tolerances and like ways they

different tolerances and like ways they

or more authoritarian and do you you

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:44.780
or more authoritarian and do you you

probably implement the API differently

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:53.780
probably implement the API differently
 

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:55.870
probably implement the API differently
yeah I think but just to give like want

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:55.880
yeah I think but just to give like want
 

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.640
yeah I think but just to give like want
it but we've typically done in our in

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:57.650
it but we've typically done in our in
 

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:00.010
it but we've typically done in our in
our pilots is one to two weeks of data

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:00.020
our pilots is one to two weeks of data
 

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.260
our pilots is one to two weeks of data
analysis so just looking at histograms

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:02.270
analysis so just looking at histograms
 

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.570
analysis so just looking at histograms
of you know where are the outliers of

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:04.580
of you know where are the outliers of
 

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:08.680
of you know where are the outliers of
people or countries or levels where it

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:08.690
people or countries or levels where it
 

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:11.650
people or countries or levels where it
really looks like really really bad and

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:11.660
really looks like really really bad and
 

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.970
really looks like really really bad and
then I think the second thing you do is

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:12.980
then I think the second thing you do is
 

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.990
then I think the second thing you do is
like if you see lot of volume there how

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000
like if you see lot of volume there how
 

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.640
like if you see lot of volume there how
does it impact others that's kind of

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:18.650
does it impact others that's kind of
 

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.530
does it impact others that's kind of
that's probably good way to think about

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:20.540
that's probably good way to think about
 

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.050
that's probably good way to think about
it and then how would you change your

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:23.060
it and then how would you change your
 

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.210
it and then how would you change your
game economy with the new information to

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:25.220
game economy with the new information to
 

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.000
game economy with the new information to
have to stop that egregious behavior I'd

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.010
have to stop that egregious behavior I'd
 

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:30.820
have to stop that egregious behavior I'd
also want to look at why I for example

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:30.830
also want to look at why I for example
 

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.650
also want to look at why I for example
if you're running a gotcha game and your

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:32.660
if you're running a gotcha game and your
 

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:35.410
if you're running a gotcha game and your
drop rates are far too low that it's

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:35.420
drop rates are far too low that it's
 

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.030
drop rates are far too low that it's
time to look at your gotcha rates if

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:37.040
time to look at your gotcha rates if
 

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.620
time to look at your gotcha rates if
your your gotcha rates are far too low

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:38.630
your your gotcha rates are far too low
 

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:41.080
your your gotcha rates are far too low
and your refunds are far too high it's

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:41.090
and your refunds are far too high it's
 

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.700
and your refunds are far too high it's
time to have a conversation I gets back

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:42.710
time to have a conversation I gets back
 

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:46.030
time to have a conversation I gets back
to actually to trust and to to fairness

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:46.040
to actually to trust and to to fairness
 

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:49.240
to actually to trust and to to fairness
is if players don't trust you they're

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:49.250
is if players don't trust you they're
 

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.790
is if players don't trust you they're
more likely to cheat it all they're also

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:51.800
more likely to cheat it all they're also
 

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.080

things we've touched on in a few of

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:02.840
things we've touched on in a few of
 

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.390
things we've touched on in a few of
these conversations has been the role of

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:04.400
these conversations has been the role of
 

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:07.870
these conversations has been the role of
community and what that means for fair

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880
community and what that means for fair
 

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:09.970
community and what that means for fair
play and they they sort of go hand in

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:09.980
play and they they sort of go hand in
 

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.220

your community people are going to leave
 

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.330
your community people are going to leave
and potentially abandon your game but

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:16.340
and potentially abandon your game but
 

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.460
and potentially abandon your game but

could you tell me the how you think
 

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.140
could you tell me the how you think
about approaching community and the role

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:20.150
about approaching community and the role
 

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:21.910
about approaching community and the role
that it plays when you consider fair

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:21.920
that it plays when you consider fair
 

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:24.730

play in your games you want to take a

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:24.740
play in your games you want to take a
 

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.730
play in your games you want to take a
first story and I mean I guess shortly

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:27.740
first story and I mean I guess shortly
 

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:31.420
first story and I mean I guess shortly
at what I would say is our goal is

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:31.430
at what I would say is our goal is

say a game above a pedestrian experience

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600
say a game above a pedestrian experience
 

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.710
say a game above a pedestrian experience
it makes it you continue to play a game

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:50.720

you have an emotional connection to the
game and that's something that you get

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:00.260
game and that's something that you get
 

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.000
game and that's something that you get
from community and so you know fairness

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.010
from community and so you know fairness
 

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.040
from community and so you know fairness
is a means to that end

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:06.050
is a means to that end
 

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.120
is a means to that end
and and that's how I would how I think

growing obviously and when you think

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:47.420
growing obviously and when you think
 

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.090

about it at that scale you say how can I

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:49.100
about it at that scale you say how can I

one of the things were always into is

00:35:40.969 --> 00:35:40.979
one of the things were always into is
 

00:35:40.979 --> 00:35:44.029
one of the things were always into is
measuring and so do you in this

00:35:44.029 --> 00:35:44.039
measuring and so do you in this
 

00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:47.150
measuring and so do you in this
community and this trust aspect how do

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160
community and this trust aspect how do
 

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.370
community and this trust aspect how do
you measure community trust or do you

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380
you measure community trust or do you
 

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.239
you measure community trust or do you
measure it because I'm sure some

00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:50.249
measure it because I'm sure some
 

00:35:50.249 --> 00:35:51.979
measure it because I'm sure some
developers are in the audience thinking

00:35:51.979 --> 00:35:51.989
developers are in the audience thinking
 

00:35:51.989 --> 00:35:54.019
developers are in the audience thinking
like you know like I could spend an

00:35:54.019 --> 00:35:54.029
like you know like I could spend an
 

00:35:54.029 --> 00:35:55.999
like you know like I could spend an
extra effort like go through like

00:35:55.999 --> 00:35:56.009
extra effort like go through like
 

00:35:56.009 --> 00:35:58.130
extra effort like go through like
providing twitch streams and providing

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.140
providing twitch streams and providing
 

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.529
providing twitch streams and providing
kind of 24/7 support but how do you

00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:00.539
kind of 24/7 support but how do you
 

00:36:00.539 --> 00:36:03.259
kind of 24/7 support but how do you
measure the community trust or sentiment

00:36:03.259 --> 00:36:03.269
measure the community trust or sentiment
 

00:36:03.269 --> 00:36:05.599
measure the community trust or sentiment
if you do player purchases retention

00:36:05.599 --> 00:36:05.609
if you do player purchases retention
 

00:36:05.609 --> 00:36:08.569
if you do player purchases retention
lifetime value and you can throw it

00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:08.579
lifetime value and you can throw it
 

00:36:08.579 --> 00:36:11.390
lifetime value and you can throw it
right in relations - absolutely if you

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400
right in relations - absolutely if you
 

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.339
right in relations - absolutely if you
looked at a lifetime value of a company

00:36:13.339 --> 00:36:13.349
looked at a lifetime value of a company
 

00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:14.660
looked at a lifetime value of a company
that doesn't have support versus a

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:14.670
that doesn't have support versus a
 

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.249
that doesn't have support versus a
company that does have support you would

00:36:16.249 --> 00:36:16.259
company that does have support you would
 

00:36:16.259 --> 00:36:18.620
company that does have support you would
find it significantly higher for

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:18.630
find it significantly higher for
 

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.249
find it significantly higher for
community events live events in game it

00:36:22.249 --> 00:36:22.259
community events live events in game it
 

00:36:22.259 --> 00:36:24.380
community events live events in game it
shows that it's active and alive and

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:24.390
shows that it's active and alive and
 

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.319
shows that it's active and alive and
they're willing to stay for that oh yeah

00:36:27.319 --> 00:36:27.329
they're willing to stay for that oh yeah
 

00:36:27.329 --> 00:36:30.529
they're willing to stay for that oh yeah
I would say it's it's hard to measure

00:36:30.529 --> 00:36:30.539
I would say it's it's hard to measure
 

00:36:30.539 --> 00:36:34.609
I would say it's it's hard to measure
directly retention is going to be the

00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619
directly retention is going to be the
 

00:36:34.619 --> 00:36:37.219
directly retention is going to be the
the best measure by far long-term

00:36:37.219 --> 00:36:37.229
the best measure by far long-term
 

00:36:37.229 --> 00:36:39.009
the best measure by far long-term
retention obviously not not short-term

00:36:39.009 --> 00:36:39.019
retention obviously not not short-term
 

00:36:39.019 --> 00:36:41.569
retention obviously not not short-term
and one of the things that we like to

00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579
and one of the things that we like to
 

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:44.749
and one of the things that we like to
look at is momentum on and look at RIT

00:36:44.749 --> 00:36:44.759
look at is momentum on and look at RIT
 

00:36:44.759 --> 00:36:49.249
look at is momentum on and look at RIT
not pure retention but looking at ratios

00:36:49.249 --> 00:36:49.259
not pure retention but looking at ratios
 

00:36:49.259 --> 00:36:51.700
not pure retention but looking at ratios
of retention so how you know what's your

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:51.710
of retention so how you know what's your
 

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.440
of retention so how you know what's your
your change from D 7 to D 30 what's your

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:54.450
your change from D 7 to D 30 what's your
 

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.420
your change from D 7 to D 30 what's your
change from D 30 to D 90 because

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:56.430
change from D 30 to D 90 because
 

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:57.950
change from D 30 to D 90 because
different games and different genres are

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:57.960
different games and different genres are
 

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.299
different games and different genres are
going to have different baselines but

00:36:59.299 --> 00:36:59.309
going to have different baselines but
 

00:36:59.309 --> 00:37:01.370
going to have different baselines but
that tells you a lot about that

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:01.380
that tells you a lot about that
 

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.640
that tells you a lot about that
experience so that's one way of looking

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:04.650
experience so that's one way of looking
 

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.410
experience so that's one way of looking
at it but that's still a lot of that is

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:06.420
at it but that's still a lot of that is
 

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.489
at it but that's still a lot of that is
going to come down to the game you know

00:37:10.489 --> 00:37:10.499
going to come down to the game you know
 

00:37:10.499 --> 00:37:12.589
going to come down to the game you know
I one thing is you know what when you

00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599
I one thing is you know what when you
 

00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:14.930
I one thing is you know what when you
see it if you go into a forum you can

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:14.940
see it if you go into a forum you can
 

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.009
see it if you go into a forum you can
tell really quickly what the overall

00:37:18.009 --> 00:37:18.019
tell really quickly what the overall
 

00:37:18.019 --> 00:37:19.559
tell really quickly what the overall
sentiment

00:37:19.559 --> 00:37:19.569
sentiment
 

00:37:19.569 --> 00:37:21.989
sentiment
and in ten minutes and now you can't

00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:21.999
and in ten minutes and now you can't
 

00:37:21.999 --> 00:37:24.839
and in ten minutes and now you can't
measure that and track it in a really

00:37:24.839 --> 00:37:24.849
measure that and track it in a really
 

00:37:24.849 --> 00:37:27.779
measure that and track it in a really
clear way but we do we do do some

00:37:27.779 --> 00:37:27.789
clear way but we do we do do some
 

00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:29.910
clear way but we do we do do some
tracking our community management do

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920
tracking our community management do
 

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.249
tracking our community management do
weekly summaries and sometimes daily

00:37:32.249 --> 00:37:32.259
weekly summaries and sometimes daily
 

00:37:32.259 --> 00:37:34.049
weekly summaries and sometimes daily
summaries for developers and talk about

00:37:34.049 --> 00:37:34.059
summaries for developers and talk about
 

00:37:34.059 --> 00:37:36.019
summaries for developers and talk about
sentiment and we track that over time

00:37:36.019 --> 00:37:36.029
sentiment and we track that over time
 

00:37:36.029 --> 00:37:38.819
sentiment and we track that over time
but and then the other thing that we do

00:37:38.819 --> 00:37:38.829
but and then the other thing that we do
 

00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:42.019
but and then the other thing that we do
is just tracking fraud rates on

00:37:42.019 --> 00:37:42.029
is just tracking fraud rates on
 

00:37:42.029 --> 00:37:44.729
is just tracking fraud rates on
purchases over time and that you know

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:44.739
purchases over time and that you know
 

00:37:44.739 --> 00:37:47.130
purchases over time and that you know
that's not going to tell you strengthen

00:37:47.130 --> 00:37:47.140
that's not going to tell you strengthen
 

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:49.199
that's not going to tell you strengthen
community but it tells you when things

00:37:49.199 --> 00:37:49.209
community but it tells you when things
 

00:37:49.209 --> 00:37:51.449
community but it tells you when things
are going off the rails and that you you

00:37:51.449 --> 00:37:51.459
are going off the rails and that you you
 

00:37:51.459 --> 00:37:53.519
are going off the rails and that you you
will see that happen pretty quickly and

00:37:53.519 --> 00:37:53.529
will see that happen pretty quickly and
 

00:37:53.529 --> 00:37:54.989
will see that happen pretty quickly and
when you will see it come back down as

00:37:54.989 --> 00:37:54.999
