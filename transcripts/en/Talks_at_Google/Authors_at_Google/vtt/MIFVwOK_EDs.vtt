00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt;Dr. Susan Kleiner: I walked into this building,
it's like the good mood building; colors and

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.290
it's so g-o-o-d.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.960
[laughs] Google, right.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.880
So it is great to be here, I'm thrilled to
be on the Google campus in my backyard and

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.880
it's just so nice to know that your whole
programming here is starting to center around

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.070
health and fitness.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.550
At lunch we were talking about that it's time
to take a stand, that if we don't have health

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.710
we don't have the fundamental tools to progress,
to proceed, and certainly to excel.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.860
So health is critically important.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:51.360
What I have learned in the years of being
a sports nutritionist is that health is great

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.750
but we have very important performance goals
that we also want to accomplish.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.320
Wouldn't it be great if those could overlap?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.170
And most people really want to be happy, that's
what everybody wants.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.490
What was interesting to me when I said to
you, "How do you feel?" is that there was,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.650
you know, like one or two who said "good,"
I heard happy, but everybody else was kind

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.030
of quiet.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.170
And you know it's very interesting when I
go into an elementary school and I ask the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.680
kids, "Tell me how do you feel?" they right
away can tell me, "I feel happy, I have ants

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.990
in my pants, I have too much energy, I'm sleepy,"
they yell it out with no inhibition at all.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.860
I go to a middle school and I say, "How do
you feel?" and they all look at each other.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.860
[chuckles]

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.860
[laughter]

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.350
And once somebody says something then they've
all got permission to say something and they

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.430
all can pretty much say to me as well how
they're feeling at that moment, they are connected.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.050
Many of them will say they're tired, many
of them will say a little anxious, some of

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.300
them say that they're very happy, they're
starting to have some different feelings at

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.770
that point.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.440
When I get to high school it gets a little
quieter, certainly when I get to colleges

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.750
and definitely work settings it gets quieter
and quieter.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:27.590
People are less willing to express how they
feel or are becoming more and more disconnected

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.840
from how they feel.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.730
Just as we've talked about in the nutrition
field for decades that Americans are disconnected

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.879
from the neck down, that when we walk by plate
glass windows we don't look at ourselves,

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.430
we have mirrors from the neck up, we don't
wanna know what we look like from the neck

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.430
down.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.530
We are also encouraged by our society to disconnect
from the neck up.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.850
You're too tired?

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.400
Take some caffeine.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.200
You're sad?

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.510
Take a pill.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.690
You're overworked?

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.190
Too bad, keep going.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.390
You don't have time to exercise because it
makes you feel better?

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.540
Well you really better get to work and make
a dollar.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:19.580
So we are being encouraged to ignore how we
feel, but how we feel is in fact what it's

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.370
all about.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.610
And so I encourage you to look at my faces
up here [chuckles] and when I put this together

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.709
and this is stuff that I love, serendipity,
these are actually all up there alphabetically,

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.489
but you'll notice that all the ones in the
center are the happy ones.

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:47.860
Nobody wants to be on the outside team, everyone
wants to be on the inside and everyone wants

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.480
to be confident, happy, and optimistic.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:04:00.930
And in fact what you eat has a huge impact
on whether you're on the inside or the outside,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:09.459
whether you're feeling good, happy, optimistic,
confident, or you're feeling anger, anxiety,

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:17.470
not coping well, sad; what you eat plays a
profound role in how you feel.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.049
So I love this, Will Rogers says, "You know
you've got to exercise your brain just like

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.049
your muscles."

00:04:23.049 --> 00:04:29.960
And we talk about this and you have to feed
your brain just like you have to feed your

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.960
muscles.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:40.170
These athletes no matter how well trained,
how genetically gifted, how well skilled and

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:47.970
drilled they are, if they can't get out of
bed in the morning because they're depressed

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:54.330
it doesn't matter how hard they've trained;
they can't get to the starting line let alone

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.860
the finish line.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.290
And the beginning of The Good Mood Diet, actually
the kernel of the beginning of the thought

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:08.680
of The Good Mood Diet came from when I did
work with a very high profile, very elite

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.680
athlete who couldn't get out of bed in the
morning and was being paid a boat load of

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.150
money to show up.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:23.710
So what I found at that time and what I've
continued to preach and work on in my practice

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.470
is that you must feed your brain.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:36.130
That in fact if it was all about what we weighed,
which is what society tells us, everyone needs

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.530
to get on the scale and pay attention to what
you weigh, that the goal is weight loss, that

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.180
we all should weigh less and we all should
be thinking about weighing less.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:55.110
If that's really what mattered to us in how
we felt, we would all be thin.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.699
We know that diets work.

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:05.620
But we go on a diet, it makes us feel bad
and it doesn't matter if you've lost weight.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.680
You go off of it.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.850
So what The Good Mood Diet is, is the blending
of cutting edge sports nutrition, although

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.789
I kind of hide it in there because if I talk
too much about sports nutrition it would scare

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:26.150
everybody away, but nobody knows how to help
people alter their body composition, gain

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.259
muscle, lose fat like a sports nutritionist.

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:36.260
But blended with cutting edge neurobiology
of food is what I call it; the neuroscience

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.260
of food.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:44.759
How food affects the health of the brain,
mood, cognitive function, our ability to rest

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:50.950
and relax, our ability to have the mental
energy and focus when we need it; when you

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:57.710
blend those it's a powerful force to make
you feel the difference.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:06.520
So that when you follow this kind of concept
and then you go off of it, it's not about

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.580
what's happening with your weight that changes
you, because any of you who have tried to

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.259
lose weight know that it takes a long time
before you say, "Oh I really outta try and

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.430
lose this weight again."

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:23.690
What happens with The Good Mood Diet is that
within weeks you've realized that you feel

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.300
so bad you can't wait to be back on the diet.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:31.210
And this is what I learned from clients and
from Good Mood Diet groups around the city

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.520
and the country as I did this.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.620
So conceptually we think about feeding your
brain because most of us eat by default, you

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.410
can't eat this, you can't eat that, you can't
eat the next thing, don't eat, avoid, limit,

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.349
those are the language of the diet world.

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:56.470
And so whatever's left over is what ends up
on your plate which isn't very fun, it isn't

00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:01.919
very inspirational, and it probably doesn't
taste very good either so nobody wants to

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:02.990
do that.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:08.450
A typical weight loss diet is very low in
calories, it's so low in calories I always

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:14.020
say it wouldn't feed a small pigeon and in
fact the foods that you particularly are told

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:19.289
to avoid make those diets depressing.

00:08:19.289 --> 00:08:26.539
Not depressing because, gee, you wish you
could eat other food, it's because in fact

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:29.780
they are biochemically depressing.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.060
So let's talk about that.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:38.110
I'm gonna do a little bit of a science course
here very quickly because I'm an educator

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:43.930
and a motivator and I know that when you reach
a certain point and you don't understand why

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:50.180
you're doing something you stop, but if you
understand why you keep going, you can make

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.040
the choice to keep going.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.480
So did anybody ever play with a chemistry
set?

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.050
Yeah, and I almost burned down my parents'
basement with the chemistry set [laughs] at

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.000
one time in my life.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.360
But think of your body as a chemistry set;
we are kind of this bag of chemicals.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:14.510
And so food is the chemistry that enters our
body; our stomach is kinda that Erlenmeyer

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:19.830
flask and your metabolism is the Bunsen burner
underneath.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:25.810
So when you eat the food goes into your stomach
and you shake it around and you have your

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:33.990
metabolic rate going and it ends up going
into your blood stream, digested, absorbed

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.130
into your blood stream.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:39.710
What do you think the very first organ is
that's affected by the food that you eat?

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:40.830
Just yell it out.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.950
&gt;&gt; female #1: The brain.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.820
&gt;&gt;Dr. Susan Kleiner: The brain, right, see
I know I got a smart group here.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.089
Most people say the liver, the heart, no the
brain.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:56.959
In fact I want you to think about this because
it's so incredible: you don't even have to

00:09:56.959 --> 00:10:01.160
even swallow the food for it to affect your
brain.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:09.230
Think about when you get really hungry and
you haven't eaten maybe for hours, you put

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:17.330
something in your mouth and you're chewing
it and you just go, "Ah I feel so much better,

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.870
I'm eating."

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:24.740
Well it didn't even hit your stomach yet and
you're brain is affected by the fact that

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.170
you've put food in your mouth.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:34.890
So imagine the power of eating the right foods,
the right combinations of foods at the right

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.680
times and the impact that those can have on
your brain.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.920
So mechanisms of mood.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:50.160
Well mood is very complex, it occurs in many,
by a sort of a synergy of changes in several

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:58.330
different parts of the brain and the neurotransmitters
are sort of the connectors, the chemicals

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:05.440
that connect and communicate from one brain
cell to the next; in fact from one cell in

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.180
the central nervous system to every other
cell in the central nervous system.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.550
But we're talking about mood, what goes on
in the brain.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:18.100
Serotonin, now there are a number of different
neurotransmitters, we're going to focus on

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:25.050
serotonin today because it is the most abundant
neurotransmitter that influences mood, it

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:29.420
is also probably one of the most well understood.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:37.110
You know serotonin by anti-depressant drugs
today, they always are trying to raise serotonin

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:38.830
levels in the brain.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.640
Shift to what is the building block of serotonin
in the brain?

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.720
Tryptophan.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.500
Tryptophan is an amino acid, comes in from
protein, it is essential in the diet, we cannot

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:57.250
manufacture enough of it in the body, it is
the building block of serotonin in the brain;

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.730
it's found in the blood, the precursor to
serotonin.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:06.470
Now we know that tryptophan is essential to
raise serotonin levels in the brain because

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:11.769
if we deplete the body from tryptophan then
serotonin levels drop.

00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:17.620
And all this kind of connection is important
because what I talk about is evidence based,

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:27.769
meaning that it's scientifically supported;
the data are there for the information that

00:12:27.769 --> 00:12:32.610
I'm giving you here today and what's written
in The Good Mood Diet.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.910
[pause]

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:40.940
So if tryptophan is what is required to raise
serotonin levels in the brain, it is the building

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:49.250
block, then one would assume that a very high
protein diet should raise your mood.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:56.300
In most instances diets that are very high
in protein and very low in carb do the opposite.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.800
You wouldn't wanna work for anybody who was
on a very high protein low carb diet, you

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.740
wouldn't wanna be married to anybody that
was on that diet, you wouldn't wanna have

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:12.899
to partner with anybody at work on that diet
because it actually lowers serotonin levels

00:13:12.899 --> 00:13:14.810
in most people.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:23.959
People become angry, aggressive, depressed,
poor coping skills, all of those happen yet

00:13:23.959 --> 00:13:27.250
we have an abundance of tryptophan.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.440
Why?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.630
[pause]

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.630
Well --

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:31.630
[pause]

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:38.030
amazingly, and I always borrow a phrase, it's
the carbohydrates stupid, [chuckles] is what

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:44.570
you'll read in The Good Mood Diet because
in fact it is the carbohydrate in your diet

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:50.930
that allows tryptophan to cross the blood
brain barrier and enter the brain.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:56.760
Now you know this, you know this in your gut,
you know this fundamentally.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:05.120
What ingredient, what single food makes you
feel really good really fast?

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.519
&gt;&gt;male #1: Sugar.

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:08.519
[pause]

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:09.920
Sugar, right.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.650
So don't ever let anybody tell you that sugar
doesn't make you feel good.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:21.620
Now we're gonna talk about why too much sugar
is on my Feel-Bad Foods list, but understand

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:28.350
the science and why in the short term sugar
makes you feel so good.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:33.960
Now you know it's very simple, it's very rapidly
digested and enters the blood stream.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:41.730
When carbohydrate levels go up, when blood
sugar goes up, insulin, the hormone that helps

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:50.000
take blood sugar out of the blood and transfer
it into the muscles or to the liver, when

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.290
insulin goes up as well, it stimulates a whole
separate cascade of biochemical events that

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:02.940
actually take out all the other competing
amino acids in the blood stream that compete

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:09.449
with tryptophan to cross the blood brain barrier
and they leave tryptophan out there all alone.

00:15:09.449 --> 00:15:15.410
There are seven other amino acids that resemble
tryptophan.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:22.519
Those seven other amino acids compete for
the same receptor molecule, the same usher

00:15:22.519 --> 00:15:25.490
that takes tryptophan into the brain.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:32.760
And so when you have a very high protein diet
you have a lot of those competitive amino

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:41.529
acids around and those compete with tryptophan
and so a proportionately lower amount of tryptophan

00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:43.440
gets into the brain.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:49.880
If, on the other hand, you could remove those
competitive amino acids, which is what happens

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.880
when you eat carbohydrate and amazingly it
takes those amino acids and shuttles them

00:15:54.880 --> 00:16:00.510
to the muscle cell where we want the muscle
to recover, repair, and grow after exercise,

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:03.329
since we're all active.

00:16:03.329 --> 00:16:08.910
It leaves tryptophan out there with little
competition to enter into the brain and raise

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:16.320
serotonin levels; this happens in an infinitesimal,
small amount of time.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:24.399
And so the sugar that you eat raises of course
not only serotonin, there are number of other

00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:30.709
neurotransmitters that are raised as well
that are too much for me to go into today.

00:16:30.709 --> 00:16:38.220
But when it comes to raising mood, carbohydrate
plays an enormously important role; so important

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:43.910
that diets that are lower than 40 percent
of calories as carbohydrate have been shown

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.680
to be depressing, literally depressing.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:57.490
So ideally we should eat carbohydrate and
protein together; it is the ideal fuel and

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:05.540
recovery combination for muscles, it is also
a beautiful combination for the brain, giving

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:11.640
you the tryptophan that you need and enhancing
the movement of tryptophan into the brain

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:13.240
to raise serotonin levels.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.830
Well so I said sugar makes you feel good.

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:22.970
Well then why do we keep telling people to
stop eating so much sugar?

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:30.470
Well this is why, and we've had a discussion
sort of nationally about insulin resistance.

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:35.160
That's something that if you have a lot of
sugar over a long period of time and you start

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.770
to gain weight, can happen.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:43.660
So over a long period of time you can develop
insulin resistance and move slowly into the

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.850
beginning of Type II diabetes.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.770
However, that's long way off.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:56.370
What also happens when you eat a lot of sugar
frequently is that it is considered a stress

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.580
by the body.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:04.990
When your blood sugar levels rapidly rise
insulin meets it and lowers it and rises again

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:10.650
and lowers it; your body responds with a stress
response to that.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:17.770
One of the results of the stress hormone response
is protein degradation, breaking down proteins.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:22.679
This is kind of part of that fight or flight
response, we're talking about a very short

00:18:22.679 --> 00:18:27.010
term, acute response to a stress.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:34.429
And so if you begin to degrade proteins you
are flooding your bloodstream once again with

00:18:34.429 --> 00:18:39.400
lots and lots of protein and lowering the
serotonin level.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:46.780
There you have to go back and eat more sugar
to then help move the tryptophan into the

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:54.370
brain and so you get on, in a very short period
of time, within four to five days, maximum

00:18:54.370 --> 00:19:03.620
seven days, your body will begin using other
neurotransmitters as well to force a craving

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:09.770
for more and more sugar so that you can raise
the serotonin levels over and over again.

00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:15.169
So in addition to the long term stress that
lots of sugar puts on your body this is a

00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:21.940
very acute short term stress and it's why
you begin on a daily basis to want more and

00:19:21.940 --> 00:19:25.480
more sugar because you want to raise your
mood.

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.800
It's a biological function, a biological urge.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:36.130
This is not about do you have the willpower,
this is about making the choices that alter

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:38.580
your physiological responses.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:45.920
So we go back to the foods that were served
in the cafeteria today; slow digesting, whole

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.350
carbohydrate, sources rich in carbohydrate.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:57.450
So of course whole grains, fruits, vegetables,
beans, those are all wonderful sources of

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:04.230
slowly digesting carbohydrates that keep you
even all day long, keep your blood sugar levels

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.040
even.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.850
[pause]

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.470
What types of proteins?

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:14.549
There are lots of different proteins, they
are mostly all absolutely wonderful.

00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:16.309
I have some favorites.

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:21.970
Now fish is on here obviously for the fish
oil that we will get to in a moment, but there's

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:29.740
new data on fish protein in and of itself
showing that fish protein may help the body,

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.780
we call it, mobilize the fat stores in the
abdomen.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:41.650
Meaning that no you can't spot reduce by eating
loads of fish, but that fish protein can enhance,

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:46.440
the fat cells in our abdomen can be different
than some of the fat cells in the rest of

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:52.909
the body, and so if you can help turn those
on and get them more active, which is what

00:20:52.909 --> 00:21:00.920
fish protein has been shown to do, along with
the fish oils, then you can hopefully reduce

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.860
this midsection that increases the risk of
disease over the years.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:11.330
So that is a great benefit of fish and we
will talk about the fish oils in a moment.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.039
You're gonna see milk up there.

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:22.460
I am a very big advocate of milk and this
is why: milk is an ideal good mood food; it's

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.530
carbohydrate and protein together.

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:31.930
The protein in milk is high in tryptophan,
the protein in milk is also high in an amino

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:40.010
acid, leucine, that is the trigger for protein
metabolism so after you exercise you enhance

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:42.190
your recovery.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:48.130
And as I said it has the natural carbohydrate
lactose in there.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:54.900
It also has Vitamin D which is required for
the manufacture of serotonin.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:22:03.770
So there's a natural combination of nutrients
in milk that is a true good mood food.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:05.330
Eggs.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:09.809
Well we're gonna talk about the yolk and it's
there and that'll be in the next section on

00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:16.160
fats, but of course egg protein is an ideal
protein highly biologically available.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.150
Now turkey most people nod their head and
they say, "Yeah I've heard turkey's high in

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:26.360
tryptophan and I know that at Thanksgiving
I get really sleepy after my Thanksgiving

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.360
meal.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.360
It must be from that tryptophan."

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:33.340
And I say, "Oh it was probably the 2,000 calories
and five glasses of wine that you had --

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.340
[laughter]

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.809
[chuckles] at your Thanksgiving meal [laughs]
not necessarily the tryptophan, but yes turkey

00:22:37.809 --> 00:22:39.960
is high in tryptophan."

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:43.350
And I said, "Does it make you sleepy in the
evening?"

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:50.679
Well in fact we have 16 different receptor
molecules in the brain that recognize serotonin

00:22:50.679 --> 00:22:57.760
and so those turn on and off on the light/dark
cycle.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:05.510
So based on Circadian rhythms during the day
serotonin makes you feel alert, awake, you're

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:13.200
calm but sort of alive and ready to go and
keeps your mood elevated.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:20.929
When it gets dark outside in the evening serotonin
helps your body quiet down, relax, and get

00:23:20.929 --> 00:23:23.040
ready for rest.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:30.930
And so you can make use of that, you can what
I say put your food to work for you.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:41.620
If you have dairy or milk in the evening you
can help turn on that relaxation cycle.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:46.710
Now if I said to you, "Have a glass of milk
in the evening," most people would add –

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:47.710
&gt;&gt;male #2: Cookies.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.250
&gt;&gt;Dr. Susan Kleiner: [chuckles] cookies right.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:56.370
So I like to just add the chocolate or the
cocoa powder right to the milk, heat it up,

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:00.320
and there's nothin' wrong with having a little
bit of cocoa powder it makes everything taste

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.320
better.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:07.850
And so a hot cocoa in the evening is actually
part of the Good Mood plan, helping you rest

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.950
and get ready for bed in the evening.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:12.640
Fat.

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:20.520
We have had a horrible fat phobia in this
country and what we are learning is turning

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.929
nutrition advice on its head.

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:25.039
[pause]

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:33.860
Not only are diets that are lower than 25
percent of calories depressing, lower than

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:40.120
25 percent of calories from fat are in the
diet we have a lowered ability to cope with

00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:46.740
stress and increased incidents of anxiety
and anger.

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:53.080
So when I'm out on the road I wish I had some
kinda avocado or somethin' to hand out to

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.430
people [chuckles] while I'm drivin' around
on Seattle roads 'cause people are pretty

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.450
angry and aren't coping very well with stress.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:05.789
But one of the things that you can do is begin
to enjoy the high performance fats that we

00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:07.650
must have in our diets.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:14.520
The data is now showing that these fats are
so critically important, including fish oil,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:20.940
they are so critically important to the health
of the brain and the brain cell that if you

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:29.581
do not have adequate fats in the diet the
brain will slow down fat metabolism, meaning

00:25:29.581 --> 00:25:34.919
you will not burn optimum amounts of fats
in the body.

00:25:34.919 --> 00:25:41.419
So if you are on a very low fat diet and you're
trying to lose weight you won't lose the fat

00:25:41.419 --> 00:25:43.060
that you can.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:49.870
And if you are on a diet restricted in calories
you may lose more lean tissue than you want

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:55.110
rather than preferentially burning the fat.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:26:01.020
With the goal of raising the whole amount
of fat that's available proportionately for

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:08.010
the brain cell membrane and the entire central
nervous system that is lined with fat, the

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.419
brain will turn off fat burning.

00:26:10.419 --> 00:26:14.400
So high performance fats.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.570
[pause]

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:20.970
Certainly avocados, olive oil, nuts, seeds.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:26.299
When we talk about extra virgin olive oil
one of the great benefits of extra virgin

00:26:26.299 --> 00:26:31.929
olive oil is that it contains a compound that's
identical to ibuprofen.

00:26:31.929 --> 00:26:37.860
When you get that peppery finish that makes
you kind of go [ ] if you ever dip in extra

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:43.701
virgin olive oil itself, that compound that
gives you that little burning sensation, that

00:26:43.701 --> 00:26:49.539
peppery finish, is actually a very powerful
anti-inflammatory.

00:26:49.539 --> 00:26:55.669
And so extra virgin olive oil is special compared
to all the different olive oils.

00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:56.909
Fish oil.

00:26:56.909 --> 00:27:06.039
Fish oil is unique, flax seed oil, hemp seed,
none of those replace the two compounds found

00:27:06.039 --> 00:27:12.490
in fish oil or marine oils, DHA and EPA those
are required in the brain.

00:27:12.490 --> 00:27:20.649
ALA, the third Omega fat which is a great
anti-inflammatory found in much of the plant

00:27:20.649 --> 00:27:26.480
kingdom is not a substitute no matter what
you've been told.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:34.380
On the best day with the best genetic possibilities
when you've eaten the best diet, a maximum

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:43.400
of five to maybe ten percent of that ALA will
be converted to DHA or EPA.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.990
So the body just does not have the capacity
to replace it.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:57.010
DHA is absolutely essential to the function
of a brain cell; it is what keeps the inflammatory

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:03.840
processes in the brain cell in check.

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:11.140
Inflammation and oxidation are a side effect
of being alive; we all have it going on.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:17.570
In the brain and in the body we have systems
to help fight this all the time.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:24.730
The system that is critical in the brain depends
on the Omega-3 fat DHA.

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:26.860
[pause]

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:32.740
Because fat is so essential to the mass of
the brain, 60 percent of the mass of the brain

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:38.760
is fat, so you must have fat in your diet.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:48.149
Because the composition of a brain cell membrane
so depends on DHA and on fat, if DHA isn't

00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:54.350
around it will replace DHA with another fat;
that fat can function structurally but it

00:28:54.350 --> 00:29:03.880
is not a functional anti-inflammatory compound
so that inflammation proceeds unchecked.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:12.159
When we have low levels of DHA in the body
brain cells become, neuroscientists call it

00:29:12.159 --> 00:29:15.780
rigid or not plastic.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:24.150
We wanna have fluidity in our cells and when
inflammation proceeds in the brain we lose

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:29.250
that fluidity of those cells, communication
slows down, neurotransmitters and electrical

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:37.640
impulses cannot move smoothly, cognitive function
is lower, memory is decreased, mood is lowered.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.850
People who have low levels of DHA in their
diet, people who are low fish eaters, have

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:49.169
a significantly increased risk of depression,
not to mention all the other degenerative

00:29:49.169 --> 00:29:56.320
diseases of the brain, and many other certainly
heart disease and other diseases in the body.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.000
We are finding that these compounds are critically
important.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.909
If you don't supplement with anything, you
must supplement with DHA and EPA.

00:30:08.909 --> 00:30:16.990
If don't want to supplement and you love fish,
five fish meals a week will get you to the

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:25.620
amount of recommended fish oil at this point
which is about 1,000 milligrams total every

00:30:25.620 --> 00:30:26.720
day.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.960
So this is critically important.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:36.000
Now fish oil has also been shown to enhance
weight loss; again you're getting the brain

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:43.590
in a more healthy foundational situation so
that it will allow for fat metabolism to proceed

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.799
in the body.

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:47.789
Eggs.

00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:49.830
Who's throwin' their egg yolks down the drain?

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:50.830
[pause]

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:51.919
One, two –

00:30:51.919 --> 00:30:52.919
[laughter]

00:30:52.919 --> 00:30:57.700
I know there's a lot more of you or you're
not eating eggs at all.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:04.280
I want you to know there has never been a
study, never been a study, that showed that

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:11.070
an egg yolk a day raises cholesterol levels
in healthy people, never been a study.

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:17.289
And now we have four studies that have shown
that an egg yolk a day does not raise cholesterol

00:31:17.289 --> 00:31:19.890
levels in healthy people.

00:31:19.890 --> 00:31:25.080
And I would take the big step and say you
could probably make it two egg yolks a day

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.970
in a healthy person, but it also depends on
what else you're eating in your diet.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:36.190
Now The Good Mood Diet with an egg yolk a
day stays within the American Heart Association

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:42.500
guidelines of 300 milligrams of cholesterol,
dietary cholesterol a day.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.980
Why am I telling you to eat egg yolks?

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:50.820
Well once we get this whole Vitamin D thing
straightened out, Vitamin D right now if you

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:56.990
haven't heard of it you're not Googling [laughs]
because it's everywhere and particularly here

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:00.559
in the Northwest it is a problem.

00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:07.019
We have low Vitamin D nutriture, we don't
get much sunshine, and low Vitamin D intake

00:32:07.019 --> 00:32:13.390
is highly associated with numerous issues
including depression, by the way.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:20.800
Once we get that taken care of the next nutrient
coming down the pike is choline.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:30.260
Choline is a B vitamin, it is half of the
most abundant neurotransmitter in the body,

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:35.090
acetylcholine, responsible for every thought
and every movement that we have.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:36.480
[pause]

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:42.669
In the United States ever since we started
dumping egg yolks down the drain we consume

00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:47.940
somewhere around 30 percent of our requirement
for choline.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:55.960
It is dramatic, there is now numerous studies
on choline, there are studies looking not

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.679
only at total health but certainly at brain
function.

00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:05.910
The National Institutes of Mental Health are
supplementing people with degenerative diseases

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:13.630
of the brain with two phospholipids found
in egg yolks: phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:19.830
and have shown a slowing of the rate of progression
of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:27.480
And studies in 18 year old boys starting college
have shown enhanced memory when they were

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.480
supplemented.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.419
So we're at both ends of the spectrum with
this, it is a huge problem.

00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:43.430
If you eat just an egg yolk a day you get
about half of your choline need for the day.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.610
And then we find choline in other foods as
well.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:54.570
So it is very important if you are not allergic
to eggs you should be eating an egg yolk a

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:55.570
day.

00:33:55.570 --> 00:34:00.930
An easy way is to boil 'em up at the beginning
of the week and just pop a hard boiled egg

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:06.899
in your mouth everyday whatever you do, and
you will find that now you've got another

00:34:06.899 --> 00:34:09.810
great easy source of protein.

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:17.109
And so add that egg to breakfast and enjoy
it because we have cut out a foundational

00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:20.020
food in our diets.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.550
[pause]

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:27.120
So I want you to think about what you need
to eat, not what you can't eat next.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:29.879
Okay, I'm gonna say that again.

00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:35.520
Think about what you need to eat, not what
you can't eat next.

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:41.580
Americans focus on what they can't eat; it
is so depressing [chuckles].

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:47.700
Food is such an intimate part of our lives,
we should be looking forward to eating.

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:53.690
We share it with friends, we share it with
our lovers, we share it with our families,

00:34:53.690 --> 00:35:02.690
we share it at work, it is a primitive part
of our psyche to share food and break bread

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.560
with another person.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:11.960
And so when we are more concerned when we're
at a party of fighting with the brownie on

00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:17.530
the table than we are with talking to the
cute guy or girl next to you, that's a real

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:21.430
problem, you're missing out on life, you're
limiting your horizons.

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:25.220
Focus on what you need to eat, not what you
can't eat next.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:30.960
Now I have a great story to tell you with
Matt Hasselbeck's permission.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:35.510
I worked with him a number of years ago when
he was getting injured a lot and he needed

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.290
to pack on some pounds.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:49.119
And so this is just an illustration of how
if we crave foods, if we don't feed ourselves

00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:57.670
well, our brain will force us to eat certain
things that cravings and desires and what

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:06.120
feel like uncontrollable urges with food often
can be purely physiological drives that can

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:12.520
be altered if you change the way you eat.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:19.200
Matt was known as the ice cream boy in the
Seahawks training facility.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.890
When I walked in the first day to work with
him all the guys were snickering.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:27.850
And I walked in and I thought, "God is my
fly down, I mean why is everybody laughin'?"

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:34.150
I get down and I sit down with he and his
lovely wife and I said, "What's gonna on?

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.700
Why was everybody laughing when I walked in?"

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:41.420
"Oh," he said, "they've all taken bets on
me workin' with you and who's gonna win the

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:42.820
dietician or me."

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.860
I said, "Why?"

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:47.010
"Well," he says, "let me tell you what I eat."

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:53.320
So he told me what he ate during the day and
then when he got home in the evening he'd

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:58.000
eat about a quart or more of Haagen-Dazs.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.680
And when he would get on the plane to go to
an away game, on the plane for the return

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.660
he would have five or six Dove bars.

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:12.619
[laughter]

00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:20.250
So was this an outta control athlete just
taking advantage of the position that he was

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:27.710
in and how active he was or was this some
fundamental physiological need for ice cream?

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:34.760
Well after I talked with Matt he told me that
during the day he ate around 1,500 calories

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:41.200
worth of food and he trained at least three
times during the day, sometimes four, he'd

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:49.230
do his morning workout, his strength program
in the training room, they had the team training

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:54.531
at some point in the morning, he'd have quarterback
skills and drills, they'd train again in the

00:37:54.531 --> 00:38:01.510
afternoon and so by the time he'd get home
he said, "About 1,500 calories."

00:38:01.510 --> 00:38:06.980
Well the guy needed 5,000 calories a day just
to maintain his weight.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:10.440
So when he got home he was starving.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.200
What did the brain say?

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.020
"Immediate fuel.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:21.730
I need structural component, I need to raise
my mood, and I need fuel, sugar and fat."

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:24.450
What better thing than ice cream?

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:31.510
So I put together a program for Matt that
gave him around 3,000, 3,500 calories during

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:37.869
the day, much of that in liquid nutrition
using smoothies and if you ever see my book

00:38:37.869 --> 00:38:43.980
Power Eating it is packed with recovery drinks
and smoothies; it is a very important part

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:50.180
of an active person's life whether or not
you're burnin' 5,000 calories a day or 1,600

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:55.820
calories a day we are runnin' around a lot
and liquid smoothie packed nutrition is a

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.530
great convenience.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:03.280
So for Matt he had between food and smoothies
around 3,500 calories a day.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:08.550
When he got home he had a really nice dinner
and of course I still had about I don't know

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:13.010
cup and a half of ice cream in his diet.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.960
And people say to me, "You kept ice cream
in it?"

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.910
Well yeah I mean he could eat 5,000 calories
a day and if I gave the guy who was eatin'

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:25.900
that much ice cream a diet with no ice cream
he'd say, "Hey, doc you're a nice lady but

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.380
I'm not gonna follow this diet."

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.380
Right?

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.490
[chuckles] So we kept the ice cream in there
in the evening.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:40.430
After about a week, 10 days, Matt called and
he said, "Hey doc, is there a healthier snack

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:41.560
I could eat at night.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:45.869
I don't even want that ice cream anymore."

00:39:45.869 --> 00:39:54.119
So with all the permission in the world his
body was well fed, his brain was well fed,

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:56.160
he didn't want that anymore.

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:05.650
It's such a great illustration of how potent
food is in the choices that you make.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:13.910
So that if today say you had your lunch and
at lunch you ate all these great good mood

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:20.599
foods and then you went and you I don't know
the chocolate chip cookies are your absolute

00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:25.070
favorite, there is nothing as good as those
chocolate chip cookies, and you had a couple

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:29.680
chocolate chip cookies for dessert and while
you're sitting here you've been beatin' yourself

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.640
up about eating those chocolate chip cookies.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.980
And so you go, "You know what I ate those
chocolate chip cookies," and you go back to

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:45.190
your desk and it gets to be around I don't
know four o'clock and you're startin' to get

00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:48.960
hungry and you go, "Nope, no snack because
I ate those chocolate chip cookies."

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:54.020
And then you get home and it's dinner time
and you say, "Well I'm pretty hungry but oh

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:58.810
I can only eat a salad because I ate those
chocolate chip cookies."

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:05.589
And then as it gets on toward the evening
you're getting really hungry and, "I shouldn't

00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:11.640
eat anything," and you're gettin' really anxious
and really stressed and now anything that

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.420
doesn't run across the counter is fair game.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:15.420
[laughter]

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:16.420
Right?

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:21.180
So now if there's chocolate chip cookies or
there's chocolate cake, who knows what is

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.090
in the house, you're eating that and half
a dozen other things as well.

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:32.240
Now you really feel bad and you go to sleep
and you don't sleep well and you wake up in

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:38.839
the morning and you say, "Oh God I can't eat
breakfast now, I ate all that at night and

00:41:38.839 --> 00:41:41.250
everything that Dr. Kleiner said, the heck
with it.

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:47.950
I feel so bad I'm not, I can't follow anything,
I'm just a loser."

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:54.960
Well if you had eaten those chocolate chip
cookies and you just loved 'em and you came

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:59.079
in and you heard me speak and I say to you,
"No you've really gotta eat every two and

00:41:59.079 --> 00:42:03.900
a half to three hours because physiologically
you're blood sugar drops whether you eat tofu

00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:06.990
or a chocolate chip cookie you're gonna get
hungry.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:12.450
So plan what you need to eat in two and a
half to three hours."

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:16.210
And so you go back and you go, "Oh yeah, well
a good snack let's see protein.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:21.030
I can have some nuts, that has healthy fat
and some protein, and I can have a piece of

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:27.560
fruit, that's a really good carb, or I can
have a piece of cheese, that's a great combination.

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:31.960
And now I have energy to finish my day and
go workout."

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.461
And you get home and you feel great and you
eat your healthy dinner and then you have

00:42:36.461 --> 00:42:40.640
your hot cocoa in the evening or if it's kinda
hot out, if we don't have air conditioning

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:44.280
we're gonna have cold milk, cold chocolate
milk.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:48.100
And you sleep really well and you go to sleep
and you wake up and all of a sudden you've

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.940
slept so well, you woke up an hour earlier,
maybe you can go for a walk.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:56.359
And you come into work and you're on your
way.

00:42:56.359 --> 00:43:04.040
And so think like an athlete, don't rewind
the tape over and over and over again.

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.540
It is paralyzing.

00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:11.480
No matter how many times you rewind that tape
about having eaten those chocolate chip cookies

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:16.660
you will never not have eaten those cookies
even though we're really hoping that one time

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.210
we won't have eaten it, it's never gonna happen.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:26.990
So forget the past, it doesn't matter what
you ate a moment ago, it is absolutely irrelevant.

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:32.820
Think about what you need to eat, whatever
you ate you ate, I hope you enjoyed it, it

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:37.470
should have been wonderful, it should have
just delighted you.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:45.450
Now think about what you need to eat next;
a snack, a meal, a hot cocoa, whatever it

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:50.730
is that's how you stay on the good mood food
highway.

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:51.850
[pause]

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:58.170
So there is a list of Feel-Great Foods in
the book and that's because all publishers

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:03.552
want something that magazine editors will
stick in a magazine, and so I had to have

00:44:03.552 --> 00:44:04.552
a list.

00:44:04.552 --> 00:44:08.970
[chuckles] You have to have lists, you will
see every diet book has lists because that's

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:10.650
what gets into the magazines.

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:17.839
In fact we could fill this room with every
food in the world, they all make us feel good,

00:44:17.839 --> 00:44:24.609
but some foods make us feel better than other
foods in fact, and some foods when we eat

00:44:24.609 --> 00:44:29.850
them too frequently as I said with sugar,
can make us feel bad.

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:37.030
There's a special group of foods, Anti-inflammatory
Foods, and this is worked fundamentally into

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:43.350
the diet, this list is not in the book, but
all the foods that are promoted and we talk

00:44:43.350 --> 00:44:52.250
about fundamentally this is a big goal when
you eat is to eat these foods rich in color

00:44:52.250 --> 00:45:02.210
and high performance fats, all of these herbs,
are great sources to help reduce inflammation

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:03.230
in the body.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.280
And then the Feel-Bad foods.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:12.500
Well it's a short list fortunately, but they
can take up a lot of our diet.

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:17.290
Alcohol, need I say more, it's a central nervous
system depressant.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:24.550
[chuckles] So, you know, in a small amount
it can fit into The Good Mood Diet but don't

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:29.020
let anybody tell you that it's a health beverage.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:31.030
[laughter]

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:36.610
The alcohol companies, the wine companies,
I kind of feel like the U.S.

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:41.880
Government may be in cahoots with them as
well, really promoting the use of alcohol

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.359
as a way to get healthy.

00:45:43.359 --> 00:45:50.700
In a country that is two-thirds overweight
and more than a third obese at this point,

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:57.680
this is a horribly irresponsible stance to
take, not to mention the abuse of alcohol.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:03.560
But the addition of these calories, the slowing
of the metabolic rate, the influence that

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:12.080
it has on your physical performance for many
days afterwards, it is not a sharp tool to

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.260
add to your diet.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:19.980
If you feel that you are stressed think about
the other things that you could add to your

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.430
diet before adding alcohol.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:28.490
Now you will see in a moment how it fits into
the diet, but remember it will slow your metabolism,

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:31.440
it will slow your cognitive function.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:40.120
For every, if you have three to five drinks,
depending on your size, it takes 72 hours

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:43.550
to return to full physical performance.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:48.319
72 hours, this is from the University of Notre
Dame.

00:46:48.319 --> 00:46:52.070
So be aware of what drinking will do.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:57.130
Caffeine, now caffeine opposite from alcohol,
is a stimulant.

00:46:57.130 --> 00:47:03.050
We know it wakes us up, it makes us alert,
it makes us feel pretty good, it's a performance

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:04.050
enhancer.

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:09.000
It lowers our rate of perceived exertion,
meaning that when you have a little caffeine

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.230
before you workout you don't perceive that
you're training as hard as you are so you'll

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:21.350
push a little harder so you get a better training
effect, so it will enhance performance.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:25.920
There's a prudent use of caffeine prior to
exercise if you are a caffeine user.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.200
Obviously I don't want you to start using
caffeine.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:35.859
Be aware that you're gonna, you hear a lot
of hype about energy drinks; know that a Red

00:47:35.859 --> 00:47:42.099
Bull, now I'm not promoting it I just want
people to be informed.

00:47:42.099 --> 00:47:51.000
Yes we are down the road from Starbucks headquarters,
but a tall latte has three times the amount

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.710
of caffeine as a Red Bull.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:58.900
So just be an informed consumer.

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:04.000
There's a lot of bashing going on right now
and there's a lot of good reason for it and

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.040
there's a lot of things in energy drinks that
are worse than what we're drinkin' in coffee

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:12.000
and coffee has a great anti-inflammatory effect,
an anti-oxidant effect.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:19.089
We can go on and on, but if caffeine is your
issue that you're focusing on be informed.

00:48:19.089 --> 00:48:26.440
And I don't feel that coffee should be let
off the hook when we are talkin' about the

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:29.619
amount of caffeine in energy drinks.

00:48:29.619 --> 00:48:34.579
Caffeine in large doses can give you a rebound
effect and you know this, everyone has gone

00:48:34.579 --> 00:48:38.460
through this at some point unless they really
are not a caffeine user.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:43.510
And that is it makes you feel really great
when you have one cup and then two and three

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:46.319
and four and then you start to feel bad.

00:48:46.319 --> 00:48:50.790
And in the afternoon when you're using caffeine
to keep you aware and alert rather than The

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:55.560
Good Mood Diet or gettin' out and goin' for
a little walk or drinking some water because

00:48:55.560 --> 00:49:01.140
you're probably somewhat dehydrated, the caffeine
makes you feel worse and worse and worse;

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:05.800
lowers your focus, decreases your attention
time.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.790
So be very aware of that.

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:15.109
Fried foods, fatty meats, fatty snack foods,
those are promoting inflammation in the body

00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:18.089
and our goal is to reduce the inflammation.

00:49:18.089 --> 00:49:22.300
Just like I talked about in the brain it's
goin' on in the whole body.

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:29.849
Fundamentally all of these foods promote inflammation
and heart disease, cancer, etcetera.

00:49:29.849 --> 00:49:35.170
And so if you have a lot of inflammation in
the body you don't feel good.

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:38.800
And refined sugars and starches we really
already talked about.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.480
So very briefly and I'm not gonna spend much
time on this 'cause I wanna give a little

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:48.370
bit of time for questions, is that the diet
does have a strategy and there's two weeks

00:49:48.370 --> 00:49:49.920
of menus in there.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:52.570
The first two weeks we call the Good Mood
Accelerator.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:55.099
I ask ya give me two weeks.

00:49:55.099 --> 00:49:59.319
You can practically hold your breath for two
weeks; two weeks is a really short period

00:49:59.319 --> 00:50:00.319
of time.

00:50:00.319 --> 00:50:04.290
You could probably not leave the building
here at Google for two weeks and not really

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:05.290
notice it.

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:14.820
[laughs] So give me two weeks and really clean
yourself out; eliminate the Feel-Bad Foods.

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.599
[pause]

00:50:16.599 --> 00:50:25.579
If you want to lose weight it is an outcome
of The Good Mood Diet, it is not the goal.

00:50:25.579 --> 00:50:33.849
In fact weight loss is a long term goal of
changing short little habits: drinking more

00:50:33.849 --> 00:50:40.670
water, starting to get exercise, eating more
greens, doing all the little things where

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:46.720
on a daily basis you can look back and pat
yourself on the back and be successful.

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:54.480
Weight loss takes so long that we don't feel
successful, we feel like a failure and so

00:50:54.480 --> 00:51:00.450
you stop doing all these other things that
have on a daily basis a true impact on your

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:02.550
health and performance.

00:51:02.550 --> 00:51:05.480
And so those are the goals.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:13.030
When you do all of those things right if you
need to lose weight, you will.

00:51:13.030 --> 00:51:19.460
In fact my clients know when they come to
me that when they get everything right the

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:24.920
first week, when they finally are doing their
real regular workout, they're hydrating the

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:31.180
way they're supposed to, they're eating everything
they need to eat, at the end of the week they

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.030
gain weight.

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:34.160
[pause]

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.570
So don't look at the scale.

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:38.580
Those are long term outcomes.

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:44.390
Now over time using a scale can be useful
and helpful for monitoring what's going on

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:45.780
with us.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:50.400
Think about how you feel, get very connected
with the food that you eat.

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:56.791
And then after the first phase you can add
these kind of fun little foods, whoops, fun

00:51:56.791 --> 00:52:02.890
little foods back but you don't have to; there's
no requirement to doing it.

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:09.830
And I talk about knowing the added sugar in
your diet; be aware of where sugar is added

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:11.280
to your diet.

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:19.609
When you pick up a box of Shredded Wheat and
you look at the nutrition label there's no

00:52:19.609 --> 00:52:29.020
sugar, it says zero sugar; wheat doesn't contain
sugar, grains don't contain sugar.

00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:33.890
So any box that you pick up that's cereal
that has sugar in it means that it was added

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:39.940
by the manufacturer and don't think it's from
the two slices of little strawberries that

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:45.089
they put in there; there's like two strawberries
in a whole box.

00:52:45.089 --> 00:52:47.750
So it's sugar added.

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.040
Be informed.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:54.910
Milk, an eight ounce, and I have a whole section
of this in the book, an eight ounce cup of

00:52:54.910 --> 00:53:06.010
milk contains 12 grams of sugar, naturally
lactose, the natural carbohydrate in milk.

00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:12.850
Look at carton of yogurt it will have, if
you take plain yogurt it will be slightly

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:18.080
higher because the fluid has been taken out,
the solids are more concentrated, you have

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:23.290
13 grams of sugar in a plain carton of yogurt.

00:53:23.290 --> 00:53:32.970
A flavored carton of yogurt, using sugar,
typically has a minimum of 26 grams, 30 grams.

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:39.250
You can start to figure out where the added
sugar is in your diet by reading the labels.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:43.720
Every four grams of sugar is a teaspoon.

00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:45.020
[pause]

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:49.410
Every four grams of sugar is a teaspoon.

00:53:49.410 --> 00:53:56.490
So I have, if you guys can come up with something
less dogmatic sounding than the 10 Commandments

00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:02.410
I would love it, but so far I haven't, email
me if you come up with something better, but

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:07.670
these are the 10 Commandments and they are
a great guideline.

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:13.050
First and foremost it is all about how you
feel, think about what you need to eat, not

00:54:13.050 --> 00:54:14.280
what you can't eat.

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:18.550
Next, always combine starches with protein
and/or healthy fat.

00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:24.349
Around exercise we leave the fat out or to
a very small minimum because it slows digestion;

00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:27.180
you don't wanna slow digestion around exercise.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:33.300
Nourish yourself before and after exercise,
and every 2 1/2 to 3 hours all day long.

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:39.650
I love dairy three times, morning when you
wake up, after exercise 'cause it is such

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:45.620
a potent recovery beverage both for hydration
and muscle and mental performance, and in

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.460
the evening when you wanna rest.

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.150
An egg yolk I say or soy every day.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:55.760
Whole soy contains lecithin which also contains,
which has the choline in it.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.900
Nuts every day.

00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.460
Fish five times a week.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:03.710
Of course hydration plays an enormous role
here; five to six cups of water every day

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:09.150
in addition to all of your beverages, and
that is a science based number and we can

00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:14.950
talk about where that comes from at another
time; may be in the book.

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:21.210
Of course a variety of fruits and vegetables;
this is foundational, fundamental.

00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:22.809
Don't just eat carrots and apples --

00:55:22.809 --> 00:55:24.440
[pause]

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:30.200
and bananas; that's what Americans eat, carrots,
apples, and bananas.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:34.690
Spread out [chuckles], try something new.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:37.910
It is peach season in Washington State.

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:44.809
The peaches, half a peach is like the size
of a whole peach, they're each a pound I think,

00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:51.299
they are fabulous, you can eat them raw, you
can throw them in a smoothie, you can put

00:55:51.299 --> 00:55:57.770
them in your yogurt, you can make a pie, you
can bake a peach, you can grill a peach, you

00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:59.470
can broil a peach.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:04.100
Enjoy the stone fruit this time of year.

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:09.450
And of course I'd be lying to you if I said
that it was all about diet.

00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:16.099
Diet creates the foundation in your body and
your mind so that you can have the energy

00:56:16.099 --> 00:56:22.710
physically and mentally to do the other things
in life that are so important to making a

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:25.530
full rounded, happy life.

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:30.320
And so exercise, rest, relationships, creativity,
and spirituality.

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:37.030
And in fact it takes action to have satisfaction.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:43.160
Physiologically you must move to have a sense
of satisfaction.

00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:50.099
So that is neurochemistry of the brain tied
to the movement of the body.
