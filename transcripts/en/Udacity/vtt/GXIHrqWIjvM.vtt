00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.810
Jenny's story is truly amazing, and we're

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.160
going to hear from her later in the lesson.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.460
&gt;&gt; She talked a lot about passing on the trait of dwarfism

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.010
or achondroplasia to her children, and for us to understand exactly what

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.840
that entails, we need to think about what's actually getting passed down

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.700
to the next generation. So how's the whole genome involved in this process?

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.440
&gt;&gt; Well, let's take a moment and step back from our pedigree. So,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.150
focus on the physical material. That's

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.540
actually passed down from generation to generation.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.590
&gt;&gt; So, you're talking about DNA.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.800
&gt;&gt; Right. DNA. The genetic material that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.450
a parent passes on, to their offspring. Tell

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.050
me. What cell type is most responsible

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.720
for passing DNA on to, the next generation?
