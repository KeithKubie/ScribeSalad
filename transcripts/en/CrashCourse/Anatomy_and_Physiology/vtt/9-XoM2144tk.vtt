00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.959
I feel like I haven’t spent nearly enough
time lately talking to you about all the stupid

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.890
and dangerous things that you can do to your
own body, so let’s talk about doping.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.970
You probably have heard of this thanks to
Lance Armstrong, who secretly messed with

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.280
his own blood so that he could illicitly win
the Tour de France seven times in a row.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.190
You might be dimly familiar with the fact
that doping isn’t like shooting steroids,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.770
but it is still cheating, even though, like,
why is it cheating? And how does it work?

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.210
And is it even possible to make your blood
better at being blood?

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.510
In other words, how can some people treat -- or
mistreat -- their own blood like it’s some sort of drug?

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.290
Short answer: Because your blood is incredibly
powerful stuff.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.280
And its power rests largely in your erythrocytes,
or red blood cells. They’re the most abundant

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.760
cell type in your blood, accounting for nearly
45 percent of its volume.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.430
Every time you take a breath, they pick up
oxygen in your lungs and distribute it through

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.760
your body, and then grab carbon dioxide, and
bring it back to the lungs where it can be exhaled.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.460
The main mission of erythrocytes is to keep
your body fed with oxygen, so your muscles

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.129
can do their thing, and your brain can continue to
think and feel and boss around your various parts.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.489
But you don’t want to mess around with your red
blood cells because erythrocytes are weird characters.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.920
They go places that other cells won’t. They
purge themselves of their most precious inner

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.979
belongings, preferring instead to live as
hollow shells.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.880
Because of the crushing demands of their job,
they don’t live very long. And just like

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.789
with your blood pressure, too much of these
good things can turn bad quickly.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.669
So the erythrocyte must be respected. It is
not for doping. Or for dopes.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.020
Despite their prominent role in some international
sports scandals, your red blood cells are

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.590
fairly simple and unassuming little cells.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.810
They’ve got a distinct biconcave shape -- which
just means that they’re concave on both

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.689
sides -- making them look kinda like a breath
mint… a tiny, bloody breath mint.

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.560
And while they have a plasma membrane, they
don’t have a nucleus and don’t have most

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.929
of the parts other cells do.

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.169
So they’re basically just glorified, protein-filled
phospholipid-bilayer sacks. But they’re

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:04.429
still another great example of that harmony
between form and function.

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:09.000
For one thing, that biconcave shape gives them a
large surface area that’s ideal for gas exchange.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.610
It also makes them flexible, able to change
shape as they squeeze through tiny capillaries

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.209
with diameters smaller than the cell itself.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.170
Of course, all that squeezing and twisting
is hard on a cell’s membrane, and that,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.510
combined with their general lack of organelles
to help repair the membrane, means these cells

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.349
don’t live very long, surviving on average
only 120 days.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.340
But they sure work hard while they’re alive.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.620
And their work is mostly in gathering and
transporting oxygen. They’re able to do

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.129
this because, if you don’t count their water
content, red blood cells are 97 percent hemoglobin

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.629
-- a molecule that easily binds to, and releases,
oxygen. It’s like an oxygen sponge.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.670
Every hemoglobin molecule is really made of
eight different component molecules -- four

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.069
are a red pigment called heme, and four are
a protein called, you guessed it, globin.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.299
Each globin is a globular polypeptide chain
-- hence its name -- and proteins, you’ll

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.489
probably remember, like to bind to stuff.

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.269
So each globin has its own personal ring-shaped
heme molecule, and in the center of that heme

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.469
is an iron atom, kinda like a cherry on top
of a protein-and-pigment sundae.

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.879
It’s that iron in the center of the heme
that makes our blood red.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.739
Incidentally, not all animals have red blood,
because not all animals use hemoglobin to

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.349
move oxygen. For example, most mollusks like
squids and snails have blue blood, because

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.499
it contains hemocyanin, a copper-rich protein-pigment
that turns blue when exposed to oxygen.

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.959
But, iron is what we’re stuck with, and
I have to say it’s great at its job, because

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.030
each iron can bind with one whole oxygen molecule.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.069
And that oxygen really adds up.

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.069
Since you have four iron atoms in every molecule
of hemoglobin and every red blood cell contains

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:45.579
something like 250 million hemoglobin molecules
that means each one of your tiny, floppy red-breath-mints

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.569
can grab about a BILLION molecules of oxygen.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.379
Exactly how they transfer oxygen and carbon
dioxide from your tissue cells is something

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.459
that we’ll get into when we talk about the
respiratory system.

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.439
But if you’re wondering why all this hemoglobin
can’t simply skip the red blood cell rigamarole

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.670
and just run around naked in your blood, it’s
because free-range hemoglobin would actually

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.430
thicken the blood, making it so viscous that
it would impede blood flow.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.029
This also happens to play a part in blood doping,
which -- stick with me -- I will explain in a bit.

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:16.799
So what does the brief but glorious four-month
life of an erythrocyte look like? Well, remember

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.930
when I said a red blood cell doesn’t have
a nucleus? And maybe you thought, hey wait

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.150
a second, how can it even be a cell without
a nucleus, or DNA?

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.720
First of all, nice catch.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.580
But actually, erythrocytes do start off with
a nucleus and DNA, they just get rid of them,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.750
because their entire purpose for existing
is to schlep around hemoglobin and oxygen,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.960
and they want the extra room.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.259
The whole process of forming blood cells,
called hematopoiesis, happens in your red

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.300
bone marrow, which is mostly made of reticular
connective tissue that’s snuggled up to

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.610
special capillaries called blood sinusoids.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.610
In short, the process begins with a hemocytoblast
-- or a specialized stem cell -- which soon

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.539
differentiates into an early erythroblast.
Then, it starts making a whole bunch of ribosomes,

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.440
the organelles that manufacture proteins.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.220
And in this case, the ribosomes start cooking
up tons of hemoglobin, as the cell transforms

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.690
into a late-stage erythroblast.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.310
When it’s got enough hemoglobin, it suddenly
jettisons most of its organelles, which causes

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.979
the cell walls to collapse a little, giving
it its biconcave bloody breath-mint shape.

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.259
Now you’re left with a reticulocyte, which
is pretty much just an early erythrocyte that

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.629
still has a little group of ribosomes left,
called a reticulum.

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.789
So far, this whole journey so far has taken
about fifteen days.

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.840
When the reticulocyte is finally bursting
with hemoglobin, then it leaves the marrow

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.229
and enters the bloodstream, and a couple of
days later, when the last ribosomes have degraded,

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.330
you’ve officially got yourself a mature
red blood cell.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.270
And that cell travels around your body, doing
its job for a few months before it gets old

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.030
or damaged and needs to be replaced.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.949
Now, maintaining the balance between production
and destruction of these cells is crucial.

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.589
Too many will make the blood too
viscous and difficult to pump,

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:53.699
and too few leads to oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia.

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.810
The process of maintaining the right levels
of red blood cells is regulated by a special

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.060
hormone called erythropoietin, or EPO. It’s
produced mostly in the kidneys, but also in

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.580
the liver, and is constantly circulating in
the blood.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.970
If you’re anemic, or hiking at a high altitude,
or hemorrhaging blood, or experiencing anything

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.159
else that creates a drop in your blood oxygen
levels, certain cells in your kidney will

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:15.770
notice, and take action.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.789
And they can do that, because they traffick
in a signaling molecule called hypoxia-inducible

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.770
factor, which monitors your blood’s levels
of oxygen.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.550
The way that this works is pretty cool. These
special kidney cells need oxygen in order

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.159
to break down that signaling molecule, so
if oxygen levels in the blood are low, they

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.060
can’t turn the signal off. This means that
the signal keeps going, which triggers the

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.879
release of more and more EPO, which stimulates
your red bone marrow to pump out more red

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.080
blood cells to carry around more oxygen.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.440
As oxygen levels in your blood increase, the
signal is degraded, and EPO production slows.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.069
And EPO is a key player in blood doping too,
but we’re gonna have to wait a minute before

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:53.960
we get there, because I first want to get
back to the fate of your hard-working erythrocytes.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.289
So if you’re generating about two million
new blood cells every second, you also have

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.210
to dispose of about the same number of dead
ones to maintain the balance, right?

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.919
When these cells get old, they turn rigid,
and their hemoglobins starts to fall apart.

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:10.300
As they get stiffer, they can end up getting
stuck in capillaries in your brain or heart,

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.370
which would not be good.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:16.409
Luckily, you have certain channels to corral
these dying cells, especially around the spleen,

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:19.909
which some anatomists call “the red blood
cell graveyard.”

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:24.879
So these tired old cells get trapped and then
basically ambushed by big macrophage white

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:29.069
blood cells in the spleen, liver, and bone
marrow, which break them down and recycle

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:30.340
their various components.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.060
The globin proteins are broken down into their
basic components -- amino acids -- which go

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.669
back into the blood to be used by other cells
for making more proteins.

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:41.090
Iron from the heme group is separated and
either bound to proteins and stored in the

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.599
liver, or put right back into a new hemoglobin
molecule. And the heme gets turned into bilirubin,

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:49.719
a yellowish pigment that goes to the liver
where it’s added to the bile that it secretes

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:52.740
into the intestine and eventually leaves the
body in your poop.

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.680
Now that you know how your erythrocytes function
naturally, it’s easier to see how they can

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.639
be messed with -- often with bad results.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:02.000
You can dope your blood in a few different
ways, but the most common technique is to

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.330
inject natural or synthetic EPO hormone to
boost your red blood cell production.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.370
It’s also possible to draw and store some
of your own blood, and then transfuse it back

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:15.889
into your body after your body has recovered
from the blood loss, effectively raising your

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:17.430
volume of red blood cells.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.560
The logic, if you can call it that, is that
more red blood cells equals more oxygen being

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.349
carried to your muscles, and therefore better
physical performance.

00:08:24.349 --> 00:08:28.860
Now, the extra oxygen can’t change your actual
muscle strength, but the added aerobic capacity

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.520
does reduce muscle fatigue and enhance endurance,
by allowing your muscles to work harder for longer.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:39.070
And it can provide enough of an extra edge
to win a race, like, say, the Tour de France.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.320
Seven times.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.740
But not only is it banned in athletic competitions,
blood doping is also dangerous.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.820
Because, remember, a red blood cell count
that’s too high thickens the blood, and

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.430
that actually makes it harder for the heart
to pump blood around the body. In addition

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.850
to defeating the purpose of enhancing the
blood’s effectiveness, this can lead to

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.230
blood clots, and strokes, and heart failure.
So, no thank you.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:01.080
Plus, cheating sucks.

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.920
But today you learned about the structure
and function of your erythrocytes, and of

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.700
hemoglobin, which they use to carry oxygen.
We also went through the formation and life

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:13.340
cycle of a red blood cell, and studied how
their levels are regulated by EPO and their

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:17.730
signalling molecules. Finally, we learned
how doping the blood is a recipe for disaster

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:23.450
and for finding yourself on Oprah and apologizing to
everyone you know and losing all of your yellow jerseys.
