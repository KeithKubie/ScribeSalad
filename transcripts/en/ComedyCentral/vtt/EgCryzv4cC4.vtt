All right. Welcome back,
welcome back, welcome back.

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:10.510
Now, in many ways, social media
is a brutally honest reflection

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:12.278
of today's culture,
for better or for worse.

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:15.081
Now, here to examine what
social media got right and wrong

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:17.250
this week is<i> Nightly Show</i>

-(cheering, applause)

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.325
Thanks, Larry.

00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:28.361
So, this past weekend Kanye West

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:31.164
dropped the music video
for his song "Famous."

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.801
In it, Kanye West lays in bed
with creepily realistic

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.370
wax replicas of celebrities,
including Taylor Swift,

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:40.306
Rihanna, Chris Brown,
Amber Rose, Donald Trump,

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.708
Caitlyn Jenner and Bill Cosby.

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.544
Oh...

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.680
and they're all butt-ass naked.

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:49.649
Gross.

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:51.350
Now, they're
supposed to be asleep,

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:53.753
but to me it just
looks like a crime scene.

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.789
But, as they say,
Kanye's gonna Kanye.

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:59.392
But his delusional fans were
quick to defend the video

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.227
with tweets like these.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.795
"The 'Famous' video
by Kanye West

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:05.531
is (bleep) art."

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.700
"Why are people
shaming this video?

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.435
It is art!"

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:12.338
"With your famous video
is one of the most valuable

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.107
pieces of art in our time."

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.313
The most valuable
piece of art in our time?

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:23.716
I'm guessing you've never
seen an Andy Warhol,

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.319
Georgia O'Keeffe
or Jackson Pollock?

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.489
If you think this video is art,
I've got an old copy of<i> Hustler</i>

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.157
and an episode of<i> Forensic Files</i>

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.159
that will
blow your (bleep) mind.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:34.727
(cheering, applause)

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.800
And to add insult to injury,

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.835
this garbage video
isn't even original.

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:46.172
"This scene is inspired
by Vincent Desiderio.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:48.374
Gotta appreciate
the risk and vision."

00:01:48.407 --> 00:01:50.176
Risk and vision?

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:53.212
Sure, risky because Kanye's ass
is probably getting sued.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:56.382
But vision? He just copied
someone else's work.

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:59.418
Hey, HBO, I've got a completely
original idea for you.

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:02.221
It's called<i> Throne of Games.</i>

00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:05.725
Trust me, totally mine.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.895
Sure, technically, this video
could be considered art.

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:11.464
But just because it's art
doesn't mean it isn't awful.

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:15.168
Kind of like your nephew's
macaroni self-portrait.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:16.736
I don't care
if you're in preschool, kid,

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.606
working with rigatoni
makes you a douche.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.209
Not to mention,
art can be criticized.

00:02:23.242 --> 00:02:24.877
Oh, and criticize it I will.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.480
This video is gross
on so many levels.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:29.448
It's so misogynistic.

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:31.884
It's not new or creative
to exploit women's bodies.

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:34.720
There are tons of wax tits
in this video

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:36.956
but where
are the wax dicks, Kanye?

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.725
(cheering, applause)

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:42.562
Well...

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.463
technically,
Trump is a wax dick,

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.232
-so you do have one.
-(cheering, applause)

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.604
I'll give it to you.

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:54.707
Then you've got Rihanna
next to Chris brown.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.343
You know, that dude
that, uh, abused her?

00:02:57.376 --> 00:03:01.247
And let's not forget the video
has multiple naked women in bed

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.349
with an alleged serial rapist.

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:05.919
That's right, (bleep),
we haven't forgotten about you.

00:03:08.487 --> 00:03:10.923
To top it off,
this masterpiece was made

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:12.491
without any
of these people's consent,

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:14.360
which is so hypocritical.

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:17.363
Kanye, you know how valuable
your public image is.

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:19.532
Hell, you didn't like it
when an Australian artist

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:22.635
did a mural of you
making out with yourself.

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:26.539
And if I'm being totally honest,
Kanye making out with Kanye

00:03:26.572 --> 00:03:30.309
is way more plausible
than this freaky slumber party.

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:33.512
Listen, Kanye, I really don't
understand your sick obsession

00:03:33.545 --> 00:03:36.349
with Taylor Swift, Amber Rose
or yourself, for that matter,

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:38.618
but this video
really crossed the line.

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.586
I have always been a fan
of your music,

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:42.421
but what you do
with your wax figures

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:45.791
in the privacy of your own home
is your business.

00:03:45.824 --> 00:03:49.528
Just leave us out of your not so
beautiful dark twisted fantasy.

00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:51.631
Franchesca Ramsey, everybody.

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.666
We'll be right back.
