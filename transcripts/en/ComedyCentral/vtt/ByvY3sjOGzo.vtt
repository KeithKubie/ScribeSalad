I got a gift.

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:48.741
You know?

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:51.778
But I was in New York City,
east of Hoboken.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:02:00.853
And I hadn't planned on doing
any cocaine, okay?

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.656
I planned on doing
this much cocaine.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.726
That's a zero amount,
you know?

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:12.165
But apparently, some cocaine
had planned on getting together

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:16.636
with me when it left
its home that evening.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.037
So I went to this party, man,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.705
and my friends were
at this party.

00:02:19.738 --> 00:02:22.308
And uh--and I felt
uncomfortable

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:24.010
when I got to this party.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.479
Probably because, like,
when I really

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.014
think back on my life, like,

00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.049
I've always just felt
uncomfortable.

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:31.651
You know, like,
I don't know what it is.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.186
Like, my whole life
has just been

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.489
this constant struggle
with every moment.

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:38.324
Like, I'm just wrestling
with every second

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:40.026
just to feel okay.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:42.895
Like, I don't even wanna
feel good.

00:02:42.928 --> 00:02:46.566
Just set me in the middle,
you know?

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.868
So I'm at this party,
and I'm feeling

00:02:48.901 --> 00:02:51.137
how I feel
regularly, uncomfortable.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.539
So I decided
to have some drinks,

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:56.175
because my friends
are alcoholics.

00:02:56.208 --> 00:03:00.513
And I'm competitive.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.381
So I have a couple tequilas,
right?

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:04.050
And tequila, let's be honest,

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.986
is like pouring Mexico right
into your body, okay?

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.023
I mean, make you jump a fence,
make you buy a gun,

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:14.193
make you run across a highway
with your family,

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:17.363
make you knock a woman up,
make you knock a woman down.

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:20.032
Okay?
Olé, Janet.

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:22.168
You know?

00:03:22.201 --> 00:03:25.905
So I had me
a couple of tequilas, and, uh--

00:03:25.938 --> 00:03:27.873
And I was feeling alive,
you know?

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:29.408
I was feeling
a little more comfortable.

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.944
Now, at 1:30 in the morning,
I left this, uh--

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:33.946
I left this party
because at 6:30 a.m.,

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.549
I had to be on a nationally
syndicated radio program,

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:39.118
"The Opie and Jim Norton"
radio show.

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:41.754
And uh--yeah, it's a wonderful
show that tapes there,

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:43.522
in New York City, New York.

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:48.094
And those are two men
that I really admire, you know?

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:51.897
And "admire" is when somebody
is better than you,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.301
but you still like 'em.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.073
It's an old-fashioned ideal.

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:06.078
So at 1:30 a.m. I get
into this taxi cab, right?

00:04:06.111 --> 00:04:07.913
This beautiful Asian girl,

00:04:07.946 --> 00:04:10.583
that I do not know,
gets into the taxi with me.

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:13.719
We're both headed the same way.
They call it "sharing a taxi."

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:15.554
Okay?

00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:19.892
And this girl lays the back of
her head right into my lap.

00:04:19.925 --> 00:04:23.796
And I'm thinking,
fuck yeah, you know?

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:28.267
New York's got these beautiful
free Asian girls

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.770
with every taxi ride.

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:33.272
This is a marvelous
accoutrement to the city,

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:34.774
you know?

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.108
Uber? No, thank you.

00:04:36.141 --> 00:04:40.012
Taxi, you have won me back.

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:42.114
So this girl's just
laying in my lap,

00:04:42.147 --> 00:04:45.584
and she just starts reminiscing
about her evening, you know?

00:04:45.617 --> 00:04:47.119
She said--

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:48.954
She said she had
a nice evening,

00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:50.923
but that her boyfriend
wasn't in town.

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.958
That he's never in town.

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.295
Then she goes,
"What happens in taxis,

00:04:56.328 --> 00:04:59.165
stays in taxis."

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:04.136
And I'm not the brightest,
you know,

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.308
bowl in the bowl drawer,
you know?

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:11.644
[laughs]

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.312
Ugh, dude.

00:05:13.345 --> 00:05:14.547
You ever wander into a
sentence, and you're like,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.617
how do I get out of here?

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.321
But I'm looking around this
vehicle after she says that,

00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:23.789
and I'm thinking,

00:05:23.822 --> 00:05:27.693
"This is a taxi," you know?

00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:32.565
I mean, taxi me once,
shame on me.

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:35.167
So I'm feeling kinda cavalier
after her statements, right?

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.203
I go down to make a kiss,
you know?

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:40.172
This young lady is laying in my
lap, I go down to make a kiss.

00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:44.343
Now, trying to kiss someone
that's laying in your lap,

00:05:44.376 --> 00:05:47.980
that's a beautiful idea.

00:05:48.013 --> 00:05:52.418
Until you get right here, okay?

00:05:54.787 --> 00:05:56.722
And then you're just
milling around

00:05:56.755 --> 00:06:00.226
like a lip rapist, bruh.

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:04.730
I don't think James Bond could
kiss a woman laying in his lap.

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:06.198
Okay?

00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.933
So she pushed me off of her.

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:09.735
Uh, she called me a creep.

00:06:09.768 --> 00:06:14.507
She called me a pervert.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.779
I'm definitely not a creep.

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.614
And then it was awkward
for a few blocks,

00:06:21.647 --> 00:06:24.216
until she got dropped off
wherever she was going.

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:26.051
Uh, I'm not sure
even where it was.

00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:28.421
I think it was, like,
a halfway house

00:06:28.454 --> 00:06:32.358
for complete cunts
or something.

00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:36.595
And at that point, it's just me
and the driver, you know?

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:39.231
And--

00:06:39.264 --> 00:06:42.902
and I thought he said "drugs."

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:44.270
He could've
said something else.

00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:46.071
English wasn't
his first language.

00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:48.240
You know?
He was bi-language.

00:06:48.273 --> 00:06:50.910
But I heard "drugs" in my head,
you know?

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:52.812
And so I said, "Cocaine!"

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.414
Like I was
Coke-stepher Columbus, bruh,

00:06:55.447 --> 00:06:59.251
and we just landed on
Crack Rock, you know?

00:06:59.284 --> 00:07:01.454
And I heard him accelerate
that vehicle,

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:03.589
and that's
universal language for,

00:07:03.622 --> 00:07:07.259
"We're gonna get some cocaine."

00:07:07.292 --> 00:07:09.895
'Cause that's a drug to me,
you know?

00:07:09.928 --> 00:07:11.597
Weed.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.301
Weed is a confusing spice.

00:07:18.303 --> 00:07:20.272
I mean, weed will make you
forget how to get home.

00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:24.977
Cocaine will make you forget
how to get to heaven.

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:29.114
So we just drove, man.
Man, we just drove, man.

00:07:29.147 --> 00:07:31.116
And, uh, we drove
for about a half hour,

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:32.618
into, like, North Harlem.

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:36.155
If that's even a place.
I don't even know.

00:07:36.188 --> 00:07:38.157
But it was a dark neighborhood.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.093
And that's not a euphemism.

00:07:41.126 --> 00:07:43.462
All the street lights
were busted out,

00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:47.299
so you couldn't tell that it
was predominantly black.

00:07:47.332 --> 00:07:48.801
But I grew up in a
black neighborhood.

00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:51.136
I know when I'm back,
you know?

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:52.471
And we got there, man.

00:07:52.504 --> 00:07:54.473
And I gave this dude
some money.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.442
He gets out of the vehicle,
comes back a few minutes later

00:07:56.475 --> 00:07:58.143
with some cocaine on him,
you know?

00:07:58.176 --> 00:08:01.647
But he sits
in the backseat next to me.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.350
A little alarming,
you know?

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:06.318
Kinda like when you're
in the air on a plane,

00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:07.853
and you see the
pilot taking a piss,

00:08:07.886 --> 00:08:10.823
and you're like,
What the fuck, dude?

00:08:10.856 --> 00:08:13.559
Is this Spirit?

00:08:16.895 --> 00:08:18.497
But this beautiful gentleman

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.199
scooped up a little bit of
cocaine on a car key,

00:08:20.232 --> 00:08:21.500
put it under my nose...
[sniffs]

00:08:21.533 --> 00:08:23.002
killed that baby, bruh.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:24.503
Then I scooped him one.
[sniffs]

00:08:24.536 --> 00:08:26.071
And he killed his, man.

00:08:26.104 --> 00:08:28.140
And then, [sniffs] and [sniffs]
and [sniffs]

00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:29.542
and [sniffs]
and [sniffs] and [sniffs].

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:34.880
Just a couple of
dueling cocainists.

00:08:34.913 --> 00:08:36.348
And we got high, man.

00:08:36.381 --> 00:08:39.318
Uh, we got high
for about 40 minutes.

00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:42.588
Dude, I remember being
so high at one point,

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:47.393
I was like, dude, where
the fuck is the driver, bro?

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:55.034
And he didn't know.

00:08:57.402 --> 00:08:59.238
So we sat there, man.
We continued

00:08:59.271 --> 00:09:01.073
to get high together, me and
this beautiful gentleman.

00:09:01.106 --> 00:09:05.444
And he said, Luigi--
that was his name--Luigi.

00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:07.880
And I thought that was Spanish,
you know?

00:09:07.913 --> 00:09:11.050
Like that rare Italian Spanish.

00:09:12.651 --> 00:09:14.920
So I start saying
my name in Spanish.

00:09:14.953 --> 00:09:17.389
Teodoro.

00:09:17.422 --> 00:09:21.260
'Cause I learned Spanish
in Louisiana.

00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:23.596
And my whole life,
I thought Teodoro

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:27.032
was Spanish for Theodore,
which is my first name.

00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:28.767
About six months ago,
this girl goes,

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.971
that means I adore you.

00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:35.808
Wish you would've told me
at some other point, you know?

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:38.644
Because it's fine--right--it's
fine to tell people

00:09:38.677 --> 00:09:40.079
you adore them
when you meet them.

00:09:40.112 --> 00:09:41.146
But when you're an hour deep

00:09:41.179 --> 00:09:43.949
into an 8-ball,

00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:46.085
with a man who keeps saying
he's Luigi

00:09:46.118 --> 00:09:50.122
and you just keep saying,
I adore you to him,

00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:54.360
99% of the time,
this don't end heterosexually.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:09:59.431
So--

00:09:59.464 --> 00:10:04.570
Ah, this is a long night, man.

00:10:04.603 --> 00:10:07.573
So he starts saying,
I got a gift for you.

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:09.274
I got a gift.

00:10:09.307 --> 00:10:11.243
And I grew up in, like, a
broken neighborhood, you know.

00:10:11.276 --> 00:10:13.445
I thought it was
gonna be his cock.

00:10:13.478 --> 00:10:15.848
You know?

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:17.449
So I start practicing my, like,

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:20.119
"see a cock, like,
don't be interested" faces.

00:10:20.152 --> 00:10:23.022
It's, you know, like...
[tsks]

00:10:24.122 --> 00:10:26.292
[mumbles]
Uh-uh.

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:30.195
So I'm running through
the rolodex

00:10:30.228 --> 00:10:32.598
of "no cock for me" faces.

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:35.300
And, uh--and then
he keep saying

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:37.703
I got a gift, a gift,
I got a gift for you.

00:10:37.736 --> 00:10:39.705
Then I'm thinking, like, it's,
like, a thing on his phone.

00:10:39.738 --> 00:10:41.306
You know, like a GIF.

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:44.443
You know, like
a disappointed walrus.

00:10:44.476 --> 00:10:48.748
You know, like,
Monday, Monday, Monday.

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:54.286
Monday, Monday.

00:10:54.319 --> 00:10:56.188
But then I hear...
[knocks on microphone]

00:10:56.221 --> 00:10:57.823
on the taxi door.

00:10:57.856 --> 00:11:01.160
And I'm like,
Who knocks on a car door, dude?

00:11:01.193 --> 00:11:04.430
Come in, or just be out there,
you know?

00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:09.368
Were you raised in a house
of car doors in it?

00:11:11.236 --> 00:11:13.639
So I'm like, come in.

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:16.675
'Cause now I gotta live in this
shit universe they created

00:11:16.708 --> 00:11:18.744
by knocking.

00:11:18.777 --> 00:11:20.145
And a 'tute gets in.

00:11:20.178 --> 00:11:23.215
A prostitute, you know?

00:11:24.182 --> 00:11:26.719
A 'tute.
You can't say "pros."

00:11:26.752 --> 00:11:30.856
"Pros" is somebody that, uh--
have a prosthetic, you know?

00:11:30.889 --> 00:11:32.825
And a 'tute get mad
if you call 'em a "pros,"

00:11:32.858 --> 00:11:37.996
if, uh--if they got
everything, you know?

00:11:38.029 --> 00:11:39.364
So I'm being politically
correct

00:11:39.397 --> 00:11:40.532
and I'm saying this 'tute,
you know.

00:11:40.565 --> 00:11:42.034
And I respect prostitutes.

00:11:42.067 --> 00:11:43.569
I respect all women.
You know,

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:45.003
whether they're
a president or a prostitute,

00:11:45.036 --> 00:11:46.572
I respect them, man.

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:48.340
You know, prostitute,
probably a tougher job,

00:11:48.373 --> 00:11:50.209
let's be honest,
these days, dude.

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:52.377
You out there,
middle of the night,

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:55.514
slinging that canal,
you know?

00:11:55.547 --> 00:11:58.584
A lot of men are gay,
market share's declined.

00:11:58.617 --> 00:12:00.419
So I respect prostitutes, man,

00:12:00.452 --> 00:12:02.387
but I don't wanna deal
with a prostitute tonight.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:06.191
I just wanna do cocaine
with my adorable buddy, Luigi.

00:12:06.224 --> 00:12:08.427
You know?

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:10.295
And this prostitute, man,
she had, like,

00:12:10.328 --> 00:12:13.632
a--you know, she had a wig
that covered--

00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:16.902
you could see about 60%
of her face, okay?

00:12:16.935 --> 00:12:19.238
And to me, it looked like
a man's face, right?

00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:22.241
Which is fine, you know?

00:12:22.274 --> 00:12:24.610
No judgment, there, I'm just
saying if I were on a game show

00:12:24.643 --> 00:12:28.413
called "Guess 60%
of This Person's Face,"

00:12:28.446 --> 00:12:31.750
I would guess man first,
you know?

00:12:31.783 --> 00:12:33.452
But so we're all, uh--
we're all back there

00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:35.087
getting high together,
and this prostitute

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.055
starts making
advances towards me.

00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:38.724
And I don't want a prostitute.

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:40.325
So I start feeling
uncomfortable,

00:12:40.358 --> 00:12:42.661
which is where I live at,
most of the time.

00:12:42.694 --> 00:12:45.297
So it only took me about half
a lung to get there, you know?

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:46.799
So I get out of the taxi

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:48.734
into the street
in North Harlem, right?

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:52.504
Luigi comes out after me,
'cause that's new friendship.

00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:55.440
And he's like,
"$100, $100, $100."

00:12:55.473 --> 00:12:56.942
So I give him a hundred bucks.

00:12:56.975 --> 00:12:58.677
I'm thinking he's gonna
pay this 'tute.

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.279
She'll go on
about her business.

00:13:00.312 --> 00:13:02.181
We'll get back to,
you know, uh,

00:13:02.214 --> 00:13:04.950
you know, friendship.

00:13:04.983 --> 00:13:06.418
I look over a minute later,
they're kissing

00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:08.120
on each other's necks, okay?

00:13:08.153 --> 00:13:10.422
He's investing my hundred
back here with this prostitute.

00:13:10.455 --> 00:13:13.358
You know?
I still have a $240 meter

00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:15.460
on the front of
this taxi, right?

00:13:15.493 --> 00:13:21.600
So I'm out $360, not even
in the vehicle, unfair.

00:13:21.633 --> 00:13:23.869
But I deal with my negative
feelings outside of the car,

00:13:23.902 --> 00:13:25.304
so I don't bring negative
energy back

00:13:25.337 --> 00:13:28.540
into the vehicle, right?

00:13:28.573 --> 00:13:30.642
Then I get back into the taxi.

00:13:30.675 --> 00:13:33.645
But now I'm sitting in the
front passenger seat, right?

00:13:33.678 --> 00:13:36.215
You can hear Luigi
and the 'tute in the back.

00:13:36.248 --> 00:13:37.883
Um.

00:13:37.916 --> 00:13:40.018
So, you can hear the
light rustlings of a blowjob.

00:13:40.051 --> 00:13:44.456
You know, kinda just
simmering up into existence.

00:13:44.489 --> 00:13:46.491
A good blowjob too.
It sounded like, you know,

00:13:46.524 --> 00:13:49.628
one you see on the Internet,
you know?

00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:53.332
Sounded like somebody's
at a water park.

00:13:53.365 --> 00:13:56.501
And I respect
what they're doing, man.

00:13:56.534 --> 00:13:59.838
But I still wanna do cocaine
by myself, right?

00:13:59.871 --> 00:14:02.241
So now I'm trying to be
considerate,

00:14:02.274 --> 00:14:05.778
and quietly do cocaine
by myself, right?

00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:12.517
[sniffs slowly]

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.487
Just the softest, little
cokehead you ever met, dude.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.489
Just like a--just like a
newborn rabbit,

00:14:17.522 --> 00:14:20.425
just hopping up on the ground,
you know?

00:14:20.458 --> 00:14:22.694
At one point,
I was leaning my head back,

00:14:22.727 --> 00:14:26.531
and just quietly
dumping cocaine

00:14:26.564 --> 00:14:29.268
into the bottom
of my nose.

00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:33.038
It was awesome, bruh.

00:14:33.071 --> 00:14:36.408
Luigi's in the back, dude.
He's at the water park, bruh.

00:14:37.742 --> 00:14:39.578
He gots that
all-day wristband, dude.

00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:43.282
He don't give
a fuck about me.

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:46.919
He goes,
"You drive, you drive."

00:14:48.086 --> 00:14:50.389
And this is when I knew
I had a problem, man.

00:14:50.422 --> 00:14:52.758
not specifically
with drugs and alcohol,

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:57.062
but with the way that I behave
when I'm on drugs and alcohol.

00:14:57.095 --> 00:15:00.299
When I moved over into the
driver's seat

00:15:00.332 --> 00:15:02.267
of this taxi, right?

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.869
Put on my seatbelt.

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:09.274
I remember asking them
to put their seatbelt on.

00:15:09.307 --> 00:15:11.777
But they don't even make a
seatbelt for all that activity.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.313
You know?
We need seatbelt reform,

00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:17.249
I've been saying this.

00:15:17.282 --> 00:15:18.884
And I started this vehicle,

00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:21.620
and I drove us off
into North Harlem, man.

00:15:21.653 --> 00:15:24.756
At 4:15 in the morning,
just driving.

00:15:24.789 --> 00:15:28.093
Drove for probably
about 20 minutes.

00:15:28.126 --> 00:15:30.062
Didn't know where I was.
You know?

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:34.132
My brain's like, damn,
dude, you're lost.

00:15:34.165 --> 00:15:36.635
It's 4:30 in the morning, man.

00:15:36.668 --> 00:15:39.604
You're high on cocaine.

00:15:39.637 --> 00:15:45.811
But at least you're working.

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:50.182
At least you're out here making
money for your family, okay?

00:15:50.215 --> 00:15:53.452
I don't have a family, dude.

00:15:53.485 --> 00:15:57.689
More importantly,
I don't drive taxi, bruh.

00:15:57.722 --> 00:15:59.524
But then my brain also goes,
but man, you don't have

00:15:59.557 --> 00:16:01.760
a commercial driver's license.

00:16:01.793 --> 00:16:06.131
As if that was gonna be
an issue when the cop stops us.

00:16:06.164 --> 00:16:09.034
There's empty cocaine bags
everywhere, right?

00:16:09.067 --> 00:16:10.635
Like, I looked like
I'd been washing my face

00:16:10.668 --> 00:16:13.305
with powdered donuts.

00:16:13.338 --> 00:16:15.140
The sex crimes in the backseat.

00:16:15.173 --> 00:16:18.844
Potentially gay sex crimes
in the back seat.

00:16:18.877 --> 00:16:20.645
And that officer
is just gonna be like,

00:16:20.678 --> 00:16:22.614
"That's all for naught,
young soldier.

00:16:22.647 --> 00:16:26.352
You don't have
a chauffeur certificate."

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.721
But that's what got me
to pull over, man.

00:16:29.754 --> 00:16:31.656
I pulled over, I left a couple
hundred dollars

00:16:31.689 --> 00:16:34.326
on that car seat,
I started walking off, man.

00:16:34.359 --> 00:16:35.660
I walked about three blocks.

00:16:35.693 --> 00:16:40.465
Got into a regular taxi, right?

00:16:40.498 --> 00:16:42.968
I--I even made him
pop the trunk just to

00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:45.003
make sure that spare ties
wasn't shooting up

00:16:45.036 --> 00:16:47.406
in the back, you know?

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:51.143
I get to my hotel.
It's 5:30 in the morning.

00:16:51.176 --> 00:16:52.677
And in one hour,
I gotta be

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:54.579
on the nationally
syndicated radio program,

00:16:54.612 --> 00:16:56.848
"The Opie and Jim Norton"
radio show,

00:16:56.881 --> 00:17:00.352
two men that I really admire.

00:17:00.385 --> 00:17:03.355
So I finished doing my cocaine.

00:17:03.388 --> 00:17:07.325
'Cause you can't not finish
your cocaine, dude.

00:17:07.358 --> 00:17:12.364
Try to not finish your cocaine.

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:14.866
I will watch you try.

00:17:14.899 --> 00:17:18.137
What do they put in it,
cigarettes?

00:17:20.138 --> 00:17:24.176
I took three showers
in ten minutes, son.

00:17:24.209 --> 00:17:27.212
And dried off after each one,
bruh.

00:17:27.245 --> 00:17:29.748
You don't know me.

00:17:29.781 --> 00:17:33.085
Then I start walking to the
radio station, right?

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:36.221
It's five blocks
to the Sirius building.

00:17:36.254 --> 00:17:39.558
Halfway there, I realize
that I have on jeans

00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:42.861
with sweatpants
over them.

00:17:42.894 --> 00:17:44.896
Something I've never
worn before.

00:17:44.929 --> 00:17:47.099
Because nobody's ever worn it.

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:51.736
I'm the Neil Armstrong
of pants this morning.

00:17:51.769 --> 00:17:53.472
I get up to the radio station.
They tell me

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:55.540
I gotta be
on the air for three hours.

00:17:55.573 --> 00:17:57.742
There's a million listeners,
right?

00:17:57.775 --> 00:18:00.145
I can't feel my face.

00:18:00.178 --> 00:18:01.913
With either hand.

00:18:01.946 --> 00:18:04.116
Highest I can feel is my neck.

00:18:04.149 --> 00:18:07.419
Running on neck thoughts.

00:18:07.452 --> 00:18:10.989
And the other guest for the day
is Darryl Strawberry.

00:18:11.022 --> 00:18:14.759
[laughter and
scattered applause]

00:18:14.792 --> 00:18:17.062
Yeah.
Who's in the Hall of Fame.

00:18:17.095 --> 00:18:18.763
He's a Hall-of-Fame
baseball player.

00:18:18.796 --> 00:18:22.267
And he's in the Hall of Fame
for cocaine.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.803
Wasn't a eight ball this
beautiful man couldn't hit,

00:18:24.836 --> 00:18:25.770
right?

00:18:25.803 --> 00:18:27.439
And bless his heart, man.

00:18:27.472 --> 00:18:30.242
He's 13 years sober, and
he's eloquent, and successful,

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:31.743
and well-put together.

00:18:31.776 --> 00:18:32.811
And he was some of these ideas
that maybe

00:18:32.844 --> 00:18:34.446
I envisioned myself as.

00:18:34.479 --> 00:18:35.614
But this morning
I'm showing up, you know,

00:18:35.647 --> 00:18:38.950
nothing like that, you know.

00:18:38.983 --> 00:18:40.619
So it just made me think,
like dude,

00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:42.954
you gotta tighten up, you know?

00:18:42.987 --> 00:18:45.023
And I'll say this, too,
about Darryl Strawberry, man.

00:18:45.056 --> 00:18:47.192
I have big nostrils.
Darryl Strawberry gots

00:18:47.225 --> 00:18:51.029
the biggest nostrils
you ever seen.

00:18:51.062 --> 00:18:53.431
I'm not saying it to shame him,
it's not an ethnic thing.

00:18:53.464 --> 00:18:58.503
This man gots dead stars at the
bottom of his nose, okay?

00:18:58.536 --> 00:19:00.872
And I just say it
so that you understand

00:19:00.905 --> 00:19:05.177
he didn't stand a chance
against a fine powder.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.379
This beautiful man could
kill a spice rack

00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:10.315
from 70 feet away, okay?

00:19:10.348 --> 00:19:11.516
[sniffs]

00:19:11.549 --> 00:19:14.152
Boom. Take that, nutmeg!

00:19:14.185 --> 00:19:17.489
What you lookin' at,
coriander?

00:19:17.522 --> 00:19:18.657
But on this day,
he was everything

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.158
I needed to see, you know?

00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:22.827
Uh, so, yeah.
So that's when I got sober.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:24.696
And now I've been
sober for 11 months.

00:19:24.729 --> 00:19:26.231
Uh, and I'm Theo Von.

00:19:26.264 --> 00:19:28.567
Thank you for having me.
You guys be good.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.903
[crowd cheers]

00:19:31.936 --> 00:19:33.539
