00:00:00.386 --> 00:00:04.216
&gt;&gt;So my question is this, why do
we assume that kids' socializing

00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:06.056
and play is not a side of learning?

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:08.466
And on the flip side,
why do we assume

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:12.216
that schools can't have a
spirit of entertainment and play

00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:13.566
as part of what they're doing?

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:26.286
&gt;&gt;Last year I wrapped up a
three-year study with a large team

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:29.626
of researchers where we were looking
at a lot of different examples

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:31.976
of kids' new-media
practice, ranging from sort

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:36.316
of everyday hanging-out behavior
on sites like Myspace and Facebook

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:40.756
with text messaging, IM to what we
were calling more "geeked-out" kinds

00:00:40.756 --> 00:00:45.666
of participation, like making
YouTube videos, remixing videos,

00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:48.066
creating podcasts,
engaging in fan fiction,

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.946
and other forms of fan production.

00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:56.176
&gt;&gt;I think our most important
top-level finding was

00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:59.776
that there was tremendous diversity
in what kids were doing online

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:01.226
and what kids were learning online.

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:04.186
So most kids were engaged
with what we were calling

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:07.586
"friendship-driven participation,"
which was primarily about hanging

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:08.976
out with their friends online.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:11.726
And this is stuff that's
not so different

00:01:11.726 --> 00:01:14.656
from what older generations did
or what kids are doing today

00:01:14.656 --> 00:01:16.636
in the lunchroom and
hallways at school.

00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:19.186
And this is a really
important side of learning,

00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:23.486
the sort of important social
behaviors and what it means to grow

00:01:23.486 --> 00:01:27.816
up in a digital world and the sort
of ways in which kids post, link,

00:01:27.916 --> 00:01:30.676
forward, comment, create
top-friends lists.

00:01:30.676 --> 00:01:33.216
These are all negotiations
that are incredibly important

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:34.706
to kids growing up today.

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:37.926
There was a smaller minority of kids

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:41.436
who started using this baseline
technical and media literacy

00:01:41.436 --> 00:01:46.186
as a jumping-off point to start
developing more sophisticated kinds

00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:50.386
of skills, and this is what we called
"messing around" or as a transition

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:54.436
to more geeking-out kinds
of forms of participation.

00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:58.696
And that's where we saw a
much smaller cut of kids.

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:03.076
It was really a minority, those
kids that tend to be identified

00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:07.136
with more creative or geeky or
intellectual pursuits at school,

00:02:07.176 --> 00:02:11.986
kids who have strong interest-driven
orientations, and these are the kids

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:15.656
who are using the online world,
using new media-production tools,

00:02:15.726 --> 00:02:19.786
games as environments to really
develop specialized interests

00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:23.006
and very sophisticated forms of
technical and media literacy.

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:31.726
&gt;&gt;So I think there's this question
about how we look at the relationship

00:02:31.726 --> 00:02:34.806
between the friendship-driven
sites or the hanging-out space,

00:02:34.936 --> 00:02:36.676
the messing around
and the geeking out.

00:02:37.006 --> 00:02:40.276
And I think it's actually important
to value all those activities,

00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:42.496
but the way we as parents

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:44.936
and as educators approach
these different kinds

00:02:44.936 --> 00:02:47.676
of participation is
very different, I think.

00:02:48.086 --> 00:02:51.876
So overall, we found that
kids aren't really welcoming

00:02:51.876 --> 00:02:54.526
of adult intervention in
the friendship-driven space.

00:02:54.576 --> 00:02:57.246
I mean, I got so many
questions from parents

00:02:57.316 --> 00:03:01.296
who were wondering they should
friend their teenage daughter or son

00:03:01.296 --> 00:03:04.446
on Facebook, for example, or were
worried about the peer interactions,

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:08.386
and adults have a particular
and complicated role

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:12.046
to kids' peer relations, and
it's actually profoundly creepy

00:03:12.396 --> 00:03:15.976
for grown-ups to be participating in
a space where there's a lot of sort

00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:18.136
of dating and flirting going around.

00:03:18.136 --> 00:03:21.466
So for the most part, adults
are not welcome in that space,

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:25.166
but there is a role for education
in the sense that kids need

00:03:25.236 --> 00:03:28.096
to start thinking critically
about things like privacy

00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:29.576
and identity and all those things.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:34.256
And I think the adult world is quite
aware of those concerns and issues

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.326
and we've rehashed those quite a lot.

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:41.606
I think the piece that we don't
currently have real awareness

00:03:42.066 --> 00:03:47.496
that is shared or broad-based about
is how we support kids' engagement

00:03:47.656 --> 00:03:49.696
in the more messing-around
and geeking-out space.

00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:52.626
And this is space that
really has the opportunity

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:56.186
to foster kids' intellectual
development, their civic engagement,

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:59.746
their personal development
in really important ways,

00:03:59.746 --> 00:04:02.636
and yet we haven't really
worked as educators or parents

00:04:02.706 --> 00:04:04.956
to proactively engage kids.

00:04:12.116 --> 00:04:16.576
&gt;&gt;There really is a gap in perception
and understanding between generations

00:04:16.576 --> 00:04:19.796
about the value of engagement
with online activities.

00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:24.296
And so in the adult world,
there was a general perception

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:26.976
that when kids are in front
of the screen or messing

00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:29.346
around with their computer,
that it's a waste of time,

00:04:29.656 --> 00:04:32.386
that it's taking away from
more productive activities,

00:04:32.516 --> 00:04:36.156
healthier activities, whereas
kids ascribe much more value

00:04:36.306 --> 00:04:37.506
to those activities.

00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:40.566
And that's, in a way, not
so different from, you know,

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:43.716
an earlier generation trying to get
your teenage daughter off the phone

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:48.616
or trying to get your son to come
in from playing with their friends

00:04:48.646 --> 00:04:49.846
to focus on their homework,

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:52.966
but I think there's a more
general perception in the culture

00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:56.356
around new media that is
associated with entertainment media

00:04:56.356 --> 00:04:59.446
and other forms of
just mediated activity

00:04:59.446 --> 00:05:05.766
that it is inherently a space
that is hostile to learning.

00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:09.466
And that's the perception that I
think we really need to work against.

00:05:09.466 --> 00:05:11.936
And part of it is understanding
the differences

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:14.186
between different kinds
of online activities.

00:05:14.576 --> 00:05:16.796
So friendship-driven
activities are very different

00:05:16.796 --> 00:05:19.536
from interest-driven activity,
and if you lump them all together,

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:23.086
you're actually missing the
opportunity for learning that's

00:05:23.086 --> 00:05:26.276
in the space and also
not recognizing the sort

00:05:26.276 --> 00:05:29.756
of baseline social learning that's
happening in the friendship space.

00:05:37.736 --> 00:05:41.666
&gt;&gt;We know that the learning outside
of school matters tremendously

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:43.026
for the learning in school.

00:05:43.406 --> 00:05:46.516
So a lot of what we're trying to
say about kids' informal learning

00:05:46.516 --> 00:05:50.506
with new media is part of an already
existing set of understandings

00:05:50.506 --> 00:05:54.026
that educators have of the
importance of the home environment,

00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:56.426
for the peer environment,
for the community

00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:58.316
for learning that happens in schools.

00:05:58.666 --> 00:06:01.076
The question is, how
can we be more active

00:06:01.076 --> 00:06:02.786
about linking those two together?

00:06:05.086 --> 00:06:07.436
&gt;&gt;And I think this is a
tremendous challenge that a lot

00:06:07.436 --> 00:06:09.606
of these experimental
efforts are dealing with.

00:06:10.226 --> 00:06:14.246
I think for teachers and
schools and classroom learning,

00:06:14.246 --> 00:06:16.686
there's still an incredibly
important role to play,

00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:21.356
which is about giving kids access
across the board to a baseline set

00:06:21.356 --> 00:06:24.656
of standards, literacies,
expectations about what they need

00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:28.956
to participate in contemporary
society, to be reflective,

00:06:29.346 --> 00:06:35.026
and to also take opportunity of
the fact that you really have kids

00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:38.846
and adults in a shared space
that's safe, that's sanctioned,

00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:42.216
that gives kids an
opportunity to reflect on things

00:06:42.256 --> 00:06:43.866
in their everyday life
that's not just

00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:45.946
about them being immersed
in it all the time.

00:06:45.946 --> 00:06:49.436
So I think that there are incredibly
important functions for schools.

00:06:49.486 --> 00:06:52.396
What we're saying by evaluating
informal learning is not

00:06:52.456 --> 00:06:54.216
that we should abandon
formal learning

00:06:54.486 --> 00:06:56.566
but that we should get
those working together

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:58.036
in a much more coordinated way.
