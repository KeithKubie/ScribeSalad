1
00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.720
I,
I have,
uh,

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
all daughters and I have friends that are women and I,
uh,

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.980
I have a lot of friends that are women in the world of standup comedy.
And

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.110
I oftentimes see massage,

5
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.590
Enos Shit online that shocks me.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.000
And one of the things that shocked me was there's a guy that I follow and he was

7
00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:28.770
talking about how his wife was,
he looked thread on Twitter.
Well thought out,

8
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:32.430
very smart guys,
a lawyer.
And I was talking about how his wife's gas tank,

9
00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:34.650
so he's empty.
It's like every time he gets in his wife's car,

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.270
she's always had a gas.
He's like,
what the fuck?

11
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.620
Why do I always have to get gas for you?

12
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.010
And then she explained she doesn't like to park to get gas because she gets

13
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:46.500
harassed and it creeps her out.
And um,

14
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.290
and it's like a man would never think about that.
Not only men,

15
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:50.130
never think about that.

16
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.160
The messages he was getting from men calling him a cock making excuse.

17
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.670
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
There is,
I mean,

18
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.630
I am an idiot that I didn't think darkly enough because of course it was going

19
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.940
to go there and he told me direct messages,
getting directions,

20
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.520
just people you know,
saying all kinds of crazy shit to him because they,

21
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.620
not only are they in denial that this could be a situation where their mother

22
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:21.450
was in or their wife or their daughter.
Maybe they don't have a daughter.

23
00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:23.940
Maybe they have a bad relationship with her mother.
Maybe they just,

24
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.560
they've had so many bet.
You know,

25
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.790
if a guy's had so many bad interactions with women and he's not very smart and

26
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:33.150
he's just decided that women are evil and you see anything that's like saying,

27
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:36.540
hey guys,
maybe we should look at it in terms of like how the woman looks at it.

28
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.860
Fuck you.
Like that's real.
Those guys are real and they're out there.

29
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.830
I was at a gas station the other night at two o'clock in the morning.

30
00:01:43.831 --> 00:01:47.820
I was coming home from the comedy store and I pulled into this gas station and

31
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:48.450
there was this guy,

32
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.450
you know that you have that bulletproof thing where this thick glass and the

33
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:52.380
guy's talking to,
I'm,

34
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.250
I'm using my credit card and this guy is trying to use his debit card.

35
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.200
And uh,
I pull in,

36
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:02.820
I get out of my car and I hear yelling and I hear him going,
hey bro,

37
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.240
relax.
You're not a fucking bank teller or right.
He goes,

38
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:07.740
you're taking this job so seriously.

39
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:11.200
You make $10 an hour and the guy says something,
there's no money on the cars.

40
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.220
Like fuck you,
there's $800 on this card.

41
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.630
And his friend from the car saying something,
he said,
and I am nervous.
Okay,

42
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:23.340
I'm here.
Yes,
it's two o'clock in the morning and I'm nervous.
And I'm like,
fuck.

43
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.850
And I'm like,
what if this guy turns any of this aggression on me?

44
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.230
What if he decides,
I mean,

45
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:33.090
he's a fucking asshole and he's probably drunk or high or something and it's two

46
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:36.540
o'clock in the morning and it's him and there's another guy in the car.

47
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:40.500
And I'm so nervous humiliating the guy who works.
Yes,
yes.

48
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.130
And I'm so nervous that I'm thinking of cutting my pumps short.
I'm thinking,

49
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:47.580
I just don't get a full tank.
Just get five bucks and get the fuck Outta here.

50
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.990
You know,
don't run out of gas,
but let's just get the fuck out here.

51
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.810
We'll get the gas tomorrow during the daylight.

52
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.470
And I'm a man and I'm looking at these two guys and I'm saying,
okay,

53
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.250
if some shit goes down,
if these guys don't have a weapon,
if some shit goes down,

54
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.280
um,
I'm gonna beat the fuck out of these two guys.
Did they look skinny?

55
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.040
They look like they don't exercise,
but they're aggressive.
They're angry.

56
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:10.540
They're stupid.
My God.
Dammit.
Like all my spidey senses.
Go on,

57
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.990
get Outta here.
Go Get outta here.
And like an asshole.

58
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.980
I decided to stay and pump my gas,
but when the,
the,

59
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.300
these guys are yelling at each other,

60
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:23.830
I literally went around the front of the car instead of the,

61
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.030
this the back way because it was a shorter path from me being exposed to their

62
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:28.700
view.

63
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.070
So I'm hiding behind my truck while I'm filling my tank and I'm a man who could

64
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:33.970
kill these two guys.

65
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.360
I honestly thought where this story was going to go is that you were going to go

66
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:39.640
over and tell them to show.
I was thinking of going over there,

67
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:43.300
but I didn't want to get shot and I'm thinking,
what if this is how people die?

68
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.580
Now I'm saying no,

69
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.780
but also you can get hit in the head with a pipe,

70
00:03:49.781 --> 00:03:52.780
but isn't that insane thing that you have to worry that you're going to get shot

71
00:03:52.781 --> 00:03:57.190
at again?
It is.
It is,
but it's not just shot.
It's just violence in general.

72
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.350
And I'm,
and I'm a martial arts expert,

73
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.470
so I'm less worried than most men and certainly way less worried than a woman.

74
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.900
If I was a woman and I pulled up and I heard that guy go,

75
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.770
fuck you make $10 an hour,
bro,
fucking relaxed.
I'd be like,
Oh,

76
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.110
get me the fuck out of here.
I was on fumes though.

77
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.570
Raising two daughters made you so much more aware of this stuff.
100% yeah,

78
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.450
and also just raising babies.
Even if there were boys,

79
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.730
I realized that people were babies.
Now,

80
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.880
I used to think of people as being in a static state.
If I,
how old are you?

81
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.840
34 I meet you.
I go,
oh,
34 year old person.
This is a 34 year old person.

82
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:36.841
I didn't meet you in think in the past I would have met you and only thought of

83
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:38.170
you as a 34 year old person.

84
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.700
Now I look at everyone by default as a baby.

85
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.020
That's how I process things and it made me way more compassionate,

86
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.310
way more understanding and way more patient with people because I now I say,

87
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.430
okay,
when I meet this asshole at the gas station,

88
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:57.850
two o'clock in the morning that's berating that guy.
Well,
why is he?
Well,

89
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:01.570
because probably his dad's a fucking piece of shit.
His life probably sucks.

90
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:04.570
He's probably dumb.
He's probably been on drugs since he was young.

91
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.070
He doesn't have any smart friends.

92
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.560
They don't have any money to get gas at two o'clock in the morning and making

93
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:11.080
poor life choices.
There's a lot wrong here.

94
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.730
He doesn't have any discipline in his life.

95
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.420
He's never gone through any sort of trials and tribulations that taught him

96
00:05:16.421 --> 00:05:19.270
about things he isn't.
Disney didn't receive life lessons,

97
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:21.610
probably didn't get a good education.
Here we are,

98
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.370
and I might have to kick this guy's ass cause it's two o'clock in the morning

99
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.420
and he's threatening.

100
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:28.360
He's loud and he's probably going to be loud to other people.

101
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.660
Look at them the wrong way.
He's just fucking toxic.
Really stupid.

102
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.810
But it was a baby.
He was a baby at one point in time.

103
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.480
So I don't want to go over there.
I don't want to,
I want,

104
00:05:36.481 --> 00:05:39.040
I don't want to create violence.
I'm thinking it's just going to drive away.

105
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:39.910
And eventually he did.

106
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.200
And that poor guy who probably is probably making just a little bit more than

107
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:47.380
$10 an hour,
is stuck in this fucking cubicle,

108
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.970
this little glass box with this asshole berating him at two o'clock in the

109
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:54.190
morning.
But that's a baby.
That guy was a baby.
