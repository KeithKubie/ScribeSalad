there's really two types of items that

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560
there's really two types of items that
 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.300
there's really two types of items that
you can have one of managed items and

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310
you can have one of managed items and
 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.830
you can have one of managed items and
these are typically things that you only

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840
these are typically things that you only
 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.390
these are typically things that you only
buy once and we'll talk about the

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400
buy once and we'll talk about the
 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.700
buy once and we'll talk about the
details of these we have an unmanaged

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710
details of these we have an unmanaged
 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.610
details of these we have an unmanaged
items as well now when it comes to the

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620
items as well now when it comes to the
 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.260
items as well now when it comes to the
implementation side of it there's

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270
implementation side of it there's
 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.240
implementation side of it there's
actually you can do it an in-app billing

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250
actually you can do it an in-app billing
 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.340
actually you can do it an in-app billing

where you've got some of that data

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830
where you've got some of that data
 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.610
where you've got some of that data
stored on your server and we're going to

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620
stored on your server and we're going to
 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.280
stored on your server and we're going to
look at how about that process varies

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:50.290
look at how about that process varies
 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.750
look at how about that process varies
between the two and what advantages in

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:51.760
between the two and what advantages in
 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.100
between the two and what advantages in
distance you can have so managed items

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110
distance you can have so managed items
 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.370
distance you can have so managed items
these are typically as i mentioned items

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380
these are typically as i mentioned items
 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.190
these are typically as i mentioned items
that you only buy once so if you have a

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200
that you only buy once so if you have a
 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.190

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.260
critical components one is your act the
other part is the Google Play fine and

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:46.270
other part is the Google Play fine and
 

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.160
other part is the Google Play fine and
we're going to see how the Google Play

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:48.170
we're going to see how the Google Play
 

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.920
we're going to see how the Google Play
client is really involved here so what

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:50.930
client is really involved here so what
 

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.110
client is really involved here so what
happens is in terms of

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120
happens is in terms of
 

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.970
happens is in terms of
how we secure this data we actually have

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:54.980
how we secure this data we actually have
 

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.120
how we secure this data we actually have
a your app will have a public key that

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.130
a your app will have a public key that
 

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.040
a your app will have a public key that
you generate the place over has the

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:00.050
you generate the place over has the
 

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.250
you generate the place over has the
private key now from you from your app

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:03.260
private key now from you from your app
 

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.050
private key now from you from your app
what you do is use your billing service

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:05.060
what you do is use your billing service
 

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.450
what you do is use your billing service
to make a billing request and what app

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:07.460
to make a billing request and what app
 

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.860
to make a billing request and what app
is actually when you make that billing

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:08.870
is actually when you make that billing
 

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.260
is actually when you make that billing
request it's making it locally on the

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:11.270
request it's making it locally on the
 

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.940
request it's making it locally on the
device to start with it goes to the

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:12.950
device to start with it goes to the
 

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.460
device to start with it goes to the
Google Play client the Google Play to

Google Play client the Google Play to
 

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.530
Google Play client the Google Play to
client then actually forwards on that

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:17.540
client then actually forwards on that
 

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.150
client then actually forwards on that
building because to the Google Play

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160
building because to the Google Play
 

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.940
building because to the Google Play

server where it's processed and the
 

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.890
server where it's processed and the
users have an opportunity to you know

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:23.900
users have an opportunity to you know
 

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.900
users have an opportunity to you know
say hey I want to pay for it using this

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:25.910
say hey I want to pay for it using this
 

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.850
say hey I want to pay for it using this
credit card or you know if they've

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:29.860
credit card or you know if they've
 

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.170
credit card or you know if they've
bought a Nexus 7 they might have some

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:32.180
bought a Nexus 7 they might have some
 

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.090
bought a Nexus 7 they might have some
credit left over so they may choose that

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:34.100
credit left over so they may choose that
 

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.370
credit left over so they may choose that
purchasing option but anyway so it's

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:36.380
purchasing option but anyway so it's
 

00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.579
purchasing option but anyway so it's
process to the Google Play server side

00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:38.589
process to the Google Play server side
 

00:09:38.589 --> 00:09:41.500
process to the Google Play server side
and then we get a response that signed

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:41.510
and then we get a response that signed
 

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.030
and then we get a response that signed
by the Google Play server with that

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040
by the Google Play server with that
 

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.440
by the Google Play server with that
private key we talked about that

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:44.450
private key we talked about that
 

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.450
private key we talked about that
response is passed back to the Google

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:46.460
response is passed back to the Google
 

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.640
response is passed back to the Google
Play client which in turn passes the

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:48.650
Play client which in turn passes the
 

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.769
Play client which in turn passes the
response back your app to your billing

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:50.779
response back your app to your billing
 

00:09:50.779 --> 00:09:53.350
response back your app to your billing
receiver component you then use that

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360
receiver component you then use that
 

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.500
receiver component you then use that
public key to decrypt that message and

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:56.510
public key to decrypt that message and
 

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.960
public key to decrypt that message and
process it how you want so that's

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:58.970
process it how you want so that's
 

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.820
process it how you want so that's
basically telling you hey you know the

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:00.830
basically telling you hey you know the
 

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.370
basically telling you hey you know the

purchase succeeded or occasionally may
 

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.660
purchase succeeded or occasionally may
even tell you things like the purchase

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:04.670
even tell you things like the purchase
 

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.699
even tell you things like the purchase
failed and there are a number of failure

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:06.709
failed and there are a number of failure
 

00:10:06.709 --> 00:10:08.980

states that you do need to take care of

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:08.990
states that you do need to take care of
 

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.290
states that you do need to take care of
for example the users credit card may

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:11.300
for example the users credit card may
 

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.150
for example the users credit card may
not have had the funds or the amount of

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.160
not have had the funds or the amount of
 

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.890
not have had the funds or the amount of
purchase may have been defined or

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:14.900
purchase may have been defined or
 

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.840
purchase may have been defined or
whatever reason we have extensive

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:16.850
whatever reason we have extensive
 

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.000
whatever reason we have extensive
documentation on those scenarios that

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.010
documentation on those scenarios that
 

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:19.990
documentation on those scenarios that
you need to support on

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000
you need to support on
 

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.199
you need to support on
developer.android.com but this is the

00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:23.209
developer.android.com but this is the
 

00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:25.390
developer.android.com but this is the
client version and you can see it it's

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:25.400
client version and you can see it it's
 

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.130
client version and you can see it it's
fairly straightforward when we look at

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:27.140
fairly straightforward when we look at
 

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.680
fairly straightforward when we look at
it step by step let's now talk about a

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:29.690
it step by step let's now talk about a
 

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.440
it step by step let's now talk about a
version of this where we introduced your

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:32.450
version of this where we introduced your
 

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.290
version of this where we introduced your
own server so you see now we have two

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:35.300
own server so you see now we have two
 

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.360
own server so you see now we have two
dotted lines so I love the topmost

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.370
dotted lines so I love the topmost
 

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.100
dotted lines so I love the topmost
dotted line we have the Google Play

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:39.110
dotted line we have the Google Play
 

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.769
dotted line we have the Google Play
server and in the middle there in

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:41.779
server and in the middle there in
 

00:10:41.779 --> 00:10:43.030
server and in the middle there in
between the two dotted line is the

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:43.040
between the two dotted line is the
 

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.030
between the two dotted line is the
device and we have the Google Play fine

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.040
device and we have the Google Play fine
 

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.130
device and we have the Google Play fine
and your app and then below the dotted

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:48.140
and your app and then below the dotted
 

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.390
and your app and then below the dotted
line we have your server now you'll

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:52.400
line we have your server now you'll
 

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:55.900
line we have your server now you'll
notice that the public key is no longer

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:55.910
notice that the public key is no longer
 

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:57.730
notice that the public key is no longer
sitting in your app itself with now

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:57.740
sitting in your app itself with now
 

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.670
sitting in your app itself with now
sitting on your server let's help where

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:00.680
sitting on your server let's help where
 

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.949
sitting on your server let's help where
we're going to use it but let's now look

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959
we're going to use it but let's now look
 

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:05.400
we're going to use it but let's now look
at the flow of how this part of it works

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:05.410
at the flow of how this part of it works
 

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.769
at the flow of how this part of it works
the app will make the the bidding

00:11:07.769 --> 00:11:07.779
the app will make the the bidding
 

00:11:07.779 --> 00:11:09.389
the app will make the the bidding
request which gets forwarded on to the

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:09.399
request which gets forwarded on to the
 

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:11.670
request which gets forwarded on to the
moon placer lock the Google Play server

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:11.680
moon placer lock the Google Play server
 

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.800
moon placer lock the Google Play server
will respond and sign up with the

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:13.810
will respond and sign up with the
 

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:17.340
will respond and sign up with the
private key and then that sign response

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:17.350
private key and then that sign response
 

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.129
private key and then that sign response
will actually be passed back to your app

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:20.139
will actually be passed back to your app
 

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:23.429
will actually be passed back to your app
to its billing receiving but so far it's

00:11:23.429 --> 00:11:23.439
to its billing receiving but so far it's
 

00:11:23.439 --> 00:11:25.050
to its billing receiving but so far it's
actually the same that client-side

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:25.060
actually the same that client-side
 

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.990
actually the same that client-side
version this is where it differs your

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000
version this is where it differs your
 

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.329
version this is where it differs your
app will then take that whatever

00:11:30.329 --> 00:11:30.339
app will then take that whatever
 

00:11:30.339 --> 00:11:32.689
app will then take that whatever
credentials it has and pass it to your

00:11:32.689 --> 00:11:32.699
credentials it has and pass it to your
 

00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:35.579
credentials it has and pass it to your
server including that that sort of

00:11:35.579 --> 00:11:35.589
server including that that sort of
 

00:11:35.589 --> 00:11:38.670
server including that that sort of
signed response so let's do a deep dive

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680
signed response so let's do a deep dive
 

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.920
signed response so let's do a deep dive
into what that that part of it is the

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:40.930
into what that that part of it is the
 

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:47.129
into what that that part of it is the
your app is it your server side so what

00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:47.139
your app is it your server side so what
 

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:48.809
your app is it your server side so what
happens is your server takes those

00:11:48.809 --> 00:11:48.819
happens is your server takes those
 

00:11:48.819 --> 00:11:50.939
happens is your server takes those
credentials and returns back a section

00:11:50.939 --> 00:11:50.949
credentials and returns back a section
 

00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:53.819
credentials and returns back a section
poking through your client it's

00:11:53.819 --> 00:11:53.829
poking through your client it's
 

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:55.619
poking through your client it's
obviously utilized that public heat or

00:11:55.619 --> 00:11:55.629
obviously utilized that public heat or
 

00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:58.170
obviously utilized that public heat or
will do so but we take that session

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:58.180
will do so but we take that session
 

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.090
will do so but we take that session
token' into your app your app then

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:00.100
token' into your app your app then
 

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.999
token' into your app your app then
request content with that session token

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:03.009
request content with that session token
 

00:12:03.009 --> 00:12:04.980
request content with that session token
now you know you should follow the best

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:04.990
now you know you should follow the best
 

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.960
now you know you should follow the best
practices around new section poke them

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:06.970
practices around new section poke them
 

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.540
practices around new section poke them
make sure they expire after so for so

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:09.550
make sure they expire after so for so
 

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.920
make sure they expire after so for so
long and you know but the point of this

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:13.930
long and you know but the point of this
 

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:16.050
long and you know but the point of this
token is it's really hard coded between

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:16.060
token is it's really hard coded between
 

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.689
token is it's really hard coded between
your app in your server it should really

00:12:18.689 --> 00:12:18.699
your app in your server it should really
 

00:12:18.699 --> 00:12:22.050
your app in your server it should really
be used to set up a session every time

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:22.060
be used to set up a session every time
 

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.350
be used to set up a session every time
the client contacts to server so once

your server can then return to content

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:31.660
your server can then return to content
 

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.840
your server can then return to content
now this is that scenario with the

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:33.850
now this is that scenario with the
 

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.929
now this is that scenario with the
unmagnetized you can do it this way if

00:12:36.929 --> 00:12:36.939
unmagnetized you can do it this way if
 

00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:41.400
unmagnetized you can do it this way if
you want to track information server

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:41.410
you want to track information server
 

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.980
you want to track information server
side now of course this is going to work

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:43.990

add those credentials we're getting some

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:47.740
add those credentials we're getting some
 

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:51.179
add those credentials we're getting some
information from from your app now on

00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:51.189

the server you may choose to have your
own user accounts on your tracking them

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720
own user accounts on your tracking them
 

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.590
own user accounts on your tracking them
so that when the users fire up your app

00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:58.600
so that when the users fire up your app
 

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:01.049
so that when the users fire up your app
they're basically saying hey I'm signing

00:13:01.049 --> 00:13:01.059
they're basically saying hey I'm signing

not really so when you're developing
this you probably want to do a lot of

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:27.080
this you probably want to do a lot of
 

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.490
this you probably want to do a lot of
our sample testing or prototyping so

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:30.500
our sample testing or prototyping so
 

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.020
our sample testing or prototyping so
what we've implemented are some test

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.030
what we've implemented are some test
 

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:35.320
what we've implemented are some test
ideas in a reserve that you can use to

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:35.330
ideas in a reserve that you can use to
 

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:39.220
ideas in a reserve that you can use to
simulate different scenarios so this is

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:39.230
simulate different scenarios so this is
 

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.260
simulate different scenarios so this is
a good way to actually verify the code

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:41.270
a good way to actually verify the code
 

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.260
a good way to actually verify the code
if using automated unit tests you can

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:44.270
if using automated unit tests you can
 

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.300
if using automated unit tests you can
use these product IDs when you make the

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.310
use these product IDs when you make the
 

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.960
use these product IDs when you make the

straightaway and they're you know
 

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:54.370
straightaway and they're you know
they're simulating the response request

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:54.380
they're simulating the response request
 

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.350
they're simulating the response request

you use this but there comes a time when

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920
you use this but there comes a time when

that you need to do when you're testing

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:10.430
that you need to do when you're testing
 

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.960
that you need to do when you're testing
real purchases but you need to go into

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:13.970
real purchases but you need to go into
 

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.210

a very important part you need to go and
 

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.320
a very important part you need to go and
publish those items there and then so

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:11.330
publish those items there and then so

primary account on each of those devices
 

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.910
primary account on each of those devices
with the testing one by primary account

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920
with the testing one by primary account
 

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.829
with the testing one by primary account
ideally what you want to be primary

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839
ideally what you want to be primary
 

00:16:17.839 --> 00:16:19.450
ideally what you want to be primary

that you added you a droid device now if
 

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.360
that you added you a droid device now if
you've got some testing devices in there

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:28.370
you've got some testing devices in there
 

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:30.160
you've got some testing devices in there
some other accounts on there what you

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.170
some other accounts on there what you
 

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.600
some other accounts on there what you
will need to do is do a factory reset

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:31.610
will need to do is do a factory reset
 

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.450
will need to do is do a factory reset
and then go and add those particular

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:34.460
and then go and add those particular
 

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.699

that part is really important if you

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:02.510
that part is really important if you
 

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.360
that part is really important if you
don't go ahead and refined their test

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:04.370
don't go ahead and refined their test
 

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:06.520

it was an issue on our end and they gave

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:54.560
it was an issue on our end and they gave
 

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.530
it was an issue on our end and they gave
some developer impressions actually they

some developer impressions actually they
 

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.130
some developer impressions actually they
cannot test a building with with good

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:00.140
cannot test a building with with good
 

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.430
cannot test a building with with good
test account so but it's actually it was

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440
test account so but it's actually it was
 

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.580
test account so but it's actually it was
a issue earlier and that should be fixed

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:06.590
a issue earlier and that should be fixed
 

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:10.000
a issue earlier and that should be fixed
now so so testing went a second should

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.010
now so so testing went a second should
 

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:13.150
now so so testing went a second should
be should be working now okay right now

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:13.160
be should be working now okay right now
 

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.900
be should be working now okay right now
that's a good point on um yeah this was

that's a good point on um yeah this was
 

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.280
that's a good point on um yeah this was
something over the last couple of weeks

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:18.290
something over the last couple of weeks
 

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.010
something over the last couple of weeks
but we believe it's sleeping resolved if

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:21.020
but we believe it's sleeping resolved if
 

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.650
but we believe it's sleeping resolved if
you had some issues and it should be

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.380
personnel yeah okay ah so that's that's
a really high level overview of the not

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:35.390
a really high level overview of the not
 

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.350
a really high level overview of the not
billing and we today wanted to just

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:38.360
billing and we today wanted to just
 

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.020
billing and we today wanted to just
introduce the concept we know when you

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:41.030
introduce the concept we know when you
 

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.180
introduce the concept we know when you
developers are using though and that in

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:43.190
developers are using though and that in
 

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.680
developers are using though and that in
that building has been very successful

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:44.690
that building has been very successful
 

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.740
that building has been very successful
in blue the plate and we think that the

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:47.750
in blue the plate and we think that the
 

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.780
in blue the plate and we think that the
more developers should adopt the use of

00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:49.790
more developers should adopt the use of
 

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.860
more developers should adopt the use of
in-app purchases or in-app billing

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:52.870
in-app purchases or in-app billing
 

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:55.270
in-app purchases or in-app billing
because it does at the end of the day

what you're trying to do so maybe if you

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720
what you're trying to do so maybe if you
 

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:25.370
what you're trying to do so maybe if you
have some code trying to remove a dialog

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:25.380
have some code trying to remove a dialog
 

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:27.770
have some code trying to remove a dialog
so is this a fragment dialogue or a

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780
so is this a fragment dialogue or a
 

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.270
so is this a fragment dialogue or a
regular progress dialog guys do you have

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280
regular progress dialog guys do you have
 

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.880
regular progress dialog guys do you have
any you have any inputs from from memory

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:36.890
any you have any inputs from from memory
 

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:42.110
any you have any inputs from from memory
this sort of issue because it is

00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120
this sort of issue because it is
 

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.870
this sort of issue because it is
definitely a lifecycle issue and it's

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880
definitely a lifecycle issue and it's
 

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.549
definitely a lifecycle issue and it's
because some certain code is being

00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559
because some certain code is being
 

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:49.610
because some certain code is being
invoked out of sequence basically you're

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620
invoked out of sequence basically you're
 

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:54.140
invoked out of sequence basically you're
relying on I'm trying to remember what

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:54.150
relying on I'm trying to remember what
 

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.430
relying on I'm trying to remember what
the details are because there's several

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440
the details are because there's several
 

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.650
the details are because there's several
ways to end up in this that I think

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:57.660
ways to end up in this that I think
 

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.510
ways to end up in this that I think
you're trying to rely on the state of

00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520
you're trying to rely on the state of
 

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.200
you're trying to rely on the state of
certain it could be a fragment and yeah

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:03.210
certain it could be a fragment and yeah
 

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.770
certain it could be a fragment and yeah
so so high from what I remember like the

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780
so so high from what I remember like the
 

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.890
so so high from what I remember like the
this this exception tends to happen in

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900
this this exception tends to happen in
 

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:14.419
this this exception tends to happen in
two places one is if if someone trying

two places one is if if someone trying

the framework is very conservative

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:50.750
the framework is very conservative
 

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:53.940
the framework is very conservative
trying to prevent these kind of the

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:53.950
trying to prevent these kind of the
 

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:58.119
trying to prevent these kind of the
state happen even in reality most of the

00:24:58.119 --> 00:24:58.129
state happen even in reality most of the
 

00:24:58.129 --> 00:25:02.590
state happen even in reality most of the
time your activity is still in not in

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:02.600
time your activity is still in not in
 

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:08.369
time your activity is still in not in
that state so um I guess I guess the

00:25:08.369 --> 00:25:08.379
that state so um I guess I guess the
 

00:25:08.379 --> 00:25:13.389
that state so um I guess I guess the
solution or I think we you really need

00:25:13.389 --> 00:25:13.399
solution or I think we you really need
 

00:25:13.399 --> 00:25:16.810
solution or I think we you really need
to look into whether whether is property

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:16.820
to look into whether whether is property
 

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:22.029
to look into whether whether is property
to update the UI actually in those

00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039
to update the UI actually in those
 

00:25:22.039 --> 00:25:24.850
to update the UI actually in those
scenario and because the things could

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:24.860
scenario and because the things could
 

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.450
scenario and because the things could
happen actually after after this after

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:28.460
happen actually after after this after
 

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:33.610

instance date so you you have to see

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:39.700
instance date so you you have to see
 

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:42.999
instance date so you you have to see
whether it makes sense actually trying

00:25:42.999 --> 00:25:43.009
whether it makes sense actually trying
 

00:25:43.009 --> 00:25:47.919
whether it makes sense actually trying
to do some of these UI updates and one

00:25:47.919 --> 00:25:47.929
to do some of these UI updates and one
 

00:25:47.929 --> 00:25:52.049
to do some of these UI updates and one
way to to to avoid the exception but

00:25:52.049 --> 00:25:52.059
way to to to avoid the exception but
 

00:25:52.059 --> 00:25:55.060
way to to to avoid the exception but
poor not necessarily the best solution

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:55.070
