00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.970
So in my case, I added the touch

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.800
action attribute to the keybox. The element that contains

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.550
all of the keys. Now the spec says this

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.620
should be a CSS property, but the polymer polyfill

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.340
needs them to be an attribute because CSS

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.250
properties are actually quite hard to polyfill. Then, I

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.280
add a set of event listeners for the pointer

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.190
messages. And of course, I have the actual handlers.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.515
Now, I have one set of handlers for pointer events. And, look how

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:36.463
smoothly it works across the desktop, where I'm using a mouse input. [SOUND]

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.228
And across touch interfaces as well. [SOUND]
