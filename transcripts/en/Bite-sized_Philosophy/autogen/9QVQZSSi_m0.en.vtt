00:00:00.485 --> 00:00:01.485
 System 

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:03.825
 Surrounded by chaos 

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:07.175
 It is like a tree 

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:10.405
 The evolutionary incubator of primates 

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:12.115
 Tree, with snakes around 

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:15.125
 This is the scene 

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:17.365
 Fire Stove, For Primitive Tribes 

00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:20.755
 And the horror created by forests 

00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:22.825
 Which extends away from the light that is spread by the fire 

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:24.765
 It is a discovered land 

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:27.815
 In the face of a land not set foot 

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:29.865
 This is also a primitive model 

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:32.735
 You can not be in such a situation 

00:00:33.155 --> 00:00:35.735
 Even if you are among friends 

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:39.535
 You take this discovered land 

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:41.585
 This is not quite true what actually happens you are about friends 

00:00:41.965 --> 00:00:42.965
 they 

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:46.305
 They carefully reveal new parts of themselves all the time 

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:48.935
 As if they were blowing up elements 

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:52.655
 Small of the unknown land 

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:55.715
 Constantly if they do not? 

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:56.715
 what happens? 

00:00:56.875 --> 00:00:59.705
 You will feel weary and will be looking for new guys 

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:01.705
 We know that there is empirical data 

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:02.895
 Related to 

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.425
 Intimate relationships There is a nice study 

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:08.865
 I have long been looking at the sentiment rate 

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:10.665
 Positive to negative 

00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:13.635
 Which was the most productive in long-term relationships 

00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:16.485
 In favor of the success of these relations and the answer was, 

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:17.905
 Of course it depends on how you calculate 

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:20.195
 Incident and how will measure 

00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:22.855
 Positive and negative emotions 

00:01:22.855 --> 00:01:24.405
 If we turn a blind eye to this 

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:28.005
 The result is that you are in a relationship 

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:30.805
 You only had five positive reactions versus one negative reaction 

00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:34.045
 The relationship will end this very negative 

00:01:34.275 --> 00:01:37.255
 But, if you have more than eleven interactions 

00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:39.395
 Eleven positive interactions versus one negative reaction 

00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:40.355
 The relationship 

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:43.195
 You will also end up believing, my God 

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:46.335
 This is really strange strange why this happens? 

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:49.475
 Would not we wish 100 positive interactions for one negative interaction? 

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.785
 The answer is 

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:54.225
 What makes you believe that you want the relationship to be happy! 

00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:57.765
 Or at least, happy at all times and why do you think so? 

00:01:57.925 --> 00:02:01.185
 It's definitely not so you know it too! 

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:04.435
 I bet you there is no one in this room 

00:02:04.435 --> 00:02:07.445
 Only one day someone has refused it 

00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:08.445
 He was nice to him over and over! 

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:11.555
 Something in this sense, the person of "you are more watered than necessary rojool" 

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:14.675
 Something that way you want someone you can match 

00:02:14.675 --> 00:02:17.685
 Then suddenly bite you! And you feel .. Oh did you know this exciting 

00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:20.375
 I never expected it! 

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:23.095
 Werbkk it up to .. Tnjt yourself thinking about it 

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:26.285
 This is one of the things that keeps you really tied to the relationship 

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:29.385
 The reason for this is that you want a relationship in your life 

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:32.585
 Not because you want to be happy in now and moment 

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:35.775
 But because you want to live a high quality life on the stretch 

00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:38.805
 So many decades you are looking for someone 

00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:41.735
 You can compete with someone who will push you further 

00:02:41.735 --> 00:02:44.805
 You already have someone who will often try you and hardcore 

00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:46.800
 For your hobbies this will make you angry 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.060
 Etc. You know, and angry, and may retaliate 

00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:54.440
 Etc. But you do not want to believe 

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.635
 You are perfect in your current situation 

00:02:56.635 --> 00:03:00.115
 Partly because, who would like to accompany those who misled this greatness!
