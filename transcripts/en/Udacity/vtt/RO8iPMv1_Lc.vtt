00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, Galileo had his work cut out for him.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The idea that objects fall at a constant speed had been around

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for almost 2,000 years by the time Galileo came around.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This idea had a lot of, as we say in physics, inertia. It is going to be very difficult to change.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If we were able to get the fact that feathers fall at constant speed,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Galileo had a pretty difficult task ahead of him.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now Galileo had a proposal for why feathers do actually fall at constant speed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
He felt that some resistance provided by the air would actually slow objects down.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And for lightweight objects like feathers, this has a huge effect and causes them to fall

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
at more or less a constant speed.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, the rumors that Galileo's experiments involved him dropping

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
objects off of the leaning tower of Pisa—

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
it's quite possible that he did but it seems unlikely that he would have gotten good results

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
since, as we talked about before, the fall motion is just too fast.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Which brings us to the question--how can we slow motion down?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This seems like an essential aspect to doing any meaningful experiment with motion.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So, should we drop objects through water or some other liquid to slow them down?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Should we roll objects at inclined planes? An inclined plane is just another word for a ramp.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Or should we still drop our objects through the air but just

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
attached a parachute to them to slow them down?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I want you to tell me the best answer and there is only one here—so this may require some thought.

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Keep in mind some of the points made over here when you're answering this question.
