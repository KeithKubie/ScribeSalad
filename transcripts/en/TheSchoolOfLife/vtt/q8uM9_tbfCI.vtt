00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.800
The so-called mind-body problem
is one of the greatest

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.240
and most quietly painful
conundrums in philosophy,

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.320
and more importantly,
in everyday life.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.656
The problem is rooted in the fact
that in the eyes of other people,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.640
all of us are automatically and
stubbornly associated with our bodies,

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.959
which includes, of course, our faces.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.696
The way we look is the overwhelming factor

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.600
that dictates how others assess
our natures and our characters.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.936
Whatever lip service we might pay
to less punitive ideologies,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.640
in the practical world,
who we are is taken to be how we look.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.896
The sweet face is assumed to
contain a gentle, benevolent owner;

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.960
the large, red face with narrow eyes
an angry and suspicious one.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.267
We trust that personal identity
is indivisible from bodily form.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.240
Yet there is one dramatic exception
from this rule: our own cases.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.160
When it comes to ourselves, we know,
usually with considerable an ongoing sorrow

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.480
that the way we look is
obviously not who we are.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.936
We are profoundly aware of a large gulf
between our understanding of ourselves

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.816
and the suggestions emitted by our bodies.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.616
Inside we may feel tender, inspired,
inquisitive, playful, and young.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.696
But the face we see in the mirror is
indelibly imprinted with an atmosphere

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.136
that may be stern, grave, humorless,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.280
and ever more akin to that of an
insipid elderly uncle.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.216
We may bravely push
the hair this way and that,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.976
or soften the appearance with
the help of a slightly brighter jumper

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.440
or some intrepid shoes or dab some kind
of cream or powder here and there.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.479
But nothing can ever overcome
the monumental injustice,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.080
to which we appear to be subject.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.136
It isn’t merely that we feel unattractive:

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.920
we feel something bigger: misrepresented,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.680
as if we have been forced go into
the world as an ambassador for a country

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.440
we don’t actually really
inhabit or identify with.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.856
The English essayist George Orwell
once remarked that at 40,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.520
everyone has the face they deserve.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.056
This is as absurd and cruel as to suggest
that everyone might have the illnesses,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.320
the income or the life, fate they deserve.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.816
No one, not even with 40 years of trying,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.656
has ever managed to
change their facial appearance

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.680
by an effort of the inner will
so as better to reflect their identity.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.296
No one who has passionately
thought of themselves

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.776
as a button-nosed person
over half a lifetime

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.000
has ever thereby shrunk their proboscis
by even a quarter of a millimetre.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.296
In fact, quite the opposite
tends to happen:

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.816
our characters are liable
to mould themselves

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.656
to the personalities
implied by our faces,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.336
as a result of years of
other people assuming

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.016
that this must be who we are and
treating us in the light of our appearance.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.496
The gentler sides of someone
who looks gentle

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.256
will thereby constantly
be invited to the surface

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.216
by the expectations and
encouragement of others.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.319
The person who is routinely
assumed to be a bit sly

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.240
because of the
slope of their eyelids

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.280
may end up fitting with
the prevailing story of who they are.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.136
The mind-body problem leads us
to understand some of what love,

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.000
in its most generous, imaginative guises,
should really involve:

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.856
a commitment to remember
that the other is not how they appear;

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.256
that their body was imposed and not chosen

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.856
and that there may be a
very different character

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.040
trapped within their physical envelope.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.920
The writer Cyril Connolly,
who struggled with his weight all his life,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.560
and felt sickened by his round full cheeks,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.536
bald head and what he termed ‘accountant’s
expression’, once wrote poignantly:

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.680
‘Inside every fat man is
a thin one trying to get out…’

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.016
But the phenomenon shouldn't be
limited to the fat-thin dichotomy.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.360
Inside a distressing number of us,
there is someone else trying to get out,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.560
perhaps a mellow 65-year-old man from
the body of a 25-year-old woman,

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.960
or a thoughtful nerdy girl from
the body of a middle-aged irritable male.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.776
The best we can do to overcome
the mind-body problem

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.136
is not to fiddle with our clothes,
invest in hairdressers

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.776
or endanger our health
with plastic surgery.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.070
We will never be able properly
to align mind and body,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.520
by outward sculpting.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.880
The solution is to recognise

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.216
that the problem is
an existential part of being human.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.760
And therefore, that we must
always strive to remember,

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.480
in spite of all the visual evidence,
and in a spirit of love,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.936
that the bodies and faces
of others are very separate

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.136
from the character of their minds,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.696
in the hope that others will in time

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.120
give us completely generous
and kind interpretation

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.160
when their gaze turns to
our faces and bodies.
