1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:00.720
Yeah.

2
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.720
And and transport it through a space ship onto another planet and you could look

3
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:10.170
through its eyes because you're somehow or another connected to it.

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:12.450
The same way they're connected to the study lights.
Oh No,

5
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:16.410
you're all being prepared.
Clothes where your bow hunting and all that.

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.860
You just saw the 1950s diagram of the VR goggles.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.610
Can we pull this famous photo of a,
you don't believe in any aliens,
Eddie.

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.140
I don't believe they come from up there.
Pull up their inner dimensional.

9
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:29.380
I think they're from the same place.
We're all worthy.

10
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.610
All think we're in this vast plain and there's a lot of those employees.

11
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.170
They got us in closed in this little thing.
Or Eddie,
you learned.

12
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:40.140
Here's the thing,
you learn what the plan is by the attack.

13
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.320
They don't want us having kids.
They want us to moralized.

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.260
They want to break this down and they don't want us to think we could expand and

15
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.650
they don't want us to believe that their space,
and I'm not trying to attack you,

16
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.440
but they don't want third dimensional resource expansion.

17
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.180
I don't even know what that is.
They don't want us

18
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.600
third dimensional resource expansion.
Yeah.
What does that mean?
Well,
I don't,

19
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.040
I don't know if I want this guy or not.
That's a 1950s diagram.
No,

20
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.160
I saw that.
I'm glad he found the pattern.
Yeah,
that's crazy.
And told me,
Oh,

21
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:15.000
we have virtual reality.

22
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.690
And then I talked to the scientist and he put me in touch with somebody else and

23
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:23.580
then I found out other stuff.
Let's just say this.
I'm not in the CIA.
Me Neither.

24
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.170
I'm not in the NSA.
Me Neither.
But they'd been tracking me my whole life.
Mm.

25
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.940
You think they'd give you disinformation sometimes?
You're still absolutely.

26
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.260
For sure.
It was the CIA.
It was the former deputy director,

27
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.890
basically the CIA section,
chief founder,

28
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.760
founder of Delta Force who got me to like a two weeks.
She goes,
Alex,

29
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:45.420
you're not saying sandy hook stage.
You need to go Shay Sandy Hook stage.
He goes,

30
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:45.601
oh,

31
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:50.601
we have the people were there and just because he was famous Mit scientist and

32
00:01:51.491 --> 00:01:56.310
stuff,
I went with that.
So do you think about today already had AI computers?

33
00:01:56.311 --> 00:02:00.210
Probably.
I'm speculating,
looking way out to set me.
I mean,
I don't know.

34
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.800
I'm sure there's people setting everybody up.
If you think I told you about this,

35
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:05.760
I don't know if I've told you about,

36
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.350
I've told people that listen to this podcast,

37
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:11.010
but this woman Renee to Resta and she had a podcast with Sam Harris where they

38
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:16.011
went into detail about the operation that people use to troll Facebook pages and

39
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:19.140
Instagram pages and create,

40
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:23.540
these were the Russians had created these troll bots and these meme pages where

41
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:26.580
the hundreds of thousands of Hawaiians are,
rushes are all doing it.

42
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:29.560
Everyone's doing it.
Everyone's doing.
I do that just Russians are.
Yeah,

43
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.360
everyone's doing.

44
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.260
But the thing that was fascinating was she was saying that they organized a

45
00:02:34.261 --> 00:02:38.000
Muslim event across the street from a Protex is event.
Yeah,

46
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.010
well they want explosive.

47
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.610
They would have black lives matter next to blue lives matter.

48
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:44.760
They'd set everybody up with every person that blue lives matter is a lot.

49
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.860
Dan Morrison at film school here in California,
trained on by the CIA.

50
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.560
What was he trained on?
Trade on?
Can I,
can I hear this?

51
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.980
[inaudible] said this before and I've said that they don't in the podcast,

52
00:02:56.981 --> 00:02:59.180
so I'll keep going.
I gotta pee.
I gotta pee.
I'm not going.
I gotta wait.

53
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.210
You gotta pee again,
please?
Just let me go first.
