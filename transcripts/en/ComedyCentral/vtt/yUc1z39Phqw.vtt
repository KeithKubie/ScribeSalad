00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.860
- Well, I guess romance isn't dead.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:03.740
Let us know in the comments

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.090
how you would propose to your sex doll.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:07.161
- [Man] And that's a cut.

00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:09.527
(bell ringing)

00:00:09.527 --> 00:00:11.777
(coughing)

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.330
- Great job everybody, especially Ryan.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.897
- Thank you.

00:00:19.897 --> 00:00:21.097
- (laughs) Just kidding.

00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:22.980
(everyone laughing)

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.250
You were normal, bad.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.310
Okay yeah, side note, Nate
might be away for a while.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.913
So let me know if you have any
ideas for a replacement host.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.350
- That's ominous, do you think he's dying?

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.140
- He's always so sick, probably arthritis.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.410
- Wait what?

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.090
Nate's job's up for grabs?

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.623
So like I could own you guys?

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.216
- I found a penny.

00:00:46.216 --> 00:00:48.799
(upbeat music)

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.520
- Hey crazy running into you here.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.640
- In my office?

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.653
- Totally right.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.760
Listen, I think we both are
in agreement that I should be

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.430
the one who gets Nate's job.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.650
- Why's that?

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.580
- Because I, Jordan
Mendoza am a cultural icon.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.063
Did you know I'm dating
Jack Nicholson's niece?

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.980
- You are?

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.813
- Well not exactly.

00:01:11.813 --> 00:01:14.400
I have been catfishing her
for weeks as Logan Paul

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.040
so I'm close.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.950
By the way I'm gonna need to be reimbursed

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.290
for facial reconstructive surgery.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.653
- Yeah, no I see see
where you're going Ron.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.590
Let me call you back.

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:34.020
- The water cooler,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.560
classic place for an office conversation.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.250
You know I've got a little
experience leading conversations

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.340
if you know what I mean.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.193
I'm an expert, climate, immigration, oil.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.610
- Well typically on our pop
culture show we avoid politics,

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.188
but if you have big ideas,
let's talk about them right now.

00:01:53.188 --> 00:01:54.490
- Right now?

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.340
- Yeah right now.

00:01:56.497 --> 00:01:57.703
- Sure.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.670
Climate is good.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.450
Immigration, pretty good.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.283
Oil,

00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:10.419
is bad.

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:13.482
- Go.

00:02:13.482 --> 00:02:14.315
- Fine.

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:16.072
So stupid.

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:18.070
I don't even know why you
have this in your office.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.333
- [Plaid Shirt] You know why.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.561
- I believe I misunderstood
the assignment.

00:02:29.561 --> 00:02:32.700
(upbeat jazz music)

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.533
- Please, allow me,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.760
just the kind of leadership
you can expect from me.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:39.740
That was my father's stapler.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.800
- So when does that pay bump kick in?

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.520
Because I'm kinda going
through a bit of a lawsuit see,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.610
I took a credit card from
a guy who I hooked up with,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.410
but I let him do anal you know?

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.813
And plus I'm not responsible, I was drunk.

00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:53.890
- Hannah what's in that cup?

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.340
- Water, that happens
to smell like alcohol.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.810
So let's share social security numbers.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.110
You go first.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.943
- Please go.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:02.723
- Fine.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.843
- Psst,

00:03:06.813 --> 00:03:07.963
down here.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.459
Step into my office.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.570
- This is my office.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.960
- Then why am I under your desk dummy?

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.320
Look, I know you want Nate gone,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.469
and I'm telling ya, I can
do it clean, no witnesses.

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.120
- Oh my God, I do not want Nate dead.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.220
- Really?

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.110
Then why did I think you did?

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.360
- I have no idea.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.430
- Huh.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.163
Anyway, your feet stink, and I love it.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.050
- Thank you all for bombarding me,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.860
but it turns out Nate will
not be leaving after all.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.110
- Whoa, way to beat that arthritis bro,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.580
I always knew you could do it.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.590
- I didn't have arthritis.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.790
- You know I once hooked up
with a guy who had arthritis,

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.320
still get flareups.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.610
- I think the horse that
kicked me had arthritis.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.130
That's why I foam at the mouth.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.050
- None of you know what arthritis is.

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.090
- Look I wasn't sick,

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.010
I was gone because I thought
that I was up for a job

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.530
in Logan Paul's squad, would've been cool.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.420
But it turns out it was just an imposter.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.130
So looks like I'm stuck
here with you morons.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.410
- What?

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.300
That's so weird.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.133
Don't give up though,

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:18.410
you should definitely keep
Venmoing that guy money.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.760
- I don't know, I've
already lost like $4,000,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.656
wait, how'd you know I Venmo'd him money?

00:04:24.656 --> 00:04:26.423
- (laughs) Shut up.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.293
- Jordan!

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:32.667
(smooth jazz music)
