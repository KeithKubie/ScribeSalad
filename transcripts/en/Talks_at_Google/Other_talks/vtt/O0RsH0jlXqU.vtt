00:00:06.344 --> 00:00:08.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.430
SPEAKER: Welcome,
everyone, in the series

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.690
of "Talks at Google."

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.370
Today we'll be hearing from
Bryan Franklin, a business

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.280
strategist who's helped seven
companies go from startup

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.720
to over a billion dollars.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.970
He once coached 35
Google executives,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.400
and specializes in conditions
of massive uncertainty,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.590
such as the coming years.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.900
His co-author, Michael Ellsberg,
previously wrote the book,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.970
"The Education of
Millionaires-- Everything

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.590
You Won't Learn in
College About How

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.170
to be Successful," by Penguin.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.900
And his writings
have been featured

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.490
in "The New York
Times," "The Washington

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.300
Post," and Forbes.com.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.638
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.780
BRYAN FRANKLIN: So
it's our conjecture

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.050
that every one of you
is sitting on a massive

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.810
and massively
underutilized asset.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.820
And in fact, that
in your future,

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.170
when you look back at
what-- economically

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.740
and otherwise-- were your
biggest leverage points,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.230
your biggest assets,
your biggest advantages,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.220
you're going to look back
on the class of assets

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.490
that we're going to discuss
here as the most advantageous

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.050
and the most important.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.480
And they're probably
assets that you're

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.050
paying almost no attention to.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.080
And you might not even
think of as investments.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.380
So we're going to
look at those today

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:51.010
and see if we can de-code
why so many have struggled

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.460
to make a traditional
investing model work for them,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.290
why we're in the global economic
situation that we're in,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.495
and then what we
can do about it now.

00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:03.870
MICHAEL ELLSBERG:
So before we go

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.540
into the kind of investing
we're talking about,

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.850
we're going to just
do a little overview

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.900
of the traditional investment
advice that's generally given,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.030
that many of you have probably
heard in different forms.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.620
We call this the financial
advice commonly delivered,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.480
or FACD, for short.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.800
And it's a pretty simple model.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.830
It starts with
earn-- work a job,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.020
earn however much you earn.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.160
Then the next step in the model
is save as much as possible.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.360
The typical advice that you see
in a lot of personal finance

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.840
books is scrimp and save,
don't drink premium coffee,

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.010
have the cheapest
coffee you can.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.300
You know, watch videos instead
of taking your sweetie out

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.370
to a movie.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.320
Scrimp and save every
little penny you can.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.290
And then the next step
is take those savings

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.340
and invest them in the market,
mutual funds, 401Ks, index

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.580
funds, that kind of thing.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.010
And in the plan they say,
watch that money grow.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.760
Typically the figure
that they'll cite

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.670
is that the markets,
broadly, have

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.430
risen about 7% per
year, annualized

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.160
over the last decades and
decades, 80, 100 years.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.520
And so that's what they'll
tell you to expect.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.420
And then if you work all
the numbers right and plan

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.770
everything right, you
can then-- on the growth

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.300
of what you saved to
invest-- you can, last step,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.710
retire at 65, or when
you want to retire.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.770
And that's the pretty
picture they paint.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.300
In our book, we talk
about how that plan is

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.370
broken at basically every step.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.732
And rather than go
into detail about all

00:03:47.732 --> 00:03:50.190
the ways we think it's broken,
the one thing I'll highlight

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.920
right now, that I think
is problematic from that,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.180
is that really
the investing part

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.340
is totally devoid
of anything that

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.500
has to do with your
own human capital.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.150
So you'll never hear an
investment adviser at Schwab--

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.430
or wherever you go for your
investment advice-- talk

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.110
about your human capital,
the skills and earning power

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.789
you have, as part of
your investment plan.

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:14.330
They don't even
really talk about it.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.399
They'll just say,
well, your investing

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.488
is this stuff you
do with our funds

00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:20.779
that we're going to put you in.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.400
And that's what investing is.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.290
And so it basically separates
investing from anything

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.290
that you have skill or
control or domain over.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.400
Which we think is a
pretty big problem.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.160
And we're going to
talk about that more.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.690
BRYAN FRANKLIN: I think
one of the reasons

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.250
why this plan-- I mean, the
plan seems like it would work.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.750
Right?

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.620
You earn, you save, you try
and save as much as possible.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.850
And then you keep
reinvesting the growth

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.100
from compound interest
and over time.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.610
Then you can stop
working and be happy.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.540
It makes sense.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.160
And it makes so much sense that
most people in our generation,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.080
and most millennials, have
a vague sense of guilt when

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.570
they don't follow that plan.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.150
Just because it's
supposed to work.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.810
But I think the reason
why it doesn't is actually

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.880
an optimization problem.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.410
It's optimizing for
one aspect of a system

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.660
at the expense of
the larger system.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.400
And anytime you optimize
one aspect of any system

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.750
at the expense of the larger
system, the larger system,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.630
of course, eventually
will collapse.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.170
And I think that's a pretty
good characterization

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:40.270
for the average American's-- for
example-- financial situation.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.400
And that's the richest
country in the world.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.460
The section that that
plan optimizes for

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.870
is just your financial
net worth-- the amount

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.640
that you would say that you
have in savings and investments,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.070
the value of what you
have on your balance

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.720
sheet less your liabilities.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.740
And the problem is, we
actually don't-- as humans--

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.760
we actually don't care
about that intrinsically.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.970
We don't care about having a lot
of static wealth intrinsically.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.310
We want static wealth because
of all of the other things

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:28.560
we think it will get us-- life
experiences, access, privilege,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.500
options, freedom, choices.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.560
So we want access and freedom
and choices and experiences.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.120
And we think that we need
this static wealth in order

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.050
to have that.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.090
But those options
and experiences

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.720
live inside the same system with
the finances, with the money.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.100
And often times, we
make choices which

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.030
limit our freedom, which
limit our access, which

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.180
limit the sense of luxury, which
limit our own enjoyment, which

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.510
limit our ability to have
the kind of experiences

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.770
that we want, in order
to make more money,

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.300
in order to save more money,
in order to invest more money.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.500
And anytime you
sacrifice from the whole

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.477
to accentuate the part, that's
when the system which would,

00:07:15.477 --> 00:07:16.310
of course, collapse.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.920
So broadly speaking,
you could say,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.440
that the purpose of any
financial plan is to be happy,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.610
to be happy with your life.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.430
And particularly, to be happy
with your life over a prolonged

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:32.460
period of time.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:37.210
And that happiness
could be arrived

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:41.860
at through, again, freedom
to travel or the freedom not

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.980
to work, or to live
in a particular area,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.630
or to have the
particular choices.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.520
And what's interesting is
that the studies on happiness

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:57.460
reveal that sudden increases
in financial capital,

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.840
like winning the lottery,
over the medium term,

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:04.440
after a few months, do
absolutely nothing to increase

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.700
your sense of happiness.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:11.040
In fact, there was a
scientist I saw do a talk

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.990
on the science of happiness.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.770
And he began this
talk by saying,

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.600
with respect to being
happy, would you

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.210
prefer winning the lottery
or becoming a paraplegic?

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.700
Which of the two do you
think would make you happier?

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.470
And of course, I'd much
rather win the lottery

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.890
than become a paraplegic.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.470
Although the studies show
that neither of those events

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:36.570
have impact on
long-term happiness.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.809
What does have a impact on
long-term happiness, number

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:43.100
one, is getting enough sleep.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.600
Number two is doing everyday
things with friends.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.980
So instead of going
to the DMV alone,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.920
going with your two
or three best friends,

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.520
doing your grocery
shopping with other people.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.030
These kinds of
things, like that,

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.600
have a meaningful impact
on your baseline happiness

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.710
over years and years.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:07.200
Being in service has an
impact on your happiness.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.867
And of course,
learning something

00:09:09.867 --> 00:09:11.200
has an impact on your happiness.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.230
People who are engaged
in self development

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:21.900
generally are more happy,
more engaged, more alive,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.490
more enlivened.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.832
When I work with corporations
on creating the kind of company

00:09:27.832 --> 00:09:29.540
and environments that
employers are going

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:31.800
to be really loyal
to, number one

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.470
is make sure that every employee
has a powerful development

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.680
plan that they,
themselves, are directing,

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:41.110
and that they see the
company as an opportunity

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.125
to fulfill on that development.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.330
So these the attributes of
things that make us happy.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.170
And those are exactly
the kinds of things

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.150
that we would sacrifice
in order to make money.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.930
Well, I'm going to
pull an all-nighter

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:58.120
to make sure that I can
get the project done,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.830
so that I get promoted.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.900
I'm going to, more
and more, work alone.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:10.080
I'm going to sacrifice sleep,
sacrifice time with friends.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.040
So we start sacrificing
the stuff-- the happiness--

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.730
that the money is supposed
to get us back later.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.130
And that creates a problem.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:26.310
Because eventually, you become
unwilling to sacrifice anymore.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.560
And when you reach
your limits of what

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.470
you're willing to
sacrifice, then you

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.740
pull back from achievement.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.710
And then usually
we judge ourselves

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.570
for being a bad person,
because we're not

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.070
achieving as much as we should.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.550
And so you get into that
cycle of underachievement,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.780
self-judgment, and then
pushing and sacrifice, and then

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:50.600
underachievement, and then
pushing and sacrifice.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.210
And I think that cycle
describes the average work

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.600
life of many, many people.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.320
So what we recommend is a more
holistic plan, a plan that's

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:08.920
going to suggest that you
invest in things that give you

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.980
more economic opportunity, but
also give you more opportunity

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.530
to be in connection with
people you care about.

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.330
Also give you more of
a direct opportunity

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.250
to be developing in the
areas that you most care

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:28.310
about developing, that the
substance of your happiness

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:33.690
be included, that you invest
not only in your ability

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:39.010
to take time off, but you
also invest in your ability

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:43.950
to enjoy the work
that you're doing,

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:52.167
and to be valuable in a variety
of uncertain work environments.

00:11:52.167 --> 00:11:54.250
MICHAEL ELLSBERG: So what
would an investment plan

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.820
look like that took into
account some of the things Bryan

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.220
was just saying?

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:02.460
Well, the title of this talk
is "The Last Safe Investment--

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:06.070
Why Investing in Your Human
Capital Outperforms Everything

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.850
Else."

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:08.370
So what is human capital?

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.290
There's a bunch of
different definitions.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.550
One definition might just
be your net present value

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:17.660
of your lifetime earnings.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.640
That's a technical definition.

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:24.770
A more humanistic definition
might be everything

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:29.010
that you bring to bear to an
hour of labor that adds value

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.750
to that hour, other than
the things you're using.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.990
So if you're mopping
a floor, you're

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.685
bringing relatively little human
capital to that hour of labor.

00:12:38.685 --> 00:12:40.310
If you're doing the
things that you all

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:43.330
are doing as engineers
and so forth, at Google,

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.550
you're bringing a lot of human
capital to each hour of labor.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.680
And that human capital
multiplies, essentially,

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.570
the value to other
people and the value

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.260
you receive financially and
non-financially, in terms

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.290
of satisfaction and
enjoyment from your labor.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:04.850
And our contention
is that as the title

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:09.050
says, that these investments
really outperform the FACD plan

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.390
type investments.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.120
And actually, it's not that high
of a bar to beat, especially

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.750
over the last 15 years.

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.650
As I mentioned, the plan
you see in the books

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:22.740
is that the investments are
supposed to go up about 7%

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.410
a year if you're investing
in a low-fee index fund.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:33.120
Over the last 15 years, if you
had put $10,000 in the S&amp;P 500,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.530
and just watch it grow,
these are very rough numbers.

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:42.830
But it's grown.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:45.870
It would be worth somewhere
around $16,000 or something

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:46.370
now.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:48.790
But that's not even
counting inflation.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.210
If you count inflation,
it's hardly grown at all.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:55.310
It's grown, maybe
like, 1% per year.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:56.910
So that's 15 years.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:00.980
That's a third of an
average working life.

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:06.570
So the plan hasn't been working
for a third of the working

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:09.580
lives of the people who
started this plan 15 years ago.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.500
Now, we're not forecasters.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.730
Things might pick up.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.770
The earnings might be so
great in the next 15 years

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.500
that it makes up for those
horrible last 15 years.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.140
But we--

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:20.540
BRYAN FRANKLIN:
Except for the people

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.020
who wanted to retire today.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.519
MICHAEL ELLSBERG:
Yeah, yeah, except

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:25.880
for the people who are
depending on that last 15 years

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.950
starting now.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.980
So the system has
really not been

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:32.832
working for very many
people over the last decade

00:14:32.832 --> 00:14:33.540
and a half or so.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.020
Nobody's happy with it.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.180
So what we're saying, is you
have this other great asset

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.030
that nobody talks about.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:43.230
If you earn the median
household income

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:47.569
in America, which is somewhere
around $50,000-- and probably

00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:49.610
most of you at Google are
earning more than that.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.270
But let's just talk about
the national median.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.840
And let's say, you
work for 40 years.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.832
Just in that technical
definition of human capital,

00:14:57.832 --> 00:15:00.290
you have a net present value
of somewhere around $2 million

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.380
of your lifetime earnings.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.010
That's a huge asset for a
22-year-old or 25-year-old

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:08.910
to have access to.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:12.900
And one of the things that
determines your wealth

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.300
is not just the rate of
growth of your investments,

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.290
but also the base that
that rate is growing.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:22.330
And so if you are
trying to save,

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.280
the average American
saves only a couple

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.580
thousand dollars a year.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.894
Even if you're getting
incredible investment returns--

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:30.310
you're the best
stock picker ever,

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.970
you're getting 25%
returns annually--

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:36.630
you're starting from
such a small base

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:41.370
if that's what you're saving,
that it's hard to make action

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:42.710
on that over time.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:47.510
Whereas, if you consider
your human capital your base,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.930
then you can invest in ways that
even make small improvements

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:54.640
that over time will
have very large impacts

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.990
on your financial
returns and also,

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.520
just the non-financial
benefits that come

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.260
from enjoying your work more,
working at a higher level,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.990
having higher levels
of leadership,

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:10.170
working with bigger and
better teams that excite you

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:16.560
more, harder problems,
that kind of thing.

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.950
And we're going to talk more
about specific investments

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.410
of your time and money
that you can make.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:27.900
But let's just say, that
you're earning $150,000 a year.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.690
And let's say, you
decided to invest

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:37.660
$30,000 over a year or two in
a bunch of different skill sets

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.000
that would increase your
human capital, your earning.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.910
And not necessarily
just technical skills,

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:48.590
but also things like
leadership skills,

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.430
sales and persuasion-- even if
you're not in a sales position,

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.340
we're always selling our ideas
to other people-- communication

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.620
skills-- all the
humanistic skills

00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.490
that go along with
technical skills

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:03.130
to make someone really
successful working in a team.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.990
Let's say you invested $15,000,
$20,000, $30,000, over a couple

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:07.680
years.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:11.099
And let's say, over time,
you got a promotion.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.250
You started working
on bigger problems.

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.720
You came up with some great
idea that was implemented.

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.910
And then over time
you're earning 20% more.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:24.859
And so one year of that
pays back your investment.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:28.109
And then if that keeps
up for a decade or so,

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:32.830
inflation adjusted, you've
just gotten a 10x return

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.620
on that investment, roughly.

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.060
And those kind of returns
are very, very hard

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.600
to achieve on the stock market,
especially without just taking

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.130
insane amounts of risk on.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:47.810
Whereas by our contention,
it's fairly predictable,

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.090
the kinds of things
that you can invest in,

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:53.500
in yourself, to
supercharge your already

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:56.950
existing technical
skills to make them more

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.250
valuable to a team,
to make them more

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.910
likely to lead to promotions
and higher earning

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:05.020
and that sort of thing.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.380
BRYAN FRANKLIN: There's
a cognitive dissonance

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.980
where the activity of
investing is normally

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.495
thought to be quite passive.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:21.730
And yet, if you get
into a discussion,

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.532
let's say, with an expert
in real estate investing.

00:18:25.532 --> 00:18:27.240
And you start to get
into this discussion

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.860
like, hey, I've got
half a million dollars.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:31.790
I want to invest
it in real estate,

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:36.350
and I'd like to
earn 15% or more.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.590
It turns out that the
education that you'll

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.180
need to have in order to
make proper use of that money

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:53.030
and not risk losing all of it
is easily several hundred hours,

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.180
probably close to 1,000 hours.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:01.470
And like any skill, in order
to be really masterful at it,

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:04.980
in order to achieve what
some people would call

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:09.286
passive income, you might
have to put 4,000 or 5,000

00:19:09.286 --> 00:19:13.680
hours of education time
into learning that,

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.020
so that you can start
to have the pattern

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.150
recognition that you need
in order to be successful.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:24.180
Now, if you want to do that,
you can be a successful stock

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:24.680
trader.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.990
You could be a successful
real estate investor.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.430
You can invest in
cryptocurrencies

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.890
and be successful at that.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:35.830
We're not saying that
those aren't vehicles,

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:39.880
where you could apply education
and turn it into money.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.570
I just don't think
it's the easiest one.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.340
There's a lot of
other skills that you

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.210
can spend a fraction
of that time learning

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:52.090
that have a much, much
higher chance of return

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.770
when applied to
your human capital.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.980
And in the book, we actually
refer to those skills

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.930
as the super skills.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.710
They're the most rewarded.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.590
They're highly compensated.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.010
They're universal.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:09.000
And unlike market
skills-- for example,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.150
a particular technical skill or
learning a particular language,

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.770
or learning a
particular technique

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.100
or having a particular
ability that you might

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.760
put on a resume-- technical
skills and market skills

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:25.050
are driven by how the market
values that particular skill,

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.860
which changes over time.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:30.380
And as we enter periods of
more and more unpredictability

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.990
in the job markets and
in the global markets,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.240
then the value of those
skills are also unpredictable.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.700
However, the super skills that
have been value accelerators

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.684
ever since human beings were
interacting with each other,

00:20:45.684 --> 00:20:49.170
they're the least
likely to change

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.720
and the most likely to be
valued over the long term.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.070
And they can multiply
your earning potential

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.970
by 5, 10 or even 100 times.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.200
If you look at, for
example, the average CEO

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.800
in a company in
the United States

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.870
makes 380 times the
average employee

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.580
in the firm where
they're leading.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:12.267
Not everyone here
wishes to be a CEO.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.840
Instead of of, say,
500 hours learning

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.170
how to invest in real
estate, if you spent,

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.540
say, 100 hours learning the
leadership and other types

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:30.510
of skills that a CEO has-- not
because you want to be one--

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:34.130
the options that you would
have for how much you work,

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.420
where you work, on what you
work, which teams you lead,

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.670
would be dramatically different.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:47.860
So when you're looking at an
asset class, an investment

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:54.180
class as an investor, really,
investors want two things.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.870
They want a lot of variability.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.730
They want a lot of variance.

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.700
Because if there's no
variance as an investor,

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.930
then you can't make money
buying and selling the thing,

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:06.870
if there's no
difference to be had.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.800
And you want a lot
of predictability.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.750
At least, you want to
be able to predict.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:12.440
So you want it to
go up and down.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:15.970
And you want to know whether
it's going to go up and down.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:21.810
And again, compared with the
stock market, the real estate

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.210
market and the other
readily-available types

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:27.380
of investments,
your human capital

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.360
has much, much,
much more variance.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.220
You know, there's
much more variance

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.160
in the value in human capital.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.350
And it's also very,
very predictable.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:38.880
The kinds of things that
you can do to increase it

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.191
will reliably increase it.

00:22:41.191 --> 00:22:43.190
MICHAEL ELLSBERG: So what
are these super skills

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:44.231
that we're talking about?

00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:46.340
The basic definition that
we have of a super skill

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.440
is any skill that
is, essentially,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.840
valuable in almost
any context-- any job,

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.000
any industry, any market,
any market conditions.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.720
So these are very
different than, say,

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.340
the particular programming
languages that you know,

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.200
or technical skills you have.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.400
And they're very basic,
very human types of skills.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.530
You know, how to communicate.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.880
So communication skills,
leadership skills, you know,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.080
there's so many different ways
to invest in being a leader.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.430
There's so many aspects
of being a leader.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.570
A very simple one, for
example, is public speaking.

00:23:22.570 --> 00:23:27.290
It's surprising how much
you will set yourself apart

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:30.650
if you learn how to
speak well publicly.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.940
And it's surprising
how easy it is

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.680
and inexpensive it is to learn.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.740
In fact, I would
say, if I had to say,

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:39.750
the single most
highly-leveraged investment

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.850
you could make probably would
be public speaking skills.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:46.030
And you can go to Toastmasters
for however many dollars

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:46.640
per month.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.850
And whatever it is,
there's plenty of avenues.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:53.040
This is the kind of
thing that can really

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:57.200
supercharge your already
existing technical skills.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.070
It's a bottleneck, in a way.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:03.540
Take two people who have PhDs
and have invested decades

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.660
of their lives in their
education, countless hours,

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.400
countless hundreds of thousands
of dollars, or student debt,

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.320
or whatever it is.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.730
One of them is a
horrible public speaker.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.320
One of them has
spent a year training

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.580
to be a public speaker.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.350
I know which one I
would put my money on,

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.320
in terms of where they're
going to go in their career.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.660
So the super skills are
sort of like bottlenecks.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.580
They get rid of bottlenecks.

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:31.020
Where are areas where all
the traditional human capital

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.300
you've invested in-- your
education, your training,

00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:35.970
your technical skills--
where the value of that

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.860
is not being fully
realized because there's

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:43.270
some human kind of
person-to-person skill

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.100
set that you haven't
fully brushed up on yet,

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.160
and you could take
to the next level?

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.770
Another one that
I've mentioned a lot

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.574
is sales, marketing,
and persuasion.

00:24:54.574 --> 00:24:56.240
Now, you may hear
those words and think,

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.460
oh I'm not a sales person.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.300
I'm not in the marketing team.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:24:59.480
It doesn't matter to me.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.450
Wrong.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:03.330
Anytime you're on a team,
you're in sales and marketing.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.680
You have ideas.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.390
You need to get
budget for your ideas.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.444
You need approval.

00:25:08.444 --> 00:25:10.360
You need your higher ups
to sign up on things.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.724
These are all sales, persuasion,
and marketing problems.

00:25:13.724 --> 00:25:15.140
BRYAN FRANKLIN:
Attracting talent.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:15.820
I mean, there's--

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:16.590
MICHAEL ELLSBERG: Yeah.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.750
And they can be learned.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.510
They can be learned,
also, in ways

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:23.880
that don't violate your
basic values of being

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.230
a decent human being.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:29.530
A lot of people hear those
words and they think,

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:32.370
oh well, sales-- they think of a
used car salesman or something.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.590
And that's really bad sales.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:39.050
And good sales is
a discipline that

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:42.000
actually takes into account
what the person being persuaded

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.530
wants and has them feel really
happy about what they're

00:25:45.530 --> 00:25:47.170
getting, and how
that ties to what

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.120
you're trying to accomplish.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.732
It's a very
human-centric discipline.

00:25:52.732 --> 00:25:54.440
And another one we're
going to be talking

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.060
about quite a bit for
the rest of this talk

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.200
is building what might be
called social capital-- it's

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.770
a part of your human capital--
which is who you know,

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:07.660
and who your community
is, and specifically,

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.260
who your tribe is.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.490
And we're going be talking a
lot about this concept of tribe.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.800
Because it's-- we think-- the
most important aspect of human

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.692
capital, and the
least discussed.

00:26:18.692 --> 00:26:20.150
BRYAN FRANKLIN: My
conjecture would

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:27.230
be many of you would prefer
if we lived in a meritocracy.

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:32.810
And most of the people
who are highly technically

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.220
capable that I've
worked with often

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.880
behave as though they live
in a meritocracy, where

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.220
the merit of your work
stands on its own.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.160
And there's something that
feels very good about that.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.570
And when you can have a
relationship with someone

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:51.650
where you can see each
other's work for what

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.380
it is and acknowledge
it for what it is,

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:56.150
that can be quite special.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.150
However, it's not the
observable world that I see.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:06.800
What I see is that between
the results you create

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.700
and the perception
of those results,

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.900
it's actually the
perception of those results

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.140
that will yield the
most acknowledgment

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.990
from other people.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.250
And those other people,
often, are decision makers

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:23.250
as to what kind of resources
you have access to.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:29.660
Now, also I would say, if
it was a room only full

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.770
of sales people, I would
say, the results actually

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.740
matter as well, and particularly
for your own relationship

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.480
to how you feel about your work.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.720
If you are only
managing perception

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.470
but you know the
results aren't there,

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:48.440
that leads to a very, very
dissatisfying experience

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.730
personally.

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.360
And since we're talking about
how to create an investment

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.110
plan that actually you
end up being happy,

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.270
you really need both.

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:00.340
So for the rest of
the time, I think

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:04.090
we wanted to focus on one
of the particular-- what

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.010
we call-- true wealth assets.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:11.830
That really amplifies both your
financial wealth-- literally,

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:13.530
the amount of
money in the bank--

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:20.270
and also amplifies the other
aspects of your human capital,

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.080
and the other aspects
of what we would

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.230
call your financial
ecosystem, which

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.330
includes all of the things
that your finances are meant

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.440
to give you-- your sense
of happiness and freedom

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.020
and development.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.200
And Michael mentioned
already that we

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:36.630
want to talk about tribe.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:39.610
So tribe is a fascinating asset.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:43.740
Because it's absolutely
coveted the least by those

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.050
that don't have it.

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:50.120
And it's treasured the
most by those that do.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:55.210
It's cited by those that do have
a strong tribe as the number

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:59.830
one source of economic and
non-economic opportunity.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.370
So we're going to
define tribe for you.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:07.830
Because it's a
subset of community.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.220
Not all communities, in
our view, are tribes.

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.470
So here's what a tribe is.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:18.650
It is a networked
values-based group of friends.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:23.360
So it's friendships where each
person is deeply connected

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.530
to each other person.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:29.020
If you have 100
friends, but mostly they

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.250
don't know each other,
that's not a tribe.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.170
That kind of hub-and-spoke
model is not a tribe.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.580
And it's not a tribe
because the value of tribe

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.530
comes from the
network effect, which

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.830
you're quite familiar with.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.060
And the kind of values
that you can get,

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:48.860
the kind of benefits you can
get through relationships--

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:54.000
whether it's like, you are
recommended for a position

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.450
that you want to have, or there
is a project that you hear

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.080
about that you want
to be involved in,

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:03.380
or that your unique skills
are known and recognized,

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.900
those kinds of values that
you get from a relationship--

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.580
and you probably
know 80% of all jobs

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:14.620
are gotten through
personal referrals,

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:19.630
not through the HR
department with the resume.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.230
So that value that you
get through individual

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:27.270
relationships is
multiplied in a network

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.990
the same way the
value of any node

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:33.510
is multiplied in a
technical network,

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.410
through the network effect.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.490
So for it to be a
tribe, everybody

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.080
must know everybody else.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:44.640
It also-- for it to be a
tribe-- must be based on values

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.050
that the tribe has in common,
that each person in the tribe

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:53.360
is dedicated to living and to
accentuating in each other.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.400
So you know, if you live in
a homeowner's association--

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.140
if you have a condo or
you live where you live

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:06.150
has an HOA-- that's a community
that's based on where you live,

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:08.040
not based on values.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.510
So it's very unlikely
for that to be a tribe.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.927
In fact, why most
homeowners associations

00:31:12.927 --> 00:31:15.510
are such a nightmare-- if you've
ever been on the board of one

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:19.940
and that kind of thing--
endless petty fighting

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.470
is the typical scene in an HOA.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:26.370
And the reason for
that is because you've

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.660
got a bunch of people
who have shared interests

00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:32.550
where the decisions
impact each other.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.190
But they don't
have shared values.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.900
And that's what
makes it so painful.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.090
So it's networked and
it's values based.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:45.480
And not just any values, but
the values of contribution--

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.590
meaning where you want to
contribute as much value as

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.830
possible during your life,
versus just extract as much

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:56.570
as you can-- the value of
development or growth--

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.875
where you want yourself to be
the best version of yourself

00:31:59.875 --> 00:32:01.500
that you can, and
you want your friends

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.250
to be the best versions
of them, that they

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:07.720
can be, as well-- and then the
value of being in service--

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.190
where you want your collective
effort to matter, to make

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:12.850
someone else's life better.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.540
Those three values have to
be included in the values

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.470
that the tribe holds
in order for it

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:19.610
to be the kind of
tribe that's going

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:26.390
to yield truly economic benefit
for you as well non-economic.

00:32:26.390 --> 00:32:28.490
So that's what a tribe is.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:32.490
I'd say the smallest tribe would
be probably 15 to 20 people.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:35.850
And according to Dunbar's
research, he would say,

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:37.390
the largest would be 150.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:42.030
Because at about-- he says--
150 is the average number

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:44.920
of simultaneous
connections you can

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.990
hold in your mind at one time
before you start losing track.

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.329
Imagine that you have
the seed of a tribe,

00:32:51.329 --> 00:32:52.620
if you've got some friendships.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.587
And maybe you already
have a tribe already.

00:32:55.587 --> 00:32:56.420
And maybe you don't.

00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.430
Most people don't.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:58.431
So let's say, you don't.

00:32:58.431 --> 00:33:00.346
MICHAEL ELLSBERG: Could
you just maybe explain

00:33:00.346 --> 00:33:02.800
just a little bit what that
might look like, for somebody

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.100
in this room, to have a tribe?

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:04.975
BRYAN FRANKLIN: Sure.

00:33:04.975 --> 00:33:06.810
So having a tribe
would be-- imagine

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:12.310
there are 35 friends who all
are dedicated to similar values.

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:15.270
And you find ways of connecting
and getting together regularly.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:19.850
Maybe it's every month
or every three weeks.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:23.080
And you're constantly
aware of and tracking

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.150
each other's progress
in your lives,

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.140
in terms of what's important
to you and how much of that

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.590
stuff are you having.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.770
It may all be Googlers.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:37.770
It may be a mix of people
here and other companies.

00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.470
But what do you
do have in common

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.570
is this sense of wanting
to develop into the best

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.970
version of yourself you can
be, and wanting to contribute.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.900
And then so the kinds
of conversations

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.260
you're likely to have are
like, hey, what's going on?

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.390
How are you doing?

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:54.150
Like, tell me about
this contribution.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.920
Or tell me about this
thing that you're learning.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.630
And you're constantly sharing
those kinds of experiences

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:03.220
together as friends.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:10.260
So we found that tribe has
an absolutely massive impact

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.770
on a person's felt
sense of wealth

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:17.230
and also, indeed, their
actual financial wealth.

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:21.179
And when you add
the asset of tribe--

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:26.552
we've tested it over
10 years-- the gains

00:34:26.552 --> 00:34:28.760
that you can get-- both
financial and non-financial--

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.139
are just staggering.

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:37.310
One of them is something we call
the Happiness Exchange Rate.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:41.159
So given that we all want
to make money in order

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.219
to exchange that money for
some form of happiness, be it

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:46.780
freedom or enjoyment
or luxury or prestige

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.920
or some kind of
experience like that.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:53.620
Your personal wealth
is actually governed,

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.340
to a great degree,
by how efficient

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.280
you are, personally, at
making that exchange.

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.920
How efficient are you
at exchanging money

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.710
for those experiences?

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.620
So if you spend a lot of money
and don't get the experience

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.140
you were hoping
to have from it--

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.420
for example, if you
buy a $100,000 car,

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.170
but then sitting in the
car you don't feel special

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:18.182
or whatever it is, or
attractive or powerful,

00:35:18.182 --> 00:35:20.390
or you don't have any of
the feelings you were hoping

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.750
that the car would give
you, then, in a way,

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.770
you wasted that $100,000.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:28.900
Someone who is able to derive
the experiences they want

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.460
from the purchases they make is
going to have a lot more money

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.430
and a lot more felt
sense of wealth

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:35.990
than someone who
continually needs

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:38.410
to spend more and more
money, but the experience

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.880
they were hoping to
have eludes them.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:44.460
And it turns out that one of
the ways that these experiences

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.310
that we want are conveyed
are through these kinds

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:48.800
of networked friendships.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.580
Where if you want to
feel a certain way

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:54.220
or be thought of
in a certain way,

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.706
and that's part of
your development

00:35:56.706 --> 00:35:58.580
that your group of
friends is aware of and is

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:01.800
committed to, then actually,
when you start spending time

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.860
with them, indeed you
start to feel that way

00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:05.620
and become that thing.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:09.010
So it's tremendously
positive from the point

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:11.510
of view of your
Happiness Exchange Rate,

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.060
where you have to spend less
and less dollars in order to get

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.102
the same degree of fulfillment.

00:36:16.102 --> 00:36:17.560
And then there's
more and more left

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:22.160
in the savings account for
you to add to your wealth.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.730
And of course, tribes
share resources.

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:26.180
You know, it's funny.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.880
An economist would
say, that an invitation

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.880
to sail around the world
on your friend's yacht

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.270
doesn't increase
your balance sheet.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:37.386
But if you own a yacht
and it's in dry dock

00:36:37.386 --> 00:36:39.010
and you're paying
the maintenance fees,

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:41.180
then that is an asset.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:43.320
We would say, that the
former is an asset.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.180
And the latter is just
a liability, really.

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.840
So when you have a tribe,
if you have 150 people who

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:55.260
share resources and share
values and share experiences,

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:59.000
one of our friends has a
50-foot yacht in Grenada.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.170
Another one of our friends
has a place in Vail.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:04.690
Another one of our friends
has a place in Ibiza.

00:37:04.690 --> 00:37:07.180
So there are
constantly events that

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:10.230
utilize these types of assets.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:13.580
But we don't all need
all of the assets.

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.820
We start to specialize
in the kinds of ones

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.220
that we want to maintain.

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.640
And since the way
to utilize an asset

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.770
like that is to share it
with friends, then all of us

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:26.490
are the richer because of it.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.360
MICHAEL ELLSBERG:
Another benefit

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:32.440
that comes from tribe that
really, in my opinion,

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:38.050
is where the financial power of
this comes, is the networking

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:40.970
and informational
aspects of finding

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:47.500
about new opportunities-- let's
just say, within a company,

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.950
finding out where
the hot projects are,

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:55.000
where the inside scoop on
what's happening where,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.190
and what is exciting for
you to be involved with,

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.940
that kind of thing,
who's looking for what

00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:01.880
kind of talent, if
and when someone

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.550
is ready to have a
different career.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.790
Or let's say, there's
an economic downturn

00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.480
and people are getting laid off.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:15.980
It's also a hedge against
risk, in that two people get

00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:16.670
laid off.

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:20.260
One of them just has
a loose connection

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:24.680
of friends that they go
drinking with after work.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.490
And another person is part
of a really vibrant tribe,

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:32.040
as we're talking about,
with a diversity of people

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.720
who are in different areas and
working at different companies.

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.150
Again, the second one is
the person I would bet

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:43.100
is going to weather that
economic storm a lot more.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:45.730
In my opinion, the
only search engine

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:49.002
that could possibly
deliver better

00:38:49.002 --> 00:38:50.460
and more tailored
and more relevant

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:54.620
search results than
Google, is your tribe.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.730
It couldn't give you the results
on such a wide range of topics.

00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:00.560
But it can give you,
for very specific,

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.010
highly, highly relevant
pieces of information

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.990
such as, where is
there someone who

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.600
might be looking to hire someone
with me, with my skill set?

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:13.470
Or where is there x,y, or z
type of social opportunity that

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:17.330
I'm looking for,
dating opportunity,

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:19.930
anything like that.

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:25.180
Your tribe delivers to you
the most relevant, valuable,

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.380
directed search
results possible.

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.400
And it's a huge benefit,
both financially

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:34.430
for economic opportunity, and
also for social opportunity.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.650
Who do you want to know?

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:39.200
What kinds of events?

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.980
These are the kind of things
that massively increase

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:46.150
your felt sense of wealth.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.150
Because again, yes, money
in the bank is important.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.370
And we're, in no way,
here to deny that.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.880
But as important, if
not more important,

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:58.090
is how you feel with the
opportunities and the things

00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:00.220
you're able to do
with that money.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.680
And your tribe
really is the filter

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:08.690
through which the money
in your bank account

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.310
is going to be filtered into
the experiences you have

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:13.030
and whether those are
really, really rich

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.730
and rewarding experiences
that feel incredibly

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:18.430
meaningful to you over
time, or whether they're

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.300
toss-away experiences
that you forget.

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.830
BRYAN FRANKLIN: Tribe also has,
to me, a fascinating impact

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:26.450
on reputation.

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:29.280
If you think of reputation
as like, stored goodwill.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.850
Or it could be stored ill will.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:34.430
But let's just talk about
positive reputation for now.

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:38.160
So if your positive reputation
is your stored goodwill

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:44.070
with others, which then causes
them to reinterpret what you

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:47.660
say, what you do more
positively as a result.

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:49.870
If someone has a very
positive reputation,

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:52.490
it only takes a small bit
of positivity from them.

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:57.000
And then you sort of imbue all
of the rest of the positivity.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.960
Someone with a really
positive reputation

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.540
can get far, far more access.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.980
And reputation is stored as
goodwill in relationships.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.760
But again, if you had a
hub-and-spoke kind of set

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:16.500
up, where the relationships
between the different people

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:19.200
that you were
closest to was weak,

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.250
then goodwill that you'd
restore in one relationship

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.820
wouldn't transfer to another.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.140
Because they don't have
goodwill with each other.

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:34.550
So in a tribe, every time you
contribute or help someone

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:36.360
along their self
development journey,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.720
or give them access to
a resource they needed,

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.920
or offer them a
job, or offer them

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:45.410
a connection, or an investor,
or a co-founder, whatever

00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.380
it is, each time
you do that, you

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:51.640
get a positive
stored reputation,

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.430
a positive stored
goodwill, in all

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:54.770
of the members of the tribe.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:57.750
And it has this kind
of compounding effect

00:41:57.750 --> 00:42:00.850
so that your reputation
with that group of people

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:03.740
can get actually
quite astronomical.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:09.760
And so we took one of the true
wealth assets, the tribe--

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.720
of which there are three.

00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.420
And we talked a little bit
about your super skills,

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.180
one of the true
well disciplines--

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.890
of which there are three.

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:21.080
Just to show you how
these things can actually

00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:24.310
have a both an economic
and a non-economic benefit.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.280
And we've have about
18 minutes left,

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.150
if you want to go
to some questions.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.940
AUDIENCE: So I actually
do have a tribe.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.890
And it's a tribe of moms.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:34.490
And I can tell you, that
when one person's husband got

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:38.110
in a serious car accident, they
didn't cook dinner for a month.

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:41.400
And we only have one carpet
cleaner that makes the rounds.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.110
But that's very
different, in some ways,

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:44.984
from the economic impact
to the kind of tripe

00:42:44.984 --> 00:42:46.107
you're talking about.

00:42:46.107 --> 00:42:48.440
You know, ,a group of moms
is amazing when you need some

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.832
emergency child care.

00:42:49.832 --> 00:42:51.790
But it's not going to do
the same sort of thing

00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:54.980
in terms of
employment networking

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.740
or financial networking.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.220
How does your advice
change for people

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.980
who, maybe their
natural affinity

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:04.272
group isn't white males
in high-powered jobs?

00:43:04.272 --> 00:43:07.410
Like, how does this
work if you're black

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:08.690
and in the inner city?

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.500
Is this actually just amplifying
existing inequalities?

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:14.320
BRYAN FRANKLIN: That's
a great question.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:16.870
So one of the things that's
essential to a tribe--

00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:19.470
and Michael mentioned
it very, very briefly.

00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:22.450
And I think I kind of skipped
over it-- is diversity.

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:26.630
Diversity's absolutely
essential to a tribe.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.280
It's good to have some
powerful white men in there.

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:37.450
But it's much better to have
artists and moms and people

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:42.550
in various different economic
and social conditions,

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:44.790
but that each share
the same values.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:48.100
Because then the perspectives
that are brought to the tribe

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:50.020
are that much richer.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:53.830
What we've noticed--
we come from California

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:56.190
and from Silicon
Valley-- and there

00:43:56.190 --> 00:44:00.450
are communities of people who
are the powerful Silicon Valley

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:01.190
elite.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:02.600
But they're quite stale.

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:07.270
And they would not qualify,
from my perspective, as a tribe.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.260
There is certainly
economic opportunity

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:12.160
to be derived from those
kinds of communities,

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.360
of powerful people.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.980
But the non-economic
opportunity is quite limited.

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:20.840
And our experience
when someone like that

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.760
is introduced to our tribe
or introduced to friends that

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:29.040
have a much broader range
of backgrounds is it's

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.640
incredibly enlivening for
them and enriching for them.

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.140
Because it's, again, different
perspectives on the same value.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.090
But diversity is essential.

00:44:38.090 --> 00:44:39.810
That's what I would say.

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:41.260
MICHAEL ELLSBERG:
I would just add

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:45.329
real quickly, if you think
of the word richness,

00:44:45.329 --> 00:44:46.370
it's a word I like a lot.

00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:49.820
Because it may seem
like rich means

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:51.980
having lots of one thing,
like having lots of money

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.700
or having lots of
gold, or whatever.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.074
But actually, if
you use the word

00:44:55.074 --> 00:44:57.840
rich as in the
richness of the novel's

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:04.030
language or a rich flavor, or
a rich musical composition,

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:07.870
what it actually means is lots
of different things interacting

00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:10.310
in very subtle and
interesting ways.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:15.740
And so yes, a tribe of
just rich white dudes

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.240
might have a lot of financial
wealth running through it.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.740
And maybe that's what
those people want.

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.991
But that's just
the financial side.

00:45:23.991 --> 00:45:26.365
Like Bryan said, I've hung
out with those kind of people.

00:45:26.365 --> 00:45:30.500
Anyone who's been to a party
of just one type of person

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:33.410
in one economic class and
one race, or whatever,

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:36.500
it doesn't have
that alive richness.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:41.000
To actually realize the
experiential side of wealth,

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.500
you want a richness that is not
in the richness sense of lots

00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:48.550
of money, but a richness like
lots of different things,

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:50.510
lots of different
kinds of people,

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:54.590
different backgrounds,
different outlooks,

00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:58.140
interacting in ways, again,
with some shared value system.

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:59.500
We don't want to cacophony

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.070
But interacting
in different ways

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:03.160
so that we're all
learning from each other.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.890
And that is much
more likely to lead

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:09.089
to a richness of experience.

00:46:09.089 --> 00:46:10.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.530
And I was going
to say, maybe I'm

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:13.900
more antisocial than I thought.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:19.690
But when you guys started
talking about the tribes,

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:24.790
I'm not sure I know
anyone in my own network

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:26.110
who belongs to a tribe.

00:46:26.110 --> 00:46:30.360
I'm not even sure I know
anyone who knows of a tribe.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:34.100
The numbers that you cited,
a minimum of 15, 20 people,

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:39.680
and then up to 150,
those seemed higher to me

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:41.330
than what I expected.

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:43.530
So would you mind
sharing a few thoughts

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:45.030
about your tribes,
where you're in,

00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:49.300
and how do tribes come about?

00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.730
How do they form and live?

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.570
And I mean, obviously
I'm not talking

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:57.280
about like, forced tribes
where it's circumstance

00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:59.130
like, I don't know,
religion or ethnicity

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:03.800
or living in the
same condo house.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.030
But yeah, how do they
work, organically?

00:47:06.030 --> 00:47:07.421
MICHAEL ELLSBERG: Yeah.

00:47:07.421 --> 00:47:07.920
Thank you.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.580
That's a great question.

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:13.352
People ask us,
well, have you have

00:47:13.352 --> 00:47:14.810
you used this
financial plan you're

00:47:14.810 --> 00:47:17.310
talking about for 40 years?

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:18.980
And the answer is no.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.800
I'm not even 40 years old yet.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.420
And so what is the basis?

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:26.820
Why are we up here, feeling
like we have any credibility

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.040
to talk about these things?

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.390
Well, we have been using
this plan for about 15 years.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:36.340
And specifically,
the part where we

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.110
feel we've realized the most
value and have something very,

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:43.610
very tangible that is a
thing that we can point to,

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.750
that's really adding
value to our lives,

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:52.160
is the cultivation of a tribe--
specifically in the Bay Area.

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.512
Mostly, also, we're
connected to New York.

00:47:54.512 --> 00:47:56.220
One thing that's really
important to note

00:47:56.220 --> 00:47:59.860
is it's not centered
around one person.

00:47:59.860 --> 00:48:03.420
So this isn't a cult. This isn't
a religious movement with one

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:05.010
leader or something like that.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:13.030
It's a natural affinity of
people that have really just

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.550
had this intention.

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:16.650
We were sort of,
like, going around,

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:18.730
looking for other people
who had this intention

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:21.170
to live-- not on a commune.

00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:22.870
We actually don't
live communally.

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:27.480
There's a few group
homes-- in a community.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:31.240
Or more than community-- what
we're talking about-- tribe.

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:37.539
So it looks like
there's a consistency.

00:48:37.539 --> 00:48:39.080
It's the first time
I've really felt,

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:43.890
in my life, this sort of
consistency of people who

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:49.830
care about me, who intend for
me to do better in my life,

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:51.990
and I intend for them.

00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:55.970
And it was cultivated
relatively intentionally.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:59.150
And maybe you can talk about
how it gets cultivated?

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:00.670
BRYAN FRANKLIN: Yeah.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:04.260
I also want to just
note that there

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:08.770
are those in the tribe who
earn less than $30,000 a year.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:12.440
And there are those in the tribe
who have a net worth in excess

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.330
of $100 million.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:16.180
So it's quite a range.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:20.350
And the how is it
begins, really,

00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:24.190
with a soul search for you,
of what you care most about.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.790
Imagine looking
back on your life,

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:34.600
and asking yourself
in what way did

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.900
you want to change
other people's

00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:41.960
experiences for the better.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.674
And if you look
at the work you do

00:49:43.674 --> 00:49:45.090
and the way you
like to socialize,

00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:47.530
and kind of relationships
you like to have,

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:49.290
the times when
you have felt most

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:53.880
fulfilled probably correlate
to other people being

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.510
benefited in a specific way.

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:59.520
And so I would
begin by identifying

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.540
what that is, and then start to
talk with my existing friends

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:06.220
about that specific benefit.

00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:07.990
Like, hey, I notice
that I really

00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:11.170
care about people feeling this
way or having this experience,

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.380
or being benefited
in a specific way.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:17.090
And naturally, because they're
your friends, some of them

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:19.551
will share this value.

00:50:19.551 --> 00:50:21.800
And then I would start just
getting together with them

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.700
and having dinner parties
and having the question--

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:30.420
what do you suppose we
could do together somewhere

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.560
in the two-hour-a-week
kind of time commitment,

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.300
or one hour a week, what do you
think that we could do together

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.100
that would maximize that impact?

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.350
Or maximize our
individual ability

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.880
to have that impact
in our lives?

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.430
And just start having the
question be in the friendships

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:47.670
that you have.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:53.561
And that is the
nucleus of a tribe.

00:50:53.561 --> 00:50:55.810
Once you start asking that
and answering that together

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:58.560
and discovering it
together, then you

00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:01.200
start to gain understandings
and technologies

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.560
for how you can collaborate
inside of a work environment,

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:08.930
outside a work environment,
to have that impact.

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:11.586
AUDIENCE: So the short answer
is make your own tribe?

00:51:11.586 --> 00:51:12.460
BRYAN FRANKLIN: Yeah.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.900
Yeah, I mean, I
would start that.

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.490
And then what will
happen as you do that,

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:19.750
is you'll start to notice
other existing tribes that are

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:21.430
currently not on your radar.

00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:24.580
And then you might glob onto
one or be adopted by one

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:25.700
or join one.

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.174
That has happened
as well, with us.

00:51:28.174 --> 00:51:29.590
AUDIENCE: I think
it's interesting

00:51:29.590 --> 00:51:34.070
that what seems like
almost just life advice,

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:39.000
you're putting it in a form
of investment advice, which

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.250
is a neat twist.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:44.020
But taking that
as an approach, I

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:47.590
think about a lot
of your advice seems

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:52.330
like it's further investment
in your one big investment,

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:54.950
which is yourself.

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:57.520
A lot of times, people think
about traditional financial

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:00.790
investing as a way
of diversifying over

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:03.590
their complete investment in
their own skills and abilities

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:07.170
so that they don't--
maybe someday,

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:10.300
if they lose some of those
skills and abilities,

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:12.340
they'll still be able
to eat and have shelter.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:16.140
So what do you think about
the diversification question?

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:19.480
BRYAN FRANKLIN: Yeah,
so first of all,

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:24.520
I don't think we can
diversify, other than ourself.

00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:28.760
I think we have
the one unit here.

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:33.750
And the way that the principle
of diversification to me

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:37.970
applies to this life
advice, is to invest

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:42.380
in the kinds of relationships
and the kinds of skills

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:47.540
that are valuable in the
most diverse situations.

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:51.370
In terms of there's
this idea of retirement,

00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:54.030
or when I want to
stop adding value

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:56.650
but want to still
be getting value.

00:52:56.650 --> 00:53:00.690
And the way that we address
that in the book, in the plan,

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:07.500
is to look at the idea of
advisor equity, or how can

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:11.370
you start to have the
kinds of contributions

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:16.960
that you make be divorced from
the time you spend making them?

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:19.040
Which is a rather
advanced concept.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:26.810
But if you're invested in say,
a tribe of 150 people, which

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:30.130
are diverse people,
and you're continually

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:35.420
building positive capital
with them, then more and more,

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:40.870
their success can be a part of
your future financial success.

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:46.120
And we can all share,
basically, our future benefit.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.110
The more the tribe starts
to span generations,

00:53:49.110 --> 00:53:51.500
the more the elder
generation is taken care

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:56.130
of by the generation that
is in their working prime.

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.380
MICHAEL ELLSBERG: One thing
I would add to that, also,

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:02.570
on this question
of diversification,

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:08.030
is our belief is that you
should not be risking money just

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:09.110
to get more money.

00:54:09.110 --> 00:54:12.420
So basically, everyone
needs savings.

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:15.370
We need savings, perhaps
a lot of savings,

00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:17.830
to weather different
storms, or to retire, to not

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:19.270
have to work for some period.

00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:21.700
But in our opinion, that
should really be savings.

00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.770
Like, a lot of people
think when they put money

00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:26.210
in a 401K, that's savings.

00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:26.940
No, it's not.

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:27.920
That's investing.

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:28.630
That's risking.

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:31.170
I mean, people saw just
how much that was risking.

00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:32.420
Same thing with the home.

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:33.860
Home equity is not savings.

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:37.920
It's an investment that is
taking a lot of risk, actually.

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:42.660
And we saw the risk,
again, about 10 years ago.

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:49.540
In my opinion, the ways
we should risk our money

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:53.050
involve doing things
where it's a project where

00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:55.230
money isn't the only thing
we're going to get back.

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:59.630
And there's some value actually
occurring in the risk itself,

00:54:59.630 --> 00:55:04.040
that there's some experiential
value in the risk.

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:07.490
Take, say, an example
from my own life.

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:08.770
I'm a writer.

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:12.360
I just spent-- invested--
six months of my time

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:18.690
and quite a bit of money getting
a manuscript ready for an agent

00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:20.660
and possible publication.

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.287
It didn't end up working out.

00:55:22.287 --> 00:55:23.620
I won't go into all the details.

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:27.080
But basically, nothing
came of that six months.

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:31.007
Now, had that been purely me
spending that time or the time

00:55:31.007 --> 00:55:32.840
value of the money and
putting it in a stock

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:36.485
and then the stock went to zero,
I'd be pretty pissed about it

00:55:36.485 --> 00:55:37.490
and pretty bummed.

00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:40.106
But actually, I was
able to learn things

00:55:40.106 --> 00:55:40.980
from this experience.

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.240
I was able to get ideas.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.750
I was able to come away from
it feeling like, OK, well, it

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.410
didn't turn out
the way I wanted.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:48.940
But I actually
learned something.

00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:50.840
And now I'm going to
go in this direction.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:54.410
So that has this sort of
experiential quality, where

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:57.760
the money being
invested was tied up

00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:01.090
in things that had a
tie to my life narrative

00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:05.230
in such a way that the
risk almost wasn't a risk.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:06.782
It was just part
of doing the things

00:56:06.782 --> 00:56:08.740
that I wanted to do in
life and learning, which

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:10.390
is what we all do.

00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:14.490
So yeah, diversification of some
things that are really, really,

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:16.010
really low risk.

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:17.620
And then the things
that are higher

00:56:17.620 --> 00:56:21.580
risk are tied up in
the things you actually

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:23.230
care about and the
kind of narrative

00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:25.920
that you're building
of your life story.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:29.400
BRYAN FRANKLIN: I also
want to point out that it's

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:30.670
an important economic theory.

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:32.560
It's an important
investment theory.

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:36.770
But it actually hasn't worked
out for the average person.

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:40.890
98% of baby boomers
say, they don't

00:56:40.890 --> 00:56:43.640
have enough money to retire.

00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:47.780
So it hasn't worked,
is the problem.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:48.280
You know?

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:52.920
If the existing
advice was working,

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.120
then I think we
probably wouldn't

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.500
have written that book.

00:56:57.500 --> 00:57:02.590
And the theory of
diversification, again,

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:08.010
for it to take hold, requires
a massive education investment

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:11.020
in investing in that
particular asset class,

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:14.760
to learn what is actually
diversified and what isn't.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.644
So it just reminded
me of that part.

00:57:16.644 --> 00:57:18.060
AUDIENCE: I was
just wondering how

00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:21.180
you reconcile-- my mom was a
public school teacher growing

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:21.680
up.

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.910
So it was all about
not being in a clique.

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:25.670
And kids would be
like, be in my crew.

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:26.620
I like you.

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:30.070
And I have been following her
advice through high school,

00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:31.830
college, business school, etc.

00:57:31.830 --> 00:57:34.310
And so when I get approached,
be in my lean-in circle,

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:37.040
or be in my crew, or we're
a clique, we're the girls,

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:40.310
we're the Plastics, whatever
it may be, great pitch, right?

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:43.190
I've been declining on purpose
and following my parents'

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:46.530
advice not to be part
of a said tribe, where

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:50.470
there are a distinct number
of people in a group.

00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:53.960
So how do reconcile that
advice and your own,

00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.170
to try to create a tribe?

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:57.990
BRYAN FRANKLIN: Sure.

00:57:57.990 --> 00:58:01.450
So the first is that the cliques
that you were told not to join

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:05.000
had, as a primary value,
exclusion of others.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.920
That was, like, their number
one deal, was to exclude others.

00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:10.600
And for any tribe
to be healthy, it

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.590
has to have porous boundaries.

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:16.980
People have to be able to join
and leave as it suits them,

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:18.920
without much drama.

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:22.310
And the way that you
would join our tribe

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:26.080
is if you had the same values
and you started to hang out.

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.390
Or you knew someone, you
got invited to an event,

00:58:28.390 --> 00:58:29.470
and then you were
at the event, you

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:30.719
wanted to come to another one.

00:58:30.719 --> 00:58:31.680
And you were there.

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.179
If you were there
more often, you're

00:58:33.179 --> 00:58:36.010
going to be in, provided
that you are actually

00:58:36.010 --> 00:58:38.020
living in accordance to
the values of service

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:42.450
and contribution, of freedom,
of devotion, and of growth.

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:48.070
So I think the difference
between a healthy tribe

00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:50.690
and an unhealthy
clique, or even a cult,

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:52.760
is the values that
it's centered around.

00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.340
And they have to really
resonate as your values.

00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:58.276
So that's the first
thing I'd say.

00:58:58.276 --> 00:59:00.150
MICHAEL ELLSBERG: What
does Jennifer call it?

00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:02.445
Like, a duocracy or something?

00:59:02.445 --> 00:59:03.820
BRYAN FRANKLIN:
Oh, effortocracy.

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.361
MICHAEL ELLSBERG:
Yeah, effortocracy.

00:59:05.361 --> 00:59:09.080
Like, the cliques
you're talking about,

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.090
it's about prestige and who's
cool, and who's not cool.

00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:17.240
And better metric,
we think, is a tribe

00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:20.000
that basically people
who are doing the most

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.589
to create the events or make
things happen for people,

00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:25.380
or support each other,
they're the ones who

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:28.740
are kind of rising
naturally to leadership.

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.700
So it's almost like an
effortocracy, rather than

00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:34.640
a cool-ocracy.

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:35.840
Thank you for having us.

00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:37.816
Thank you for taking an
hour out of your day.

00:59:37.816 --> 00:59:41.339
