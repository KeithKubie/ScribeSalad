00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.940
Most of your classes will
provide links to two other tools

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.380
you'll use frequently,
Piazza and Udacity.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.950
Most of your time in the OMS program
will be spent on using these three

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.190
tools, T-Square, Udacity, and Piazza.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.140
We also recommend bookmarking
these three tools individually.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.708
&gt;&gt; That just about covers everything
there is to know about T-Square.

00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:23.960
Note that T-Square can experience
some pretty major slow-downs,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.610
especially around submission time for
some of your projects.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.350
So try to submit things a little early,
just to be safe.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.070
Check with your classes' TAs to see
if they've built in a little lag time

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.480
into the deadline to allow for
T-Square's slowness or glitches.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.650
We'll close with one
little trick as well.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.935
You might notice that T-Square generally
doesn't let you run multiple tabs of

00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:43.780
T-Square in one browser,
they interfere with each other.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.510
However, if you open up a new window and
load T-Square there,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.870
you can run two instances of it to view
multiple assignments side by side or

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.860
use multiple tools at the same time.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.590
So that can be a major help.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.660
So now that we've covered T-Square,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.760
let's move on to talking about the other
site you'll use most often, Udacity
