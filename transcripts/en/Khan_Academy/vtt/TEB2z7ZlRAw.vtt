00:00:00.336 --> 00:00:01.853
- [Voiceover] So far,
when I've talked about

00:00:01.853 --> 00:00:03.457
the gradient of a function,

00:00:03.457 --> 00:00:05.199
and let's think about this as a

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:07.275
multi-variable function
with just two inputs.

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.272
Those are the easiest to think about.

00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:12.569
So maybe it's something like
x squared plus y squared,

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.652
a very friendly function.

00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:17.070
When I've talked about the gradient,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.951
I've left open a mystery.

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:20.693
We have the way of computing it,

00:00:20.693 --> 00:00:22.771
and the way that you
think about computing it

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:23.828
is you just take this vector,

00:00:23.828 --> 00:00:26.300
and you just throw the
partial derivatives in there.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.530
Partial with respect to x,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.363
and the partial with respect to y,

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:35.039
and if it was a higher dimensional input,

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.999
then the output would have as
many variables as you need.

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:39.590
If it was f of x,y,z,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.678
you'd have partial x,
partial y, partial z.

00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:44.153
And this is the way to compute it.

00:00:44.153 --> 00:00:46.184
But then I gave you a graphical intuition.

00:00:46.184 --> 00:00:48.994
I said that it points in the
direction of steepest ascent,

00:00:48.994 --> 00:00:50.321
and maybe the way you think about that

00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.690
is you have your input space,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.368
which in this case is the x,y plane,

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:58.630
and you think of it as
somehow mapping over

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.128
to the number line,

00:01:00.128 --> 00:01:01.556
to your output space,

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:03.901
and if you have a given point somewhere,

00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:04.795
the question is,

00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:06.142
of all the possible directions

00:01:06.142 --> 00:01:08.290
that you can move away from this point,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.368
all those different
directions you could go,

00:01:10.368 --> 00:01:12.470
which one of them--

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.898
this point will land somewhere

00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:14.885
on the function,

00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:16.383
and as you move in the various directions

00:01:16.383 --> 00:01:18.669
maybe one of them nudges
your output a little bit,

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:20.063
one of them nudges it a lot,

00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:21.670
one of it slides it negative,

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.395
one of them slides it negative a lot.

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.079
Which one of these directions

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.539
results in the greatest
increase to your function?

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:29.665
And this was the loose intuition.

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:31.383
If you want to think in terms of graphs,

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:34.030
we could look over at the
graph of f of x squared,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.609
and this is the gradient field.

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.815
All of these vectors in the x,y plane

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:38.872
are the gradients.

00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:40.369
As you kind of look from below,

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.670
you can maybe see why

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.154
each one of these points in
the direction you should move

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:46.337
to walk uphill on that graph

00:01:46.337 --> 00:01:47.800
as fast as you can.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.821
If you're a mountain climber,

00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:51.016
and you want to get to the
top as quickly as possible,

00:01:51.016 --> 00:01:53.338
these tell you the direction
that you should move

00:01:53.338 --> 00:01:54.232
to go as quickly.

00:01:54.232 --> 00:01:57.517
This is why you call it
direction of steepest ascent.

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.017
So back over here,

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.659
I don't see the connection immediately,

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.324
or at least when I was
first learning about it,

00:02:03.324 --> 00:02:04.417
it wasn't clear

00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:08.121
why this combination
of partial derivatives

00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:11.163
has anything to do with
choosing the best direction.

00:02:11.163 --> 00:02:13.845
And now that we've learned about
the directional derivative,

00:02:13.845 --> 00:02:16.104
I can give you a little
bit of an intuition.

00:02:16.104 --> 00:02:17.989
So let's say instead of thinking about

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.951
all the possible directions,

00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:21.875
and all of the possible changes

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:24.027
to the output that they have,

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:26.527
so I'll fill in my line there.

00:02:27.664 --> 00:02:28.694
Let's say you just have,

00:02:28.694 --> 00:02:29.704
you've got your point

00:02:29.704 --> 00:02:31.260
where you're evaluating things,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.907
and then you just have a single vector,

00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:35.195
and let's actually make it a unit vector.

00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:36.995
Let's make it the case

00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:38.620
that this guy has a length of one.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.549
So I'll go over here, and I'll just

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.105
think of that guy as being V,

00:02:41.105 --> 00:02:44.022
and say that V has a length of one,

00:02:45.168 --> 00:02:47.723
so this is our vector.

00:02:47.723 --> 00:02:48.556
We know now,

00:02:48.556 --> 00:02:50.555
having learned about the
directional derivative,

00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:51.809
that you can tell

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:53.678
the rate at which the function changes

00:02:53.678 --> 00:02:55.548
as you move in this direction

00:02:55.548 --> 00:02:59.158
by taking a directional derivative

00:02:59.158 --> 00:02:59.991
of your function,

00:02:59.991 --> 00:03:00.824
and let's say this point,

00:03:00.824 --> 00:03:02.746
I don't know, what's a
good name for this point?

00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:03.996
Just like, a,b.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.440
a,b is this point.

00:03:08.028 --> 00:03:10.528
When you evaluate this at a,b,

00:03:12.312 --> 00:03:13.905
and the way that you do that

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:16.738
is just dotting the gradient of f.

00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:21.545
I should say dotting it,
evaluate it at that point,

00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:23.704
'cause gradient is a
vector valued function,

00:03:23.704 --> 00:03:25.817
and we just want a specific vector here,

00:03:25.817 --> 00:03:28.650
so, evaluating that at your point,

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:30.700
a,b,

00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:35.616
together with whatever the vector is,

00:03:35.616 --> 00:03:37.810
whatever that value is,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.577
and in this case we're
thinking of V as a unit vector.

00:03:41.577 --> 00:03:42.410
So this,

00:03:44.787 --> 00:03:47.399
this is how you tell the rate of change,

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:49.593
and when I originally introduced
the directional derivative,

00:03:49.593 --> 00:03:52.879
I gave kind of an indication why.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.398
If you imagine dotting this together with,

00:03:55.398 --> 00:03:58.458
let's say it was a vector
that's like one two,

00:03:58.458 --> 00:03:59.690
really you're thinking
this vector represents

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.153
one step in the x direction,

00:04:01.153 --> 00:04:02.743
two steps in the y direction,

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:04.775
so the amount that it
changes things should be

00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:06.183
one times the change caused by

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:07.863
a pure step in the x direction,

00:04:07.863 --> 00:04:10.059
plus two times a change caused by

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:11.474
a pure step in the y direction.

00:04:11.474 --> 00:04:12.856
So that was kind of the loose intuition.

00:04:12.856 --> 00:04:14.853
You can see the directional
derivative video

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:18.951
if you want a little bit
more discussion on that.

00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:20.623
And this is the formula that you have.

00:04:20.623 --> 00:04:22.359
But this starts to give us the key for

00:04:22.359 --> 00:04:25.371
how we could choose the
direction of steepest ascent,

00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:27.124
'cause now, what we're really asking,

00:04:27.124 --> 00:04:28.947
when we say which one of
these changes things the most,

00:04:28.947 --> 00:04:30.863
maybe when you move in that direction

00:04:30.863 --> 00:04:34.067
it changes f a little bit negatively,

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:36.209
and we want to know,

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:38.042
does another vector W,

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.769
is the change caused by
that gonna be positive?

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:42.731
Is it gonna be as big as possible?

00:04:42.731 --> 00:04:45.216
What we're doing is we're saying

00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:47.076
find the maximum

00:04:47.076 --> 00:04:48.713
for all unit vectors,

00:04:48.713 --> 00:04:51.035
so for all vectors V

00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:53.798
that satisfy the property
that their length is one,

00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:56.898
find the maximum of the dot product

00:04:56.898 --> 00:04:59.289
between f evaluated at that point,

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:03.063
evaluated at whatever point we care about,

00:05:03.063 --> 00:05:03.896
and V.

00:05:05.222 --> 00:05:06.722
Find that maximum.

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.632
Well, let's just think about

00:05:10.632 --> 00:05:12.780
what the dot product represents.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.802
So let's say we go over here,

00:05:13.802 --> 00:05:16.855
and let's say we evaluate
the gradient vector

00:05:16.855 --> 00:05:18.190
and it turns out that the gradient

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.537
points in this direction,

00:05:19.537 --> 00:05:21.604
and maybe, it doesn't
have to be a unit vector,

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:24.901
it might be something very long like that.

00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:27.420
So if you imagine some vector V,

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.046
some unit vector V,

00:05:29.046 --> 00:05:32.006
let's say it was taking
off in this direction.

00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:34.363
The way that you interpret
this dot product,

00:05:34.363 --> 00:05:36.871
the dot product between the gradient f

00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:38.534
and this new vector V,

00:05:38.534 --> 00:05:41.062
is you would project that vector

00:05:41.062 --> 00:05:43.698
directly, kind of a
perpendicular projection

00:05:43.698 --> 00:05:45.207
onto your gradient vector,

00:05:45.207 --> 00:05:47.204
and you'd say what's that length?

00:05:47.204 --> 00:05:48.539
What's that length right there?

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:49.897
And just as an example,
it would be something

00:05:49.897 --> 00:05:51.244
a little bit less than one, right?

00:05:51.244 --> 00:05:52.138
'Cause this is a unit vector.

00:05:52.138 --> 00:05:55.555
So as an example, let's say that was 0.7.

00:05:56.445 --> 00:05:58.472
And then you'd multiply that by the length

00:05:58.472 --> 00:05:59.708
of the gradient itself,

00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:01.937
of the vector against
which you're dotting,

00:06:01.937 --> 00:06:04.491
and maybe that guy, maybe the length

00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:06.616
of the entire gradient vector,

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.729
just, again, as an
example, maybe that's two.

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.352
It doesn't have to be,
it could be anything.

00:06:11.352 --> 00:06:13.881
But the way that you interpret
this whole dot product then

00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:15.866
is to take the product of those two.

00:06:15.866 --> 00:06:17.449
You would take 0.7,

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:20.742
the length of your projection,

00:06:20.742 --> 00:06:23.841
times the length of the original vector.

00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:25.700
And the question is

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.838
when is this maximized?

00:06:26.838 --> 00:06:28.951
What unit vector maximizes this?

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:30.135
And if you start to imagine maybe

00:06:30.135 --> 00:06:32.085
swinging that unit vector around,

00:06:32.085 --> 00:06:34.082
so if, instead of that guy,

00:06:34.082 --> 00:06:35.742
you were to use

00:06:35.742 --> 00:06:39.121
one that pointed a little bit more

00:06:39.121 --> 00:06:40.456
closely in the direction,

00:06:40.456 --> 00:06:41.431
then it's projection

00:06:41.431 --> 00:06:42.360
would be a little bit longer.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.530
Maybe that projection would
be like 0.75 or something.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.004
If you take the unit vector

00:06:47.004 --> 00:06:49.930
that points directly in the same direction

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.287
as that full vector,

00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:53.297
then the length of its projection

00:06:53.297 --> 00:06:55.131
is just the length of the vector itself.

00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:56.431
It would be one,

00:06:56.431 --> 00:06:59.520
because projecting it doesn't
change what it is at all.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.064
So it shouldn't be too
hard to convince yourself,

00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:04.361
and if you have shaky
intuitions on the dot product,

00:07:04.361 --> 00:07:06.184
I'd suggest finding the videos we have

00:07:06.184 --> 00:07:07.449
on Khan Academy for those.

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:11.449
Sal does a great job
giving that deep intuition.

00:07:12.314 --> 00:07:13.707
It should kind of make sense why

00:07:13.707 --> 00:07:16.714
the unit vector that points
in the same direction

00:07:16.714 --> 00:07:19.396
as your gradient is gonna
be what maximizes it,

00:07:19.396 --> 00:07:20.406
so the answer here,

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:22.809
the answer to what vector maximizes this

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.932
is gonna be, well, it's
the gradient itself, right?

00:07:25.932 --> 00:07:27.593
It is that gradient vector

00:07:27.593 --> 00:07:29.543
evaluated at the point we care about,

00:07:29.543 --> 00:07:30.925
except you'd normalize it, right?

00:07:30.925 --> 00:07:32.956
Because we're only
considering unit vectors,

00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:34.210
so to do that, you just

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.335
divide it by whatever it's magnitude is.

00:07:36.335 --> 00:07:38.378
If its magnitude was
already one, it stays one.

00:07:38.378 --> 00:07:39.876
If its magnitude was two,

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.629
you're dividing it down

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:42.686
by a half.

00:07:42.686 --> 00:07:43.777
So this is your answer.

00:07:43.777 --> 00:07:46.134
This is the direction of steepest ascent.

00:07:46.134 --> 00:07:48.374
So, I think one thing to notice here

00:07:48.374 --> 00:07:50.685
is the most fundamental fact

00:07:50.685 --> 00:07:52.473
is that the gradient is this tool

00:07:52.473 --> 00:07:54.423
for computing directional derivatives.

00:07:54.423 --> 00:07:55.818
You can think of that vector as something

00:07:55.818 --> 00:07:58.521
that you really want to dot against,

00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:00.983
and that's actually a
pretty powerful thought,

00:08:00.983 --> 00:08:02.399
is that the gradient,
it's not just a vector,

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.943
it's a vector that loves to be dotted

00:08:03.943 --> 00:08:05.197
together with other things.

00:08:05.197 --> 00:08:06.509
That's the fundamental.

00:08:06.509 --> 00:08:09.551
And as a consequence of that,

00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:11.502
the direction of steepest ascent

00:08:11.502 --> 00:08:13.777
is that vector itself

00:08:13.777 --> 00:08:15.739
because anything, if you're saying

00:08:15.739 --> 00:08:18.212
what maximizes the dot
product with that thing,

00:08:18.212 --> 00:08:19.547
it's, well, the vector that points in

00:08:19.547 --> 00:08:21.544
the same direction as that thing.

00:08:21.544 --> 00:08:23.785
And this can also give
us an interpretation

00:08:23.785 --> 00:08:27.163
for the length of the gradient.

00:08:27.163 --> 00:08:28.173
We know the direction is the

00:08:28.173 --> 00:08:29.311
direction of steepest ascent,

00:08:29.311 --> 00:08:31.598
but what is the length mean?

00:08:31.598 --> 00:08:32.736
So, let's give this guy a name.

00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:35.128
Let's give this normalized
version of it a name.

00:08:35.128 --> 00:08:37.485
I'm just gonna call it W.

00:08:37.485 --> 00:08:38.959
So W will be the unit vector

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:41.931
that points in the
direction of the gradient.

00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:44.497
If you take the directional derivative

00:08:44.497 --> 00:08:47.469
in the direction of W of f,

00:08:47.469 --> 00:08:50.883
what that means is the gradient of f

00:08:50.883 --> 00:08:52.466
dotted with that W.

00:08:53.402 --> 00:08:55.143
And if you kind of spell out

00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:56.643
what W means here,

00:08:58.313 --> 00:09:01.169
that means you're taking
the gradient of the vector

00:09:01.169 --> 00:09:03.363
dotted with itself,

00:09:03.363 --> 00:09:05.639
but because it's W and not the gradient,

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:07.508
we're normalizing.

00:09:07.508 --> 00:09:09.795
We're dividing that,
not by magnitude of f,

00:09:09.795 --> 00:09:11.014
that doesn't really make sense,

00:09:11.014 --> 00:09:12.396
but by the value of the gradient,

00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:13.696
and all of these,

00:09:13.696 --> 00:09:15.043
I'm just writing gradient of f,

00:09:15.043 --> 00:09:16.750
but maybe you should be thinking about

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.333
gradient of f evaluated at a,b,

00:09:20.604 --> 00:09:21.823
but I'm just being kind of lazy,

00:09:21.823 --> 00:09:24.146
and just writing gradient of f.

00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:27.199
And the top, when you take
the dot product with itself,

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:29.149
what that means is

00:09:29.149 --> 00:09:31.482
the square of its magnitude.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.850
But the whole thing is
divided by the magnitude.

00:09:40.376 --> 00:09:41.479
So you can kind of cancel that out.

00:09:41.479 --> 00:09:44.323
You could say this
doesn't need to be there,

00:09:44.323 --> 00:09:46.320
that exponent doesn't need to be there,

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.897
and basically, the directional derivative

00:09:49.897 --> 00:09:52.167
in the direction of the gradient itself

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:55.499
has a value equal to the
magnitude of the gradient.

00:09:55.499 --> 00:09:58.889
So this tells you when you're
moving in that direction,

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:00.305
in the direction of the gradient,

00:10:00.305 --> 00:10:02.140
the rate at which the function changes

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.671
is given by the magnitude of the gradient.

00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:06.296
So it's this really magical vector.

00:10:06.296 --> 00:10:07.129
It does a lot of things.

00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:10.000
It's the tool that lets you
dot against other vectors

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.706
to tell you the directional derivative.

00:10:11.706 --> 00:10:14.307
As a consequence, it's the
direction of steepest ascent,

00:10:14.307 --> 00:10:16.466
and its magnitude tells
you the rate at which

00:10:16.466 --> 00:10:18.336
things change while you're moving in that

00:10:18.336 --> 00:10:19.764
direction of steepest ascent.

00:10:19.764 --> 00:10:21.264
It's just really a

00:10:22.295 --> 00:10:25.418
core part of scalar valued
multi-variable functions,

00:10:25.418 --> 00:10:28.181
and it is the extension of the derivative

00:10:28.181 --> 00:10:31.625
in every sense that you could
want a derivative to extend.
