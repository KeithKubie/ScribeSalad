1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,750
This question,

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,750
what does a patient is basic and
important and deserves the short summary?

3
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,960
So let's just recap what is the patient?

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:16,850
Patients are mosaics of parts
that have very different ages.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,810
On the left you see the
illustration showing when the

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,910
transposon inserted into the protal
immunoglobulin gene to make possible the

7
00:00:28,281 --> 00:00:32,360
vertebrate adaptive immune system that
happened about 500 million years ago.

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:38,150
Some of the very oldest parts like
intermediate metabolism are precise and

9
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:41,720
efficient because they have been
shaped by billions of selective events.

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,730
They are also very hard to change.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,410
Some of the most recent responses have
not had had time to adapt to change

12
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:50,930
conditions and so they are
maladaptive mismatches.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,073
Secondly,

14
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,770
patients of different ethnicities have
genes that have experienced different

15
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:03,771
histories of exposure to disease and diet
and the illustration evokes a g was a

16
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:09,120
genome wide association studies showing
that in a particular part of Africa

17
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:13,860
there is a particular region of the
chromosome that provides resistance to

18
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:14,700
tuberculosis.

19
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:16,610
Yeah,

20
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,780
because patients vary in their ability
to resist disease and metabolize drugs.

21
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,890
Individualized medicine can probably
produce more accurate treatment,

22
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,390
but it doesn't come cheap.

23
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,020
Another feature of patients is that they
have a particular life history and the

24
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,490
human life history is an unusual,

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,720
humans have only recently evolved
altricial young childhood,

26
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,320
Short Inter birth intervals and menopause.

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,470
They are not yet as precisely
and elegantly designed
is ancient traits because

28
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:57,471
they have been shaped by
many fewer selective events
and you can see that girls

29
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:02,340
and boys have also evolved very
different growth trajectories with girls

30
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:05,010
maturing earlier than boys.

31
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:07,860
Okay.

32
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,450
The next important aspect of patients
is that their products of their

33
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:15,690
developmental histories as well
as their evolutionary histories,

34
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,070
they react to diet, exercise, and
disease with plastic responses.

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,690
Here are the evil brothers
who are identical twins.

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,680
This one undertook long distance running
at 18 and at the same age his brother

37
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,330
took up weightlifting.

38
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,473
Okay.

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,110
This makes the point that patients are
points on reaction norms and reaction

40
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:45,630
surfaces that integrate their
individual developmental histories.

41
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,580
Okay.

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,050
It also emphasizes that events
occurring very early in life in Utero,

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,130
perinatal and postnatally have
large impacts on the rest of life.

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,860
Patients are also bundles of
tradeoffs and because of that,

45
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,280
most interventions have side effects
because changes in one trade or linked to

46
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:15,320
changes and other traits genetically
develop mentally and physiologically,

47
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,890
and we evoke that idea with the y model
of tradeoffs where a certain resource

48
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:24,980
coming into the organism is being
split here between two functions,

49
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:27,200
between fecundity and survival.

50
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:35,270
This means that it's almost impossible
to change any one thing without changing

51
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:39,870
something else that might be significant
or not significant depending on the

52
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:40,710
circumstances,

53
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:45,390
but all traits in an organism
are tied together to some degree.

54
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:49,560
Some side effects are important
and we need to be aware of them.

55
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,210
Patients also are organisms that age
and they were not selected to age and to

56
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:02,521
die the age because they were selected
for reproductive performance and

57
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:06,850
reproduction has costs in repair,
maintenance,

58
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:11,851
defense and mortality that were worth
paying an evolutionary currency.

59
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,600
Many patients and doctors of course,
do not see it that way.

60
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,663
Okay.

61
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,060
Another very interesting developing part
of our vision of what is a patient is

62
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:30,600
that early experience makes quite a
difference and we evoked that with this

63
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:31,860
picture from the Dutch hunger.

64
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:36,861
Winter nutrition in Utero in infancy
affects the risk of cardiovascular disease

65
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,330
type two diabetes and obesity decades
later as well as some other diseases.

66
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,740
And if we also look into the Microbiota,

67
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:52,530
we can see that we need to be very careful
about disrupting the microbiota and

68
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:55,500
that's because of our recognition
that there is continual,

69
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,390
there's initial crosstalk and then there
is continuing crosstalk between the

70
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:05,391
immune system and the Microbiota both in
the gut and in the skin epithelium and

71
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,170
in the lung epithelium and elsewhere.

72
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,680
The microbiota are effected by C-sections,

73
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,470
by breastfeeding and antibiotic therapy
and that has consequences for asthma,

74
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,110
atopy,
autoimmune diseases and obesity.

75
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,860
I should also point out that if we have
large antibiotic treatments that pretty

76
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,900
much wipe out the intestinal Microbiota,

77
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,640
it opens up the possibility of a c
difficile infection which can kill people.

78
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,040
So here again,

79
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,630
events that are happening very early in
life when the gut is initially colonized,

80
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,170
have disproportionate
impact on the rest of life.
