00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.100
Here we have the graph,
or part of the graph, of y

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.850
is equal to x squared again.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.310
And I want to find the volume
of another solid of revolution.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.910
But instead of rotating
around the x-axis this time,

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.665
I want to rotate
around the y-axis.

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:15.870
And instead of going
between 0 and some point,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.320
I'm going to go between y is
equal to 1 and y is equal to 4.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.820
So what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.720
to take this graph
right over here.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.310
I'm going to take this curve.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.950
And instead of rotating it
around the x-axis, like we

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.850
did in the last few
videos, I'm going

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.610
to rotate it around the y-axis.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.960
So I'm going to rotate
it around just like that.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.750
So what's the shape
that we would get?

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.930
So let me see if we
can visualize this.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.580
So the base is going
to look something

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:53.180
like that if we
could see through it.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.630
And then this up
here, the top of it,

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.270
would look something like that.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.690
And we care about
the stuff in between.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.370
So we care about this
part right over here,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.250
not the very bottom of it.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.750
And let me shade
it in a little bit.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.270
So it would look
something like that.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.280
So let me draw it separately,
just so we can visualize it.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.930
So I'll draw it at
different angles.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.780
So if I were to draw it with
the y-axis kind of coming out

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.365
the back, it would look
something like this.

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:29.110
It would look something like--
it gets a little bit smaller

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.330
like that.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.910
And then it gets cut off right
over here, right over here

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.480
like that.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.290
So it looks-- I don't know
what shape you could call it.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.570
But I think hopefully
you're conceptualizing this.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.550
Let me do it in that
same yellow color.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.240
The visual-- that's not yellow.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.350
The visualization here is
probably the hardest part.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.100
But as we can see
it's not too bad.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.490
So it looks something like this.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.410
It looks like maybe a truffle,
an upside-down truffle.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.990
So this right here, let
me draw the y-axis just

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.600
to show how we're oriented.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.200
So the y-axis is popping out
in this example like that.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.570
Then it goes down over here.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.070
And then the x-axis
is going like this.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.140
So I just tilted this over.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.630
I tilted it over
a little bit to be

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.171
able to view it at
a different angle.

00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:22.111
This top right over here is
this top right over there.

00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:24.110
So that gives you an idea
of what it looks like.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.318
But we still haven't thought
about how do we actually

00:02:26.318 --> 00:02:28.880
find the volume of this thing?

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.590
Well, what we can do,
instead of creating

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.600
discs where the depth is in
little dx's, what if we created

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.590
discs where the depth is in dy?

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.690
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.280
So let's create-- let's
think about constructing

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.110
a disc at a certain y-value.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.230
So let's think about
a certain y-value,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.360
and we're going to construct
a disc right over there that

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.480
has the same radius of
the shape at that point.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.800
So that's our disc.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.720
That's our disc right over here.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.190
And then it has
a depth-- instead

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.910
of saying it has a depth of dx,
let's say it has a depth of dy.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.210
So this depth right
over here is dy.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.539
So what is the volume of
this disc in terms of y?

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.080
And as you could
imagine, we're going

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.690
to do this definite integral,
and it is a definite integral,

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.530
with respect to y.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.120
So what's the volume
of this thing?

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.620
Well, like we did
in the last video,

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.410
we have to figure out the
area of the top of each

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.220
of these discs.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.250
Or I guess you could say
the face of this coin.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.869
Well, to find that
area it's pi r squared.

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.910
If we can figure out this
radius right over here,

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.600
we know the area.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.290
So what's that radius?

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.430
So to think about that
radius in terms of y,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.260
we just have to solve
this equation explicitly

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.100
in terms of y.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.850
So instead of saying it's
y is equal to x squared,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.220
we can take the principal
root of both sides,

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.010
and we could say that the
square root of y is equal to x.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.960
And this right over here is only
defined for non-negative y's,

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.600
but that's OK, because we are
in the positive x-axis right

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.480
over here.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.010
So we can also call of this
function right over here

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.929
x is equal to the
square root of y.

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:15.970
And we're essentially
looking at this side of it.

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.335
We're not looking at this
stuff right over here.

00:04:20.335 --> 00:04:22.460
So we're only looking at
this side right over here.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.800
We've now expressed
this graph, this curve,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.070
as x as a function of y.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.090
So if we do it that way, what's
our radius right over here?

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.690
Well, our radius right over
here is going to be f of y.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.090
It's going to be the
square root of y.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.020
It's going to be the square
root of y is our radius.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.520
So it's going to
be a function of y.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.700
I don't want to confuse you if
you thought this was f of x,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.866
and actually this is f of y.

00:04:45.866 --> 00:04:48.060
No, it would be a function of y.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.360
We could call it g of y.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.420
It's going to be the
square root of y.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.840
So area is equal to
pi r squared, which

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.380
means that the
area of this thing

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.400
is going to be pi times
our radius, radius squared.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.290
Our radius is square root of y.

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.490
So this thing is going
to be equal to pi--

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.472
the square root of y
squared is just pi times y.

00:05:19.472 --> 00:05:20.930
Now, if we want
the volume, we just

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.870
have to multiply the area of
this surface times the depth,

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.490
times dy.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.820
So the volume of
each of those discs

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.430
is going to be pi y times dy.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.580
This gives you the
volume of a disc.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.130
Now, if we want the volume
of this entire thing,

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:45.930
we just have to sum
all of these discs

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.650
for all of the y-values
between y is equal to 1

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.440
and y is equal to 4.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.380
So let's do that.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.250
So we just take the definite
integral from y is equal to 1

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:54.939
and y equals 4.

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:56.480
Just as a reminder,
definite integral

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.540
is a very special type of sum.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.320
We're summing up
all of these things.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.190
But we're taking the
limit of that sum

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.400
as these dy's get
shorter or get, I guess,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.580
squatter and squatter
or smaller and smaller,

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.650
and we have a larger and
larger number of these discs.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.890
Really, as these
become infinitely small

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.040
and we have an infinite
number of discs,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.250
so that our sum doesn't
just approximate the volume,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.190
it actually is the
volume at the limit.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.430
So to figure out the volume
of this entire thing,

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.450
we just have to evaluate
this definite integral

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.390
in terms of y.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.949
And so how do we do that?

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:31.240
What's it going to be equal to?

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.290
Well, we could take
the pi outside.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:38.210
It's going to be pi times the
antiderivative of y, which

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.270
is just y squared over 2,
y squared over 2 evaluated

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.540
from 1 to 4, which is
equal to pi times--

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.972
well, if you evaluate it
at 4, you get 16 over 2.

00:06:50.972 --> 00:06:52.430
Let me just write
it out like this.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.210
4 squared over 2 minus
1 squared over 2,

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:07.600
which is equal to pi times
16 over 2 is 8, minus 1/2.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.600
And so we could view
this as 16/2 minus 1/2,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.570
which is equal to 15/2.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:18.420
So this is equal
to 15/2 times pi.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.626
Or another way of thinking
of it is 7 and 1/2 times pi.

00:07:21.626 --> 00:07:23.000
But this is a
little bit clearer.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.690
So we're done.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.570
We found our volume not
rotating around the x-axis,

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:32.010
but rotating around the y-axis,
which is kind of exciting.
