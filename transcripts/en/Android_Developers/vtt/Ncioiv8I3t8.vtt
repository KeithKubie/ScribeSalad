00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
I'm Max.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.930
I'm a Play Partner
Manager based in Berlin.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.090
And what I do in
day-to-day interactions

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.990
is talk to app developers.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.230
Could you just reset
the notes, please?

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:24.080
Talk to app developers about
their engagement strategies

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.300
across the whole device
ecosystem that is emerging.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.520
And certainly, it's true
that, at the moment,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.500
the hub of your interactions
with your customers

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.220
is the smartphone.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.670
But what we're seeing
is a whole ecosystem

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:47.270
of smart and connected
devices coming to the fore,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.500
and coming to the fore like
smart TVs, smart watches,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.680
smart cars.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.050
And they're creating new
avenues for user interactions.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.314
The growth that we're seeing
in beacon deployments--

00:01:01.314 --> 00:01:02.980
it's still in the
early stages, but it's

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.910
going to get bigger-- as well
as the growth of the Internet

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.310
of Things, will create
new opportunities for you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.360
to interact with your users
in the physical world.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.390
We've seen this slide before
just from Mateo's presentation.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.940
But I think what it does, it
captures the point really well.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.970
For you as developers,
it's a key challenge

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.920
to find strategies that take
advantage of the growing

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.310
connected device ecosystem.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.690
And what we've seen
across categories of apps

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.570
is that frequent regular
interactions with your app

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.740
build loyal audiences
and increase

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.770
your chances of building
long-term customers

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.960
or long-term relationship
with your users.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.740
So what I want to
do today is look

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.880
at how you can build
smart interaction

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.375
strategy for the multi-device
contextual world.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.310
Oh, sorry.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.750
I'm not in the spotlight.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.430
And so in this
more complex world,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.960
developers are finding new
answers to their questions.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.840
So how do I personalize
and tailor interactions

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.130
with my users?

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.000
How do I take advantages of
these new device classes that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.440
are emerging, and how do I build
a good interaction strategy

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.200
around it?

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.950
And how do I enable users
to interact with others

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.485
and the world around them?

00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:46.760
So in the next 20
minutes or so, we'll

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.760
talk about how
Google can help you

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.072
with finding good answers
to those questions

00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:52.280
and building a good strategy.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.380
So let's start with
tailored interactions.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.610
So this chart is
for the US only,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.420
but it holds true for many
European countries as well.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.860
So think about
this for a minute.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.050
Next year, 60% of your app
users on their smartphone

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.410
will also be able to use
your app on their tablets.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.430
I think that's quite
a staggering figure.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.210
So what that means for your
services or for your apps,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.880
for your products that depend
on logging in users to deliver

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.750
a personalized
content or services,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.630
or to track the value of
your advertising channel

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.260
is that you basically
need to find a way

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.000
to provide your users
with a seamless login

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.520
experience across all the
devices that they're using.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.680
And Google can
help you with that.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.290
I want to introduce you to
Smart Lock for Passwords today.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.610
It's a lightweight API
for Android and Chrome

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.930
that basically stores the login
information your users use

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.320
on web and in Android.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.700
So it remembers whether they
use their email and password

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.440
or whether they might
have used Google sign-in

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.529
or Facebook to authenticate
themselves in your app.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.279
And if they do that on the
web, Smart Lock for Passwords

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.660
will do the same on Android.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.410
And the credentials
that the users enter

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.070
will sync seamlessly in
the background across all

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.560
the devices where the user is
logged in-- so across Android,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.100
smartphones,
tablets, and Chrome.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.570
So let's see what
it can actually do.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.350
So if you have a
web presence and you

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.590
have a user that's authenticated
previously on the web

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.390
but now installs your
apps for the first time,

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.800
they won't see a login
screen or a prompt

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.960
to enter their
password, but they will

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.280
be signed in automatically.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.370
So what we're seeing
with the launch partners

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.190
that we have out there
is that instantly they're

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.510
signing in 10% of their
audience on Android

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.940
just because they have
built up a big signed

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.500
in user base on web.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.480
If multiple accounts
are registered,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.080
Smart Lock for
Passwords will ask

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.340
the user, hey, do you want to
sign in with your Gmail account

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.840
or with your Hotmail account.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.750
And so what that means for you
is that as users are moving

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.000
between platforms
or between devices,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.640
they'll have no sign-in prompts.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.080
You'll have no drop off.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.520
And you'll have instant
personalization in your apps.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.860
So you also will
encounter the situation

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.430
where a user will sign
up for the first time.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.190
And when they create
an account in your app,

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.090
a prompt will appear and ask
the user to save their password.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.940
Or if they want to
log in with Google,

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.290
it will remember that choice
and make that available

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.540
if they use your app on
a tablet or on the web.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.480
And about 50% to 60% of
users say yes to that option

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.140
when prompted.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.670
And we think we can do
even better with some UX

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.420
improvements in
that prompt flow.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.460
And what we've seen is one of
the launch partners was Orbitz.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.880
And they've seen a 5% increase
in the overall signed-in users

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.200
on Android just by having
that prompt appear.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.010
So once you've
identified your users

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.940
on all the different
devices and made it easy

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.120
for them to
authenticate themselves

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.060
as they move between
devices-- I wanted

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.360
to talk a little bit about
notifications as a key user

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.659
interaction strategy
and the tools

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.950
that we have available to help.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:59.430
So we've seen that notifications
are a key tool to make sure

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.210
that users keep coming back.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:06.820
But to really have a material
impact on engagement,

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.310
you need to ask yourself a
couple of important questions

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.090
to formulate your
notification strategy.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.216
So you need to have
a key objective.

00:07:14.216 --> 00:07:16.090
So what this developer
is doing ShareTheMeal,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.260
where the key objective
is to solicit a donation.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.950
So when they send
you a notification,

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.500
they want you to go
into the app and donate.

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.520
And they're also
trying to figure out

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.370
the context of the
notification and the timing.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.160
So here the context is
you get a notification

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.820
at breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.820
And then the timing would
be, or the frequency

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.880
would be once a week, once
a month, once a day even.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.160
And then what you also
need to figure out,

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.750
once you have those
questions answered,

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.700
is to say, how
can I target users

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.440
that fall into these different
groups for notifications.

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.330
And also you need to think
about what technical resources

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.310
you want to invest to actually
implement your notification

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.520
strategy.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.990
And Google Cloud Messaging is
a free notification service

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.540
from Google that
actually helps you

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.380
deliver your world-class
notification strategies.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.370
So it's fit for all use cases.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.560
You can use it to send messages
to do background syncing,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.210
to implement
messaging, use cases.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.080
You can enable cross-device
platform messaging.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.790
So if someone likes
your photo somewhere,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.520
you get a notification
on all your devices.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.750
The value is that it's built
on Google infrastructure.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.815
And it's reliable under
high message loads.

00:08:39.815 --> 00:08:43.230
So you don't have to worry
about not reaching your users

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.960
when it's critical.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.800
It also keeps power
consumption down,

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.750
which is great because
your app doesn't

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.890
have to pull your servers.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.860
And it basically reduces
engineering complexity for you

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.750
as you're implementing
your strategy.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.480
And the great
thing is it's free.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.110
And it has any features
that are out of betas,

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.990
don't have any caps or
restrictions on usage.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:12.165
One key feature I want
to highlight-- oh, it's

00:09:12.165 --> 00:09:13.450
a little logo missing.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.350
So this is the cloud
messaging logo here.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.400
One feature that's new and that
was a highly asked-for feature

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.960
is the topic messaging.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.360
Oh, there it is.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.850
So what you can do is you
can assign users to topics.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.010
So first what you do is
you create a topic list.

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.780
Say, call it app marketing.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.570
And then you can automatically
assign users to that list.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:45.600
So you have a list of devices
that subscribe to that topic.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.730
Or you can actively
ask users to sign in,

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.525
so you can have a
little question,

00:09:50.525 --> 00:09:52.460
are you an app
marketing manager,

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:53.600
or something like that.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.340
And then you can send a message
to Google simply saying,

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.400
there's a new open beta
on topic messaging,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.150
and send it to the
topic app marketing.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.450
And you don't have to worry
about all your subscription

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.260
management anymore
because all of that

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.210
is taken care of by Google.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.000
And the great
thing about that is

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.820
that you have a fast
and efficient way

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.710
to implement subscriptions.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.260
At the moment, this
is still in beta.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.630
So there's a cap of 1
million subscribers per app.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.520
So we've covered the
tailored interaction piece.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.650
Now we're going to move on to
how to extend your interaction

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.750
strategies to other devices.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.080
So starting with
phones and tablets

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:45.670
and going to TVs and wearables
and cars, Android is expanding.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.350
Android and Play provide
you with a platform.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.980
But these platforms
really come to life

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.390
and create value for
users with the apps

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.960
that you as developers build.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.570
So now this is still
a very new field.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.090
So it's a great time
to think about how

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.610
you can tailor your interaction
strategies to these new devices

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.500
and platforms.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.840
So I'm really, and we're
all really excited to see

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.870
what you come up with.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.990
Talking about wear, there are
really three use cases that,

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.770
in order of the integration
work and complexity, that you

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:33.290
can do to drive users
of the wear platform

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.230
and of our smart watches
back into your app

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.330
and to interact with them.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.270
So notifications is great
because mostly notifications

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.440
already worked out of the box.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.620
If you have optimized your
notifications for Android,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.470
then they already work on wear.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.740
If you've enhanced
your notifications

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:58.590
with action buttons,
then those actions

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:00.490
automatically work on wear.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.830
And there's great
wear-specific enhancements

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:07.730
that you can do like stacks,
pages, and voice replies.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.360
Watch faces are also
great because they

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.700
give you or your brand or your
app a really prominence base

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.660
on the wrist of the user and on
the most glanced at real estate

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.740
on their very personal device.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:26.370
So what you can do is you
can push relevant updates

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.510
from your app into the
watch face which is great.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.750
And then on the most complex
spectrum you have apps.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.910
So you can build these apps.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.550
And they run on the wear device.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:42.060
And they can do almost anything
that a smartphone app can do.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:45.310
So they are equipped-- they
can use the sensors on the wear

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.660
device.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.970
And we'll go a little
bit into the use cases.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:58.300
So enabling great
wear experiences,

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.030
we haven't stopped innovating
as we launched wear last year.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.960
We've actually made
great improvements.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.170
So one of the key things
I want to highlight

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.050
is the Always On functionality.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.880
So basically, it
allows your app to be

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.030
on in the foreground
drawing very little energy

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.270
and updating at
longer intervals--

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.280
so maybe every 10 seconds.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.170
And so for example, running
apps can show the distance

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.530
that you've traveled.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.700
Or it can show you
your boarding gate

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.860
as you walk into the airport
without using too much energy

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.310
and drawing down the
power of the wearable.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:43.090
And another thing that we've
launched is the watch face.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.470
So it's interactive watch faces.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.680
So basically, you
can and tap on custom

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:55.490
designed watch faces to show
other content or more relevant

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.990
content.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.890
So you can tap on a watch face
and tap the calendar button

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.980
and see your agenda for
the day without actually

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.440
going into the app.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.392
So we've also launched
other upgrades.

00:14:08.392 --> 00:14:09.850
So for example,
we're allowing apps

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.530
to use Wi-Fi when you're
away from the phone.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:13.430
That's great.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:15.140
You can use the onboard GPS.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.000
So that's great
for running apps.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.470
And you can access,
actually, the map's API.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:24.630
And you can have great mapping
experience on the wear device.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.720
And we also have
iOS support now.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.110
So here's some great examples.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:36.910
One is the guardian which--
it's taking long time to load.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.550
The guardian notifies
you of the latest news

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.010
directly on your watch.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.560
So if you're actually interested
in that piece of news,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.880
you can make a note of it
and have it saved later

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.820
for reading on your phone.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.640
City mapper has a
great use case where

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.150
it shows you how to get from
A to B in most major cities.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.290
And with Always
On, it saves energy

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.640
while you're commuting
around London.

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.640
And American Airlines
has a great use case

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.820
where all your
flight information

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.662
is available on your
wrist which is great

00:15:07.662 --> 00:15:09.870
if you don't want to keep
getting out your smartphone

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.100
because you forgot what
seat you're sitting in,

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.610
and you're also
carrying some luggage.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:20.969
WhatsApp is really great because
they've enhanced their wear app

00:15:20.969 --> 00:15:22.510
so that you sometimes
don't even have

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.960
to open your phone anymore.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.544
You can reply right
from your wrist.

00:15:26.544 --> 00:15:27.710
And then obviously, fitness.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.390
I was talking about that before.

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.430
You can have the Always
On mode and always see

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.720
as you're running
how far you've run

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.130
and how much time
you've spent running.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.730
And then for travel--
that should say music.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.282
Spotify lets you seamlessly
browse your playlist.

00:15:45.282 --> 00:15:46.740
So if you're at
home and you've got

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.030
your phone plugged on--
you're walking around--

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.430
you can press play.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.780
And you can control your music
from the comfort of your couch

00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.430
without having to get up
and getting your phone.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.230
I'm going to talk a little
bit about our TV experiences

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.940
as well.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.660
So we've got Google
Cast and Android TV.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.120
Firstly, Cast is
a technology that

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.160
lets you cast wirelessly from
your favorite entertainment

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.790
apps on phone, tablet,
or websites on a computer

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.750
to your TV or speakers.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:25.830
So we have a really
strong presence with Cast.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:28.780
We've sold over 17
million devices globally.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.580
And you can buy Cast in 26
countries from 35,000 stores.

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.950
And this is a really
mobile platform,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.860
so it aligns well
with consumer trends.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.430
And what we're
seeing is that we're

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:45.470
seeing a 60% year-on-year
growth of per device usage.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.370
And already, 22,000
apps support Cast.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.820
Android TV is designed
for a different use case.

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.490
It's more for a, call
it lean-back experience.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.170
So you're just
sitting on your sofa.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.880
And you don't already know
what you want to watch.

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.400
But you just want to
switch on your smart TV.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.410
And our goal there is
to create an experience

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:12.750
where you basically discover
new media content while you're

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.569
sitting in your living room.

00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:16.349
Some of the partners
that we have

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:22.050
are TV vendors, such as
Sony, Philips, and Grundig.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.380
And we're also working with
over the top boxes and gaming

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:25.880
consoles.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.370
So we've got Nexus
devices, NVIDIA, Huawei,

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.750
and Razor devices out
there because it's also

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.800
a great gaming platform.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.380
So for Cast, how it
works technically,

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.270
is that you've got Cast
for audio and video.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.300
You've also got games
for Google Cast.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:47.860
So you can build
great HTML5 games.

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:54.000
And you can in other use cases
to extend your apps or your app

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.320
user experience to
a second screen.

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.450
So you can have a dual
screen experience.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:04.950
With Android TV and the lean
back libraries that we have,

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.700
we are asking you to
create a catalog browser

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.011
and to provide a card view and
detailed background playing

00:18:11.011 --> 00:18:11.510
cards.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.340
So if someone's watching
a program in your app

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.710
and switches out of
your app, it still

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.070
keeps playing in the background.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.230
What's really
important on Android TV

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.570
is that you make it easy for
users to discover your content.

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:30.890
So we advise that you make your
content searchable, your app

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:35.110
searchable and also to enable
searching while the user is

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.520
inside your app which
is very important

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.890
as well to surface
the right content.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.690
I also want to talk about
Android Auto a little bit.

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:52.560
We're having a slow
start with Android Auto.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.190
But we're already live
with VW, Seat, and Skoda,

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.630
and an Audi is coming soon.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.500
Also GM brands such as Voxel
is announced for early 2016.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.720
And in Europe, you can buy
pioneer aftermarket upgrades

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.160
for Android Auto, or users
can buy aftermarket upgrades.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.370
And we know that
other manufacturers--

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.350
so we've signed up
28 manufacturers--

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:24.730
are coming soon to also offer
Android Auto experiences.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:28.070
So if you have apps
in the messaging space

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:30.980
or in the music space,
now is a really great time

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.624
to build a footprint there.

00:19:34.624 --> 00:19:37.790
I also want to quickly
mention Cardboard.

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:41.730
What it does is it basically
makes it easy for developers

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.320
to build virtual
reality experiences

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.720
into their mobile apps by
offering an open source

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.570
toolkit that takes care of
a lot of common VR tasks

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.290
that you're faced with
such as dealing with lens

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.830
distortion correction
and head tracking.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:06.830
So that's a great way to
extend the user interactions

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:13.030
with your apps to different
platforms and emerging devices.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.390
Lastly, I want to
talk a little bit

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:22.170
about how your apps can interact
with the world around them

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.760
and how users can interact
with other users around them.

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:32.330
So let's talk a little bit about
the Nearby Proximity API first.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.850
This is a new technology
that was recently

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.980
released by Google
that basically allows

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.200
you to build beautiful
experiences that

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.990
lets your users discover each
other when they're close by

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.830
or to discover beacons
when their close by.

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.070
So there are two
components-- nearby messages.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:56.780
So that means devices that
are close by can exchange

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.640
messages easily such as editing
something, maybe a whiteboard

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.420
in a room, or forming a
group of voting on something

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.700
or broadcasting resources.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.700
And there's also
nearby connections

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.460
which lets devices on the same
network discover each other.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.590
And then it's used in
multiplayer gaming.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.940
And the cool thing about
the Nearby Proximity API

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.460
is that it's available
for iOS, Android,

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.000
and also for interacting
with beacon devices.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.060
And it doesn't require you
to sign in your users which

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.010
is great as well.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.650
And it also lets you concentrate
on the actual use cases

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.370
that you want to implement,
and Google handles the rest.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.690
So we communicate with other
devices via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:47.310
and also by inaudible
sounds that are picked up

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:51.410
by devices but not humans.

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.760
What we've seen-- we've got
some really nice showcase

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.090
implementations.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:22:00.290
So we have edjing, which
has a cool new case

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.960
for playlist voting.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.115
So the DJ publishes
their playlists,

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:06.570
and the listeners
can vote on what song

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.090
they want to hear next.

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:12.580
We have Pocket Casts, where
basically two people or more

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.180
can publish the podcasts
that they're subscribed to.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.030
And then you can
pick out podcasts

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.860
that might be interesting to you
and subscribe to them as well.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:26.970
And Trello shares project
boards, basically,

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.780
that are nearby, so
you can subscribe

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:32.590
to do a project board
from someone who's,

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.020
for example, in this room.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.360
So that's really
a great technology

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.430
to interact with people and
other people, other users that

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:47.580
are in your apps and get them to
engage more with your product.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.120
I also want to mention beacons.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.890
So basically, rather
poetically, think

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:59.280
of beacons as
lighthouses that are

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.190
attached to physical objects
or somewhere in the room.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:08.760
And they provide a precise
location and contextual cues

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.980
to apps that want to use them.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.010
So for example, we could
label a bus stop with beacons.

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.570
So your phone knows
to show you the times

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:20.430
when the next bus arrives
or to have the ticket ready.

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.530
Or we can have a museum that has
a beacon attached to an exhibit

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.660
and provide additional
information or background

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.180
information to an exhibit.

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.570
The way that Google helps you
with this kind of interaction

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.960
is we have the Google
beacon platform.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:41.820
And it's comprised,
basically, of three parts.

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.700
You've got the
low-cost beacon devices

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.450
that have to comply with
our hardware specifications

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:56.750
so that we know that they
will work with our APIs.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.630
We have the Eddystone format
that is the beacon format

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.280
that-- it's an open source
format made by Google

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.920
that basically defines
three payloads.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:13.560
You can have a device identifier
which can provide context

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.270
to your app so
that you can engage

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.650
with them so you can build
interactive experiences on top

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.540
of them.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:24.630
The Eddystone beacons can
broadcast compressed URLs.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.940
So you can launch
experiences right--

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.660
so you can launch a deep
link right into the app

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:31.940
where it matters.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.230
And they also broadcast
telemetry data.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.310
So it will tell
you the temperature

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.880
in the beacon, whether it's
moving, things like that.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.480
So you can build
experiences around that.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.070
And then we also have
the proximity beacon API

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.790
which allows you to
register fleets of beacons

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.240
and manage them remotely
so that you don't have

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.560
to go to every beacon
that you have installed

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.460
and make sure that
they're still running

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.820
and have enough battery left.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.390
The last thing I
want to get into

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:10.240
is provide a look at the
future at what's out there,

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.550
what we're working on.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.344
And that's Brillo and Weave.

00:25:15.344 --> 00:25:19.510
We're trying to take the
next steps after beacons

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.440
and really enable the
Internet of Things.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:26.030
So Brillo is really
the Android platform

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.100
for your connected devices.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.036
So they're basically
our standards

00:25:31.036 --> 00:25:32.660
so that they're easy
to set up and they

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:34.590
talk to each other
the way they should.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:39.930
And Brillo, think of it as
basically the operating system

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.400
of the Internet of Things.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:46.380
Weave is the Internet of
Things protocol on top of that.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.630
It provides seamless and
secure communications

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.190
between your
devices, so not just

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:55.820
between your smartphone and
an Internet of Things device

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.150
but also between
devices themselves.

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.580
And it's also integrated
into Google Play

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.020
so that right from
the start Android

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.800
app developers can start
building beautiful applications

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.430
on top of that.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:12.300
And it will make sure that all
the devices are interoperable.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.910
And there's a
certification program

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:19.540
and in place to make sure that
all the standards are kept.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.100
That brings me to the end.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.320
So thank you very much
for your interest.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.840
I hope the path that I wanted
to take you on was clear.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.750
So we have the tailored
interactions for the platforms

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.400
that are really
well-established now

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.660
and are core to your business.

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:37.770
Then we have the emerging
platforms, like wear

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:40.530
and smart TVs and
Chromecasts and cardboard,

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:42.480
and that are also
important to think about

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.070
to really make sure
you're reaching your users

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.270
where it matters.

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:52.370
And then going beyond that, the
connected world, the beacons,

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.640
and the Internet of Things where
it's really important to start

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.320
thinking about how you're
going to reach your users there

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.020
and how to make sure they
come back into your app.

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:04.030
So thank you very much.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:07.680
