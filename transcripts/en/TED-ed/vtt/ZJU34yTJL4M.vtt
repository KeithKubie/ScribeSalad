00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.303
Food doesn't last.

00:00:09.303 --> 00:00:12.652
In days, sometimes hours,
bread goes moldy,

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:14.522
apple slices turn brown,

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:17.883
and bacteria multiply in mayonnaise.

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:22.112
But you can find all of these foods
out on the shelf at the grocery store,

00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:23.792
hopefully unspoiled,

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:25.923
thanks to preservatives.

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:28.063
But what exactly are preservatives?

00:00:28.063 --> 00:00:31.962
How do they help keep food edible
and are they safe?

00:00:31.962 --> 00:00:35.062
There are two major factors that cause
food to go bad:

00:00:35.062 --> 00:00:37.573
microbes and oxidation.

00:00:37.573 --> 00:00:40.824
Microbes like bacteria and fungi
invade food

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:42.824
and feed off its nutrients.

00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:44.763
Some of these can cause diseases,

00:00:44.763 --> 00:00:47.312
like listeria and botulism.

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:52.883
Others just turn edibles into a smelly,
slimy, moldy mess.

00:00:52.883 --> 00:00:57.202
Meanwhile, oxidation is a chemical change
in the food's molecules

00:00:57.202 --> 00:01:02.025
caused by enzymes or free radicals
which turn fats rancid

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:05.504
and brown produce, 
like apples and potatoes.

00:01:05.504 --> 00:01:09.764
Preservatives can prevent both types
of deterioration.

00:01:09.764 --> 00:01:12.354
Before the invention of artificial
refrigeration,

00:01:12.354 --> 00:01:16.227
fungi and bacteria could 
run rampant in food.

00:01:16.227 --> 00:01:21.166
So we found ways to create an inhospitable
environment for microbes.

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:25.414
For example, making the food more acidic
unravels enzymes

00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:27.864
that microbes need to survive.

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:30.654
And some types of bacteria 
can actually help.

00:01:30.654 --> 00:01:34.435
For thousands of years, people preserved
food using bacteria

00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:37.265
that produce lactic acid.

00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:39.875
The acid turns perishable vegetables
and milk

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.025
into longer lasting foods,

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:43.804
like sauerkraut in Europe,

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:45.235
kimchi in Korea,

00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:47.525
and yogurt in the Middle East.

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:52.875
These cultured foods also populate your
digestive track with beneficial microbes.

00:01:52.875 --> 00:01:56.724
Many synthetic preservatives 
are also acids.

00:01:56.724 --> 00:01:58.655
Benzoic acid in salad dressing,

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:00.635
sorbic acid in cheese,

00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:03.696
and propionic acid in baked goods.

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:04.853
Are they safe?

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:08.656
Some studies suggest that benzoates,
related to benzoic acid,

00:02:08.656 --> 00:02:11.635
contribute to hyperactive behavior.

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:14.097
But the results aren't conclusive.

00:02:14.097 --> 00:02:17.556
Otherwise, these acids seem to be
perfectly safe.

00:02:17.556 --> 00:02:22.836
Another antimicrobial strategy is to add
a lot of sugar, like in jam,

00:02:22.836 --> 00:02:25.795
or salt, like in salted meats.

00:02:25.795 --> 00:02:30.107
Sugar and salt hold on to water
that microbes need to grow

00:02:30.107 --> 00:02:35.006
and actually suck moisture out
of any cells that may be hanging around,

00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:36.949
thus destroying them.

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:40.876
Of course, too much sugar and salt
can increase your risk of heart disease,

00:02:40.876 --> 00:02:41.731
diabetes,

00:02:41.731 --> 00:02:43.146
and high blood pressure,

00:02:43.146 --> 00:02:46.626
so these preservatives 
are best in moderation.

00:02:46.626 --> 00:02:51.067
Antimicrobial nitrates and nitrites,
often found in cured meats,

00:02:51.067 --> 00:02:56.457
ward off the bacteria that cause botulism,
but they may cause other health problems.

00:02:56.457 --> 00:02:58.857
Some studies linking cured meats to cancer

00:02:58.857 --> 00:03:02.997
have suggested that these preservatives
may be the culprit.

00:03:02.997 --> 00:03:06.737
Meanwhile, antioxidant preservatives
prevent the chemical changes

00:03:06.737 --> 00:03:10.638
that can give food an off-flavor or color.

00:03:10.638 --> 00:03:13.446
Smoke has been used to preserve food
for millennia

00:03:13.446 --> 00:03:18.327
because some of the aromatic compounds
in wood smoke are antioxidants.

00:03:18.327 --> 00:03:22.600
Combining smoking with salting was an
effective way of preserving meat

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.677
before refrigeration.

00:03:24.677 --> 00:03:27.619
For antioxidant activity 
without a smoky flavor,

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:30.768
there are compounds like BHT
and tocopherol,

00:03:30.768 --> 00:03:33.077
better known as vitamin E.

00:03:33.077 --> 00:03:36.878
Like the compounds in smoke,
these sop up free radicals

00:03:36.878 --> 00:03:39.258
and stave off rancid flavors

00:03:39.258 --> 00:03:41.228
that can develop in foods like oils,

00:03:41.228 --> 00:03:42.047
cheese,

00:03:42.047 --> 00:03:44.119
and cereal.

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:47.305
Other antioxidants like citric acid
and ascorbic acid

00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:49.798
help cut produce keep its color

00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:53.268
by thwarting the enzyme 
that causes browning.

00:03:53.268 --> 00:03:56.268
Some compounds 
like sulfites can multitask.

00:03:56.268 --> 00:04:00.125
They're both antimicrobials
and antioxidants.

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:03.239
Sulfites may cause allergy symptoms
in some people,

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:08.965
but most antioxidant preservatives
are generally recognized as safe.

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:11.329
So should you be worried 
about preservatives?

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.518
Well, they're usually near the end
of the ingredients list

00:04:14.518 --> 00:04:16.779
because they're used 
in very small amounts

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.842
determined by the FDA to be safe.

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:22.488
Nevertheless, some consumers
and companies

00:04:22.488 --> 00:04:24.920
are trying to find alternatives.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.329
Packaging tricks, like reducing
the oxygen around the food can help,

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:31.679
but without some kind 
of chemical assistance,

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:36.250
there are very few foods that can
stay shelf stable for long.
