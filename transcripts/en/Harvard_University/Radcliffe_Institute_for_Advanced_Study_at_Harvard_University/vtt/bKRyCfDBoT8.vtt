00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.810
-Thanks to Radcliffe
and to Judith

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.030
for your generous introduction.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.130
And to Rebecca and
Sharon for making things

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.380
so easy for all of us here.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.780
And to my fellow Fellows for
your engaging and challenging

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.760
companionship over this
year-- which feels to

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.570
me like a long sea voyage.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.450
The sort I always wanted
to take-- not a cruise

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.390
on a cruise ship going
nowhere, but a crossing

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.210
on a great liner.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.040
Like the France, and
the United States,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.360
or the Empress of Canada--
crossing some important ocean

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.860
to a destination I have
not visited before.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.460
I am the old guy on
deck, wrapped in my rug,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.800
in my deck chair reading
novels, looking out for whales

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.410
and flying fish.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.330
And dreaming of-- I
don't know-- France?

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.500
Something.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.070
It is wonderful being
at sea with you people.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.320
So thank you.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.515
And I'm going to
talk about my books.

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:15.890
Though there's not much more
to say after what Judy said.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.250
But first of all, I'm just
going to talk a little bit--

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.332
because some people
here are wondering what

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:23.540
this fellowship is all about.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.081
And I thought I'd
talk about-- so let

00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:30.730
me offer two scenes from
Radcliffe The Reality Show.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.910
One is from November.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.970
This happened shortly after
the Lucia and Raul's talk.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.620
They are cosmologists.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.160
Their project is understanding
the nature of the universe.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.040
My project is a
novel about teenagers

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.500
in Quebec in the 1960s.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.660
So post-Raul and
Lucia, I had a bit

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.620
of a morale problem going on.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.970
I was a little intimidated.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.450
And just before Raul and Lucia
and the nature of the universe,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.889
Philip Klein delivered
a talk and I still

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:10.990
don't know what an algorithm is.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.620
But his delight in mathematics
was contagious-- almost

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.120
contagious.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.150
So there I was-- OK,
this is this first scene

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.390
of Radcliffe The Reality
Show-- back in November.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.680
Late November late
night-- not late night,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.860
evening-- in my office
surrounded by the brainiacs

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.610
on the second floor.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.330
The door's shut.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.930
I'm grinding away at a chapter.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.430
And I gradually become
aware of disturbances--

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.730
shouting, rowdiness
noise out in the hall.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.680
And this is Radcliffe, right?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.430
It's Raul, it's
Lucia, it's Philip.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.080
I think Robert Huber was
there too, and Tina Duhaime.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.040
Radcliffe was
getting really rowdy.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.330
I mean it's coming into my
office-- heated and loud.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.830
Call the prefacts-- you
know, there's some laughter.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.790
But they are really
trash talking out there.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.490
It's like listening
to a call-in show

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.820
on Boston Sports Radio--
it's that kind of tone,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.020
that kind of volume.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.400
But it's not about the Sox, or
the Patriots, or the Celtics,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.000
or the Bruins.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.780
They are out there
in the hallway,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.290
yelling at each other about
contemporary issues in brain

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.930
science, mathematics
and cosmology.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.180
So this is what life is like
on the second floor at Byerly.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.320
One more scene, then
I'll get to my books.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.410
This is Martin Luther King Day.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.820
Byerly was very, very quiet.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.920
There no one else
here, I thought.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.790
Me-- I'm working in my office.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.890
My son Henry was spending
the afternoon with me.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.860
He knows his way
around here now.

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.330
He likes riding the elevator,
because elevators are

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.570
rare on our peninsula in Maine.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.145
He likes the hot chocolate
made steamed milk

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:50.770
from the machine in the kitchen
on the first floor-- many of us

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.350
do.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.520
Anyway, middle of the
afternoon he's hungry

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.860
and I have neglected
to bring a snack.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.770
But he's cased the building
and found a vending machine

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.810
in the basement.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.860
Can we get a snack
out of the machine?

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.260
I don't like vending machine
snacks, but I'm feeling guilty.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.810
Now just a little aside--
Henry was raised in Maine

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.709
by two parents who consider
themselves biophiles.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.630
Basha grows vegetables for
our family in her garden.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.050
We're mostly vegetarian.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.847
We compost everything.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.680
In our Cambridge apartment
across the street

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.470
from Harvard Law, we poured
the compost in the freezer.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.910
I carry frozen lumps of it
to Radcliffe twice a week

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.490
on my bike through the snow.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.290
So we're organic.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.480
But this boy is hungry,
and I forgot snacks,

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.060
and there's a vending machine
in the goddamned basement,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.930
and I'm in the middle
of a paragraph.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.870
So we go down in the
basement together

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.040
and the vending machine
looks like a food morgue.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.920
Henry points to a bag of
Doritos inside the machine.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.540
It's a buck and a quarter
for the Doritos-- $1.25.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.420
OK, I never buy in this stuff.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.840
And I've obviously blown
it with the snacks.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.440
But it's a holiday, right?

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.230
Not that I think for
a minute Doctor King

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.350
would have approved, but
I go through my pockets.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.250
Henry looks hopeful.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.040
I find a buck.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.920
I can't find a quarter.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.270
I don't have a quarter.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.400
Sorry-- hate to
disappoint the guy.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.210
He shrugs-- he's a good guy.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.110
We head back to my office,
elevator to the second floor.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.215
And I notice Michael
Pollan's door

00:05:28.215 --> 00:05:32.350
is ajar-- next office to mine.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.540
I haven't seen Michael
around for a couple of weeks,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.160
but he's back.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.770
No one else in the building--
as far as I can tell-- only

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.560
Michael Pollan, author of
The Omnivore's Dilemma.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.920
In defense of food, and cooked.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.380
Michael Pollan, our
most articulate critic

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.410
of agribusiness in the
destructive and precarious

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.760
agricultural system
that has wrought havoc

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.370
upon the diet, nutrition,
and well-being of Americans.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.350
And for about 10 seconds, as
we were walking down the hall,

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.950
I'm thinking, are
you really going

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.567
to ask Michael Pollan for a
quarter to buy a bag of Doritos

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:11.275
from the vending
machine in the basement?

00:06:13.765 --> 00:06:16.390
And somehow-- though I was aware
it would've been a great story

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.620
to tell at the farmer's
market this summer in Maine--

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.300
I just could not
do it to Michael.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.820
So I didn't.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.236
We hunted through
my office and we

00:06:24.236 --> 00:06:27.920
found some Hawaiian macadamia
nuts called Mauna Loas-- which

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.414
are apparently kind of junk
food from Hawaii that Chris

00:06:30.414 --> 00:06:32.830
had left out for everyone in
the kitchen before Christmas.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.030
And those worked.

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.371
So we left Michael alone.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.779
I want to talk a
bit about process--

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.070
where my books started, what
inspired me to write them.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.710
And I'll read a very short
passage from each one.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.810
I finished three novels.

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.152
The third, Carry Me, is
being published next month.

00:06:51.152 --> 00:06:52.360
I'm working on a fourth here.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.260
All the books are rooted in
my family's story, or stories.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.330
Things I observed or
stories people told.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.780
Some of the stories
probably were true.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.280
Some were already myth
when I heard them.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.260
Those inherited
stories and myths seem

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.600
to be where I got
started, but my books

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.400
are novels not memoires.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.710
Characters start as people
I know, or once knew,

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:18.890
and along the way become
entirely themselves.

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.720
I let this happen.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.359
It seems to have to happen.

00:07:21.359 --> 00:07:23.150
I don't think there's
anything particularly

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.109
original about this
way of working.

00:07:26.109 --> 00:07:27.650
Starting with
something that happened

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.140
or something someone
said, and then

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.460
inventing-- or trying to
find my way closer to things

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.010
that I'll never actually know.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.870
Writing fiction seems a more
interesting and enlightening

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.070
way to try to comprehend
the dead generations

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:44.810
and their various claims on
myself than any other method

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.830
of inquiry available to me.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:51.260
The Law of Dreams is set during
the Irish famine in the 1840s.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.820
The protagonist
is Fergus O'Brien.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.420
I think of him as my
great-great-grandfather,

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.950
of whom I know basically
nothing-- other than that he

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.420
was an O'Brien from East
Clare who came up the Saint

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.890
Lawrence on a ship sailing
from Liverpool to Quebec

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:07.636
in the 1840s.

00:08:07.636 --> 00:08:09.010
But when I was
writing the novel,

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.200
I always thought of this
guy-- this protagonist--

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.810
as my ancestor.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.750
And therefore my son
Henry's ancestor.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.330
And that's Henry on his
first day in Dublin--

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.280
which is a big deal for me
and for my family-- walking

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.090
in moose moccasins, made
especially for him by a woman--

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.830
a Dene woman in
Northern Saskatchewan--

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:33.480
so those are very Canadian feet
he's putting on Irish ground.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.230
But it was a happy
day for all of us.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.104
We were there on The
Law of Dreams book tour.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.750
Let's see if I do this right.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.500
That was the first
jacket of the book.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.570
It's been around in
a bunch of languages

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.320
which has kind of been fun.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.400
Love the Italian cover.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.320
That's my grandfather.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.020
I don't remember anyone
in my family ever talking

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.100
about the famine.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.120
And I don't remember ever
not knowing about it.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.780
In my family we were
not into being Irish.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.760
My grandfather, John
Joseph O'Brien-- this guy--

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.350
was the first
warden of Ascension

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.640
of our Lord parish in Montreal.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.140
He was in the
construction business.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.850
And he named his four daughters
Mary Margaret, Mary Althea,

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.520
Mary Frances, and Mary Patricia.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.920
But somehow we weren't Irish.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.960
We were Canadian.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.887
And we were.

00:09:31.887 --> 00:09:33.970
And there are a lot of
reasons why Irish-Canadians

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:36.280
became Canadian faster
than Irish-Americans

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.092
became American.

00:09:37.092 --> 00:09:39.050
And I won't go into them
here, but believe me--

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.220
anything too Irish was
scorned in my family.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.990
"Leprechauny" was
one adjective used.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:50.510
It's very hard for me to imagine
my grandfather river dancing.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.410
Nonetheless, the ghosts were
there-- the dead generations.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.610
This rock-- I'll just
read what it says--

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:04.650
"To preserve from desecration
the remains of 6,000 immigrants

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.560
who died of ship
fever AD 1847-'48.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.270
This stone is erected by the
workmen of Messieurs Peto,

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.190
Brassey and Betts employed
in the construction

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.770
of the Victoria Bridge AD 1859."

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.977
The story is when
they were building

00:10:18.977 --> 00:10:20.560
the footings for the
Victoria Bridge--

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.050
the first bridge across the
Saint Lawrence at Montreal--

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:29.940
the workmen by accident opened
the gravepits from the famine

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.260
summer twelve summers before,
and covered them up again.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.780
And rolled this rock over
them, and it's been ever since.

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.490
There's some dispute as
to the exact whereabouts

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.340
of the gravepits and
how many people there.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:46.530
But the rock is there--
no doubt-- I've seen it.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.820
It was put up by workmen.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.680
And when I was Henry's
age, we sometimes

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.940
went for Sunday
drives in my family.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.860
This seems a
bizarre concept now.

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.680
But people used to do
this-- get in the car

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.400
and drive around
the city, sometimes

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.400
with their grandparents.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.470
And once by accident,
heading I think,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.580
for Victoria Bridge,
and Saint-Lambert

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.780
on the South Shore,
we happened to drive

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.200
past this rock in a part of
Montreal called Griffintown--

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.320
which hardly exists anymore,
but was at one point

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.270
the Irish slum in Montreal.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:27.030
And it's very near the wharves
where the famine people came.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.510
And something happened
when we went by this place.

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:30.696
I remember it.

00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:31.796
I was eight or nine.

00:11:31.796 --> 00:11:34.170
My grandfather-- I think of
him like hissing or spitting.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:35.544
But what probably
happened was he

00:11:35.544 --> 00:11:38.010
made a sign of the cross
or something in the car.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:45.130
And I felt radiating
through him from this place,

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:46.620
that this is a
place of some sort

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.300
of dark and shameful memory.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.390
Really a place of a
memory of poverty,

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:56.100
and disinheritance, and
disregard, and shame.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.500
And I picked that up.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.890
He picked it up, and I
picked it up through him.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:06.730
I don't believe the past
felt any different than now.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:10.180
I believe the past felt
shockingly contemporary

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.940
to those living in it.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.320
I believe they felt as we do
that they were on the cutting

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:18.230
edge of the human
experience, careening

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.930
into the great unknown of
the next moment, next hour,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:22.500
next day.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.080
This is my way of saying
when I write about the past I

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.345
try to avoid teleology.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.820
The piece I'm going to read
is set not in Ireland-- piece

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.650
from The Law of Dreams-- not
in Ireland, but in Liverpool.

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.410
In the fabulous complex
of the Liverpool docklands

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:43.750
which were built on the slave
trade and the cotton trade.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:46.400
The structures of the modern
industrial and commercial age

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.350
are well in place in
Liverpool in the 1840s.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.430
But it's a world
dragging ancient roots.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.220
And the Irish are dragging
ancient roots of their own

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.060
when they flood into
Liverpool in the '40s

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:01.980
because they can get a cheap
passage to America there.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:04.540
In a few years everyone will
be crossing the Atlantic

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.980
in scheduled sailings,
packets, and steamers--

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.910
recognizably modern
ways of traveling.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:14.190
But in 1847 the cheap passage is
on ships in the Canadian lumber

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:18.030
trade-- three-masted barques,
there's hundreds of them.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.360
It's a one-way trade.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.020
Canada exports lumber,
the holds go back empty.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.300
The masters realize that with
thousands of desperate Irish

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.310
looking for passages across what
they call the Western Ocean,

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.610
they can sell space in the
holds of their lumber ships.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.610
And that's what they do.

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.700
They knock together
really primitive bunks.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.542
They think for
about five minutes

00:13:38.542 --> 00:13:41.000
about how to feed these people
and how to take care of them

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.590
on an ocean crossing.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.830
They sell tickets-- three
pounds a head is the going

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.320
rate in the summer of '47.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.130
They pack the boats full of
people, and they set off.

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:54.497
And these become
the coffin ships.

00:13:54.497 --> 00:13:56.330
Because a lot of people
are already carrying

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.538
typhus when they come aboard.

00:13:57.538 --> 00:13:59.610
And of course the
environment in these ships

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:02.220
is perfect for its spread.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.600
So it becomes a pretty
desperate summer.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.060
And thousands and thousands
and thousands of these people

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.893
come up the Saint
Lawrence River that summer

00:14:08.893 --> 00:14:11.862
and completely overwhelm all
the cities along the way.

00:14:11.862 --> 00:14:14.070
The American ports are in
a position where they could

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.274
refuse entry to the ships.

00:14:16.274 --> 00:14:17.940
The Canadian ports
can't because they're

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.273
all part of the British empire
and the ships sailing out

00:14:20.273 --> 00:14:22.400
of Liverpool can just come
up the Saint Lawrence.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.900
They can't go into Boston
necessarily, or Baltimore,

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.850
or New Orleans, or New York.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:28.600
Well, some do but this
is why most of them

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.637
come up the Saint Lawrence.

00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:32.470
And minus the typhus,
these ships, you know,

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:35.150
are still arriving on the
shores of Italy and Greece

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.320
and all around
the Mediterranean.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.795
And everything nasty that's
said in Europe, or here,

00:14:40.795 --> 00:14:42.920
about refugees and immigrants
from the Middle East,

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.990
from Africa, or
Latin America-- is

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.462
said about the Irish
in the 1840s and later.

00:14:48.462 --> 00:14:49.920
Who may have been
the first people,

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.500
I would suggest,
to come to America

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.050
who were thought of and
thought of themselves,

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.050
not as settlers or as
slaves, but immigrants.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:00.480
And the template for
dissing the newest,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.770
rawest immigrant was
first built for them.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.624
They were dirty, noisy,
argumentative, uncontrollable.

00:15:08.624 --> 00:15:09.790
There were too many of them.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.170
Their religion was
impossibly weird.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.290
They were strange.

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.250
Their language was impossible--
it was barely a language.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.360
They were shoeless.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.880
They were filthy.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:19.800
They would change us.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.270
We wouldn't be able
to change them.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:24.210
All the things that Donald
Trump suggests about immigrants

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.530
and refugees-- and how
we should handle them--

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.780
was said about the Irish.

00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:30.034
You're [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:30.034 --> 00:15:30.534
Right?

00:15:30.534 --> 00:15:32.510
Yeah, OK.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.310
So I'm just to read this
little section here.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:37.660
We're with two Irish teenagers.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.180
The concept "teenager" hasn't
really been invented yet.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.890
But they're two
15-year-old Irish people.

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:43.020
They live pretty rough.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.660
They've met each
other a construction

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.930
camp in North Wales.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:49.260
They've saved, or
somehow gotten the three

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.910
pounds necessary for this
transatlantic voyage.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.397
They've gotten on the ship.

00:15:53.397 --> 00:15:54.730
They're on a ship at the moment.

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:59.120
It is being weighed out of
the docklands in Liverpool.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.990
It's under tow to a steam tug.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.580
There's 250 Irish people aboard.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:06.620
These two teenagers,
Fergus and Molly,

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:10.660
have no clue really
where America is.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.620
They've heard it's
four days across.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:14.820
They've heard it's
40 days across.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.830
They're afraid to ask anyone
and reveal their ignorance.

00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:21.330
They don't really know
where they're going.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.490
But they know they
are going, and so life

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:29.150
seems wild and crazy and modern
and completely unexpected.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:35.400
"On this morning in March on
the Mersey docklands in 1847,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:39.610
a steam tug was towing Laramie
out through the busy traffic

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.870
of steamers, ships, and barges.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.000
Sailors armed with pipes
went below hunting stowaways

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.230
while the immigrants were
herded up a pair of ladders

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.200
and squeezed into the
ship's narrow foredeck.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.950
Sailors stood guard
at the ladders,

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.730
and a clerk from
the shipping agent

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.820
began calling out
names-- checking them off

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.270
against the passenger list.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.470
They were packed so
tight on the peak

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.900
that people were lifting
children onto the rails.

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:05.319
'Oh man, this is awful business.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:09.359
I don't like this at
all,' Mollie gasped.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.480
Never would he have
pressed cattle so close.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.720
To distract himself
from grasping

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.660
panic he could feel
rising in his throat,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.650
he stared up through
masts, spars, and rigging

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:19.490
to the white sky.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:23.450
Can you control the song
of fear in your head?

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:25.579
It never really goes away.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:30.200
You are wound with it--
like a French ticker.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.691
After hearing their names
and displaying their tickets,

00:17:33.691 --> 00:17:35.690
they were allowed to climb
back to the main deck

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.720
where they stood along
the crowded rail.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.250
Tugs were buzzing up
and down the river,

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.380
paddlewheels flashing,
iron muzzles smoking.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:47.090
Laramie's bow sliced across
the Mersey ferry's wake,

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:50.020
a track of yellow fizz.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.850
The ferry, packed
with red cattle

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.030
entranced, probably heading
for the railway works.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.810
The sailors who had gone
below hunting stowaways

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:59.880
returned empty handed.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.940
The river was opening wide and
green, marled with whitecaps.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.550
Their bow began
to rise and fall.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:09.280
And some people were seasick
on the deck or over the side.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.070
Looking up you saw
sailors walking out

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:15.020
the yards, high above the
deck, bare feet on foot ropes.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.220
The sails were still bundled
in long white canvas rolls.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.650
Seabirds floated over the
ship, crying bitterly.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.440
The breeze smelled
of salt and kelp.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:30.270
And the ship ahead of
Laramie dropped her towline

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.530
and filled her sails.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:36.700
Clouds of pale canvas blooming
as she started to roll.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.140
Im long me measaim, he thought.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.840
A ship I am.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.170
A little boat was
maneuvering alongside.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.970
One of the boatman tossed
a line caught by a sailor.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.890
And the orange-seller
girls began

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.170
going over the side
on a rope ladder,

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.970
dropping neatly into the
little boat which fell off,

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.191
raising a red triangle of sail
and making for the Birkenhead

00:18:57.191 --> 00:18:57.690
Shore.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:01.090
'Goodbye old England,
you fucker,' Molly said.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:06.580
'Goodbye iron men, hard
roads, bad sleep, sickness.'

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:11.360
He looked at her profile--
small nose, strong chin.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.470
She was gall.

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.300
She was bold.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:18.730
Her warm skin-- he
loved her scent.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.200
Her clear tough
directness of thought.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.350
She was passion
for staying alive.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.050
'Goodbye old Kelly,'
he heard her say.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:31.010
'Goodbye you heartless,
fucking Muldoon.'

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.260
Laramie's yards were
braced and the sails

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.380
filled with a cracking sound.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.040
And the ship began to surge.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.060
The towline was cast
away and passengers

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:43.580
began cheering wildly
as the tug fell off.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:46.460
Laramie began to
roll and the cheering

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:50.050
turned to terrified screaming
as the world dipped.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:53.210
He heard Molly whoop for joy.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:58.050
Cutting loose the
old, the everything,

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:10.000
the country of the waves
now-- green and wild."

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.850
This is The O'Briens and
I'm just gonna go through.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.052
I always think Les O'Brien
sounds like an Australian poet.

00:20:21.052 --> 00:20:23.255
But it's actually the
name of my book in French.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:27.670
These are the O'Briens.

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:32.190
There's just a couple of-- some
of them are kind of spooky.

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.600
Uncle Jack.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.044
Frankie.

00:20:36.044 --> 00:20:38.710
That's a wild one-- I don't know
quite what was happening there,

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:39.560
but that's my mother.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.351
It's not my father.

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:45.530
-Are you sure?

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:49.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.425
-Timing is off.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:21:01.040
That's the church where my
grandfather was first warden

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:05.420
and that's the
coffin of his son.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.160
You don't find too many
family pictures of funerals.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.640
But we've got them.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.550
We're gonna leave
that one up there.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.590
OK, these are two of
the O'Briens-- daughters

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.760
of John Joseph O'Brien.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.334
So great-granddaughters
of the famine guy.

00:21:21.334 --> 00:21:22.750
They're both named
Mary but one is

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.530
called Frankie O'Brien-- my
mother with the Black Watch

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.600
cap, glengarry cap.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.250
The other is my
Aunt [? Bobby. ?]

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.170
My second novel was inspired
to a considerable degree

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.440
by these photographs.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.730
There's more of them.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.640
And by things I knew and did
not know about my grandfather--

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.029
John Joseph O'Brien's-- life
and the lives of his children.

00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:44.820
There were certain
moments in their history

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.236
I wished to explore,
and it seemed

00:21:46.236 --> 00:21:49.210
to be the best way
was through fiction.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.120
One theme in the O'Brien's
20th century history

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:56.810
that interested me was people
starting backwoods poor

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.660
and becoming metropolitan rich.

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:02.830
This sometimes happens to
third generation immigrants.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.920
It happened to my grandfather.

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.590
Another O'Brien's
theme is silence.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:13.400
What was talked about, and
what was not talked about.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.970
Silence is of course
a great Irish theme.

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:20.390
I was interested in
silence, not silence

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.320
applied to the experience
of war-- specifically

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.020
the divide that separated young
men who went off to the Second

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.742
World War and were
separated from their wives,

00:22:31.742 --> 00:22:33.200
sisters, and
girlfriends who stayed

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.670
in a safe provincial
city like Montreal.

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.860
I grew up surrounded
by these men and women.

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.693
The adults of my
childhood-- many of the men

00:22:40.693 --> 00:22:42.880
had been junior officers
in militia battalions

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.530
raised in Montreal-- The
Regiment de Maisonneuve,

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:47.290
the Royal Highland
Regiment of Canada--

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:51.100
my mother's wearing that one--
the Royal Montreal Regiment,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.270
the Fusiliers Mont-Real.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.870
These men were at the sharp
end of the war in Europe

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.720
in '43-'45.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.100
They carried this experience
home to a provincial city,

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.890
and were strongly encouraged
to-- without any fuss--

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.480
fit themselves back into
bourgeois Canadian society

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.930
that did not really own
a language in which what

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.770
these men had seen,
what they had done,

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.990
or what have been done to
them, could be discussed

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:20.130
or even mentioned.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:22.110
So they didn't mention.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.600
For decades they
kept silent-- mostly.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.720
Definite signs of strain
appeared over the years.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.800
Cracks began to show.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.602
But this was Canada, and a
class and a Catholic generation

00:23:31.602 --> 00:23:33.810
that believed in not talking
about the most important

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.440
of things which were
mysteries and could only

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.700
be profaned by talking.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.250
But when these men were
very old, the rules changed.

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:45.570
Or maybe they just
forgot the rules.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.970
And they began
spilling things to me--

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:50.840
a nephew, a godson--
because I was interested

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.204
and because I asked them.

00:23:53.204 --> 00:23:55.370
And when they were really
old and losing their minds

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:58.170
and everything else
was melting away,

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:03.814
certain quite horrific
snapshots came out of the war.

00:24:03.814 --> 00:24:05.980
My image for it was like
this-- everything else kind

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.563
of melting away like
wax from a candle

00:24:07.563 --> 00:24:09.460
and this igneous intrusion left.

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.340
The stuff that happened to
you when you're 18 or 19 or 20

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.830
in Belgium and Holland
and Germany and France

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.980
was there-- hard rock.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.540
Hard rock.

00:24:19.964 --> 00:24:21.380
Images imprinted
on the brain that

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:24.520
had not seen the light of day
in 50 years and hadn't faded.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.630
And when I say snapshots
I mean stories.

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:29.960
But I mean stories without
the structure of anecdotes.

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.240
Without beginnings,
middles or endings.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.890
Stories fresh and unexamined.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:39.050
Stories without meanings
assigned to them.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.440
Raw stuff still
there, terribly fresh

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:44.330
and unexamined half
a century later.

00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:46.720
This became one of the
themes in The O'Briens

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.650
which is a novel about
how much of themselves--

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.840
some people, my people
anyway-- seemed to need

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.710
to hide, even from themselves.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:00.840
And I'm going to read a little
piece from The O'Briens.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.244
I like writing
letters in novels.

00:25:02.244 --> 00:25:04.160
And what I'm going to
read to you is a letter.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.570
And the guy writing is- his
name is Jean Taschereau.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:13.750
He's from a bourgeois
French-Canadian background--

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.780
Montreal.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.370
He's writing to his wife,
who is Margo O'Brien who

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:19.540
was back in Montreal.

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:22.700
And he's writing from
Sicily in the summer of 1943

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.000
where this little
Canadian Army has just

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.280
encountered the [GERMAN]
for the first time.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.820
And they've realized,
after this three

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.080
weeks, what war really means.

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.100
And they've realized
also that most of them

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:37.930
are not going to survive this.

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:40.015
The numbers are
not in their favor.

00:25:40.015 --> 00:25:41.140
It's going to be something.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.470
So war has gone very rapidly
from being an adventure

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:46.390
to being something else.

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.820
And he's writing his wife.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:52.330
[READING IN FRENCH]

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.980
I'm going to read it in English.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.780
"Margo, ma chere, this letter
is to be the wings of a dove

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.130
and somehow fly between us.

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:03.700
But it's no bird, this letter.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.520
My pen is almost
dry, so is my mouth.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:06.540
I cannot speak.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.660
Haven't had a decent
thought in days.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.990
I'm trying to shake
myself out like to sheets

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.350
we stripped from the bed
that morning in Maine.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.810
Shook them, left them in
a bundle for the charwoman

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.540
to wash and wring and hang where
the sun and the clean breeze

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:22.450
would cure them.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.930
You will never get me
clean, Margo, I'm afraid.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:30.450
The sun here is the same
sun as in Maine or Canada.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:34.550
I would not believe it,
but I know it's true.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.870
There's a rifleman in
Lieutenant Trudeau's platoon,

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:41.700
Private Blais, a farmer-- no,
a farmer's son from Arthabaska.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.250
I'll tell you about him later.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.630
Planes overhead--
our planes always.

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:49.880
The Germans possess
none apparently.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.030
They say we own the sky.

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.930
The people from
Brigade say we have

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.250
beaten the Germans, only they
do not know they are beaten.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.190
And therefore we, the infantry,
will have to walk to Germany

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.020
and remind them
again-- every mile,

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:09.070
every farm, every village,
on each street corner.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:11.470
What clothes do you wear?

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:13.990
Do your fingers
touch this paper?

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:15.620
Does the ink speak to you?

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.310
How exactly are we
connected, Margo?

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:24.060
I feel more of a connection to
certain bullets than to you.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.780
I'm thinking of your wrists now.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.795
I once knew my wife
down to her bones.

00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.240
Do you have a sweet
tan this summer?

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.920
Comme une huronne?

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.390
Whatever sense I had,
whatever solidity I

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.610
inherited from my
Norman ancestors,

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.840
has been beaten out of me I
think, in this growling ground,

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.570
This month of things bursting.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:49.990
Let me dispose of my
adjectives, please.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.790
In your arms, please
let me release them.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:54.650
Bloody.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:59.250
silly, fecal, loud,
beaten, red, terror.

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.840
You see I have
slipped into nouns,

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.980
so let me deliver a few more.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.340
You don't have to
unwrap these, Margo.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.950
Just sign for them, then
you can put them away.

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:17.670
Child, children, machine
gun, anti-tank, .303, 88,

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:23.440
tree-burst, counterattack, head
wound, prisoner, neck wound,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:28.050
aorta, femoral artery, battle.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.550
And men of good cheer
are singing now.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:33.720
In this, our "rest area,"
the men of the Regiment

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.900
Vingt-Deuxieme are
being fed hamburger and

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:41.890
[READING IN FRENCH]

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:44.680
Are your thigh
still your thighs?

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.250
I'm sorry.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.490
I apologize.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:49.710
O ma femme.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:53.620
Is the little girl-- no
I shall not think of her.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.430
I do not want her
appearing in this place.

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:57.040
Your cunt.

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.760
I'm sorry.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:28:59.910
I apologize.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:01.740
Je t'en prie.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.300
Me, I want you on your back.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:08.130
I want your belly sweet
and warm, like sugar pie.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:10.410
Anti-tank.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.350
Howitzer.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:16.730
To lose your head out here--
c'est tellement facile.

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:18.930
The 88s come cracking
through olive groves

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:22.310
at dawn, high velocity very flat
trajectory, dismembering trees.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.870
What kills is often
not the shell itself,

00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:28.390
the bits of riflemen, and
splinters of rocks and trees.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.580
The thing comes at you like
a girl you want, like a cunt,

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.310
so sweet and so indirect.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.450
Soldiers in rifle
companies are killed

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:40.050
by pieces of other soldiers
in rifle companies.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.710
Arms, boots, knees.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.040
I tell my platoon leaders,
it's another reason

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.520
to keep the boys
from bunching up

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:50.380
which is what they will always
do it first, like cattle,

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.270
no matter their training.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:56.830
Think of your pals, I tell
them, as shrapnel-- dangerous.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.420
Watch out for those
flying steel helmets.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.890
A splinter of leg bone
can do astonishing damage.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:07.080
My Sergeant Major on the
road approaching Catania.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.040
There.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.850
I want you to cover me.

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:14.390
Three young German
boys in a staff car

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.000
on a road through the mountains.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.910
As little Lieutenant
Duclos reported,

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.920
he fully intended to offer
them a chance of surrender.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.450
Only Corporal Dextraxe
offered them a lively talk

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.200
from his Tommy gun instead.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.830
And the young lieutenant,
the jesuitical prig,

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:33.850
straight out of College
Brebeuf, was quite cool

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.000
delivering his report.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.840
He'll lose no sleep
over dead Boches.

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.970
It was the corporal--
one of our best,

00:30:41.970 --> 00:30:44.130
a rugged forester
from Megantic--

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:45.780
who was trembling and cursing.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:50.880
Their company commander,
this is who I am.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.080
I am not your husband
anymore, Margo.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.190
I don't belong to anyone
but the tree-bursts.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.750
And right now the greasy air
floating from the hamburger

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:03.430
tent where survivors gorge.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:04.950
Replacements are
due up tomorrow--

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.170
for my company 17 fresh men.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:09.550
Everyone is tired.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:12.150
The riflemen assure me there
are beautiful, famished girls

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.890
alive in the cellars of Messina
who will do it with vigor

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.580
for a piece of cheese.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.100
And afterwards offer
you a bottle of Marsala

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:21.510
for one lousy Sweet
Caps cigarette.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.020
That Blais, the
riflemen I mentioned,

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.530
the imbecile got his
girl pregnant last year

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.820
just before going overseas.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.470
Her old man put her off to
the gray nuns in Montreal

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.440
where she had the child and
was forced to give it up,

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:37.320
and is now a slavie scrubbing
floors for the sisters

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.340
and very miserable.

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.810
Her letter, which he
showed me, is pathetic.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.550
Do they send girls in
the country to school?

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.490
This one hardly makes
herself understood.

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:48.540
In any case, when you
go to the convent,

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.420
see the Mother Superior to
determine what can be done.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:54.080
You may use the name of
my uncle, the bishop.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.780
The girl is Lucie
something-or-other

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.610
from Tingwick, 15
or 16 years of age.

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:03.140
Blais is a good chap and insists
they will marry if he survives.

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.740
Perhaps you can find
her a maid's position.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.790
With the wages they're paying
at the factories these days,

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.220
I expect in Westmount
you are short of slaves.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:18.250
Oh my dear, I am shook up,
and no one but you knows it.

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.510
Forgive.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.840
Forgive.

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:34.690
I give you my blood, my heart,
my kisses for our girl."

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:35.410
OK.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:38.070
Someone said, this is a novel,
it's coming out next month,

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.920
and it spooked me.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.760
When I showed it
to a class I was

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.260
teaching this summer, the kind
of prototype of the jacket.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:47.350
Somebody look at it
said, Larry and Me?

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:50.400
It's actually Carry Me.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.730
And we're hoping
it's going to work.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.330
It'll be published next month.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:33:01.880
Larry and Me is about war,
passion, and escapism.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.590
It's fiction and it
also borrows some things

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:08.500
from my father's
complicated life.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:12.800
Settings were
inspired considerably

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:20.080
by these photographs and by
the stories attached to them.

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.440
That's my father--
the little guy down

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:27.770
in the corner-- and his father--
my Anglo-Irish-German father

00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:32.280
and his German father-- on the
Isle of Wight on a sunny summer

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.540
day in 1912.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:40.860
These pictures all kind of
wreak of Edwardian summer--

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.100
the last light thereof.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.737
This is my grandparents
on the Isle of Wight.

00:33:46.737 --> 00:33:49.070
This is the house they lived
in-- did not own, but lived

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.930
in-- when my dad was born
on the Isle of Wight.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.730
All these pictures were taken
before the first World War.

00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:59.880
That's Dad in the baby dress.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.990
Again, happy summer
guy, happy summer.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.030
This is my grandfather
looking out

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:07.520
through a telescope--
which I still

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:13.010
have-- at ships in the Solent
and in the body of water

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:16.035
coming into Portsmouth and
Southampton Harbor-- which got

00:34:16.035 --> 00:34:17.530
him into great trouble, this.

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:22.679
I'm going to get
mixed-up here because I'm

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.860
talking about my father and I'm
talking about the protagonist--

00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.693
and they're definitely
two different things.

00:34:26.693 --> 00:34:28.969
But the protagonist
of this novel, Billy,

00:34:28.969 --> 00:34:32.520
was born on the Isle of Wight
at the tail end of Edwardian

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:33.020
summer.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.659
On the day that England
declared war in August 1914,

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:42.840
his German father-- my German
grandfather-- was arrested.

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.820
As about 50 men were
through the British Isles--

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.480
on the orders of
Winston Churchill who

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.719
was the First Lord of
the Admiralty-- arrested

00:34:49.719 --> 00:34:53.210
as a German naval spy and
threatened with execution.

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:55.070
He was not a German spy.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.660
He had a telescope and he
liked looked at sailing ships.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:02.000
But there was a lot of
hysteria around at the time.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.480
So the charges were dropped.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:08.820
But he was interned for 4 and
1/2 years as an enemy alien

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:12.970
and then deported to Germany
in the bitter winter of 1919.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:17.820
His eight-year-old son, Billy,
and Billy's Anglo-Irish mother

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:21.660
went into exile
in that very sour

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.320
and defeated Germany with him.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.140
The wife and son did not
speak a word of German.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.570
She never really learned.

00:35:28.570 --> 00:35:29.660
She said she spoke it.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:33.480
My father said no
one understood her.

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:37.380
My dad-- and the
character in this book--

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:42.100
learn their way into German,
and Germany, and German culture,

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:47.760
by reading Karl May's Winnetou
novels which are still,

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.480
I think, the most
widely published

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.920
and widely read books
in the German language.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.020
These are Wild West tales
set on the Llano Estacado

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.400
in West Texas and New Mexico.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.230
And they feature a noble
Apache chief, Winnetou,

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:05.240
and his German blood
brother-- there in buckskins--

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.090
who's Old Shatterhand.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:11.380
These are phenomenally
influential in German culture.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:13.510
They were Albert
Einstein's favorite books.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.060
They were Adolf
Hitler's favorite books.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.990
They are really,
really the reason

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.010
why when you go to the
desert in the southwest,

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:23.180
you're likely to meet
a pack of young Germans

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:26.130
in a big Cadillac having their
Winnetou experience driving

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.730
across the country.

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:31.390
You also meet a lot on
Indian reserves in Canada,

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.500
and getting peevish at
the First Nations people

00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.390
for not having the
right shoes on when

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.514
they're doing their ceremonies
and stuff like that.

00:36:38.514 --> 00:36:41.490
They're very German about it

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.340
My dad, and the character
in this book-- Winnetou,

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.570
was their way into German.

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.480
And the way of owning Germany.

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.450
The books were written
by a German who had never

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:57.820
seen North America when he
wrote them, and never is

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.810
life got further west
than Buffalo, New York.

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:02.790
But they are the medium through
which my father fell in love

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:06.140
with German language and culture
in the Frankfurt of the '20s

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:07.860
and with Weimar
culture generally.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.210
Then of course
everything goes to hell

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.817
for the family in the book.

00:37:11.817 --> 00:37:14.400
I love this shot-- because it's
just a totally ordinary street

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:15.816
shot-- I don't
know who took it --

00:37:15.816 --> 00:37:18.280
of my grandfather on just
a totally ordinary day

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:21.310
in Frankfurt before
everything went really bad.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:22.325
This is like late '20s.

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:28.020
This is a school which I'm not
sure that my father attended,

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.700
but a historian I
met in Frankfurt

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:30.945
assured me he probably did.

00:37:30.945 --> 00:37:33.320
And this is one the places
where dreadful things happened

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:35.420
in 1933.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.720
They had a wild camp here.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.950
The SS rounded up a lot
of communists and Social

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.540
Democratic Party people
and tortured them

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.970
in the basement of
the school for weeks.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:53.540
This is IG Farben
headquarters in Frankfort,

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:57.720
now Goethe University-- built in
the early '30s for a long time

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:01.340
the largest commercial
office building in Europe.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:03.960
And I'll tell you a bit about
why I'm showing you this slide.

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.994
Doing research, I learned
my father's family

00:38:09.994 --> 00:38:11.410
had lived for a
time of the estate

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.440
of a wealthy rich Jewish
family in Frankfurt, Baron von

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.840
Weinberg and his Irish wife.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.970
The baron was the
grandson of an old clothes

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.150
dealer from Breslau.

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.080
His wife was
Anglo-Irish, and may

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.190
have been related to my
English-Irish grandmother.

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:25.690
I'm not sure about that.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.240
But the Jewish baron-- as
he was called in the press--

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.136
was a chemist,
and a polo player,

00:38:31.136 --> 00:38:33.260
one the richest men in
Germany, one of the founders

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.050
of the IT Farben cartel.

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:38.240
And I believe he got my father
his job at IG Farben in 1930,

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.620
the time when the German
economy was collapsing

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:46.159
and thousands of jobs were being
lost, including even at IG.

00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:47.950
So so much for kind of
real family history.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.250
The rest of the novel
really becomes a novel

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.290
and tracks less
the family story.

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:55.710
I learned a lot about
these two families-- my own

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:59.900
and the Weinbergs-- while
doing research in Frankfurt.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:05.740
Carry Me becomes a book
about-- partly about Karl May,

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:08.770
it's real theme is
escape and escapism.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:13.440
As Billy says at one point,
"In Frankfurt in 1938 escapism

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.440
was for realists, escapists
saw things plain."

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:24.290
And the escape
the day dreamed of

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:26.879
was-- This is my
father and grandfather.

00:39:26.879 --> 00:39:28.170
He's looking it down the Rhine.

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:30.620
This is a week before the--
my father went back to Germany

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:32.926
in the summer of '39
partly in an attempt

00:39:32.926 --> 00:39:34.300
to persuade his
parents to leave.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.290
They were Catholic, not Jews,
and not in a particular danger.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:39.970
But he wanted to get
them out of the country.

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.390
My grandfather
felt he couldn't go

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:44.150
because he'd be imprisoned
as an enemy alien in England

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:47.610
again, or in Canada.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:49.496
But this is him
looking down the Rhine

00:39:49.496 --> 00:39:50.870
a few days before
the war starts.

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:54.640
I think he sees the war
just coming down the Rhine.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.550
Dad's about to get across
the border to Holland.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:02.670
But escape in this
novel takes the form

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:06.650
of the Llano Estacado,
the imagined fantasy

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:11.260
of west Texas and New Mexico.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:15.012
A place that is everything that
Frankfurt in the 1930s isn't.

00:40:15.012 --> 00:40:17.220
One of the characters talks
about travelling at speed

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:21.080
across the emptiness and
openness of the Llano Estacado

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.680
and feeling the drag of history
being burnt off his wings.

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:27.040
This is a very romantic
idea-- a very German idea.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.100
And of course history does not
evaporate, no matter how fast

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:30.850
or how far you go.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.780
History stays with you.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:36.090
German romantics
usually in badly.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.806
And the quick piece
from this novel

00:40:37.806 --> 00:40:39.430
that I'm going to
end up reading is not

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:42.400
set in the Llano Estacado,
but it's in Mecklenburg,

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:45.760
northeast of Berlin, in 1937.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.060
These two young people
in their mid '20s

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:52.067
have left Berlin
just get out of it.

00:40:52.067 --> 00:40:54.400
And maybe it's kind of a trial
run for getting out of it

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.060
and going to the Llano Estacado.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.590
"An August afternoon in
my little car with her,

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:01.790
our windows cranked
down, salt scented air

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:03.330
that tasted like freedom.

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:05.562
We both like to move.

00:41:05.562 --> 00:41:07.020
There weren't many
cars on the road

00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.600
then, especially
to the Northeast.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:10.770
The regime was
planning Autobahn, even

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.450
starting constructing
them, but you

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:14.330
couldn't travel on them yet.

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.130
The existing roads weren't
much good but were often empty.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:19.720
We could go as fast as we liked.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:22.080
Though the wanderer had
nothing like the feline power

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.980
of [INAUDIBLE]
Mercedes, she might

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.090
clock at top speed of
90 kilometers an hour,

00:41:26.090 --> 00:41:28.510
but only on a smooth
road and with a tailwind.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.810
Still that seemed fast
enough, breezing down

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.290
empty roads in Mecklenburg.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.700
Whenever they were late we
made a point to stop and swim.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.040
She disliked bathing costumes--
said they were pornographic,

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.210
refused to wear them.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:42.350
So I had to swim naked too.

00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:45.490
We stopped to go
birding in a marsh.

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.240
That world is closed off now--
behind the Iron Curtain--

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.880
rearranged.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.370
Maybe the marsh is still there.

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.930
We're on a walkway
across the wetlands.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:56.590
Silver gray planks
strung together

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:59.530
to make a narrow wooden path
perhaps a kilometer in length--

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:01.390
so narrow if we
meet anyone coming

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:05.070
in the opposite directions,
passing will be tricky.

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:07.190
This is a well known
birding locale.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:09.500
Hunters come up
here too, in season.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.010
But in summer it's people
like us from Berlin.

00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:15.950
Or down from Rostock,
armed only with binoculars,

00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:20.410
hoping to spot whooper
cranes, egrets, night herons.

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:22.780
She is ahead of me,
wearing a summer frock,

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.260
white and brown
checks sewn in Berlin

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.540
by her expatriate
Parisian dressmaker.

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:29.860
Her shoulders are
bare, sunburned,

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:30.800
peeling a little bit.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.230
On her feet a pair
of green sandals.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.440
And around her neck, a strap
from my father's old Navy

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:40.976
binoculars-- the pair used
for watching sailboats out

00:42:40.976 --> 00:42:41.600
in the channel.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.890
In Charlottenburg,
we use the binoculars

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.990
to play a game she
calls Who's a Rotter.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:50.460
Zeroing in on patrons at cafe
tables across the street,

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.040
we have 10 seconds to
decide if they are a.

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.910
full blooded Nazis, b.

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.890
half-hearted Nazis, or c.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:57.920
not Nazis at all.

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:00.790
She claims to be Olympics
caliber at this sport,

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:03.710
but there is no way of
independently confirming

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:04.570
our scores.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:09.320
In the wide fragrant marsh it's
not party members, but egrets,

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.660
and herons, black
storks, and whooper

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:14.760
swans we're looking for.

00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:19.020
We've left behind the city and
it's sea of rippling flags--

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.720
red and white with a jagged
black cross in the center,

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.440
making hideous
use of the breeze.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.110
But the marsh is
a separate world.

00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:31.360
The wide sky is hazy, a
gray silver sky with rain

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.990
possible, but if so, warm rain.

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:37.390
I'm following her
along duckboards.

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:40.820
The planks are silvery, and
squeak and bend underfoot,

00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.200
as we tread upon them.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.170
The marsh is a sea of
silver-green grasses

00:43:46.170 --> 00:43:49.860
and the wind ripples the
grass with a sibilant sound

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.510
like bedsheets tearing.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:55.660
There's no one else in
sight, not a single person.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:58.750
It's marsh, so you
wouldn't expect a crowd.

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.250
But it still seems
extraordinarily

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:03.270
empty from the point of
view of city folk like us.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:09.250
And my nose has picked up a
first tangy scent of the sea.

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:13.500
And she stopped so abruptly
I almost bump into her.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:17.630
'Egret,' she says,
raising the glasses.

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:21.105
The bird is stalking its next
meal-- frogs or whatever it

00:44:21.105 --> 00:44:22.710
is egrets feed on in a marsh.

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:26.850
It's stride is
awkward and hesitant.

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.600
And while she peers
through the binoculars

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.459
I place my hands on her hips.

00:44:31.459 --> 00:44:33.000
It is the first time
I've touched her

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.410
in such an intimate
and possessive way

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:39.790
outside the bedroom, touch
her as only a lover would.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:43.730
'Jolly good luck to see
an egret,' she says.

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:46.430
Two young people breezing
through the wide countryside

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:50.500
an open car, walking on
duck boards across a marsh,

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.620
breathing the sifting
fragrance of the sea.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.520
It sounds charming romance.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.780
Was it?

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.414
I don't know.

00:44:58.414 --> 00:44:59.830
I never had
perspective from which

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.030
to analyze the relationship.

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:03.540
It didn't occur to me to try.

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:07.345
Most people in those days
were confused and startled

00:45:07.345 --> 00:45:10.220
by relationships--
young men were anyway.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:13.900
We never imagined or predicted
the depth and complexity

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:18.590
of our feelings about the young
woman-- about young women.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:20.050
Until such feelings
overwhelmed us.

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.110
No one warned us.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.360
We believed in privacy.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.230
Our feelings were our own.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:30.070
Words-- words were facile
things, superficial, limited.

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:33.580
One only spoiled one's
feelings by talking of them.

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:37.440
Following Karin Weinbrenner
along duckboards

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.430
set across marsh
mud and sea brine,

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:42.250
I did not own language
to discuss my feelings--

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.920
to put them out there in
the jargon everyone seems

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.420
able to wield today.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:49.990
To put myself out there.

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:51.940
No.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:54.770
Perhaps had I been able to
put things in plain language

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:57.480
it might have been plain
that things between us

00:45:57.480 --> 00:46:00.630
were so damnably
unequal, and that I loved

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.500
her as I would never
love anyone else.

00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.450
And that she loved me
as a young woman might

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.930
love a devoted brother,
a trusted bodyguard,

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:09.940
a horse that never
stumbles, never

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.020
shies, but takes
offenses willingly

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.640
and carries her safely across.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:20.920
When we were apart and I thought
of her, I left words out of it.

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.590
What came to mind
instead were flashes

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:27.200
of bold color, and
sunlight, and always

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.680
an impression of
wide open country,

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.330
and the pair of
us traveling alone

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:37.720
together at great distance
and at great speed."

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.910
So I think rather than
going into the next book,

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.480
I think I'm going to
have to wrap up there.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.480
I'm not going to speak
of my fourth book-- which

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.000
is very much in progress,
and the reason I'm here

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.979
at Radcliffe-- which is
partly a relief to me

00:46:52.979 --> 00:46:54.770
because it's a bit
scary talking about work

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:56.600
that is in progress so much.

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.270
But I assure you that
it is, in progress.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:04.080
OK, and thank you very
much for listening.
