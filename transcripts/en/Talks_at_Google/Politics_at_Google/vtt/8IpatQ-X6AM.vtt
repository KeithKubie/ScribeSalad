[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.720
JOYCE XI: My name is
Joyce XI, and I'm here

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.656
today to introduce
my father to you all.

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:13.280
First of all, I wanted
to say thank you

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.250
all for putting on
this event today.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.920
And thank you for having
my father and I at Google.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.060
So my father is a physics
professor at Temple University.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.940
And he's a physicist, but
because of his experience

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.920
with his prosecution,
he has also

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.100
been sharing his
experiences and speaking out

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.090
against racial profiling and
all forms of scapegoating

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.410
of communities of color in
the name of national security.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.950
He's in the Bay Area this week
on a speaking tour organized

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.410
by universities and
also a coalition

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.480
called the End National
Security Coalition,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.480
which is a group of
individuals and organizations

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.040
that have been
working on this issue.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.540
So I want to say thank you to
everybody who's been welcoming

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.630
to my father this week.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.230
In 2015, my father,
Xiaxong Xi, was falsely

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.700
accused of passing US technology
secrets to entities in China.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.630
He was widely labeled
a spy, and he was seen

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.790
as a national security threat.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.310
This ordeal took a
huge toll on him,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.850
as well as my whole family,
and our community at large.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.490
After several months,
all of the charges

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.910
were dropped completely
because they were wrong.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.920
They were not
based on any facts.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.280
Yet today, the US government,
who accused my father

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.780
and prosecuted him, has
not apologized, explained,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.380
or been accountable in any
way for this abuse of power

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.710
that they have created.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.880
And my family has still been
dealing with the consequences

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.380
of this action.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.920
So today, my dad
will share his story.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.710
He'll talk about what
happened in his case.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.900
He'll talk about his
background, his experiences,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.480
and really how there is a human
impact about cases like this.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.270
Individuals may read
about this in the news

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.357
and see the headlines
of a prosecution

00:02:18.357 --> 00:02:19.190
and dropped charges.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.773
But really, behind
the scenes, there's

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:25.560
a lot of hurt, and pain, and
fear that goes behind it.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.730
And he'll also be
speaking to, just

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.660
based on his story, the
harms of racial profiling

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.360
and scapegoating in the
name of national security.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.260
So I'd like to head
it off to my father.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.830
And thank you again
for having us here.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.190
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:46.152 --> 00:02:47.110
XIAOXING XI: Thank you.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.480
And thank you, [INAUDIBLE],,
for hosting outside Google.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.010
So I'm thrilled here
to be here and to talk

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.030
about my experience of being
accused by the US government

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.670
as a Chinese spy.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.690
And why does it
still matter anymore

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.290
now that the case
has been dropped?

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.420
Because what the
government did to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.520
me represents a great danger
to liberty in this country,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.420
because I don't want
this to happen to you.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.050
If we don't speak up
against the practice

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.110
of racial profiling,
what happened to me

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.100
could happen to anybody.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.380
So first, let me give you a
little bit of my background.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.860
I'm a first
generation immigrant.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.600
I was born in Beijing in 1957.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.250
When I was nine, the Cultural
Revolution broke out.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.010
And I often studied
by myself at home,

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.190
because there was not
much to learn at school.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.490
And like many Chinese youth,
I was sent to the countryside

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.990
after high school.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.340
And I would continue to study
after a day's hard work,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.640
hard labor.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.890
And after the end of
the Cultural Revolution,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.910
I entered the Peking University
and spent nine years there,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.220
where I met and married
my fellow graduate student

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.600
and got my PhD in physics.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.170
We came to the
United States in 1989

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.130
for better career opportunity
and a better life.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:40.580
And in 1995, we
joined Penn State.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:48.340
And so after many years
and two daughters,

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.560
and here you see
Joyce and Sarah,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.620
we realized that our home is
here and our careers are here.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.490
So we decided to
become US citizens.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.030
In 2009, I moved to
Temple University,

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.260
and built my
research group there.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.320
Just to give you some idea
about the research I'm doing,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.830
here are some of the
most important papers

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.640
I have published over
a period of 30 years.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.970
It's about thin films, about
100 thousands of an inch thick.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.830
And I have studied a
wide range of materials

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.890
from superconductors, to
ferroelectrics, from borides,

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.750
to oxides.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.650
America has given
me the opportunity

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.800
to a level in my profession that
I would not have imagined when

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.030
I was a youngster in China.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.590
And so May, 2015, is
a normal, busy day

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.360
for me filled with
my work, my teaching,

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.830
and my administrative duty
as chair of the physics

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.360
department.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.000
And Joyce just came back
home a day later from college

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.570
for a few days, and
Sarah was anxious

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.870
about her dental
surgery the next day.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.100
And I gave a public lecture
at a science festival

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.070
called the Pint of
Science at dinnertime,

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.040
and then I went to the
Philadelphia Airport

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.970
to pick up my wife, who came
back from a oversee conference

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.490
trip.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.860
And by the time we made
a plan that we will all

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.910
visit a famous Korean
restaurant for fried chicken,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.180
it was already
way past midnight.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.410
A few hours later,
our life would

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:01.730
be suddenly and forever
changed when I was woken up

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.850
by loud knocks on my door.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.840
It was May 21st, 2015, before
7 o'clock in the morning.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.760
The pounding on the door were
so loud and urgent that I

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.170
ran to open the door
without even fully dressed.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.080
And I saw many people
outside my house.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.370
Some were armed, and some
had the battering ram

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.390
ready to take down my door.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.000
And after an agent showed
me his badge, asked my name,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.800
and announced my arrest.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.630
And another agent turned me
around and put handcuffs on me.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.860
And I was in total
shock, and thought,

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.510
there must be a mistake.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.510
It must be a mistaken identity.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:53.510
So I asked them for
what I was arrested,

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.260
and they wouldn't tell me.

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.470
And in the meantime, the armed
agent in bulletproof vest

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:07.170
burst into my house, running
about, and rounding up

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.350
my wife and the two daughters.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:13.430
And one by one, they
came out of their bedroom

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.950
at gunpoint, with
their hands raised.

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.350
And I was really worried
that how frightening this

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.460
must be to them, but I could
not have a word with them.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.950
And later, I
learned from my wife

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.790
that her top
thought at that time

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.360
was to protect the
12-year-old, Sarah,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.830
from possible mental damages.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:40.565
So the FBI agent let
me put on a shirt

00:08:40.565 --> 00:08:45.160
and let me out of my house
in front of my family.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.760
And I had no idea when I would
be able to see them again.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.970
Because in the Cultural
Revolution in China,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.970
it was not unusual for
people to be taken away

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.814
and could not see their
family for a long time.

00:08:59.814 --> 00:09:03.480
So at FBI field office
in Philadelphia,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.100
I was subjected to
fingerprinting, mug shots,

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.470
and interrogation.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.480
And when I was transferred
to the US Marshals Service

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.910
to wait for my first
court appearance,

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.410
I was ordered to strip naked,
bend over against the wall

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.630
so that a US Marshal
could check whether I

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.820
hid anything in my body.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:31.740
I was in handcuffs all
the time, except when

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:36.480
I was using a restroom
or locked up in a cell.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.310
During the two-hour
interrogation,

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:47.670
I was handcuffed to the
table that I was sitting at.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.170
At the end of the interrogation,
the FBI agent finally

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.520
told me that I was charged
for having made a pocket

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.070
heater, a device
that was covered

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.840
by a non-disclosure agreement
with a Chinese company

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.030
with a Chinese collaborator.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:12.100
And I said immediately,
that's absurd.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:15.880
The fact is that I had never
shared the pocket heater

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.180
information with
anybody in China.

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:24.850
And I was shocked,
and think that,

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.980
how could the government
do this to me?

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.980
They charged me for crimes,
and they used these tactics

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.030
for violent criminals
to me and to my family

00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:37.640
without a thread of truth
in their accusation.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.340
So I was really shocked.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:45.160
And to that, the FBI
agent said, Xiaoxing Xi,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:50.390
I'm sure the whole thing
today has been surprising.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.370
And in the afternoon at
my first court appearance,

00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:01.040
I was released on bail
for $100,000 or my house,

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.330
with various travel
restrictions.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.390
So when I finally
United with Joyce

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:14.060
and my wife outside of the
jail, it was drizzling.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:21.990
And I shivered, because I had
very little clothes on me.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:27.720
When we were just pulling
into our driveway, and then

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:33.300
we saw the FBI agent waiting
for us with a search warrant.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.480
For the next two
hours, the FBI agents

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.970
searched every
corner of our house

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.050
and carried away our belongings.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:48.340
When all these were over,
I told Joyce and Sarah

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.160
that dad has done
nothing wrong, but you

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:57.930
have to prepare for a very,
very hard life ahead of us.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:03.860
The charges against me was
about a device called the pocket

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.630
heater.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:13.170
And that was developed
by a US company STI.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:18.010
And in 2002 to 2003, I
took a sabbatical leave

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:23.390
from Penn State to work at
Stanford and a Sunnyvale,

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:28.190
California company called
Conductus near here.

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.570
And in the indictment,
the government

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:39.040
said that the individual
at this US company

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.360
invented a piece of
technology, a device

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.280
which revolutionized the field
of superconducting magnesium

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.250
diboride thin film growth.

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:59.280
And this tale of an invention
of a revolutionary device by STI

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.800
was pure fabrication.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.480
The pocket heater was
invented by a German company

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.290
in the 1990s.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:14.460
And STI just modified
it for its own purpose.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:21.370
And this slide shows
the pocket heater

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.570
that was invented
by Professor Helmut

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:28.350
Kinder in [INAUDIBLE] Munich.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.070
And a heater is what we use
to heat a substrate when

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.290
we make thin film materials.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:39.090
It's much like using
a stove for cooking.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:43.170
And the picture that
I'm showing here

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:51.390
was from his paper published in
1993, and also from the patent

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:58.990
that the Kinder's company filed,
which was published in 1998.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.650
And so a pocket heater,
you can see from the left

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:07.840
that it looks like a cookie can
with half of his cap removed.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:15.250
And inside of the pocket,
it was filled with oxygen.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.340
And there is a
rotating [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:25.110
that switched the substrate
on it from the opening where

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.080
metals are deposited
on a substrate

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.000
into the pocket, where
they will be oxidized.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.060
And this is a
wide-known invention.

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.670
In the community, it was
known as a Kinder heater.

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:48.890
In the 1990s, conductors
adopted the Kinder heater

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:51.310
for their own thin
film production.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:56.180
And after conductors and STI
merged at the end of 2002,

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.200
STI continued to use the
Kinder heater for its thin film

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.840
production.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.620
And this slides shows the STI
pocket heater for magnesium

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.770
diboride thin films.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.700
And I can toggle it back
and forth like this.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:19.610
And the STI pocket heater
looks like a Kinder heater

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:23.030
and it works like
a Kinder heater.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.510
STI simply modified
a pocket heater

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.410
so that in the pocket
instead of oxygen,

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.450
now its magnesium vapor.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:39.405
And this heater, the STI
started to talk about it

00:15:39.405 --> 00:15:42.900
at conferences from 2003.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:48.370
And they published a
paper about it in 2006.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:54.080
So the pocket heater is not
classified, it's not sensitive,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.850
but rather, it's
widely known publicly.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:03.910
And the STI I pocket
heater produced

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:09.870
magnesium diboride thin
films inferior in quality

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:14.010
compared to the films
produced by the technique

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.250
that I invented at
Penn State before I

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.560
started my sabbatical leave.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.610
And my technique has been
universally recognized

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:28.800
as the best technique
for magnesium diboride.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:36.060
So in addition, I'm not
aware of any economic value

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:39.810
of this pocket heater
to the US company.

00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:45.180
And the prosecutor admitted
that the so-called crime

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:50.550
that committed had no
economic damage to STI.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:56.400
So I really don't understand why
the US government should even

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.320
care about a pocket heater.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.280
So in the indictment,
the government

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.170
alleged that I repeatedly
reproduced, sold, transferred,

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.050
distributed, and otherwise
shared the pocket

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.050
heater and the pocket
heater technology,

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.170
and exploited it for the
benefit of third party in China,

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.400
including government
entities in an effort

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.480
to help Chinese entities become
world leader in the field

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.260
of superconductivity.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.090
I have never done
any of the things

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.960
that the government
accused me of doing.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.620
It is utterly
ridiculous that I would

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:44.510
steal a publicly available
STI pocket heater, which

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:50.150
is inferior to my own
technique, and that

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.900
somehow could make
the Chinese world

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.790
leaders in superconductivity.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.540
So there were four
counts in the indictment,

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.620
based on four emails that I
sent from my Temple University

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.350
address to colleagues in China.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:15.450
And none of the emails talked
about the pocket heater.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.370
They were about
things completely

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:21.030
different from
the pocket heater.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.520
If you look at
the first account,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:30.450
it was about an email confirming
that a certain technology had

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.940
been delivered to a
laboratory in China.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.370
In fact, the certain
technology had

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.420
nothing to do with
the STI pocket heater.

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:49.840
It was about the HPCVD
tactic that my group invented

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:55.290
at Penn State, and before
my sabbatical leave.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:04.780
And my collaborators
fabricated this system

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:08.950
with a local Chinese
manufacturer,

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:12.660
with the help from me
and my former post-doc.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:18.430
And there's nothing secretive
and sensitive about HPCVD.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:20.440
Even the New York
Times covered it

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:26.630
when we first published
our paper about HPCVD.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.980
And from its invention
in 2002 to 2010,

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.590
that's when my
email was written,

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:40.470
I have published 91 papers,
and have given 90 talks

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:47.070
about the HPCVD and thin
films that was grown by HPCVD.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.020
And the emails
that I was sending

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.750
to my Chinese colleagues
was about using

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:58.920
HPCVD for SRF cavities.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.630
You may have heard
about the Higgs

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:07.530
boson, which was discovered
in 2012 at the Large Hadron

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.240
Collider.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.320
And even before that,
a team of physicists

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:18.180
led by Barry Barish, who got
the Nobel Prize this year

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:23.790
for the discovery of off the
gravitational wave [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:28.190
By the way, the discovery
of the Higgs boson,

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.500
one of the theories that
predicted its existence

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:34.680
the 2013 Nobel Prize.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:41.010
And as I said, the design
team by a Barry Barish

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:47.700
had decided that this
International Linear Collider,

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:54.630
or ILC, will use SRF cavities,
which is shown in the picture

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.380
down here.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.500
So the collaboration that I
have with my Chinese colleague

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:08.890
was about using HPCVD to coat
the inside wall of this cavity

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.970
with magnesium diboride.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.430
You cannot do it with
STI pocket heater,

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:18.000
which are for flat thin films.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:27.190
And count two to count
four are even more bizarre,

00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:31.160
because they were not
about magnesium diboride.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.190
They were about oxide.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.370
And magnesium diboride
is not an oxide.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.420
Here is the email two.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.020
And on the subject line,
it says very clearly

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.200
that it's about oxide
films and interfaces.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:55.900
And here it says that I will be
happy to build up a world class

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:03.150
oxide thin film lab that would
include laser MBE and oxide

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.282
MBE.

00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:11.590
An oxide thin film lab that
use laser MBE and oxide MBE

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:17.860
has no use for the STI pocket
heater for magnesium diboride.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.890
So even though I knew
that I was innocent,

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:24.790
I understood perfectly
that we could still

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:30.220
be in jeopardy if I did not
defend myself successfully.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.580
So I was very fortunate
to have engaged

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.790
a team of expert lawyers.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:43.240
It was led by Peter Zeidenberg
of Arent Fox in Washington DC.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.600
And it has a local
counsel, Mike Schwartz

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.090
from Pepper Hamilton
in Philadelphia,

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:53.890
and an IP attorney, Tony
Shaw, from the New York

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.915
office of Arent Fox.

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:03.200
And my lawyer contacted top
experts in my research field

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:06.020
and gave them all my
email communications

00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.730
with my Chinese colleagues.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:16.670
And so you can see
these experts not only

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:22.680
have impeccable statures and
reputations, but if you see,

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:30.080
John Rowell was the former CTO
and the president of Conductus.

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:35.680
And Paul Chu discovered the
high temperature superconductor

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.560
YBCO.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:42.130
David Larbalestier
is a top expert

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:46.040
on applied superconductivity,
including magnesium diboride.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.910
And Venky Venkatesan pioneered
the technique of pulse laser

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:54.950
deposition, and his company
sells PLD and the laser MBE

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.930
equipment.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:03.810
And Ward Ruby, whose company
sold me a pocket heater,

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:08.300
said that I am very familiar
with the pocket heater

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.340
as I was one of
the co-inventors.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.950
They all said in
their affidavits

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.370
that I had never shared
the pocket heater

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:19.540
technology with China.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.340
With these
affidavits, my lawyers

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:30.170
made a presentation-- a
48 slides presentation--

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:37.820
to the government,
on August 21, 2015.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.730
And here I'm going to
show you a few of them.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:49.430
And they told the prosecutors
and FBI agents, the tube heater

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.990
that we were talking about
for coating SRF cavities,

00:24:53.990 --> 00:25:00.920
shown on the left, which
the government said

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:07.530
was the STI pocket heater that
I stole for Chinese entities,

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:12.260
is unrelated to the SDI
pocket heater, which

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.480
is shown on the right.

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.830
They have different principles.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.290
They have different designs.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:25.480
And they have different
functionalities.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:31.210
And you remembered the
email for account 224 that

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.940
was talking about the
oxide films lab, which

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:39.190
the government said was evidence
that I stole the STI pocket

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:42.480
heater of magnesium diboride
to help Chinese to become world

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.650
leaders in superconductivity.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:50.110
My lawyers had to tell them
that magnesium diboride is not

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.440
an oxide.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.390
And so magnesium
diboride and oxide

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.900
have opposite requirement
for making thin films.

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:06.180
They had to tell the
government that oxide MBE is

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:12.610
unrelated to the pocket
heater, and laser MBE

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.190
is unrelated to
the pocket heater.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:23.750
And the STI pocket heater
has no value or utility

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:29.040
for oxide thin film labs that
use laser MBE and oxide MBE.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:36.510
And John Rowell, who was
the CEO of Conductus,

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.870
when he adopted the Kinder
heater for its thin film

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:43.530
production, wrote,
"The STI pocket heater

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.740
was in no sense a
revolutionary device.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.710
It was a modification of
an existing technology

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:53.180
that was well understood."

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:57.590
Then at the end, my lawyer made
a request to the government,

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.450
find your own expert.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.580
Give them all my
email communications

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.190
with my Chinese
colleagues and ask them,

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:06.950
is there any evidence
that Professor Xi

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:12.020
shared any pictures, drawings,
or schematics of the STI MGB2

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:12.780
pocket heater?

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.150
And we also shared
a draft motion

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.570
to dismiss the indictment with
the government, which we were

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.320
ready to file with the court.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.800
And it says that the
government's entire prosecution

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.730
is based on the presentation of
false and misleading testimony

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.620
to the grand jury, premised
on a faulty understanding

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.100
of basic and non-controversial
scientific principles

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.370
and concepts by an
FBI agent who was not

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.950
qualified to be the
government's sole witness

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.110
before the grand jury.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:56.940
And on September 11, 2015,
which is the deadline date which

00:27:56.940 --> 00:28:00.740
the court ordered us
to file our motion,

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.150
the government
dismissed the case,

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:05.690
citing additional
information came

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.040
to the attention
of the government.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.020
To mark that
occasion, we decided

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:14.020
to go to the famous
Korean restaurant

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.930
to try their fried chicken,
and it tasted so good.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.840
On September 17th,
I went to my lab

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.240
for the first time
in four months

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.530
and my group presented me
with a bouquet of flowers,

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:31.630
and I was really
very much moved.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:38.890
So the question why it matters.

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:42.340
Of course it matters to us.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.830
As I told the New
York Times reporter,

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.880
that this is not a joke.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.080
This is not a game.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:53.050
Just imagine that one day I
was a respected researcher

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.370
and chair of the
physics department.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.210
The next day I was
painted as a Chinese spy

00:28:58.210 --> 00:29:01.230
all over the internet
and in the news.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:13.770
And that's made us think
that everything that I

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:17.010
had worked for, for 30 years--

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:22.620
my reputation, and our
livelihood, and my career--

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.130
would all be gone.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:35.560
And so that sudden blow was
enough to crush anybody.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:40.540
But the pressure that accumulate
every day, day in day out,

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:42.990
were even worse.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:48.630
And we ask ourself,
I ask myself,

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:53.010
how would my family
live if I go to prison?

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:59.400
And how would I spend
the rest of my life

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:01.245
knowing that my career
will be finished?

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.980
And we wonder, was the
FBI still surveilling me?

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.060
And would it be safe
for me to go out?

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:20.870
And also, this thought
has never left my mind.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.980
And it weighed very
heavily on all of us.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.710
And friends and colleagues
stopped talking to me,

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:32.450
and I could not see and
talk to my students.

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:36.620
And also, we did not
know, how were we

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.290
going to pay for the
amounting legal fee

00:30:39.290 --> 00:30:41.620
if the case dragged out?

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.580
At the end it cost us 200--

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.350
more than $220,000.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:53.260
And I feel that we are lucky
because the case only lasted

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:56.210
for less than four months.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:00.430
And so you can imagine
that our emotions just

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:03.860
go through the roller coasters,
like a roller coaster.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.830
So we were outraged raging in
the defiance, and disbelieve,

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:13.390
and then worries
and frustrations.

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:18.230
And then scares and despair.

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.820
It was really a
nightmare that I do not

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.790
wish to see any innocent
American to go through.

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:31.200
But it's more than
us, more than just us.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:38.130
And whenever a Chinese
scientist is arrested,

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:43.740
some would say, well, he or she
must have done something wrong.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.590
I would say to
them, you don't need

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:50.380
to have done anything wrong.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.870
It could happen to you.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.050
It could happen to anybody.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:32:01.050
So what did I do wrong?

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:05.580
What I was doing was,
I was doing my job

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:09.900
as a university professor, which
is to create and disseminate

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:15.090
knowledge for the benefit of
the public, the human kind.

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.380
And my collaboration
with Chinese colleagues

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:21.980
for advancing sciences
for publications.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.500
It was never for
financial gains.

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.130
Well, you may ask, what
about the key technology

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:36.340
you developed using government
funding, or defense department

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.530
funding?

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:44.650
Well, I do not expect you to
read every word on this slide.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:48.600
But the principle of freedom
to publish and disseminate

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:53.520
is so fundamental to US
universities that most of them,

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.080
including Temple University,
do not accept funding

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:03.120
if they restrict its faculty
to publish and disseminate

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:05.670
the result of their research.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:11.070
And I have never done research
that involves sensitive,

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:14.790
classified, or
protected information,

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:19.550
or the export
controlled technologies.

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:25.460
And in addition that
the collaboration

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:31.010
with Chinese colleagues
is encouraged

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.450
by the US government.

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:36.530
And in a report
from the Department

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:40.790
of State to the Congress, it
says that the US China science

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:45.420
and technology cooperation
accelerated scientific progress

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:50.180
in the United States, providing
significant direct benefit

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.695
to a range of US
technical agencies.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:59.400
The national academies,
whose main mission

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:03.090
is to advise the US government
on science and technology

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:07.650
issues, it says
that science thrives

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:10.080
on the open exchange
of information,

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:12.630
on collaboration, and
on the opportunity

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:15.460
to build on previous work.

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:20.340
The United States gained and
maintained its preeminence

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.520
in science and
technology in part

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.790
by embracing the
values of openness,

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:30.150
and by welcoming
students and researchers

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:34.060
from all parts of the
world to America's shores.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.800
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.030
- You can do things to help
a foreign nation state,

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.280
as I said, without realizing
that you're dealing with.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.070
You think you're
helping a buddy who's

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.937
a researcher at a university
in China, when what you're

00:34:43.937 --> 00:34:46.020
actually doing is passing
information that ends up

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.219
with the Chinese government.

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:50.210
That's unwitting, and unwitting
is the same as your implicit.

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.469
Explicit would be you know,
I'm sending this stuff

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:54.261
to this researcher
in China and I'm

00:34:54.261 --> 00:34:56.070
doing it because I want to
help the Chinese government

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.319
and I know he's hooked up
with the Chinese government.

00:34:58.319 --> 00:35:00.400
[END PLAYBACK]

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.150
XIAOXING XI: So this
perfectly demonstrate

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.780
the mindset of the FBI.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:11.200
And what the FBI sees as
Chinese government entities are

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.840
all universities in China,
like Peking University,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:17.500
Qingquan University, Shanghai
Jiao Tong University,

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.570
or the Chinese
Academy of Sciences,

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:23.740
because they are funded
by the Chinese government.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:27.280
So basically what
they are doing is

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:32.860
to criminalize all scientific
academic collaboration

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.780
with China.

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:39.330
You know, as pointed from this
National Academies report,

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.880
measures that hinders
international collaboration

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.450
in science and technology
actually hamper

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:51.680
US economic competitiveness
and well-being and prosperity.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:58.690
So it's been two years
since my case was dismissed.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:02.510
But our struggle
is far from over.

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:08.020
Last June, I had the opportunity
to attend this conference

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.040
organized by the
Georgetown Law School,

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.600
"The Color of Surveillance."

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:19.300
And I learned that
people of color,

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:27.250
minorities, religious
minorities and LGBT persons,

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:32.830
have disproportionately being
the target of government

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.020
surveillance.

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:41.020
In my case, we knew that
the FBI had all my emails.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.990
They listened to my
phone calls, and they

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:47.170
conducted intense
electronic surveillance

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:50.560
and physical
searches against me,

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:56.730
pursuant to FISA, the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:01.000
And my case started as a
national security case.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.130
And it changed to a
criminal case at some point.

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:08.688
What we don't know is why.

00:37:08.688 --> 00:37:11.680
Why they are targeting me?

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:16.420
Once I was prosecuted
despite being innocent,

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:21.050
our peace of mind
is gone forever.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:26.230
So even now, we are living
under a constant concern

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:29.350
that the government is
still reading my emails,

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:31.075
listening to my phone calls.

00:37:31.075 --> 00:37:34.120
That anything I say
in the right could

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:39.190
be twisted by the government
as a reason to charge me.

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:46.240
Just like a Chinese saying,
to pick bones out of an egg.

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.860
So the question is,
did the government

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:57.070
target me because my
Chinese ethnic origin?

00:37:57.070 --> 00:38:03.040
And is it because of my visit
to China, to my aging mother,

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.800
my friends, my relatives?

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.360
So my lawyer, Peter
Zeidenberg said,

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:14.110
if he was Canadian American,
or French American,

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:17.560
or he was from the UK,
would this have ever gotten

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.970
on the government's radar?

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:21.840
I don't believe so.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.410
And when I met my local
counsel, Mike Schwartz,

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:26.940
for the first time
and I told him

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:29.940
that I didn't do anything
that the government charged me

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:34.080
of doing, he asked me,
have you made money

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.770
from your collaboration
with Chinese colleagues?

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.350
And I said no.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:43.710
And he then said, it must be
because you are from China.

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:51.480
So what is alarming
is that my case is not

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.360
the only such cases.

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.950
There was the National
Weather Service hydrologist,

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:59.590
Sherry Chen.

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:04.980
And there was Guoqing Cao
and Shuyu Li, the Eli Lilly

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.580
scientists.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:11.820
There is a pattern that the
scientist of Chinese origin

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:17.250
are being charged, and
just for it to be dropped

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:21.270
later on, without explanation.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:25.590
And so this has prompted
many people like members

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:30.390
of the Congress, the US
commission on civil rights,

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:34.710
and many civil
rights organizations,

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:38.550
to ask the Department of
Justice to investigate

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:42.840
whether race, and ethnicity,
and national origin

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:47.060
had anything to do with
these kind of false charges.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:55.120
So one point I want to say
is that the racial profiling

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.810
is not just a Chinese
American issue,

00:39:58.810 --> 00:40:01.420
but an issue for all Americans.

00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:07.390
I will just put this
borrowed and modify lines

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:10.960
from Martin Niemoller
up here for you to read.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.130
And then I will tell you what an
African American student wrote

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:19.030
to me after he
listened to a talk

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:22.540
that I gave at the University
of Maryland about my ordeal.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:28.720
He wrote in his email that I
cannot pretend to know what you

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.190
feel or struggle with.

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.380
I have been trained
my whole life

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:38.090
knowing that situations such
as yours could happen to me.

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.830
His great uncle was
wrongfully convicted

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:48.760
of raping a white woman and
spent 25 years in prison,

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:53.700
until it was shown that the
fingerprint in the evidence

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.930
matched another man.

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:04.150
So if race based persecution
and prosecution exists,

00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:07.960
for any ethnic
group of Americans,

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.220
this practice infringe on
the constitutional rights

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.850
of all Americans.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:24.280
So I want to call this
opinion of the Supreme Court

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.210
associate justice Louis
Brandeis in his opinion

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:33.730
in the wiretapping case of
Olmstead versus United States

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:35.910
in 1928.

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:39.810
He said that the greatest
dangers to liberty

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:44.440
lurk in the insidious
encroachment by men of zeal,

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:48.360
well-meaning but
without understanding.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:53.310
So the men of zeal
in my case obviously

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.920
were without
understanding, right?

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.340
Quite literally.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.520
But also that a man
of zeal can also

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:06.710
be malicious, not well meaning.

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:12.590
And I will say that persecution
or prosecution based on race

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:17.270
and ethnic origin, ethnicity
and national origin,

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.340
are definitely not well meaning.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:28.920
So that is why I ask this
question, why it matters?

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.570
Because cases like
mine do not protect

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:36.980
our intellectual properties.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:40.620
They threaten the
academic freedom.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:43.580
They hamper the US
research enterprise

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.770
and economic well-being.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:49.850
And they undermine
people's confidence

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:51.560
in America's legal system.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.420
And they terrorized
Chinese American

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.670
in the scientific communities.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:43:00.680
And they endanger the liberty
that we cherish so much

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:01.370
in this country.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:08.340
That is why I'm
telling my story.

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.660
What happened to me
could happen to you,

00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:16.730
unless we all speak up as
one against racial profiling

00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:22.560
in government surveillance,
and any law enforcement.

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.840
We have to work together
to stop this injustice

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:29.812
of racial profiling.

00:43:29.812 --> 00:43:31.246
Thank you very much.

00:43:31.246 --> 00:43:32.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:37.146 --> 00:43:39.270
AUDIENCE: Coming from China,
and having experienced

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:41.720
a cultural revolution,
you must have

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.640
been thinking about
coming to the US

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:48.980
to escape these kind
of accusations and loss

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:51.512
of economic-- sorry,
academic freedom.

00:43:51.512 --> 00:43:52.970
But then you come
to US, experience

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:56.590
the same, pretty much, same
things in essence again.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:44:00.990
So does that change
how you think

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:05.760
about the essence of
the politics dynamics

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.530
in China and the US and how
you think about the propaganda

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:10.742
of governments?

00:44:14.469 --> 00:44:16.010
XIAOXING XI: You're
absolutely right.

00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:19.400
I mean, there is a
parallel in this.

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:24.980
And I can even tell you a story
that illustrate this parallel.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.290
When I was in
elementary school--

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:31.360
I forgot, maybe 12
years old or so--

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:39.370
I was accused by my
teacher of saying

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:41.410
Chairman Mao three years old.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:44.670
You know, at that time
everybody was forced to say,

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:45.970
long live Chairman Mao.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:51.420
In Chinese that means
Chairman Mao, 10,000 years.

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:57.330
And the Chinese character of
10,000, the scribble of it

00:44:57.330 --> 00:45:03.069
looks very similar to
the Arabic numeral three.

00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:05.610
So my teacher was saying I was
saying that Chairman Mao three

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:06.990
years old.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:13.060
And the whole class you know,
condemn me for the class.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.770
So you are absolutely right.

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:18.850
This kind of being
false accused,

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:22.800
in a sense was not foreign
to us because I lived

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.840
through cultural revolution.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.490
But absolutely, we were
not expecting it here

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:31.050
in the United States.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:34.850
What I have to say is
that at least here there

00:45:34.850 --> 00:45:38.190
is this process,
a legal process,

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:42.630
allowing me to defend
myself, to clear my name,

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:46.980
if I have enough money
and if I have enough will.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:52.800
At least we have the system
that allows us to do this.

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:58.320
But you are right, that
nobody should be naive,

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.640
thinking that there is no
problem in this country.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.130
This country is a great country.

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:08.430
We all love this country
that attracted people

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:11.350
from all around the world
to come to this country.

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:15.660
But this country also
have its problems.

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:19.290
But this country has
a democratic process

00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:23.730
for all of us to get involved
so that we can change it

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:24.850
for the better.

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:30.010
That's why I'm talking,
telling people my story.

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:35.450
I hope I can encourage
people to become more active,

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:40.930
to, you know, take part
in the democratic process

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.520
and speak up.

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:48.860
Because we see racial
profiling happening and we

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:56.600
have to unite to make our
voice against racial profiling

00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:00.580
loud and clear so
that politicians,

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:05.840
the people with decision
power, will take that

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.420
into their
consideration when they

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.370
are making their decisions.

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:16.850
So I hope that answer what
I'm thinking about this issue.

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:18.500
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.480
AUDIENCE: My question
was, you seemed

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:22.640
to be at the peak
of your career,

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:27.062
about to be named the chairman
of the physics department.

00:47:27.062 --> 00:47:28.520
Maybe you can tell
us a little more

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.890
about what the
impact of all this

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:33.640
has had on your
professional career.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:36.230
And also you mentioned
a lot about Joyce

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:38.180
and the rest of your
family, maybe the impact

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:40.240
it's had on them.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.840
XIAOXING XI: Well,
this obviously

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:46.310
had a very significant
impact, the negative impact,

00:47:46.310 --> 00:47:47.930
on my career and my family.

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:57.350
As you said, I was really
at the peak of my career.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:48:01.860
And I was working
24/7 on my research,

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:04.820
or on my administrative
job, and so on and so forth.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:05.980
And then this happened.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.010
And now, not only that I could
not do my research and my work

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:15.255
in that four months, but
the effect continues.

00:48:15.255 --> 00:48:16.800
The effect continues.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:20.400
And it's not going
go away very quickly.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:25.400
So my reputation is tainted now.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:32.890
And there are a lot of
opportunities that I would get

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:35.920
otherwise, I cannot
get it anymore.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.810
And I was-- somebody was
asking me a similar question.

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:42.880
I was telling people that there
are, for example, workshops

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.820
of US-China
collaboration, cooperation

00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:46.910
on superconductivity.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:51.210
The organizers
would not invite me.

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.200
And if I am thinking
about advancing

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.690
in administrative roles,
well, I can forget about it.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:02.110
Who would give these
kind of opportunities

00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:05.710
to somebody who has
gone through like that,

00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:08.610
and they're charged
by the government?

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:13.710
So my research group
is now a tiny portion

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:18.830
of the group I had
before my arrest.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:26.380
And you know, I was concerned
that what I'm doing every day

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:29.590
could be misconstrued
by the government

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:34.550
for some evil purposes.

00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:40.060
And I am even scared when
I'm signing my names on forms

00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:42.770
that we need to do
for getting funding

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:46.210
and manage my
research or products.

00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:51.940
So this kind of
effect on my career,

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.710
it's not going to go away.

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:59.390
And it's very, very negative.

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:02.960
In terms of the family,
obviously we went through this.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:07.730
And my family, my wife, my
children, went through all this

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:08.930
for no reason--

00:50:08.930 --> 00:50:09.710
for no reason.

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:13.970
That was the toughest
thing for me,

00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:18.250
to see them suffer
because of me.

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:23.750
And well, Joyce was
a chemistry major

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:27.210
and now she's working in the
civil rights organization

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:30.150
and trying to raise awareness
of people off the injustice

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:32.680
that immigrants face.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:35.360
This changed her life.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:40.310
And our Sarah was trying
to go about her life

00:50:40.310 --> 00:50:41.510
like nothing happened.

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:45.230
But we worry about
the long term effect.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:46.910
And we know that it hurt.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.560
You know, she was hurt.

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:51.490
She was scared.

00:50:51.490 --> 00:50:54.970
AUDIENCE: Before your arrest
was, there any sign at all

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:57.580
that something bad
could happen to you?

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.940
Or was this just
pure surveillance

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:05.110
that going in the background
that you never knew?

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:07.210
XIAOXING XI: There was no sign.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:10.450
The very first thought
that I opened the door,

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:12.720
see all these people there--

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.290
what's that?

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:14.540
This must be a mistake, right?

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:16.770
They must mix up people's name?

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:17.370
Why me?

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:21.060
I have not done
anything remarkable.

00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.590
All these people--

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:24.986
I was still thinking
a lot of things

00:51:24.986 --> 00:51:27.510
in the hat of a
department chair.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.310
I was thinking,
all these people.

00:51:29.310 --> 00:51:32.940
That must cost
government, the taxpayer,

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:35.550
tons of money for them to
have all these people come

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:36.990
to arrest me.

00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.490
For what?

00:51:39.490 --> 00:51:46.230
And so I was just like anybody.

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:49.680
I read news about some Chinese
got arrested and charged

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:50.850
and so on and so forth.

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:55.470
I never thought that
it will happen to me.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:59.260
And I think a lot of people
are still thinking that way.

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:00.720
So that's why I'm
telling people.

00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.900
I'm telling the details
about why they charged me,

00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:07.770
what are the exact things that
I did and so on and so forth,

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:10.380
because I want
people to understand.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:14.850
You don't have to
do anything wrong.

00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:18.570
Just because maybe you
have a relative in China,

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:21.000
you talk to them over the phone.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.500
Or maybe, you know,
you talk to somebody

00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:31.270
which they are monitoring,
that can get you in trouble.

00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:32.370
So it's very scary.

00:52:32.370 --> 00:52:34.650
I have to say that.

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:37.230
But how do we change that?

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:38.490
This is going to happen.

00:52:38.490 --> 00:52:41.850
The only way we can
change that is, we all

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:46.680
unite together and speak up.

00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:53.340
And to make ourself a big
voice that the politicians have

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:55.500
to worry about.

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:59.410
They have to care about
our interests and so on.

00:52:59.410 --> 00:53:01.830
That's what the
democracy is all about.

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:04.100
So that's why I'm talking.

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:07.890
Every time I talk to people,
I reach a certain number

00:53:07.890 --> 00:53:09.670
of people.

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:13.130
And I'm doing this
because I recognize,

00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:15.390
we just have to let
more and more and more

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:20.020
people be aware
of such injustice.

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:22.680
And everybody united
again, not just

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.020
Chinese American,
Asian American,

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:29.370
but African American,
Muslim American.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:33.390
All the people will suffer
from this kind of injustice.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:36.990
And uniting together,
and change it.

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:42.130
And only then when
the law enforcement

00:53:42.130 --> 00:53:44.155
want to do something,
they have to be--

00:53:44.155 --> 00:53:47.050
at least there shouldn't
be a policy like,

00:53:47.050 --> 00:53:50.860
go after a particular
group of Americans.

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:53.700
AUDIENCE: OK, well thank
you again Professor Xi.

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.960
I really appreciate you
fighting against injustice,

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:02.170
relating this to racial
injustice across America.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:04.560
Are there things that-- you
know, hearing your story

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:05.060
is great.

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:07.990
It makes us feel more angry
and wanting to do something.

00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:10.000
So how can we learn more?

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.152
How can we find how
to help you and help

00:54:13.152 --> 00:54:14.110
what you're working on?

00:54:16.045 --> 00:54:17.420
XIAOXING XI: As
a matter of fact,

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:21.790
there are organizations
like the Coalition

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:25.780
to End the National
Security Scapegoating,

00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:32.920
and many other Asian
American and you

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.530
know, the civil
rights organizations

00:54:35.530 --> 00:54:39.280
from other minority groups.

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:45.550
I think what people can do is
to at least pay attention to it.

00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:51.655
Probably go to
the event and then

00:54:51.655 --> 00:54:55.550
once there are more and
more people are doing this,

00:54:55.550 --> 00:55:00.850
then it becomes something
that can have an influence.

00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:05.290
One thing I have to say
is that in my ordeal,

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:10.810
the several members of the
US Congress who are Asian

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:14.950
Americans have been
very, very supportive,

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:23.110
and asked the attorney general,
and asked the director of FBI,

00:55:23.110 --> 00:55:29.890
whether racial profiling was
a factor in all these cases.

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:34.750
And we need more
people in that position

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:40.300
to ask these questions
so that our interest can

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.870
be taken care of.

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:46.180
So vote.

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:49.460
Whenever you know, go vote.

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:50.820
It doesn't matter.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:54.560
You'll vote for a Democrat or
you'll vote for a Republican.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:59.090
It doesn't matter, as
long as we all go vote.

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:02.740
Then politicians have
to take us seriously.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:03.590
Thank you.

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:04.840
Thank you for the opportunity.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.340
Thank you.

00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.290
[APPLAUSE]
