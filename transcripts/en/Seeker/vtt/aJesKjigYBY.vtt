00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.089
Advanced body armor, drones, cyborgs. CYBORGS.
Is this the future of the police?

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:10.620
[MUSIC]

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.620
This is Trace for DNews! Robocop is out in
theaters, promising action and a crazy cool

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.970
reimagining of the 1980s robotic future film.
The old film had a lot of social commentary,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.560
and represented the fear of turning over our
safety to the dominion of robots. 30 years

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.210
later, with robotics permeating more of our
society than ever, the concern is still real,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.800
and far closer to the surface. ... I mean,
we may not be ready to put a man's head into

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.329
a machine body, but we got a chance to talk
to the cast of the new Robocop to ask them

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.969
why the idea of a robotic human hybrid is
so compelling.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:47.219
It can just take us to a place where we have
to be careful of the consequences. There's

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.000
an interesting emotional aspect of this [film]
that's also a moral dilemma: when do you stop

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.300
being a human being and when are you a machine?

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.770
I'm not talking about singularity, but in
the case of Robocop, he's amputated from his

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.770
throat down. The rest of his body is mechanic
and he also has artificial intelligence implants

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.899
in his brain that control some of his decision
making.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.709
We have to be careful of the consequences.

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:17.709
I just think the idea of the combination of man and machine
is quite the delicious cocktail.

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:25.579
The best free roaming humanoid robot we've
got now, according to the DARPA Robotics Challenge,

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.719
is SCHAFT. The Japanese robot isn't as sexy
as RoboCop, but it's designed to help with

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.599
nuclear disasters, not to look good while
battling on camera. SCHAFT doesn't inspire

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:41.219
quite as much fear. It can drive a car, navigate
rough terrain, remove debris, open doors,

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.959
cut holes in walls and manage a number of
other dexterous tasks like hooking up hoses

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.999
and turning valves -- all extremely valuable
in disaster scenarios, but not exactly the

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:52.719
scariest things in the world. And SCHAFT is
nowhere near to being the robot-human hybrid

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:53.785
that Robocop is.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:57.429
The new film deals with drone warfare, too.
In the year 2028, Robocop is created by the

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.959
multinational conglomerate "Omnicorp" as a
way to circumvent a new law prohibiting drones

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:03.809
from bearing firearms.

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:08.670
As of today, private unmanned aerial vehicles
that fly above 400 feet are still prohibited

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.890
by the FAA, though there's a mandate for American
airspace wide open to drones by September

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.200
30, 2015. So far, filmmakers, border-patrol
and police have made some basic use of domestic

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.640
drones, but at the moment they're still expensive
and hard to find here at home. The U.S. military,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.439
though, they've deployed 11,000 drones since
2002, and 50 countries have their own drone

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.620
programs -- including China, Israel, and Iran.
We might be looking at a future without humans

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.819
at the control stick.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.900
Luckily for us, RoboCop is still safely in
the realm of science-fiction, but the technology

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.250
is on the horizon. Drones can already fly,
drive, run and navigate disaster area -- but

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.750
are we REALLY that far off from a military
robot soldier? Would we be somehow LESS afraid

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.019
of cyborgs than straight-up robots?

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:03.019
There's always going to be a man behind the
machine behind the machine behind the machines...

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.859
There's never going to be a finger that's
pointed nowhere.

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:12.140
As technology advances and predictions of
the merging of man and machine looms, our

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.569
laws, police, and citizenry are going to be
rushing to keep up with the advance...

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.730
If something like RoboCop really existed and
you came across him, how would you feel?

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.730
It's freaky to me. As Gary, I'd be very weary.
I'd be a little unnerved by it.

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.689
What do you think? Is a human-robot hybrid
the future? Or pure drone warfare like in

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.280
other movies and science fiction? Release
your paranoia in the comments, thanks for
