00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.710
- [Instructor] Let's
dig a little bit deeper

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.500
into what happens in
perfectly competitive markets

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.580
in the long run.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.310
So what we have on the left-hand side,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.330
and we've seen this
multiple times already,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.640
is our supply and our demand curves

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.140
for our perfectly competitive market,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.130
and you can see the equilibrium
price right over here,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.660
marked with this a dotted line,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.910
and as we've talked
about in multiple videos,

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.690
the firms in that perfectly
competitive market,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.490
the perfectly competitive firms,

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.610
they just have to price takers,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.660
so the market price is going

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330
to be their marginal revenue curve.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.960
It's gonna be this horizontal curve.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.960
And it would be rational for
them to produce the quantity.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.210
So they're not going to set the price,

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.370
but they can choose what
quantity to produce,

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.250
but it would be rational
for them to keep producing

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.710
while the marginal revenue is
higher than the marginal cost

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.730
up to including when the marginal revenue

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.870
is equal to the marginal cost.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.520
So for this firm at this
current state of affairs,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.130
it would be rational for them

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.590
to produce this quantity right over there.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.350
And as we've talked about in other videos,

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.870
at that quantity, they're going
to make an economic profit.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.530
And the way that we can see that

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.430
is at this quantity, this
is the average total cost,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.990
that is your marginal revenue,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.990
and so you are going to
get this much per unit

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.880
and then you multiply,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.220
so the height is how much you get per unit

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.170
and then you multiply that
times the number of units,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.110
so the area of this rectangle

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.900
is that positive economic
profit that this firm will have.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.160
Now, that's in the short run,
but now let's think about

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.640
what will likely happen in the long run.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.210
If folks see other folks making
a positive economic profit,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.860
remember, economic profit
doesn't just account

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.110
for regular cost, it also
includes opportunity cost,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.670
so a lot of you will say hey,
I would wanna put my resources

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.880
into this market so that I can make

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.580
that positive economic profit as well.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.560
But what's gonna happen

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.100
as you have entrance into this market?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.940
Well, that's gonna shift the
supply curve to the right.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.400
At any given price, you're
gonna have more supplies,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.560
one way to think about it.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.070
So that's a supply curve.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.030
Let's just call that one.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.210
Now, you're gonna have more entrance.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.973
More entrance.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.490
And what's going to happen?

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.660
Well, you might get to
something like you might get

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.320
to a situation like this.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.080
Let me see if I can draw it well.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.950
You might get to a situation like this

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.250
where you have more entrance

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.620
and you got the supply curve two.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.730
Now, what's going to be the quantity

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.470
that firm A produces in that one?

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.130
Remember, firm A is one of many firms.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.050
Well, in this situation, we
have a new equilibrium price.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.620
So if this was P sub one,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.920
now we have this new
equilibrium price, P sub two,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.630
which is going to define a
new marginal revenue curve

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.620
for all of the players in this
perfectly competitive market

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.630
and so the new marginal revenue curve

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.183
is gonna be right over there.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.390
Now, in this situation, what
is the rational quantity

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.090
for firm A to produce?

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.370
Well, once again, as
long as marginal revenue

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.360
is higher than marginal cost,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.490
it makes sense for them to
produce more and more and more,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.020
up until the point that they are equal.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.020
So now, firm A would want to produce less

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.320
because the market price that
it just has to take is less.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.987
But notice what happens
as more and more entrants

00:03:29.987 --> 00:03:31.670
got into the market.

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.850
The market price, which also defines

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.830
this horizontal marginal revenue
curve, went lower and lower

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.230
to the point where firm
A now in this situation

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.980
is making no economic profit.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.350
At this point, where not
only as marginal revenue

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.030
intersecting marginal cost,

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.330
but that's exactly the point

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.070
in which marginal cost is
equaling average total cost.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.880
So one way to think about it is

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.440
in a perfectly competitive firm,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.650
they're productively efficient.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.040
They are producing the quantity

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.320
that minimizes their average total cost.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.640
We've already talked about that point

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.140
where marginal cost and
average total cost intersect.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.300
That's gonna be the minimum
point for average total cost.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.450
And why is that?

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.300
Well, while marginal cost
is below average total cost,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.560
average total cost is gonna
get lower and lower and lower,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.900
and then once marginal cost gets higher

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.230
than average total cost,

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.710
well, then the average total cost curve

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.670
will starting going curving up.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.920
So we just saw a situation

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.710
that even where we see economic
profit in the short run,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.240
in the long run, entrants are
going to go into that market

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.880
and it's going to reduce the
economic profit down to zero

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.240
and at that point, the firm
that has a zero economic profit,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.230
they're productively efficient.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.340
They are producing at the minimum point

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.090
of the average total cost curve.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.840
And we've already talked before

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.980
that this equilibrium point
right over here in our market,

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.260
because our demand and supply curves,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.710
the intersection point defines the price,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.740
our equilibrium price and quantities,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.450
we're also allocatably efficient.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.710
We've talked about things like
dead weight lost in the past.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.640
That is not happening right over here.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.530
Our marginal benefit is
equal to our marginal cost

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.620
right at that equilibrium
price and quantity.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.780
Now, some of you might be saying, well,

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.050
what about the other situation?

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.450
What about if for some
reason we were in a,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.830
let's call the supply curve here.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.390
Let's say people overshot.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.620
Too many people joined into this market.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.660
So let's say we went
to supply curve three,

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.640
well what's going to happen?

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.550
Let me label this.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.470
This is right over here, this
is marginal revenue curve one,

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.010
which is equal to price one.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.360
This is marginal revenue curve two,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.960
which is equal to price two.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.590
And then this would define,
so this right over here

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.740
would be price three, price three,

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.530
which would define marginal
revenue curve three.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.470
So marginal revenue curve three,

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.290
which is equal to price three.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.990
Well if too many entrants
joined into that market,

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.180
now firm A has a more difficult scenario.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.130
They are, would produce at this quantity,

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.010
we've talked about many times already,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.010
but at that quantity, each
unit their average total cost

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.520
is higher than that
revenue they're getting.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.820
So they're going to be
running at an economic loss

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.320
in the short run.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.000
But what would happen in the long run?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.200
Well firm A in the long run
would probably exit the market

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.620
and other firms who are
running at economic loss

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.000
would exit the market,
and so that would shift

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.490
the supply curve back to the left.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.370
And so we would eventually
get, once again,

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.040
to that reality where firms
have no economic profit

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.210
in there and we have a market
that is allocatably efficient,

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.620
no dead weight loss,
and firms are producing

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.260
at the minimum point of their
average total cost curve,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.370
which is known as productive efficiency

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.993
or productively efficient.
