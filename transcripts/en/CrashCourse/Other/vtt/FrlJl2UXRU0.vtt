Hi, my name is John Green.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.961
I'm the host of the new show Crash Course,
well co-host I guess with my brother Hank.

00:00:04.961 --> 00:00:05.961
I'll be teaching you world history.

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:07.939
Hank will be teaching you biology.

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.200
But, there are currently no videos on this
channel.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.620
Our goal is make Crash Course the most fun
you have ever had learning, so subscribe now,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.530
even though there are currently no videos:
there will be, I promise in January.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.700
And then you will get to find out what's hiding
in the secret compartment of my fake fireplace.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.700
Best wishes.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.470
I don't want to brag, but I could be a contestant
on The Price is Right.
