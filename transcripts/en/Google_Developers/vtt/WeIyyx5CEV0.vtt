PETE LEPAGE: Hey everybody, and
welcome to another edition

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.020
of Chrome Apps Office Hours.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.640
We've got a special Chrome Apps
Office Hours-- that's a

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.780
mouthful to say, always--

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.920
today, where we've brought in
two special guests, the

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.310
developers behind
the Reditr app.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.190
So guys, let me bring you
up and say welcome.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.586
Thanks for joining us.

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:36.480
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Thanks for
introducing us, there.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.490
And, yeah, as you said,
we developed

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.940
an app called Reditr.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.730
It's a really cool app, we
think, and it lets you

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.380
basically browse Reddit on
your desktop in a neat

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.970
column-based design, as
you can see here.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.250
So Dimitry, do you want
to explain maybe a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.340
bit about the app?

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.520
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well,
basically what's nice about

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.840
the columns is that it serves
as a feed of all the data--

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.390
like any custom feed that
you want from Reddit.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.230
So you could have like a custom
search feed, multiple

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.890
subreddit feed, and if you have
it sorted by new, it'll

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.720
pull in new posts over
an interval.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.920
And it'll be a live experience
of Reddit.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.880
PETE LEPAGE: Very cool.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.680
And so this is something that
you guys have been working on

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.410
for quite a while,
haven't you?

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.290
Or how long have you guys
been working on this?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.200
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV:
Since October--

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.010
well, we released October
of last year, so yeah.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.220
We've been working a little
bit over a year now.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.320
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.850
So this is something that
you guys have built.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.720
Did it start off as a
Chrome packaged app?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.270
Or where did you
start with it?

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.176
Where were you doing it
in the very beginning?

00:03:48.176 --> 00:03:50.860
DAVID ZORYCHTA: It's kind of a
funny story, actually, because

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.350
Dimitry and I came home from
school one day, and Dimitry

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.970
said, I'm bored.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.290
I want to make a really
cool Reddit client.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.920
Then I said, oh, cool,
good luck with that.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.710
And then Dimitry started
looking into

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.466
developing in Qt--

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:04.020
C++ using the Qt framework.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.900
And I frowned at Dimitry and
said, well, why do it in Qt

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.840
when you have this beautiful
HTML5 to design this rich

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.010
experience in?

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.365
So probably for the next month
after we decided we'd do it in

00:04:14.365 --> 00:04:18.450
HTML5, we were looking for like
a way to publish our app.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.470
I said, you know, we don't want
to make a boring website.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.360
We want to make a full
desktop app.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.810
So we were looking at maybe
XULRunner with Firefox, and

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.020
Appcelerator had a really
cool way to publish

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.830
desktop apps in HTML5.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.740
But we stumbled upon the Chrome
App Store, and we

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.740
really fell in love with that
just because of the rich API

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.417
they give us, and it's just so
easy to make an app using the

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:41.700
Chrome API.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.920
PETE LEPAGE: So that was about a
year or so ago, and that was

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.710
with the sort of v1 Chrome
packaged apps

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.020
that you did this.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.675
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Yeah.

00:04:49.675 --> 00:04:52.560
PETE LEPAGE: So what did you
like about the Chrome Packaged

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.210
App platform at the time that
sort of said, OK, yeah this is

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.640
definitely where we want
to go with this?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.065
What were some of
the key things?

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.110
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well, first
of all, it just felt

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.395
really easy to distribute
through the Chrome Web Store,

00:05:10.395 --> 00:05:13.390
plus it was kind of new.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.435
It was nice to be like one of
the early, I guess-- maybe a

00:05:17.435 --> 00:05:18.810
year isn't too early,
but still.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.730
DAVID ZORYCHTA: We're just two
guys, and we don't have any

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.440
marketing experience at all.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.530
We're first-year university
students, so we had no way of

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.850
going up to all these people
and saying, here

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:32.980
guys, here's our app.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.380
We hope you enjoy it.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.840
So the Chrome Store, that really
eliminated that problem

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.540
for us, because we just
put the app right

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.380
on the Chrome store.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.190
And then instantly whoever
searches Reddit on the store,

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.970
they'll see Reditr, and they'll
get it that way.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.780
So it sort of levels the playing
field in that sense,

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.420
because big companies who
publish apps onto the store,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.570
they have the chance of people
finding their apps as just two

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.545
kids have of people finding
our own app.

00:05:55.545 --> 00:05:57.710
So that's what we were
really excited about

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.730
with the Chrome Store.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.330
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.300
So as we're going
through today--

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.060
I just put a link up on screen,
but for those of you

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.290
who are watching at home live,
if you have questions, feel

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.100
free to post your questions to
our Google Moderator queue.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:17.250
The URL is just there
at goo.gl/knzHf.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.170
And that H is a capital.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.140
And so a shout out to you guys,
because you guys are in

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.830
school right now.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.410
And you're in school out in
the Maritimes, right?

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.950
In Canada?

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:28.320
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Yep.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.960
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.200
Very nice.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.460
What school are you guys at?

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.730
DAVID ZORYCHTA: I'm going
to Dalhousie.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.490
I'm getting a computer
science degree.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.860
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.830
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: I'm going
to Saint Mary's University.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.210
I'm taking a mathematics
and finance degree.

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:42.520
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.650
Very nice.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.060
So interesting--

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.200
mathematics and finance, and
you're doing computer science?

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.551
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Yeah.

00:06:50.551 --> 00:06:53.630
At first it started off as a
hobby, but then it kind of

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.430
grew on me.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:57.400
PETE LEPAGE: That works.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.580
Awesome.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:04.690
So as you guys started working
on the v1, and, I guess,

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.120
working on your app today, what
kind of libraries and

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.510
frameworks were you using
to get the great

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.230
app that you have?

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.800
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So in terms of
the third-party libraries

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.020
we're using that we absolutely
depend on every day, the

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.570
answer's going to be jQuery,
just like pretty

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.000
much everyone else.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.510
And it just makes everything
so simple.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.090
And we wrote our own library
for interfacing with the

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.620
Reddit API, just because not a
really good JavaScript one had

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.840
existed before.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.900
So we're heavily dependent on
jQuery and then our own little

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.290
library for that.

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.170
Other than those two libraries,
I don't really

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.130
think we utilized many more,
with the exception of, of

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.195
course, the Chrome APIs that are
offered to us within the

00:07:47.195 --> 00:07:48.930
Chrome extension.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:49.580
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.430
So did you guys do the design
work for the experience all

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.040
from scratch on your own?

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.160
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: In earlier
versions of the app,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.320
everything was our own, but over
time we had people giving

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.010
suggestions and everything like
that, so we've used a lot

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.996
of help from the Reddit
community and everyone who's

00:08:08.996 --> 00:08:10.380
been using the app.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:10.600
PETE LEPAGE: Wow.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600
That's pretty fantastic.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.880
It's really a beautiful app, and
it's got a really app-like

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.840
experience, which
is nice to see.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.900
A lot of people who build Chrome
packaged apps still

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.360
think about apps as sort of
websites, and the experience

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.570
is kind of still websitey.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.970
But the point of a Chrome
packaged app is that it's not.

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.450
It's an installed application
that you use on your desktop

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.460
computer or your laptop or
wherever that just works and

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.840
feels appy.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.360
And trying to define that appy
experience is sometimes a

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.140
little bit tough.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.460
When you guys were working
through that app-like

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.040
experience, what were some of
the things that you were

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.230
thinking about for creating an
experience and a UI that

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.340
looked and felt like an app?

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.910
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So one thing
that we hope users notice

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.220
right off the bat is that this
is something called a

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.380
frameless app.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.860
And it doesn't have the
traditional bar along the top

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.110
with the close buttons
and whatnot.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.610
We actually built our own close,
minimize, and maximize

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.270
buttons in JavaScript, and we
built it such that we wanted

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.340
to mimic the operating system
that the app's installed on.

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:27.100
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, interesting.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:30.250
So do you change for the
different operating systems?

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:30.500
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Yeah.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.130
That's correct.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:31.820
We do.

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.960
So if you'll notice here, you
see the Mac UI up in the top

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.070
left, and that's just
like the standard

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.310
Mountain Lion window controls.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.365
But if you were to install this
on Windows or Linux, then

00:09:42.365 --> 00:09:46.270
you'd see a completely different
experience in terms

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.780
of the window controls.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.480
And that's something we do in
JavaScript, and we couldn't

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.840
actually do that without
Chrome and the Chrome

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.860
Extension v2 packaged app, so.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:56.500
PETE LEPAGE: Oh, really?

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.072
Cool.

00:09:58.072 --> 00:10:00.740
Very nice.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.070
You guys have been--

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.780
I guess for about maybe three
weeks or so now-- working on

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.000
bringing this app to
a v2 packaged app.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.170
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Yeah.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.960
PETE LEPAGE: What has been
your experience on

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.480
doing that so far?

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.280
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well, so
far, after we solved the

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.950
cross-domain issues,
it's actually been

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:20.200
going pretty smoothly.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.970
The main issue was just
cross-domain.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:27.230
As soon as we got past
cross-domain, everything was

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.081
just smooth as butter,
transferring it over.

00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:32.570
PETE LEPAGE: So let's talk
about that a little bit.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.530
So one of the things we first
started, when we had our first

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.760
conversation that we talked a
little bit about is you guys

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.350
had looked at this, and
you had hit like

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.020
four sort of big problems.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.890
And content security policy and
cross-domain was sort of

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.560
the first one to mind.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:55.520
What was the problem there and
how did you end up solving it?

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.690
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well, the
problem was with Chrome v2

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.520
packaged apps, it didn't let
you, for example, set an SRC

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.800
tag on an image that went
to an external--

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.500
to a different website, and with
Reddit, where links are

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.420
shared everywhere.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.760
And if you want to embed an
image into the app, you can't

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:17.440
just link it to the
other website.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:22.450
So what we did is any time an
image tag comes up on the app,

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.940
we just add a little attribute
to it, and then with an

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.630
interval, we search through the
DOM for every image tag

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:36.470
that has that attribute, and
then we download it--

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.000
DAVID ZORYCHTA: In
the background.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.120
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: In the
background, yeah, and then we

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.000
get the blob and then
stick it as an SRC

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.810
tag, and then it works.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.380
PETE LEPAGE: OK, so you're
effectively sort of grabbing

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.790
those images.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.760
Now, are you saving them to
disk, or are you just keeping

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.820
them in memory, or what are you
doing with them once you

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.660
get them from the server?

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.480
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: I believe
they're just stored in memory.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.860
I don't believe that
they get cached.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.010
I'm not 100% certain on that.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.730
DAVID ZORYCHTA: At the moment,
I can tell you here--

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:08.780
it's funny, because it sounds
like it's this big complicated

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.570
procedure, but, in fact, it's
about 10, 11 lines of code.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:12.630
So it's actually not--

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:12.700
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Yeah.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.900
It wasn't like hours of work.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:22.420
It was just checking if we're
in a Chrome v2 packaged app,

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.940
and then just changing a
couple lines of code.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.150
It wasn't that difficult.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.010
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.170
So content security policy is
sort of one of those ones a

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.550
lot of developers run into on
their first try when they

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.000
convert an app.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.920
And it's really about because
these apps have access to APIs

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:48.330
and hardware that the drive-by
web really doesn't normally

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:51.680
have access to, it's really
important to make sure that

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.190
users are well-protected here.

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:56.180
And that's why we implement
these rules, so that you can't

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:59.930
go and grab source from
someplace else and start

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:00.710
injecting it.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.620
You can't accidentally have
somebody do a cross-site

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.030
scripting attack, where they're
grabbing their source

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.870
and inserting it
into your app.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.970
But it does mean that there's
a little bit more fun.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.520
Now, one of the things that I
shared with you guys early on

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.430
was the Chrome Asset Loader.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.070
Did you end up using that or did
you end up doing your own

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.000
thing after seeing that
and going, oh, OK.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.030
We see what's going on.

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.360
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: We saw what
it was doing, and we just

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.730
implemented just a slightly
simpler version.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.450
And then that's about it.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.560
We just [? call ?] one function
every time you see an

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.070
image, and that's about it.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.010
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:39.120
Interesting.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.010
So what were some of the other
challenges that you guys faced

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.730
as you were working through
porting the app over?

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.210
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So the other
biggest challenge that we

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.905
faced was the accessibility
of cookies.

00:13:51.905 --> 00:13:55.020
So you can't, through
JavaScript, access

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.885
document.cookie.

00:13:55.885 --> 00:13:57.420
It just doesn't let you.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:00.260
And that's kind of unfortunate,
because Reddit--

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:01.140
the API--

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:02.920
it's dependent on cookies.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.690
So we had to build a little
bit of a work-around--

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.090
like around logging into Reddit
and authenticating with

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.540
Reddit, because we didn't have
access to setting cookies, for

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.540
example, or even reading
cookies.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.430
But that didn't take that long
to fix that issue, either--

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.210
probably only about an hour.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:22.360
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: First we
went to OAuth, thinking that

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.090
we couldn't fix it, but then--

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:26.710
DAVID ZORYCHTA: But we sent you
guys an email, actually,

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.510
and you came back to us and
had a brilliant solution.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.640
We implemented that.

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.180
So it was pretty straightforward
after we got

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:33.250
your email.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:33.630
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.220
So what was that--

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:37.280
so you were using the OAuth
implementation.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.130
And when you were using that
one, were you using the

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.600
Identity API?

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.630
DAVID ZORYCHTA: No.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:48.590
Actually we had written an OAuth
implementation earlier

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.950
on for another project, so
since we just needed to

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.720
implement this for testing
reasons, we used that.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.670
But I think actually in V2
packaged apps, there's an

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.720
API-to-Interface OAuth
directly, right?

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.180
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.083
There is.

00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:03.070
And it's a relatively new API.

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.980
It's still an experimental API,
so if you use it today,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.810
you can't upload your app to
the Chrome Web Store yet.

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:16.480
That should come out of
experimental within the next

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.470
release or two.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:21.050
My guess is in the next release,
not the one that's

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:23.620
coming up in a couple
of weeks, but the

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:25.650
release after that.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:29.520
And that will allow you to
authenticate against any

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.250
authentication provider,
whether they're

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.210
using OAuth or whatever.

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:37.190
They could be using their
own sort of magic there.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.690
And then there's a second API
that lets you authenticate

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.090
against the Google APIs.

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.210
So for developers who want to
go and authenticate up to a

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.480
Google service.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.260
Say, for example, you want to
store stuff on the user's

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:53.205
Google Drive, or you want to
go and just figure out who

00:15:53.205 --> 00:15:57.310
this user is, you can use
that particular API.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:16:01.690
So what was the solution you
guys ended up using, then?

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.410
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So what we
figured out was even though we

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.020
couldn't like pragmatically
access cookies, they're

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:07.660
actually being set anyway.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.260
So we actually figured out that
we can make a request to

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.090
Reddit and then let them
handle all the

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:13.570
cookie mess for us.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.400
We didn't have to set any
cookies ourselves.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.550
And then it just sort of
erased the problem.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.350
We were really lucky that they
actually did that for us.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.860
PETE LEPAGE: Nice.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:27.970
Now when you talk to Reddit,
how are you doing that?

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.150
Because to do that cross-domain
request gets a

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.130
little bit interesting.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.310
Are you doing it with a sandbox
iframe, are you doing

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:37.790
it with a WebView?

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.920
What's your communication
process look like between your

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.920
app and the Reddit API?

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.150
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So every get
request is actually just a

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.140
normal AJAX request, and
I believe every post

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:51.320
request is, as well.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.850
They are cross-domain requests,
and we just

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:59.310
implement the necessary
restriction removal within the

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.830
security policy.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.650
So, for example, every time we
need to access a website URL

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:09.540
on reddit.com, within the
content security policy that

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.300
our app uses, it has reddit.com
within that.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.619
So it knows that we as
the developers--

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:19.650
we know it's safe to access
reddit.com, therefore it's

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.970
safe for the users to
access reddit.com.

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.440
So it started with the CSP.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.670
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:29.570
Now let's talk about some of the
enhancements you guys were

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.370
able to add because of some of
the new features with Chrome

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:35.350
packaged apps with
the v2 stuff.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:37.580
Was there anything that you were
able to take advantage of

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.260
there to enhance
the experience?

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.350
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Definitely
there was.

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.950
For one, as I mentioned before,
the frameless app.

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:49.600
So you don't have this bar along
the top of your screen

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.230
for the app.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:53.550
It's just built right into the
window itself, so this just

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:56.570
feels so native because you have
the window controls built

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.750
right into the actual WebView.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.275
So that's definitely one of
the coolest things that we

00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:02.350
were able to do.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.690
And then the second thing is
the fact that you could

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:07.620
actually use Chrome Storage
to store user data.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.450
Now, we haven't implemented the

00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:11.200
syncing yet through Chrome.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.950
Right now we actually run
off a shared web host.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.890
And as we get more and more
users, it takes longer and

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.000
longer to sync.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.910
But thanks to Google, we'll
just be able to sync

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.020
everything through Google and
just eliminate the necessity

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.360
of having to juggle syncing
by ourselves.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.480
So that's going to be the
coolest thing we do.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.730
PETE LEPAGE: Now, do you guys
have a syncing service running

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:35.730
somewhere that you guys
maintain today?

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.700
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Yes.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.560
We actually use justhost for
that-- it's just a shared web

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.150
host, because we can't afford
anything really that big.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.490
PETE LEPAGE: So that's
that a huge advantage

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.830
I guess, for users.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:54.900
And being able to store stuff
just between machines and

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.450
sessions so that if I'm signed
in on one computer--

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.370
hey, here's all my stuff.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.070
I go to another computer.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.410
All of that stuff is
synced across.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.860
Now, do you plan to use
both the local storage

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.930
and the sync storage?

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.420
Or are you just going
to end up using

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.670
sync storage primarily?

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:21.430
DAVID ZORYCHTA: We'll probably
make it so that like only the

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:23.990
essential elements are
synced so that

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.470
we're not like clogging--

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.160
putting a lot of clutter
into the cloud.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.130
We'll probably take advantage of
both local and sync storage

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:32.370
combinations.

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:32.930
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.970
One thing to keep in mind is
that there is a limit to the

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.340
amount of stuff that you can
put into the sync storage.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:45.600
So I think it's something
around 512 items or 1024

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.780
items, and each one can be a
maximum of 4K or something to

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.030
that extent.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:56.180
So you can't put the entire
world into it, but you can put

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.530
a fair amount of stuff.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.290
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Yeah--

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:02.420
a reasonable amount for a
Reddit client like ours.

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:03.190
PETE LEPAGE: Exactly.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.400
Exactly.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.410
Cool.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.250
And then as well with the
frameless stuff, what did you

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.760
have to change to get it to be
frameless so that it didn't

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:18.430
have the native bar
across the top?

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.700
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So at first when
we set out to do this, we

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.470
had no clue what
we were doing.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:27.930
But actually we just a quick
Google search on Chrome 2 v2

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:31.410
frameless app, and Google
actually has like 100

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.980
different projects
and all their

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:34.680
source visible on GitHub.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.440
So one of them happened
to be a frameless app.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:37.800
PETE LEPAGE: Perfect.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.870
DAVID ZORYCHTA: So we
just went ahead.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:40.350
We downloaded that.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.550
And to actually drag
around the app--

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.560
that's kind of fishy
right now.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:45.860
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: I
don't think you can

00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.050
see it on the screen.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.550
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Oh, right.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.260
Well, you can just click and
drag the app, and, of course,

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.020
that's something you need to
implement as a developer

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.480
yourself, because you don't have
the Chrome around the app

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.490
to do that.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.030
So it's one line of CSS.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.680
And just looking at the source
that Google provided, we found

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.212
that out in about
five minutes.

00:21:02.212 --> 00:21:03.060
PETE LEPAGE: That's
pretty great.

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:07.050
So what were some of
the resources?

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.660
You mentioned the GitHub
repository.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.620
But what are some of the other
resources that you found

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:16.080
helpful in building
your Chrome app?

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.230
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Stack
Overflow, for sure--

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.890
a lot of hours spent there
just in general.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.070
Other than that, the Google
documentation's actually

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.370
pretty good for v2 Packaged.

00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:29.320
And, as I said, like the 100
different projects that you

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.530
guys offer--

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:31.180
all the source code.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.370
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: That
was a lot of help.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.458
DAVID ZORYCHTA: A lot of help.

00:21:34.458 --> 00:21:35.310
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:38.480
So what are some of the things
that you guys are thinking

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.010
about adding to this as a Chrome
Packaged App or just in

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.800
general feature-wise
in the future?

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.180
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well,
we want to see if we can

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:53.430
implement like an offline kind
of feature, where it'll cache

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.100
like maybe the first maybe
two, three pages of each

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.520
column, and if you remember
something that you wanted to

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.340
show your friends or something,
you don't have to

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.040
connect to the internet and
redownload everything.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.520
PETE LEPAGE: That's cool.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.130
What APIs are you thinking about
will be useful for that?

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:11.640
How are you thinking about
implementing that?

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:16.810
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: We haven't
really looked enough into it

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:20.695
to know exactly what we
want to use, but we'll

00:22:20.695 --> 00:22:22.335
have to take a look.

00:22:22.335 --> 00:22:23.390
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.020
Just off the top of my head,
there's a couple I think that

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.480
will be interesting.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:31.180
The Chrome Storage Local
would be one.

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:32.790
But there's another one that--

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.720
I guess there's two that
are interesting.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.440
There's the Sync FileSystem
which works very much like the

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:44.560
HTML5 file system, that allows
you to store resources on the

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.350
user's computer.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:48.380
So you can store data, you can
store images, files, whatever.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.770
So you can use that.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.650
And because it's the synced file
system, it actually syncs

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:56.580
to the user's Google Drive
account, so they could store

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.640
stuff up there.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.000
They've got access to it on any
computer they go to, and

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.790
you're pretty much golden
across all the different

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:08.470
devices you might
be signed in on.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.790
Then the other one is the--

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.090
and I'm completely
blanking on it.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:18.780
There was Sync FileSystem
and the--

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:20.580
all right, I'll have to come
back to it, because I'm

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:22.110
blanking on it.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.820
Love those kinds of days.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:26.310
Cool.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:30.900
So what are your next steps
to get this into

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.860
the Chrome Web Store?

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:36.740
What else do you guys have to
do in order to publish it?

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:41.230
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well, there
are some minor bugs with

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.090
pulling images.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.420
Like, for example, albums--

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.900
they don't seem to
work as well.

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.970
The images just aren't being
pulled properly.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:52.895
But that shouldn't too big
of a problem to fix.

00:23:52.895 --> 00:23:56.620
It's just looking at
the code again.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:58.360
What else?

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.425
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Really just
minor bugs that when we seed

00:24:00.425 --> 00:24:02.300
it out to some testers, they'll
be able to give us

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.650
some good feedback on.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.530
And we can get back to them
and sort of solve their

00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:07.020
problems, hopefully.

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.290
And then we should be actually
ready to release then.

00:24:09.290 --> 00:24:09.740
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.360
That's fantastic.

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:16.980
And from the time you guys
started working on the v2 app

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.180
to getting something working,
how long do you think that

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.420
took, all total?

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.620
Just to get it working, not

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.020
necessarily to have it perfect.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:26.280
But like, all right,
this is working.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:31.820
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV:
Within a week.

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:34.730
It wasn't that difficult.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:37.340
It was just changing
some manifests--

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.920
some spots in the manifest, but
really that's about it.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.060
And some cross--

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.640
it was purely CSP.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.740
PETE LEPAGE: OK. so CSP was
really the big thing.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.090
And then to get it to that like
place where you're going

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.450
to be happy with it, how long
do you think it would take

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.900
you, has taken you, to
get to that stage?

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.280
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Just in raw
hours of just pure coding,

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.310
probably only like eight hours,
considering that we

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.990
also added additional features
there as well to make the

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.015
experience better
for the users.

00:25:12.015 --> 00:25:13.320
So not long at all.

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:13.780
PETE LEPAGE: Awesome.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.850
That's actually pretty
fantastic.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:20.740
And it helps, I think, for
developers who are watching

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:25.040
this and considering building or
porting their app from a v1

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.180
packaged app or a web app,
seeing real developers say

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.350
that this is what it takes.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:32.293
And this is a great app.

00:25:32.293 --> 00:25:36.410
This offers a full set of
features, has a really nice

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:37.180
experience--

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.700
it really says a lot about this
experience and moving

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.950
this forward.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:46.700
Have you guys thought about
monetization strategies?

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.920
Do you plan to make some money
with this, or are you going to

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.310
use this to pay for school,
or what are

00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:53.210
your thoughts on that?

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.730
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: It's
definitely on our minds, but

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.130
we're not 100% sure how we're
going to do it with the

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:01.680
desktop, but we're also planning
on moving on to

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.720
mobile platforms.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.770
And we're actually
in the process of

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.950
doing that right now.

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:09.983
So hopefully either through--

00:26:09.983 --> 00:26:12.200
I think it was like
a freemium model.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.800
I forget what the model was
called, but there's a free

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.260
version with ads, and another
one that's paid that

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.740
doesn't have ads.

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.500
But we're not 100% certain
with the desktop version.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.520
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.900
Well, certainly freemium is
an interesting model.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:30.710
We're getting ready to release
in-app payments to allow users

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:34.070
to pay within the app a certain
amount of money.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.690
So maybe that means unlocking
a certain set of features.

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.940
But actually you mentioned
mobile.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.490
Let's talk about
that for a sec.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.660
How are you approaching
the mobile app?

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.450
What are you doing to build
a mobile experience?

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:48.740
DAVID ZORYCHTA: It's funny you
mention that, actually,

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.430
because right now we have
a fully functional

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.890
HTML5 mobile version.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:57.350
And it's actually built
for Firefox OS.

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:59.920
It runs pretty well on
Firefox OS, actually.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.570
It was really fun to make.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.030
In terms of Android development,
we're doing that

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.280
in Java, and for the iPhone,
we're doing that in

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.380
Objective-C.

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:13.470
The reason being mostly,
actually, we just want to sort

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:13.975
of like learn--

00:27:13.975 --> 00:27:15.770
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Yeah,
get another skill set.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:18.340
It will be nice to have.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:18.940
PETE LEPAGE: Interesting.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.270
OK.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.440
For the Android and for the iOS
versions that you're doing

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.850
native, are you using WebViews
at all to render any of the

00:27:27.850 --> 00:27:32.100
content, or are you doing
everything purely native?

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.260
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well
for article previews--

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:40.580
so if someone linked to a New
York Times article, we would

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.100
use a WebView for that.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.350
PETE LEPAGE: OK.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.480
But everything else is a--

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.540
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Everything
else, yeah.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:46.876
PETE LEPAGE: Wow.

00:27:46.876 --> 00:27:48.960
That's a great learning
experience.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:52.650
I'll be interested to hear how
you guys, as you get further

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:59.440
along in this project, see how
they compare, and then

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.620
maintaining multiple code bases

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.910
across different platforms.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:06.940
One of the things we hear a lot
from developers is that it

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:10.373
is a pain to maintain all
of those code bases.

00:28:10.373 --> 00:28:11.960
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Just
especially with only two

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.910
people, it's already getting
pretty hectic.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.230
PETE LEPAGE: Yeah.

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.720
One of the things that we've
talked about with Chrome apps

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:22.660
is the ability to be able to
take your existing Chrome app

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:27.480
and wrap it with Cordova,
which is also known as

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:33.110
PhoneGap, and be able to have
a fully fledged version that

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:37.730
works for mobile, whether phone,
tablet, Android, iOS,

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:41.470
without having to change
very much code.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:44.060
Realistically, you'll need to
change a few things, because a

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.720
screen this big doesn't
necessarily work so well on a

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.090
screen this big.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:52.080
But that's potentially just some
CSS changes, depending on

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.100
how things are laid out.

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.100
So that's certainly something
to look at if you guys ever

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.140
hit the point where you're
like, uh, we want to keep

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:06.610
maintaining this, but not do
three different versions.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:07.330
Cool.

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:09.670
Well, guys, we're
almost at time.

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:12.230
Is there anything you guys want
to add or anything you

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:13.450
want to share with
the folks who are

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.270
watching live right now?

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:18.140
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Well, if
you want to follow our

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:21.950
progress on any of our
developments, either mobile or

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.790
the Chrome version, you can
visit our subreddit, which is

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:29.990
just reddit.com/r/reditr.

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:34.960
Our Twitter is just Reditr,
and our website's just

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.050
reditr.com.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:36.850
PETE LEPAGE: Cool.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.000
Let me pop that up
on screen so that

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.880
folks can see it there.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:45.450
So if you want to try or grab
Reditr, you can grab it from

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.680
that URL that's there
on screen.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.020
And it'll be up hopefully very
shortly in the Chrome Web

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:51.990
Store-- the new version.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.620
The current one works
beautifully, but it is a

00:29:55.620 --> 00:30:00.590
Chrome packaged app v1, so
hopefully we'll see v2 in

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:01.810
there in the near future.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:06.860
Well guys, thanks very
much for joining me.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:10.930
Hopefully this was useful for
folks who are watching, and

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.840
you guys all learned
a little bit.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.400
And thanks very much.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.060
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: Thank you.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.010
DAVID ZORYCHTA: Thanks
for having us.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.150
PETE LEPAGE: See you guys.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:18.500
DIMITRY VINOGRADOV: See ya.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.750
DAVID ZORYCHTA: See ya.
