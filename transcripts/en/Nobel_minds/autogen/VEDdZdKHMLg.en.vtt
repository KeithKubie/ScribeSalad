00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.039
 
my start into science was sort of

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:03.049
my start into science was sort of
 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.289
my start into science was sort of
coincidental because i was in sports

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299
coincidental because i was in sports
 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.600
coincidental because i was in sports
cool my best degrees in my own judgment

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
cool my best degrees in my own judgment
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.189
cool my best degrees in my own judgment
that I got is in competitive sports so

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
that I got is in competitive sports so
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.880
that I got is in competitive sports so
which men which means that we would

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890
which men which means that we would
 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.300
which men which means that we would
physically work out for about 25 hours a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310
physically work out for about 25 hours a
 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.000
physically work out for about 25 hours a
week at a full program for a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
week at a full program for a
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.960
week at a full program for a
professional athlete and I remember that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970
professional athlete and I remember that
 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.020
professional athlete and I remember that
I got sort of port to it went the time

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
I got sort of port to it went the time
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.040
I got sort of port to it went the time
and so I enquired whether I could on the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050
and so I enquired whether I could on the
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:47.229
and so I enquired whether I could on the
side to some research and this was

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239
side to some research and this was
 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.779
side to some research and this was
relatively successful I would give

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
relatively successful I would give
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.479
relatively successful I would give
swimming lessons to the professor of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
swimming lessons to the professor of
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.090
swimming lessons to the professor of
chemistry and he would let me work in

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
chemistry and he would let me work in
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.479
chemistry and he would let me work in
his laboratory in exchange and so I got

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
his laboratory in exchange and so I got
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.950
his laboratory in exchange and so I got
a PhD in inorganic chemistry that got me

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
a PhD in inorganic chemistry that got me
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.290
a PhD in inorganic chemistry that got me
started
