00:20:29.879 --> 00:20:29.889
terms of more current sources there's
 

00:20:29.889 --> 00:20:32.340
terms of more current sources there's
clearly a lot of licensing of news and

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:32.350
clearly a lot of licensing of news and
 

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:35.549
clearly a lot of licensing of news and
other current data and information that

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:35.559
other current data and information that
 

00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:38.759
other current data and information that
we pay for a lot of big vendors like

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:38.769
we pay for a lot of big vendors like
 

00:20:38.769 --> 00:20:42.330
we pay for a lot of big vendors like
fective and lex LexisNexis have this and

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:42.340
fective and lex LexisNexis have this and
 

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.299
fective and lex LexisNexis have this and
then we have ebook products that I often

00:20:45.299 --> 00:20:45.309
then we have ebook products that I often
 

00:20:45.309 --> 00:20:47.789
then we have ebook products that I often
call the boutique ebook products because

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799
call the boutique ebook products because
 

00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:52.769
call the boutique ebook products because
they can be very often not complying

00:20:52.769 --> 00:20:52.779
they can be very often not complying
 

00:20:52.779 --> 00:20:54.450
they can be very often not complying
with some of the standards we'd want to

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:54.460
with some of the standards we'd want to
 

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.230
with some of the standards we'd want to
see for that some may be free some main

see for that some may be free some main
 

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.290
see for that some may be free some main
not be free and again it can be very

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:00.300
not be free and again it can be very
 

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:02.750
not be free and again it can be very
fragmented and challenging to find ways

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760
fragmented and challenging to find ways
 

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.430
fragmented and challenging to find ways
to make them available they're usually

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440
to make them available they're usually

to an academic library environment so we

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:09.690
to an academic library environment so we
 

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:11.990
to an academic library environment so we
have a lot of challenges and seeing a

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000
have a lot of challenges and seeing a
 

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.210
have a lot of challenges and seeing a
lot of content come in that way and so

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:14.220
lot of content come in that way and so
 

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.610
lot of content come in that way and so
that's where open access is so important

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620
that's where open access is so important
 

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:18.800
that's where open access is so important
to us because that's really in my eyes

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:18.810
to us because that's really in my eyes
 

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.680
to us because that's really in my eyes
the growth area of the digital for a lot

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:21.690
the growth area of the digital for a lot
 

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:24.080
the growth area of the digital for a lot
of what we're covering in our group and

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:24.090
of what we're covering in our group and
 

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.470
of what we're covering in our group and
by open access I think I have a very

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480
by open access I think I have a very
 

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:31.490
by open access I think I have a very
broad and liberal definition of that I

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500
broad and liberal definition of that I
 

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.750
broad and liberal definition of that I
know there's probably a lot of energy

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760
know there's probably a lot of energy
 

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.640
know there's probably a lot of energy
that goes into defining what open access

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:34.650
that goes into defining what open access
 

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:39.170
that goes into defining what open access
means and yes in some cases it is the

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:39.180
means and yes in some cases it is the
 

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:40.940
means and yes in some cases it is the
situation that I guess is common here

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:40.950
situation that I guess is common here
 

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.770
situation that I guess is common here
where you see open access is this

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:42.780
where you see open access is this
 

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:44.720
where you see open access is this
alternative to the conventional

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:44.730
alternative to the conventional
 

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:46.460
alternative to the conventional
conventional publishing models that

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:46.470
conventional publishing models that
 

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.530
conventional publishing models that
charge fees both for access and may

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:48.540
charge fees both for access and may
 

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.050
charge fees both for access and may
limit rights to use of material we

00:21:51.050 --> 00:21:51.060
limit rights to use of material we
 

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.140
limit rights to use of material we
certainly see open access coming up as

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:54.150
certainly see open access coming up as
 

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.810
certainly see open access coming up as
an alternative and in some ways to

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820
an alternative and in some ways to
 

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.060
an alternative and in some ways to
displace or replace those kinds of

00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.070
displace or replace those kinds of
 

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.840
displace or replace those kinds of
models but we also see in our world

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:02.850
models but we also see in our world
 

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.940
models but we also see in our world
sometimes the alternative is not those

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:04.950
sometimes the alternative is not those
 

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.640
sometimes the alternative is not those
prevailing kind of commercial models but

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:07.650
prevailing kind of commercial models but
 

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.620
prevailing kind of commercial models but
the alternative is nothing that you just

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:09.630
the alternative is nothing that you just
 

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:11.540
the alternative is nothing that you just
don't see publishing if you don't see

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:11.550
don't see publishing if you don't see
 

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:14.270
don't see publishing if you don't see
open access publishing because or you

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280
open access publishing because or you
 

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:16.400
open access publishing because or you
see the print publishing that continues

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:16.410
see the print publishing that continues
 

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.890
see the print publishing that continues
but that then we'll have a very low

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900
but that then we'll have a very low
 

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.720
but that then we'll have a very low
impact because of the challenges of

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:20.730
impact because of the challenges of
 

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.270
impact because of the challenges of
seeing print get disseminated and

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280
seeing print get disseminated and
 

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.490
seeing print get disseminated and
discovered and all of that so in many

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:25.500
discovered and all of that so in many
 

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.740
discovered and all of that so in many
cases open access as having this

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:27.750
cases open access as having this
 

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.410
cases open access as having this
additive effect not a replacing effect

00:22:30.410 --> 00:22:30.420
additive effect not a replacing effect
 

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.430
additive effect not a replacing effect
adding more access and more content that

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440
adding more access and more content that
 

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.510
adding more access and more content that
that researchers can have it also is a

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:38.520
that researchers can have it also is a
 

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.430
that researchers can have it also is a
very important you know there's a lot of

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440
very important you know there's a lot of
 

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.530
very important you know there's a lot of
discussion about what that does to the

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:42.540
discussion about what that does to the
 

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.540
discussion about what that does to the
dynamic of knowledge transfer and

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:44.550
dynamic of knowledge transfer and
 

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.950
dynamic of knowledge transfer and
information transfer and we see

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:47.960
information transfer and we see
 

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.270
information transfer and we see
knowledge being produced especially in

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280
knowledge being produced especially in
 

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.620
knowledge being produced especially in
the developing world very

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:51.630
the developing world very
 

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.710
the developing world very
underrepresented and that with it often

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720
underrepresented and that with it often
 

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.420
underrepresented and that with it often
is called the south-north flow not

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:56.430
is called the south-north flow not
 

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:58.760
is called the south-north flow not
happening nor does the south-south flow

00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:58.770
happening nor does the south-south flow
 

00:22:58.770 --> 00:22:59.600
happening nor does the south-south flow
happen

00:22:59.600 --> 00:22:59.610
happen
 

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:02.120
happen
but the more that we can be aware of

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:02.130
but the more that we can be aware of
 

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.090
but the more that we can be aware of
this content and do things to facilitate

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.100
this content and do things to facilitate
 

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:07.850
this content and do things to facilitate
discovery and access the more that that

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:07.860
discovery and access the more that that
 

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.180
discovery and access the more that that
kind of exchange can happen and the

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:11.190
kind of exchange can happen and the
 

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.710
kind of exchange can happen and the
better we think for the scholarly

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720
better we think for the scholarly
 

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.789
better we think for the scholarly
communication process so so are you know

00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799
communication process so so are you know
 

00:23:16.799 --> 00:23:18.789
communication process so so are you know
our sense of open access may include

00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799
our sense of open access may include
 

00:23:18.799 --> 00:23:21.830
our sense of open access may include
aggregator sites that pull together open

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840
aggregator sites that pull together open
 

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.780
aggregator sites that pull together open
access journals and it may include just

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:23.790
access journals and it may include just
 

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:26.270
access journals and it may include just
open web content which may stray a bit

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.280
open web content which may stray a bit
 

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.039
open web content which may stray a bit
from the conventional sense of open

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:28.049
from the conventional sense of open
 

00:23:28.049 --> 00:23:30.980
from the conventional sense of open
access but that we are very aware and

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:30.990
access but that we are very aware and
 

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.590
access but that we are very aware and
cognizant of the role we may have with

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600
cognizant of the role we may have with
 

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.560
cognizant of the role we may have with
that kind of content so I'll just you

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:36.570
that kind of content so I'll just you
 

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.960
that kind of content so I'll just you
know give a few quick examples of things

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:38.970
know give a few quick examples of things
 

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:40.700
know give a few quick examples of things
that have caught our eye on ways that we

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:40.710
that have caught our eye on ways that we
 

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:42.260
that have caught our eye on ways that we
work with open access and then we can

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:42.270
work with open access and then we can
 

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.990
work with open access and then we can
maybe open things up and hear hear from

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000
maybe open things up and hear hear from
 

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.140
maybe open things up and hear hear from
some of you um and I can draw examples

00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:48.150
some of you um and I can draw examples
 

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.270
some of you um and I can draw examples
from the Latin American area because I

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:50.280
from the Latin American area because I
 

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.070
from the Latin American area because I
was the Latin American Studies librarian

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080
was the Latin American Studies librarian
 

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.539
was the Latin American Studies librarian
for many years here and that's the part

00:23:53.539 --> 00:23:53.549
for many years here and that's the part
 

00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:55.280
for many years here and that's the part
of the world that I I know the best and

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:55.290
of the world that I I know the best and
 

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.310
of the world that I I know the best and
that I'm closest to there have been some

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320
that I'm closest to there have been some
 

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:01.370
that I'm closest to there have been some
really successful aggregators of open

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:01.380
really successful aggregators of open
 

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.620
really successful aggregators of open
access journals based in Latin America

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:03.630
access journals based in Latin America
 

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:05.299
access journals based in Latin America
and some of them ranked among the top

00:24:05.299 --> 00:24:05.309
and some of them ranked among the top
 

00:24:05.309 --> 00:24:07.580
and some of them ranked among the top
portals in the world for open access

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:07.590
portals in the world for open access
 

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:10.190
portals in the world for open access
journals and that's a significant

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200
journals and that's a significant
 

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.900
journals and that's a significant
achievement and as a Latin American asst

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:11.910
achievement and as a Latin American asst
 

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.880
achievement and as a Latin American asst
it makes me kind of proud that these

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:13.890
it makes me kind of proud that these
 

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.210
it makes me kind of proud that these
projects really took off one is the

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220
projects really took off one is the
 

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.690
projects really took off one is the
scientific online library known as CLO

do that in a way that makes it easy for
 

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.370
do that in a way that makes it easy for
people to know and discover what can we

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:53.380
people to know and discover what can we
 

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.470
people to know and discover what can we
do that's different than what the open

do that's different than what the open
 

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.850
do that's different than what the open
web can do obviously there's a

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:56.860
web can do obviously there's a
 

00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.680

mentioned academic commons sorry i have
 

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.000
mentioned academic commons sorry i have
a gun tab but i have to say that we i

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.010
a gun tab but i have to say that we i
 

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.830
a gun tab but i have to say that we i
think are more at a starting point of

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840
think are more at a starting point of
 

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.320
think are more at a starting point of
working with our communities to help

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.330
working with our communities to help
 

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.980
working with our communities to help
build academic commons we have a lot of

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:22.990
build academic commons we have a lot of
 

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.780
build academic commons we have a lot of
different disciplines a lot of

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:24.790
different disciplines a lot of
 

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:28.500
different disciplines a lot of
humanities disciplines and we I think

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:28.510
humanities disciplines and we I think
 

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.750
humanities disciplines and we I think
have a lot of good potential to draw

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760
have a lot of good potential to draw
 

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.000
have a lot of good potential to draw
from those communities to continue to

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.010
from those communities to continue to
 

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.040
from those communities to continue to
feed academic commons we have global

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:35.050

based around the world and that's

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:38.590
based around the world and that's
 

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:41.190
based around the world and that's
another important production site so to

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200
another important production site so to
 

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.410
another important production site so to
speak that could feed academic commons

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:43.420
speak that could feed academic commons
 

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:44.910
speak that could feed academic commons
and we've already had discussions about

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:44.920
and we've already had discussions about
 

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.770
and we've already had discussions about
how we can we can go about doing that

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:46.780
how we can we can go about doing that
 

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:49.200
how we can we can go about doing that
but i think in some of the discussions

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.210
but i think in some of the discussions
 

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.660
but i think in some of the discussions
we've had we've kind of reaffirmed or

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:51.670
we've had we've kind of reaffirmed or
 

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.190
we've had we've kind of reaffirmed or
agreed that the different research

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200
agreed that the different research
 

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:55.620
agreed that the different research
communities may require different

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:55.630
communities may require different
 

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:58.710
communities may require different
proaches in terms of how we describe and

00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720
proaches in terms of how we describe and
 

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.950
proaches in terms of how we describe and
how we you know how we can engage

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960
how we you know how we can engage
 

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.230
how we you know how we can engage
interest in academic commons that there

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240
interest in academic commons that there
 

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.270
interest in academic commons that there
are different priorities and interests

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:06.280
are different priorities and interests
 

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.610
are different priorities and interests
in different research areas and being

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:08.620
in different research areas and being
 

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.020
in different research areas and being
attuned to that I think it's really

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:10.030
attuned to that I think it's really
 

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.960
attuned to that I think it's really
important to gaining and understanding

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:12.970
important to gaining and understanding
 

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.160
important to gaining and understanding
and then a willingness to participate

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:14.170
and then a willingness to participate
 

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:16.710
and then a willingness to participate
and so we know that would have to be

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720
and so we know that would have to be
 

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.630
and so we know that would have to be
part of the work we do is we work to

help support act until my comments so so
 

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.980
help support act until my comments so so
I'll just leave it at that then you'll

I'll just leave it at that then you'll
 

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.590
I'll just leave it at that then you'll
see we have some questions all right

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600
see we have some questions all right
 

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.810

again this is kind of different than

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:12.760
again this is kind of different than
 

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.310
again this is kind of different than
what you're seeing in other areas like

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320
what you're seeing in other areas like

they're they're rarely expensive they're

twenty-five dollars a year or fifty
dollars a year at the most so it's a

dollars a year at the most so it's a
 

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.360
dollars a year at the most so it's a
very different kind of landscape but

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:36.370
very different kind of landscape but

again the real challenge is keeping

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720
again the real challenge is keeping
 

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.980
again the real challenge is keeping

how to get it and and you do see a trend

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:43.540
how to get it and and you do see a trend
 

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.270
how to get it and and you do see a trend
of many journals that come out and don't

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280
of many journals that come out and don't
 

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.210
of many journals that come out and don't
survive so you see quite a lot of of

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:48.220
survive so you see quite a lot of of
 

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.830
survive so you see quite a lot of of
that happening and the ones that

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:49.840
that happening and the ones that
 

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:55.650
that happening and the ones that
persists are in the end much much viewer

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:55.660
 
 

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.240
 
it was really struggling you should be

00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:58.250
it was really struggling you should be
 

00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:59.800
it was really struggling you should be
talking about

00:37:59.800 --> 00:37:59.810
talking about
 

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.710
talking about
the collaboration aspect

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720
the collaboration aspect
 

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.490
the collaboration aspect
I wonder if you could all drill down

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:05.500
I wonder if you could all drill down
 

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.030

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.270
 
these you'll clearly don't think of

you do that in here your daily work and
 

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:31.090
you do that in here your daily work and
how how going for we would want to go

member I think one of the challenges of
 

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:56.600

engaging undergraduate students it's

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:56.610
engaging undergraduate students it's
 

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.720
engaging undergraduate students it's
it's a question of how do we engage a

it's a question of how do we engage a
 

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.370
it's a question of how do we engage a

questions about how information exactly

is coming to them and they're not really
thinking about their work is

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:22.650
thinking about their work is
 

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:23.720

conversation yet but by partnering with
 

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.180
conversation yet but by partnering with
faculty and having the faculty kind of

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:32.190
faculty and having the faculty kind of
 

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.160
faculty and having the faculty kind of
support some of the principles that I

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:34.170
support some of the principles that I
 

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:36.530
support some of the principles that I
discuss with them that really does

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:36.540
discuss with them that really does
 

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.140

engage them to go and submit their

engage them to go and submit their
 

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:43.270
engage them to go and submit their
theses to the comments and so that's

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280
theses to the comments and so that's
 

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:50.730
theses to the comments and so that's
where the greatest success is I find

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:50.740
 
 

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.860
 
in terms of collaborating I think are

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:53.870
in terms of collaborating I think are
 

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:56.230
in terms of collaborating I think are
trying to make connections with faculty

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240
trying to make connections with faculty
 

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.620

you know I it's sort of a fine line
 

00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.520
you know I it's sort of a fine line
sometimes but I don't think I've

sometimes but I don't think I've
 

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:10.150
sometimes but I don't think I've
offended anybody yet I hope not but the

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160
offended anybody yet I hope not but the
 

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.100

which makes some of these conversations
very easy to have but thinking about

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:40.750
very easy to have but thinking about
 

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.350
very easy to have but thinking about
what this person this person is studying

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:43.360
what this person this person is studying
 

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.850
what this person this person is studying
what

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:46.860
 
 

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:51.870
 
I can say with a faculty obviously we we

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:51.880
I can say with a faculty obviously we we
 

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.370

that also as Matthew was saying and

00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:58.390
that also as Matthew was saying and
 

00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:00.870
that also as Matthew was saying and
Megan as you were saying I think we can

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880
Megan as you were saying I think we can
 

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:05.580
Megan as you were saying I think we can
really appeal to a rule either sympathy

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:05.590
really appeal to a rule either sympathy
 

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.620
really appeal to a rule either sympathy
or the way that they are tuned to the

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:07.630
or the way that they are tuned to the
 

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.930
or the way that they are tuned to the
barriers in the world for the flow of

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:09.940
barriers in the world for the flow of
 

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.600
barriers in the world for the flow of
information and that's a very powerful

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:11.610
information and that's a very powerful
 

00:43:11.610 --> 00:43:15.830
information and that's a very powerful
motivation to promote open access and

00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:15.840
motivation to promote open access and
 

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.360
motivation to promote open access and
many scholars go off into the world

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:18.370
many scholars go off into the world
 

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:20.400
many scholars go off into the world
faculty go off into the world they would

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:20.410
faculty go off into the world they would
 

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:23.100
faculty go off into the world they would
come back and lament that they didn't

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:23.110
come back and lament that they didn't
 

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:24.360

have access to certain things when they
 

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:25.920
have access to certain things when they
were away so I think that's an easy

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:25.930
were away so I think that's an easy
 

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.000
were away so I think that's an easy
point where we can see a lot of

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:29.010

and we know that where we hope that this
is where things are going you know at

00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880
is where things are going you know at
 

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.060
is where things are going you know at

it's always kind of been here um

00:48:58.180 --> 00:48:58.190
it's always kind of been here um
 

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:01.130
it's always kind of been here um
particularly on this campus there were

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:01.140
particularly on this campus there were
 

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.309
particularly on this campus there were
dance classes over at Barnard and at

00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319
dance classes over at Barnard and at
 

00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:05.839
dance classes over at Barnard and at
Teachers College where Martha Graham was

00:49:05.839 --> 00:49:05.849
Teachers College where Martha Graham was
 

00:49:05.849 --> 00:49:11.089
Teachers College where Martha Graham was
teaching in the 30s um but it was in the

00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099
teaching in the 30s um but it was in the
 

00:49:11.099 --> 00:49:13.640
teaching in the 30s um but it was in the
physical education department and it

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:13.650
physical education department and it
 

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:16.130
physical education department and it
wasn't until a boom that kind of came

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140
wasn't until a boom that kind of came
 

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.279
wasn't until a boom that kind of came
with post-modernism in the mid 60s going

00:49:19.279 --> 00:49:19.289
with post-modernism in the mid 60s going
 

00:49:19.289 --> 00:49:21.950
with post-modernism in the mid 60s going
into the 70s that they started forming

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960
into the 70s that they started forming
 

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.240
into the 70s that they started forming
dance departments and that it was

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:23.250
dance departments and that it was
 

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.519
dance departments and that it was
recognized as a discipline right and so

00:49:25.519 --> 00:49:25.529
recognized as a discipline right and so
 

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:27.859
recognized as a discipline right and so
this is also when library collections

00:49:27.859 --> 00:49:27.869
this is also when library collections
 

00:49:27.869 --> 00:49:29.569
this is also when library collections
really start building themselves within

00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579
really start building themselves within
 

00:49:29.579 --> 00:49:32.120
really start building themselves within
colleges and universities and so it's

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:32.130
colleges and universities and so it's
 

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:33.200
colleges and universities and so it's
one of the reasons we're facing these

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:33.210
one of the reasons we're facing these
 

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:36.140
one of the reasons we're facing these
problems but it also means that um that

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:36.150
problems but it also means that um that
 

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:37.789
problems but it also means that um that
librarians have very strong

00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799
librarians have very strong
 

00:49:37.799 --> 00:49:39.470
librarians have very strong
relationships both with the community of

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480
relationships both with the community of
 

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.720
relationships both with the community of
scholars and the command the community

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:41.730
scholars and the command the community
 

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:43.549
scholars and the command the community
of practitioners they don't always talk

00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559
of practitioners they don't always talk
 

00:49:43.559 --> 00:49:45.680
of practitioners they don't always talk
to it than other the scholars and

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:45.690
to it than other the scholars and
 

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:47.329
to it than other the scholars and
practitioners but they do talk to the

00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:47.339
practitioners but they do talk to the
 

00:49:47.339 --> 00:49:50.380
practitioners but they do talk to the
librarians right and so through this

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:50.390
librarians right and so through this
 

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:52.519
librarians right and so through this
there are organizations like the dance

00:49:52.519 --> 00:49:52.529
there are organizations like the dance
 

00:49:52.529 --> 00:49:54.920
there are organizations like the dance
heritage coalition based in New York

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:54.930
heritage coalition based in New York
 

00:49:54.930 --> 00:50:00.049
heritage coalition based in New York
which has done some really important

00:50:00.049 --> 00:50:00.059
which has done some really important
 

00:50:00.059 --> 00:50:05.029
which has done some really important
work in terms of collecting the art form

00:50:05.029 --> 00:50:05.039
work in terms of collecting the art form
 

00:50:05.039 --> 00:50:06.589
work in terms of collecting the art form
teaching basic standards for

00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599
teaching basic standards for
 

00:50:06.599 --> 00:50:09.700
teaching basic standards for
preservation but also setting early

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:09.710
preservation but also setting early
 

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:11.990
preservation but also setting early
standards for film preservation they

00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000
standards for film preservation they
 

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.279
standards for film preservation they
were one of the first instituted to do

00:50:13.279 --> 00:50:13.289
were one of the first instituted to do
 

00:50:13.289 --> 00:50:13.910
were one of the first instituted to do
that

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920
that
 

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:19.640
that
so in terms of open access and creating

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:19.650
so in terms of open access and creating
 

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.319
so in terms of open access and creating
new content this is just beginning to

00:50:21.319 --> 00:50:21.329
new content this is just beginning to
 

00:50:21.329 --> 00:50:23.809
new content this is just beginning to
become part of the conversation but

00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:23.819
become part of the conversation but
 

00:50:23.819 --> 00:50:25.430
become part of the conversation but
because those collaborative

00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440
because those collaborative
 

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:27.140
because those collaborative
relationships are already formed I

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:27.150
relationships are already formed I
 

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:31.400
relationships are already formed I
really do believe that you again you

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:31.410
really do believe that you again you
 

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:34.370
really do believe that you again you
know collecting new types of content in

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:34.380
know collecting new types of content in
 

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:38.210
know collecting new types of content in
new ways and that those are it's a

00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.220
new ways and that those are it's a
 

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:39.859
new ways and that those are it's a
really great question and I think

00:50:39.859 --> 00:50:39.869
really great question and I think
 

00:50:39.869 --> 00:50:42.500
really great question and I think
overall I'm fairly optimistic but I also

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:42.510
overall I'm fairly optimistic but I also
 

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:44.359
overall I'm fairly optimistic but I also
have to be honest and say I have some

00:50:44.359 --> 00:50:44.369
have to be honest and say I have some
 

00:50:44.369 --> 00:50:47.109
have to be honest and say I have some
real concern about the sort of

00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119
real concern about the sort of
 

00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:50.809
real concern about the sort of
transition phase as we move into feeling

00:50:50.809 --> 00:50:50.819
transition phase as we move into feeling
 

00:50:50.819 --> 00:50:53.329
transition phase as we move into feeling
more responsible for having stewardship

00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:53.339
more responsible for having stewardship
 

00:50:53.339 --> 00:50:57.349
more responsible for having stewardship
of open web content you know as you can

00:50:57.349 --> 00:50:57.359
of open web content you know as you can
 

00:50:57.359 --> 00:51:00.020
of open web content you know as you can
see from when I described all that print

00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.030
see from when I described all that print
 

00:51:00.030 --> 00:51:03.349
see from when I described all that print
coming in the door hitting us that that

00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359
coming in the door hitting us that that
 

00:51:03.359 --> 00:51:05.660
coming in the door hitting us that that
this growth in open web content isn't

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:05.670
this growth in open web content isn't
 

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:08.480
this growth in open web content isn't
having a replacement effect it's largely

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:08.490
having a replacement effect it's largely
 

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:11.630
having a replacement effect it's largely
in my view additive to a lot of what we

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640
in my view additive to a lot of what we
 

00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:14.650
in my view additive to a lot of what we
still have to do and so it feels like to

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:14.660
still have to do and so it feels like to
 

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.780
still have to do and so it feels like to
actively curate that it's an additive

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:17.790
actively curate that it's an additive
 

00:51:17.790 --> 00:51:20.180
actively curate that it's an additive
kind of function that lands on top of

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:20.190
kind of function that lands on top of
 

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:22.339
kind of function that lands on top of
all the many things that we already do

00:51:22.339 --> 00:51:22.349
all the many things that we already do
 

00:51:22.349 --> 00:51:25.930
all the many things that we already do
and we don't see a lot of opportunity to

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:25.940
and we don't see a lot of opportunity to
 

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.329
and we don't see a lot of opportunity to
to push some things off the plate so I

00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339
to push some things off the plate so I
 

00:51:29.339 --> 00:51:31.339
to push some things off the plate so I
think it's a real juggling act at this

00:51:31.339 --> 00:51:31.349
think it's a real juggling act at this
 

00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:33.440
think it's a real juggling act at this
moment and it has to make us think

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:33.450
moment and it has to make us think
 

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:35.569
moment and it has to make us think
seriously about what what are the

00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:35.579
seriously about what what are the
 

00:51:35.579 --> 00:51:38.539
seriously about what what are the
appropriate roles within libraries and

00:51:38.539 --> 00:51:38.549
appropriate roles within libraries and
 

00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:41.240
appropriate roles within libraries and
whether we can just transition existing

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:41.250
whether we can just transition existing
 

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:44.480
whether we can just transition existing
models and just add in these additional

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:44.490
models and just add in these additional
 

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:46.130
models and just add in these additional
kinds of responsibilities or whether

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:46.140
kinds of responsibilities or whether
 

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:48.799
kinds of responsibilities or whether
there's new roles to be developed for

00:51:48.799 --> 00:51:48.809
there's new roles to be developed for
 

00:51:48.809 --> 00:51:50.359
there's new roles to be developed for
our human rights web archive we were

00:51:50.359 --> 00:51:50.369
our human rights web archive we were
 

00:51:50.369 --> 00:51:51.650
our human rights web archive we were
fortunate to have funding from the

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660
fortunate to have funding from the
 

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.210
fortunate to have funding from the
mellon Foundation and that's been

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220
mellon Foundation and that's been
 

00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:55.640
mellon Foundation and that's been
helping us with getting things going and

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:55.650
helping us with getting things going and
 

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:57.740
helping us with getting things going and
we had a kind of new role come out of

00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:57.750
we had a kind of new role come out of
 

00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:00.349
we had a kind of new role come out of
that the web collection curator that

00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359
that the web collection curator that
 

00:52:00.359 --> 00:52:03.170
that the web collection curator that
worked mostly on the technical aspects

00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:03.180
worked mostly on the technical aspects
 

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.990
worked mostly on the technical aspects
of how to capture and set up that

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000
of how to capture and set up that
 

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.630
of how to capture and set up that
process but got into some of the review

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640
process but got into some of the review
 

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:11.000
process but got into some of the review
of content and what we need and it may

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:11.010
of content and what we need and it may
 

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:13.069
of content and what we need and it may
be that we need some new roles like that

00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079
be that we need some new roles like that
 

00:52:13.079 --> 00:52:15.440
be that we need some new roles like that
that work in collaboration with people

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:15.450
that work in collaboration with people

that work in collaboration with people
with with very deep subject knowledge

with with very deep subject knowledge
 

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:21.470
with with very deep subject knowledge
and that there can be some share you

00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480
and that there can be some share you
 

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.070
and that there can be some share you
know responsibilities because I'm a

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:25.080
know responsibilities because I'm a
 

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.800

little skeptical of just adding on and

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:27.810
little skeptical of just adding on and
 

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:30.380
little skeptical of just adding on and
it sounds so go out now and collect the

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:30.390
it sounds so go out now and collect the
 

00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:32.870
it sounds so go out now and collect the
web you know it sounds like crazy so I'm

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880
web you know it sounds like crazy so I'm
 

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.640
web you know it sounds like crazy so I'm
not then how could I ever really

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:34.650
not then how could I ever really
 

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:36.110
not then how could I ever really
seriously tell someone that's what we

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:36.120
seriously tell someone that's what we
 

00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.990
seriously tell someone that's what we
must do so you know we have to be very

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000
must do so you know we have to be very
 

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.930
must do so you know we have to be very
thoughtful and very aware of how much

00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:41.940
thoughtful and very aware of how much
 

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:43.520
thoughtful and very aware of how much
and we have to define boundaries

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:43.530
and we have to define boundaries
 

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:45.800
and we have to define boundaries
obviously of how much we feel we can do

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:45.810
obviously of how much we feel we can do
 

00:52:45.810 --> 00:52:47.960
obviously of how much we feel we can do
and what what's most important for us to

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:47.970
and what what's most important for us to
 

00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.930
and what what's most important for us to
do versus what we can trust someone else

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:50.940
do versus what we can trust someone else
 

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:54.470

may take care of I mean if I can jump in

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480
may take care of I mean if I can jump in
 

00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:57.530
may take care of I mean if I can jump in
here as well you know I said I conceive

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:57.540
here as well you know I said I conceive
 

00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:59.630
here as well you know I said I conceive
of academic commons and open access in

00:52:59.630 --> 00:52:59.640
of academic commons and open access in
 

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.820
of academic commons and open access in
general as being it inside a library I

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:01.830
general as being it inside a library I
 

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:03.860
general as being it inside a library I
think the flip side is there's a

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:03.870
think the flip side is there's a
 

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:06.320
think the flip side is there's a
perspective from which what we're doing

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:06.330
perspective from which what we're doing
 

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:08.840
perspective from which what we're doing
is what libraries have always done which

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:08.850
is what libraries have always done which
 

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:10.880
is what libraries have always done which
is curate and disseminate the man's

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:10.890
is curate and disseminate the man's
 

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:12.920
is curate and disseminate the man's
knowledge and so from that perspective

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:12.930
knowledge and so from that perspective
 

00:53:12.930 --> 00:53:15.590
knowledge and so from that perspective
you know we need to be in this space but

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:15.600
you know we need to be in this space but
 

00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.570
you know we need to be in this space but
the question is exactly how do we do

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:17.580
the question is exactly how do we do
 

00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:19.490
the question is exactly how do we do
that how is that scalable when you're

00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500
that how is that scalable when you're
 

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:21.770
that how is that scalable when you're
talking about curating the open lab I

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780
talking about curating the open lab I
 

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:23.900
talking about curating the open lab I
mean that's that's blooming you know who

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:23.910
mean that's that's blooming you know who
 

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:26.360
mean that's that's blooming you know who
can who can take that on and so you have

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:26.370
can who can take that on and so you have
 

00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.770
can who can take that on and so you have
to figure out you know what are the

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780
to figure out you know what are the
 

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.960
to figure out you know what are the
parts that can be done but I think

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:29.970
parts that can be done but I think
 

00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:32.300
parts that can be done but I think
another aspect of it is to go back to

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:32.310
another aspect of it is to go back to
 

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:34.490
another aspect of it is to go back to
talking about collaboration you know

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:34.500
talking about collaboration you know
 

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:37.190
talking about collaboration you know
finding those those spaces for radical

00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200
finding those those spaces for radical
 

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:39.320
finding those those spaces for radical
collaboration with I you know across the

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:39.330
collaboration with I you know across the
 

00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.740
collaboration with I you know across the

profession but also with others in other
areas that have the skills and the

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:48.090
areas that have the skills and the
 

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:49.940
areas that have the skills and the
abilities to bring to the table to make

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:49.950
abilities to bring to the table to make
 

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:52.610

something like web creation possible I

00:53:52.610 --> 00:53:52.620
something like web creation possible I
 

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:55.320
something like web creation possible I
mean you know the internet archive is

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:55.330
mean you know the internet archive is
 

00:53:55.330 --> 00:53:58.650

they part of this project web archiving

00:53:58.650 --> 00:53:58.660
they part of this project web archiving
 

00:53:58.660 --> 00:54:00.840
they part of this project web archiving
project because they have the technology

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:00.850
project because they have the technology
 

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:03.180
project because they have the technology
and the resources to help make it

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:03.190
and the resources to help make it
 

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:04.920
and the resources to help make it
possible and so those kinds of

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:04.930
possible and so those kinds of
 

00:54:04.930 --> 00:54:07.440
possible and so those kinds of
collaborations are essential going

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:07.450
collaborations are essential going
 

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:09.780
collaborations are essential going
