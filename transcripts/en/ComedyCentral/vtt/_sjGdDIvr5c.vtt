AS WE GO TO OUR NEXT GAME,
DIDGERIDOO NOT RESUSCITATE.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.677
(AUSTRALIAN ACCENT): IF YOU'VE
BEEN IN AN AUSTRALIAN AMBULANCE

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.279
RECENTLY, IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE
YOU WERE POISONED BY A SPIDER IN

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:14.580 align:start position:0%
YOUR FLIP-FLOP.

00:00:14.613 --> 00:00:17.683 align:start position:0%
OR YOU WERE BADLY BEATEN BY A
BOUNTY HUNTER IN A KAYAK.

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.352 align:start position:0%
YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT
PARAMEDICS THERE HAVE STOPPED

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:23.056 align:start position:0%
ASKING WHO'S THE PRIME MINISTER
TO ASSESS YOUR ALERTNESS.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.957
THIS QUESTION'S BEEN DEEMED TOO
CONFUSING BECAUSE AUSTRALIA'S

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.994 align:start position:0%
GONE THROUGH FIVE PRIME
MINISTERS IN AS MANY YEARS.

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:29.195 align:start position:0%
HA, HA, HA.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
OH, [BLEEP]S.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.167 align:start position:0%
(NORMAL VOICE): IN FACT, TWO OF
THEIR PRIME MINISTERS JUST

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.669
WANDERED OFF DURING A CABINET
MEETING AND JUST NEVER CAME

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:37.937 align:start position:0%
BACK.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.672 align:start position:0%
THEY JUST DISAPPEARED.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THERE ARE
PLENTY OF OTHER WAYS TO

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:43.709 align:start position:0%
DETERMINE IF AN AUSTRALIAN IS
AWAKE-AROO.

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:45.812 align:start position:0%
SO, COMEDIANS, GIVE ME AS MANY
OTHER QUESTIONS AUSTRALIAN

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.916
PARAMEDICS COULD ASK PATIENTS TO
ASSESS THEIR MENTAL ALERTNESS IN

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:50.483 align:start position:0%
60 SECONDS.

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:51.517 align:start position:0%
AND BEGIN.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.052 align:start position:0%
(BELL DINGS)
JANET.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:55.321 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY SHRIMPS AM I HOLDING

(BELL DINGS)
GUY.

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:00.993
&gt;&gt; WALLABY OR WALLA NOT TO BE?

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:02.728 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: POINTS.

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.330 align:start position:0%
(BELL DINGS)
THAT IS THE QUESTION. JANET.

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HOW MANY HEMSWORTHS AM I
HOLDING UP?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.836 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NICOLE KIDMAN?

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.304
IF THEY SAY YES, THEY CAN GO.

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:12.672 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: OKAY, POINTS.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.140 align:start position:0%
POINTS. JANET VARNEY.

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:18.478 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IS THIS A KNIFE OR IS THIS A
KNIFE?

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.446 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: POINTS.

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.215 align:start position:0%
(BELL DINGS)
I FEEL LIKE... I FEEL LIKE THE

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:23.449 align:start position:0%
PARAMEDIC WOULD BE LIKE, "IS
THIS A KNIFE?"

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:25.718
AND THEN THE... THEN THE PERSON
DYING IS LIKE, "NO, THIS IS A

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
KNIFE."

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:28.287 align:start position:0%
AND THEN THEY... YEAH, THEY HAVE
IT RIGHT THERE.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.921 align:start position:0%
GUY.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:30.857 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; IS HUGH JACKMAN GAY YET?

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: POINTS.

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:35.094 align:start position:0%
(BELL DINGS)
NOT WHEN I [BLEEP]ED HIM.

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.263 align:start position:0%
UH, DIEDRICH.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.731 align:start position:0%

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:40.766

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.402 align:start position:0%
(BELL DINGS)
UH, GUY.

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:46.873 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; UM, JUST PUT THEM NEAR
ANOTHER AUSTRALIAN AND IF THEY

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.141
START FIGHTING, THEY'RE FINE.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:49.974 size:84% position:42%
