00:00:03.616 --> 00:00:07.256
&gt;&gt;Daniel Goleman: Every parent of
course is the first coach for kids

00:00:07.256 --> 00:00:09.426
in focusing and self control.

00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:11.176
Parents do it naturally.

00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:13.696
The moment you pick up
a toddler who's crying

00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:16.146
and you soothe her,
you help her calm down.

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:19.196
You're actually modeling
for her that behavior

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:22.556
and her brain is learning
how to calm down on its own.

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:27.426
Kids are constantly learning lessons
from their parents from infancy

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.636
on about managing emotions.

00:00:29.636 --> 00:00:34.426
One of the reason is when a child is
first born it actually does not have

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:40.316
in its brain the circuitry
for modulating a distress.

00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:43.886
That's why a baby will
express whatever it feels.

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:50.196
So a parent is continually
modeling for a child how you manage

00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:54.506
that impulse to run in front
of the car, to hit the kid,

00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:56.766
to do all the things that
you're telling a two year old

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:59.436
or a three year old or four
year old, "No, don't do that."

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:03.556
"Just say no" circuitry becomes
internalized for kids and they learn

00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:05.006
to manage their own emotions.

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.176
And schools that have
social emotional learning,

00:01:08.176 --> 00:01:11.776
that have teachers who care, that
have lessons in paying attention

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:14.876
and in managing your
emotions are simply continuing

00:01:14.876 --> 00:01:17.126
and complementing what
good parents do anyway.
