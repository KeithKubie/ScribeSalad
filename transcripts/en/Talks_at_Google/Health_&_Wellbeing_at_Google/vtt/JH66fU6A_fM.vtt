00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.540
DANI HIGGINS: Hi.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.210
Welcome to Mental
Health Myths and Facts.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.500
I'm Dani Higgins.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
I am a licensed
practicing counselor

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.970
in the Denver, Colorado area.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.730
And I am going to be presenting
on basically some myths

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.189
and facts of mental
health and also

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.813
[? the meat of the video ?]
is actually

00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:29.340
going to be more on finding
a therapist and what

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.720
to expect from those initial
therapy sessions, as well.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.310
And we'll kind of sprinkle
the myths and facts throughout

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.420
and then also have you guys all
come up with some exercises--

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.240
participate in some
exercises, as well.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.830
Just some thought exercises.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.530
Don't worry-- I won't make
you get up and move around.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.930
So a brief overview of what
we're going to be covering--

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.900
we're going to be
defining mental health

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.460
and mental illness.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.130
We're going to explore our
beliefs around mental health

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.870
and mental illness.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.530
Explore some common mental
health facts and myths.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.560
Explore some of our
beliefs around therapy

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.790
and some common therapeutic
myths and corresponding facts,

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.670
and finding a therapist,
the first therapy session,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.400
and then a few questions.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.536
So just a brief
introduction to what's next.

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:24.660
And we're just going to
hold a lot of the questions

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.290
to the end, because going back
and forth between the screens

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.000
is something I'm not
too super adept at yet.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.360
So we'll just hold
that till then.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.040
So defining mental
health and illness--

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.640
mental health involves
effective functioning

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.100
in daily activities,
which result

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.920
in productive activities--
so work, school, caregiving,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.610
healthy relationships,
the ability

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.230
to adapt to change and
cope with adversity.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.140
And mental illness is
kind of any impairment

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.550
in that, so any
difficulty in functioning,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.021
any difficulty with your
productive activities,

00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:10.645
anything that creates challenges
in your healthy relationships,

00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:13.540
so makes it hard to have
healthy relationships,

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.830
things that impact your ability
to adapt to change and to cope

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.240
with adversity.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.507
So it's collectively to all
diagnosable mental disorders.

00:02:23.507 --> 00:02:25.840
And it's health conditions
involving significant changes

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.430
in thinking, emotion, or
behavior, distress or problems

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.010
functioning in social,
work, or family activities.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.690
And that's the definition given
by the American Psychiatric

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.620
Association, American
Psychiatric Association.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.460
So a lot of people
think, like, oh, you

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.390
look through the DSM, the
Diagnostic and Statistical

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.880
Manual, the manual
of mental illness,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.340
essentially, that
therapists use.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.010
And they see, like,
doesn't everyone

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.770
have some of these or
a whole bunch of these?

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.790
And the joke is that
undergraduate psychology

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.790
students diagnose
themselves with half the DSM

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.120
when they take their
abnormal psych class.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.410
But the difference is, is
it impairing your ability

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.430
to function?

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.150
Is it causing you
significant distress?

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.120
Is it making it
significantly difficult

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.840
to work or go to school or
maintain your social life

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.940
and have healthy relationships?

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.930
Those are really the key
factors to make something

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.070
actually a illness rather
than just a quirk or an area

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.710
where maybe you have a
little bit of difference

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.460
from someone else.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.875
So beliefs about mental health--

00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:47.750
a lot of people have a
lot of different ones.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.750
We're going to be talking
about myths and facts.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.280
So we're going to want to
explore some of the beliefs

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.590
that you might have.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.429
And so what comes to mind
when you think mental health?

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:01.970
And I'll just get that, for now,
from the people in the room,

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.720
if anyone feels like sharing.

00:04:08.462 --> 00:04:10.420
AUDIENCE: Mental illness
feels like something's

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.101
wrong with you.

00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:13.059
DANI HIGGINS: Something's
wrong with you, yeah.

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.475
AUDIENCE: If you could make
sure to repeat what people say

00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:16.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.019
DANI HIGGINS: Thank you.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.279
So mental illness feels like
something's wrong with you,

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.779
yeah.

00:04:22.177 --> 00:04:24.267
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:26.600
DANI HIGGINS: So stereotypes
about being broken or being

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.175
crazy, feeling of that--

00:04:30.175 --> 00:04:31.550
that again, that
something wrong,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.918
but in a even stigmatized sense.

00:04:34.918 --> 00:04:36.854
Yeah?

00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:38.220
What about mental health?

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.760
Is there any ideas that
come up about helpfulness

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.290
or help being mentally healthy?

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.373
What would that look like?

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.070
AUDIENCE: Coping with stress?

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.119
DANI HIGGINS: Coping with
stress, yeah, definitely--

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:52.660
kind of your
resilience, your ability

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.940
to handle the changes
that life throws at you.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.762
So I say write.

00:05:00.762 --> 00:05:03.220
You can just think in your
head, if you don't have anything

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.070
to write with, or jot
it down in a phone.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.920
But just consider a list
of adjectives, traits,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.950
or other words, when you imagine
someone with mental health

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.300
challenges, like, the things
that immediately come to mind.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.710
Some of this is
going to be things

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.780
that you've heard society
say or that you've

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.510
heard your family say or that
you've heard from other people.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:26.494
Some of these are things
maybe you actually believe.

00:05:26.494 --> 00:05:28.660
And maybe some of them are
good things or bad things

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.000
or challenging things
or whatever else.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.800
Just kind of consider--
you don't have

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.226
to share this with me at all.

00:05:35.226 --> 00:05:36.850
It's just an illustration
for yourself.

00:05:40.875 --> 00:05:42.500
I'll give you a few
moments to do that.

00:05:51.924 --> 00:05:53.930
OK.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.670
So one myth is that people
with mental health issues

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.950
just need to get over it.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.890
This is a really common one, the
idea that you should just pull

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.960
yourself up by your bootstraps.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.140
You should just be
able to deal with it,

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.130
if you're having
struggles or challenges.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:16.340
That maybe it's just that you
have a weakness of character

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.220
or you just need to
buck up or get stronger.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.210
And that's a really
common perspective

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.370
in a lot of society.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.230
Obviously, it's a myth.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.170
Obviously, I'm biased as
a mental health counselor.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.510
But really, mental
health issues come

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.600
from a huge variety of factors.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.569
So a lot of times you might
hear about neurochemistry.

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.610
And everyone's kind of
seen the Zoloft commercial

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.100
with the little bouncing
ball that is sad

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.760
and talks about how it
doesn't have enough serotonin.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.610
So there's the factor of
the chemicals in your brain

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.100
that are imbalanced,
not hitting--

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.220
not going from one part of the
brain to the other correctly.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.400
Maybe there's too much of
it, whichever else that is.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.690
Biology, neurochemistry,
past traumas,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.110
insufficient or ineffective
coping strategies,

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.610
the environment
you're in-- so being

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.984
in a highly
stressful environment

00:07:11.984 --> 00:07:16.280
can exacerbate or even create
mental health challenges.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.040
And trying to just get over it--

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.840
well, one thing a lot
of people don't just

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.936
go to therapy as
their first go to.

00:07:22.936 --> 00:07:24.560
A lot of times, they
spent years trying

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.018
to do something
different or trying

00:07:26.018 --> 00:07:28.550
to deal with it on their
own or finding ways

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.510
that they don't have to
admit they have challenges

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.470
to deal with or that they're
not different from anyone else.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.690
And so a lot of people
just try to get over it,

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.420
because they've internalized
all these messages.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.530
It involves denying that
you're having struggles.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.604
It involves suppressing
the issues you do have.

00:07:48.604 --> 00:07:51.372
It involves a lot of shame,
because, well, I should just

00:07:51.372 --> 00:07:52.330
be able to get over it.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.160
So why am I still
dealing with this?

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:01.550
And any time you hear that
should word or should not--

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:04.459
that's usually shame coming
in and judging and saying,

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:05.500
well, you should do this.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.350
You shouldn't do that.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.270
But obviously, that's
not what reality is

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.480
and not where you're at.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.250
So that just makes it worse,
and you just feel crappier.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.940
And 75% to 80% of people
who get professional help

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.850
for mental health
challenges show benefit.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.840
So obviously, getting
help does something.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.510
So why do you need
to do it on your own

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.600
if there is the ability to
get help that will actually

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.663
be effective?

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.250
Another myth-- mental illness
makes people unpredictable

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:41.690
and possibly dangerous.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.280
So this is kind
of a big narrative

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.946
right now, right,
with all the shootings

00:08:44.946 --> 00:08:47.781
that are going on in the US.

00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:50.280
People are, like, oh, well, we
have a mental health problem.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.655
We have a mental
illness problem.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.900
When honestly, people with
mental health conditions

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.330
are statistically more likely
to be victims of violence

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:00.580
than perpetrators of violence.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:10.090
So actually, there was a study
that I did include in here

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.940
somewhere-- hang on one moment.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.180
Yeah, so a study--

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:21.130
a violence risk assessment
study with a sample size

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.310
of 1,136 people--

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.920
found that the
prevalence of violence

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.380
among those with a major
mental disorder who did

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.140
not abuse substances
was indistinguishable

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.080
from their non-substance
abusing neighborhood

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.400
controls, who did not have
a major mental disorder.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.180
So if you did not have
substance abuse issues,

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.660
but you had a major
mental disorder,

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.330
then your rate of violence
was equal to the people

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.510
in a similar environment
who also are not

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.070
abusing substances.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.860
Substance abuse doubles
the rate on both ends

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.840
for both people with
major mental disorder,

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.950
diagnosed major mental disorders
and people who have not been.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:03.490
But the main risk
factors for violence

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.010
are being young, male,
single, or of lower

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:07.990
socioeconomic status--

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.980
not mental illness.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.830
Then mental health
problems don't

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.310
affect me or people I know.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.610
This is, in large part, because
mental health is not something

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.990
that is often talked about.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.510
It's getting talked about
more as time goes on.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.010
But there's still a lot
of stigma around it,

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.910
and it's still something a lot
of people keep pretty private.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.470
But someone in
your life probably

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.410
does have a mental
illness of some kind.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:43.100
And in a 2014 study, about
one in five American adults

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.710
experienced a
mental health issue.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.240
One in 10 young
people experienced

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.810
a period of major depression.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.720
One in 25 Americans live
with a serious mental illness

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.570
like schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, or major depression.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.340
And suicide is the
tenth leading cause

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.590
of death in the United States.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.450
So it's relatively common.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:09.720
It's reasonably serious.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:15.230
It's something that not talking
about is not helpful for.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.510
Before I move on
is there any myths

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:28.940
that people have heard
of around mental health

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:29.690
or mental illness?

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.065
Any things that come to mind
that maybe you don't believe

00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:34.342
but you've heard from
people around you

00:11:34.342 --> 00:11:35.300
that I haven't covered?

00:11:42.665 --> 00:11:45.120
All right.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.230
And I am sorry for
the people remote--

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:51.960
I just-- I will
cover the ones you

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.060
brought up, if you
did, at the end.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.665
So another bit of
a thought exercise.

00:11:59.665 --> 00:12:03.570
This is [INAUDIBLE] your
beliefs around therapy.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.280
Can anyone tell me
what psychotherapy is?

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.100
Anyone have a definition
at all or any idea?

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:13.736
Yeah?

00:12:13.736 --> 00:12:16.652
AUDIENCE: Talking through
mental-related things

00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:17.695
with another person?

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:20.070
DANI HIGGINS: Yeah, talking
through mental-related things

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.900
with another person, for sure.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.170
That's definitely an aspect.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:28.015
Anyone else?

00:12:28.015 --> 00:12:30.930
All right.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.040
And who goes to therapy?

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.780
Or what sort of
person needs therapy?

00:12:36.326 --> 00:12:38.200
You don't have to
necessarily share this one.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.080
But you can just
think about that.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.742
What comes to mind immediately?

00:12:41.742 --> 00:12:42.646
AUDIENCE: Everyone?

00:12:44.614 --> 00:12:46.530
DANI HIGGINS: I mean,
that would be my answer.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:47.670
But again, I'm biased.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.397
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:48.397 --> 00:12:49.230
AUDIENCE: Oh, great.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.670
DANI HIGGINS: OK.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:51.851
Great.

00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:53.100
He said, everyone, by the way.

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.756
And then think of a list
of words, descriptors,

00:13:00.756 --> 00:13:02.130
or adjectives or
traits that come

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.950
to mind when you think about
therapy and the people who

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.260
might go to therapy.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:09.544
And we'll just have a moment
of reflecting on that,

00:13:09.544 --> 00:13:10.710
rather than writing it down.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:26.400
OK.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.160
So this is kind of an official
definition of psychotherapy,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.752
specifically of counseling.

00:13:32.752 --> 00:13:35.210
There are a bunch of different
counseling and psychotherapy

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.330
and psychology
organizations out there.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:41.150
The big ones are the American
Psychology Association,

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.900
which is--

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.170
if you've ever had to
write in APA style,

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:47.480
then that's where
that comes from.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.320
There's the American Psychiatry
Association for psychiatrists

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.597
who prescribe medication.

00:13:53.597 --> 00:13:55.430
There's the American
Counseling Association,

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:59.275
which is the association
I'm a member of.

00:13:59.275 --> 00:14:00.650
And there are a
number of others,

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.900
basically for every subset
of counseling or modality

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.392
there's probably an association.

00:14:04.392 --> 00:14:06.350
But this one comes from
the American Counseling

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.180
Association.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.630
They had a lengthy--

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:17.630
31 counseling
organizations came together

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.130
or sent their
delegates, and came up

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:22.760
with a unified
definition of counseling

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.620
across these different
organizations.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.040
So counseling is a
professional relationship

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.570
that empowers diverse
individuals, families,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:34.130
and groups to accomplish mental
health, wellness, education,

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:35.960
and career goals.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.790
Counselors work with
clients and strategies

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.710
to overcome obstacles
and personal challenges

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.690
that they are facing.

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:44.240
So it's a wide
variety of things.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.459
It might not just be you're
having some mental health

00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:48.500
challenges, or you're
struggling with depression,

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.370
or you're dealing with
a crisis in your family.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:56.300
It might be you're working on
your education or career goals,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.640
and you're kind of
struggling around there.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.560
Maybe there's some
motivation challenges.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.880
Or you want to learn how to have
more effective relationships,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.089
and you're working with that.

00:15:07.089 --> 00:15:08.630
So it's a huge
variety of things that

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.140
can be covered in counseling.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.140
But-- yes?

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.486
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] a
definition category to describe

00:15:15.486 --> 00:15:17.876
a career-- like, a life coach?

00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:22.190
How would you
compare [INAUDIBLE]??

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:24.290
DANI HIGGINS: That is
a good question, yes.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:30.600
So life coach and counselors
are very closely related.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.010
And we have to be very careful
from a legal standpoint

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.150
to differentiate the two.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:40.046
Counselors can cover the role
of coaches easily enough.

00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:42.170
Coaches cannot cover the
role of counselors or else

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:43.790
they're operating
outside their area.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.810
A coach is more like a mentor,
kind of an accountability

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:48.830
partner.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:54.200
They are there to help
you do goal formation.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.759
Usually it's, maybe,
career-related, sometimes

00:15:56.759 --> 00:15:58.550
a little bit of shape
of your life related.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:01.940
But not dealing with heavy
emotional stuff, not looking

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.880
into your family of origin.

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.720
It's a little more problems
it's a lot more problem solving

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.850
and kind of advice and
exploration of your goals

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.530
oriented, specifically.

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:18.350
Which is still a
subset of counseling,

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:23.390
but is the subset that coaches
are allowed to work within.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:26.450
Coaches are not currently
regulated as a profession.

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:32.014
They do have certifying
organizations,

00:16:32.014 --> 00:16:33.680
but do not have to
be certified in order

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.850
to advertise as life coach.

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.640
And a lot of counselors do
retire to become life coaches.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:39.724
That has been the thing.

00:16:39.724 --> 00:16:41.390
They just have to be
very careful to not

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.180
operate as in the
counseling domain,

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.210
and it's a very fuzzy line.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.110
So my understanding
is that there's

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:56.030
movement towards
regulating life coaching.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:17:00.100
So that might be a little
more clear in the future.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.558
But right now it's a
pretty fuzzy situation.

00:17:02.558 --> 00:17:03.266
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.797
DANI HIGGINS: So
myths about therapy--

00:17:10.797 --> 00:17:12.880
therapy is only for people
going through a crisis.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.740
As sorry, what is your name?

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.359
AUDIENCE: Sam.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.790
DANI HIGGINS: As Sam
suggested, anyone

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.530
can benefit from therapy.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.960
I say almost,
because I hate to use

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.360
any blanket terms
that incorporate

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.770
the entirety of the population.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.010
But almost everyone can
benefit from therapy.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.720
And it's easier to
develop crisis skills

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.480
and stress management skills
when you're in a better place.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.920
When you're in the
midst of crisis

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.160
and huge amounts of stress,
it's actually really hard

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.290
to learn how to cope
with the stress.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.300
Because you're trying--
you're in survival mode.

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.633
You don't have a lot of mental
and emotional or physical

00:17:49.633 --> 00:17:53.450
resources to learn
new things and develop

00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:56.210
new ways of being that are
different from how you've

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.860
coped with things
for your whole life.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.570
That's actually very hard.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:03.690
And so going when you're
doing a little better

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.870
can actually be very
beneficial, so prepare you

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.520
and give you better
resilience to cope

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.700
with the stresses of life.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:16.160
So at a previous agency
I worked at called

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.620
[INAUDIBLE] Counseling
Center down in Denver,

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.500
they divided clients
into level one,

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.610
level two, level three as part
of our charting administrative

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:31.010
stuff, and as part of, like,
coordinating care for clients.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:34.160
And level 1 means that
you are in crisis.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.840
You are having an
extreme difficulty

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.730
maintaining your work and
school and relationships.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:41.540
This is you're having a lot
of impairment in your ability

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.920
to function.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:47.390
And so level 1 is,
like, a lot of people

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.490
go to therapy at level
1, because that's

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.850
when you're kind of desperate.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:56.420
Level 2 is kind of the mid tier.

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:57.680
You're having some challenges.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.270
You're having some trouble
in your work and school

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.410
and relationships.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.340
You're getting by.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:04.920
You're kind of able to
keep your head above water.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.310
It's hard, and you could
use some extra help.

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.130
And you'd like it
to not be so hard.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:13.474
And maybe you dip in
and out of level one

00:19:13.474 --> 00:19:14.390
when you're a level 2.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.170
And then level 3 is
you're doing really well,

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.510
but you'd like to be happier.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.843
You'd like to be more fulfilled.

00:19:22.843 --> 00:19:25.521
Maybe you are considering
what do I actually

00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:26.520
want to do with my life.

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.560
Like, maybe I'm considering
a career change.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.550
Or I'm looking for a
self-actualization.

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:33.210
I'm clarifying my values.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.110
I'm exploring my spirituality.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.670
I'm just wanting to
go in for a checkup,

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.800
like a physical doctor.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.990
And so maybe I'm
doing really great,

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.180
but I'm going to
come in and check

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.040
in every month or
every other month

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:51.600
to just go over things and
have some time to reflect

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.650
on how my life is going.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.070
So level 3 is kind of the
everyone else category,

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.984
who people don't typically
necessarily think

00:20:00.984 --> 00:20:01.900
of as needing therapy.

00:20:05.422 --> 00:20:07.630
So another myth is that a
therapist will give advice,

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:08.995
solve problems, and will fix me.

00:20:08.995 --> 00:20:10.620
I actually ran into
this the other day.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.440
And someone said, well,
therapists just give advice.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.900
I was, like, actually, I joked
that the first entire year

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.560
of my graduate program was
learning to not give advice

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.650
and to stop solving
problems for people.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:29.990
Because it's about helping you
figure things out for yourself

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.870
and providing some tools
and providing some structure

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:34.249
and providing some education.

00:20:34.249 --> 00:20:35.540
But not telling you what to do.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.220
That disempowers you.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:42.500
That is not actually as helpful
as helping you figure it out

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.500
and giving you the tools to
figure it out for yourself.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:53.720
So therapists are more like
guides on a backpacking trip,

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:55.730
instead of drivers on a lift.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.230
You have to do the
walking yourself.

00:21:00.566 --> 00:21:01.940
They've been there
before, maybe.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:03.770
But they're not going
to be able to walk

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.622
the steps of the
backpacking trip for you

00:21:05.622 --> 00:21:07.580
or carry your backpack
for you, because they've

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.005
got their own to carry, right?

00:21:10.005 --> 00:21:12.380
A car mechanic on the phone,
when your car is broken down

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.060
in a remote location
and you can't quite

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.200
get it to the mechanic.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.990
So-- and maybe no one
can even get out to you,

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:19.490
but you can manage
to reach someone.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:22.610
So they can walk you through
getting your car up and running

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:23.150
well enough.

00:21:23.150 --> 00:21:24.130
And over time,
maybe you'll learn

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.296
how to just fix it yourself.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.910
And therapists are people
who hold up a mirror

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:33.410
so you can better
see and understand

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.640
what you're going through.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.450
It can be really hard to
understand your own problem

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:40.830
when it's just you
inside your head.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.460
Someone is having a
bit of perspective

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.060
or having someone
reflect back to you

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:49.070
what they see is going on and
what they hear you saying.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.890
And connecting the dots of what
you've described in your past

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.300
and what you're
describing now, it

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.570
can highlight in that reflection
and bring some clarity

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:02.630
to your situation and help
you figure out what to do next

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:03.470
or where to go next.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.110
Therapists are
just paid friends.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.568
Why can't I just
talk to my friend?

00:22:09.568 --> 00:22:11.710
I get the same benefit, right?

00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:13.804
I mean if you have a
therapist friend, maybe.

00:22:13.804 --> 00:22:15.970
But hopefully not-- hopefully,
your therapist friend

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:18.520
has better boundaries than that.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:22.690
So therapists are highly trained
facilitators of the growth

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:25.110
and change process.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:32.310
It's a under-graduate four year
program, a master's program

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:36.300
of usually three years,
sometimes a doctorate on top

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.320
of that.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.360
Plus, you can't get
license until you've

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.850
had two years of supervised
clinical experience

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.250
after grad school.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.447
There's a lot of training.

00:22:45.447 --> 00:22:47.280
And then you have to
keep going to trainings

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.639
to keep your license up.

00:22:49.639 --> 00:22:51.180
Some things that a
therapist provides

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:53.124
that a friend might not--

00:22:53.124 --> 00:22:54.540
some distance from
your situation,

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.790
physical and emotional,
distance from your life

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:58.134
and social circles.

00:22:58.134 --> 00:23:00.300
If you're talking to a
friend about something that's

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.220
going on, especially
if you're having

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.160
a conflict with another friend
or a conflict with your partner

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.169
or challenges there, your
friend might take sides.

00:23:08.169 --> 00:23:09.960
Your friend might get
emotionally invested.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.970
Your friend might feel
defensive or concerned

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.210
in a way that isn't
helpful to you.

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.692
Or is helpful, but
in a different way

00:23:17.692 --> 00:23:18.900
than a therapist can provide.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:21.090
There's more-- maybe
you feel like you

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.060
have to protect your friend
or take care of your friends

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.620
feelings, any
feelings they might

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.720
have in response to what
you're sharing with them.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.360
You have to worry about
how they know someone

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:36.590
or what their relationship is
to all the people in your life.

00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:41.804
A therapist provides
confidentiality and neutrality.

00:23:41.804 --> 00:23:43.220
So again, that
neutral point where

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.430
you don't have to worry about
them necessarily taking sides.

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.030
Or they're going to be having
your back, pretty unilaterally.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:53.810
Because they don't know
these other people.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.510
And confidentiality--
maybe you do trust

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:59.190
your friend to keep
your stuff confidential.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.640
But do you necessarily--

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.420
your friend isn't under a
legal and ethical mandate

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.950
to keep everything you
share with them completely

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.750
inviolate and secret.

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:18.720
A therapist has a strong
mandate around confidentiality,

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.230
which we'll get to
in more detail later.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.044
But that, plus the
distance, means

00:24:24.044 --> 00:24:26.210
you can pretty well trust
that it's not getting back

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.126
to your other friends.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.100
Skillful reflective listening,
psychoeducation, coping skills,

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.570
and resources--

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:40.230
so back to that amount of
training therapists go through.

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.170
Reflective listening is a skill.

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.780
Listening without
judgment is a skill.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:51.530
Not projecting their own stuff
onto you is definitely a skill.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.690
Being able to educate you
about some of the things

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.910
you're going through--
put names to some of them,

00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.740
provide models that have
been well-studied or formed,

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.280
so that you can go, oh,
OK, this does make sense.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:11.510
I do see how this fits into
my life or the path that might

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.020
I might take to get through it.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.620
And coping strategies--
some skillful friends

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.590
might have coping strategies
for you, and that's great, too.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.780
But therapists
most definitely do.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:27.560
Coping strategies being
different skills, methods,

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.230
and life changes you
can do to make it easier

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.254
to cope with life
and difficulties.

00:25:33.254 --> 00:25:34.670
An resources--
they might probably

00:25:34.670 --> 00:25:37.760
have community resources and
are able to connect you up

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:43.580
to different areas of your city
or your town that will provide

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:51.500
professional assistance, housing
assistance in some cases,

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:56.640
doctors, whatever kind of fully
rounded area that you need.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.090
So if you get to this
point and you decide,

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.470
I would like to
find a therapist.

00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.054
Or maybe you had a
therapist, and then

00:26:06.054 --> 00:26:08.428
you've kind of stepped away
from a therapist for a while,

00:26:08.428 --> 00:26:10.140
and you're like, OK,
I'd like to go back.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.570
Or you're really not happy
with your current therapist--

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.940
all of which are possibilities.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.580
Or maybe you have a
child or a teenager

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:22.530
who you feel would benefit
from seeing a therapist,

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:24.810
or you want to go see
a therapist for couples

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.630
counseling or
relationship counseling--

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:32.264
finding a therapist can be
a really challenging step.

00:26:32.264 --> 00:26:34.680
First of all, coming to the
idea that you need a therapist

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.290
is a big challenge.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:40.140
And then, how do
you even find one?

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.325
So the first go to is,
if you have insurance,

00:26:43.325 --> 00:26:44.700
your insurance
company has a list

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.200
of providers on their website.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.324
Sometimes they have an
employee assistance program,

00:26:48.324 --> 00:26:50.670
which I believe Google has.

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.730
And that is one route
you can go through.

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.680
And that will bring up
a list of therapists.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.000
It can be a little
hard to navigate.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.041
Maybe you call the insurance
company or maybe you

00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:02.220
go to their website
or maybe you log in.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.950
But that's one starting place.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.830
One note is that the insurance
company's list of providers

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.550
is sometimes a little out
of date, weirdly enough.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.430
I find actually that Psychology
Today's therapist directory,

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:20.302
because each therapist
maintains their own profile,

00:27:20.302 --> 00:27:22.260
is usually more up to
date as to what insurance

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:25.380
the therapist takes than
necessarily the insurance

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:25.950
company.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.850
Because it can sometimes
take a little bit to update.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:32.490
I've run into that
a couple of times.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:36.589
So my go to is Psychology
Today's therapist directory.

00:27:36.589 --> 00:27:38.880
And if you do just, like, a
Google search or something,

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.360
oftentimes that is just
what it'll lead you to,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.749
some Psychology Today profiles.

00:27:43.749 --> 00:27:45.540
You can also ask a
friend or get a referral

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.989
from your primary care
physician, your doctor,

00:27:47.989 --> 00:27:48.780
anything like that.

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:55.720
And when you're going and doing
your search for a therapist,

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.990
trying to figure out what
kind of help you need

00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.740
is also a big part of it.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.810
Because there's a lot
of different options.

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.960
So do you need individual
mental health counseling?

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.350
So it's just you and your head
and what's going on for you,

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:15.800
and so you just want to
see someone one on one.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.200
You're probably going to look
up a licensed professional

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.360
counselor, an LPC.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.780
You might look up a
psychologist, a PsyD,

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:29.730
but they tend to be a little
more specialized on assessment.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:31.640
If you're looking for
relationship or family

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.940
counseling, you look up an
LMFT, a licensed marriage

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.880
and family therapist.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.440
If you're looking
for medication,

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:41.477
sometimes you can just
go to your doctor.

00:28:41.477 --> 00:28:43.310
If you're just starting
out, and you're just

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.199
looking for, say, medication
for your depression,

00:28:46.199 --> 00:28:47.990
your doctor might just
be able to prescribe

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.420
you some stuff starting out.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.710
If it gets more
complicated or the things

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:54.844
your doctor's prescribing
you just aren't working out,

00:28:54.844 --> 00:28:56.510
then you want to see
this specialist who

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:01.330
is your psychiatrist or a
psychiatric nurse practitioner.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:03.730
Social services-- if you
need help with housing,

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:07.460
work assistance,
disability assistance,

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.190
a disability advocate--

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:13.330
anything in the
social services realm,

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:17.220
then an LCSW, a licensed
clinical social worker,

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.527
is who you go to.

00:29:19.527 --> 00:29:21.110
Addictions counseling--
you're dealing

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:23.530
with drug or alcohol addiction.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:27.640
Talk to a LAC, a licensed
addictions counselor,

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.620
or a CAC2 or CAC3--

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:33.640
which is a certified addictions
counselor, level two or three.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:41.500
A CAC1, not so much--
that's more someone who

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.440
doesn't have as much training
and maybe runs groups or helps

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.770
out or volunteers.

00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:51.100
And treatment centers are
also great for certain levels

00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.150
of addictions issues.

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.400
A support group-- that's usually
good in addition to therapy,

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.560
but sometimes it can
really help to talk

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.870
to people who are going
through similar things

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:04.610
and kind of work
their stuff together.

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:09.350
If you're having difficulty
getting any progress

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:11.030
in your individual
therapy, and you've

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:12.696
been to a bunch of
different therapists,

00:30:12.696 --> 00:30:16.040
maybe try a support group.

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.500
Learning disability-- like if
you're dealing with learning

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.940
disability or
anything like that--

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:22.880
specialists, often
psychologists, sometimes social

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.531
workers, but someone who
lists that as a specialty.

00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:28.280
There are a whole bunch
of different types

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.280
of psychologists, like
educational psychologists,

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.030
and so on and so forth.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:37.119
So some of them have specialties
in learning disabilities.

00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:38.660
And if you're looking
for assessment,

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.490
you're looking to
get a diagnosis,

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.342
go to a psychologist
or a psychiatrist,

00:30:42.342 --> 00:30:43.550
occasionally a social worker.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:47.426
But psychologists are your
go to for assessments.

00:30:47.426 --> 00:30:49.630
So that's what all
those strange letters.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:54.080
There will be more,
but starting out.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.554
So speaking of
psychiatrists, one myth

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:58.220
is that people with
mental health issues

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.040
just need to find
the right medication.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.630
And that's not entirely wrong.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:06.860
Medication can help a lot,
but it's not a complete cure.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.504
We've done study after
study after study.

00:31:09.504 --> 00:31:11.420
The studies, of course,
have been focused most

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:12.980
on antidepressants.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:17.240
So I can't speak entirely
to bipolar, schizophrenia,

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.510
and the like, which are also
very helpful with medication.

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:23.000
But for antidepressant
medication,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.980
combining psychotherapy
and antidepressants

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.720
is clinically significantly
more effective than medication

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.220
alone.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.510
And they found that works-- that
applies to major depression,

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.330
panic disorders--
so panic attacks--

00:31:35.330 --> 00:31:37.520
and obsessive compulsive
disorder, OCD.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.680
Another one, going the
opposite direction,

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.630
is that psychotropics, psych
meds turn people into zombies

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:51.300
and kill their creativity.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:53.820
So when it's accurately
prescribed and appropriately

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.550
taken, it can help people
be more fully themselves,

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:58.530
increase their quality
of life, and have

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:01.006
the capacity for greater
creative expression.

00:32:01.006 --> 00:32:02.380
But finding the
right medication,

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.680
the right dosage is challenging.

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.810
If you're on the
wrong medication,

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.270
it can turn you into a zombie.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:11.342
That's not a good side effect.

00:32:11.342 --> 00:32:13.050
If that's the side
effect you're getting,

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:15.120
you talk to your doctor
and say, hey, this

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.620
is not working for me.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.690
We need to change something.

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:21.960
If it is killing
your creativity,

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.620
then yeah, talk to
your doctor and say,

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.590
hey, this is not working for me.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.614
This is not a tolerable
side effect for me.

00:32:28.614 --> 00:32:30.780
A lot of people, though,
if you're really depressed,

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.281
you might have
creativity, but you

00:32:32.281 --> 00:32:33.780
don't have the
energy to do anything

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:36.900
with it or the motivation.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.090
If you have ADHD, you
don't have the focus

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:41.702
to channel your creativity
anywhere half the time,

00:32:41.702 --> 00:32:43.410
or the ability to
manage your time enough

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:46.290
to be able to give yourself
the resources for it.

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:48.210
Once you're
appropriately treated,

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:50.730
sometimes it can actually
expand your ability

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:56.290
to use that creativity
and do something with it.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:33:00.000
So there's definitely--
this is definitely

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.560
a very personal decision.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:04.255
But I like to quell
the fear that it's

00:33:04.255 --> 00:33:06.130
going to automatically
turn you into a zombie

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.710
and change your
whole personality

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:09.330
and kill your creativity.

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:16.440
Because if it's the right
med, it's just not accurate.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:18.690
But the journey to get
there can be changing

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:20.370
a bunch of medications
and that can

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:23.370
be stressful and challenging
and create some changes

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:29.420
in the meantime, so
risk-benefit analysis there.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:36.060
So Psychology Today-- if you
go to PsychologyToday.com,

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.550
then you'll get this screen.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:42.120
Obviously, not today-- that
was from yesterday, I think.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:47.100
But then you have this find
a therapist window down here.

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:51.450
And the find a therapist window
lets you plug in your location.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:53.370
And there's also a
dropdown menu there

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:59.100
that allows you to look up
support groups or psychiatrists

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:00.250
and treatment centers.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.180
So you can also look up
those by your location, too.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:04.925
So I searched for
Boulder, Colorado,

00:34:04.925 --> 00:34:06.930
since that's where
we're at right now.

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.830
And it brings up
your list, right?

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:16.300
It can be a huge list, and
that's a lot to sort through.

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.579
And those letters we
talked about, LMFT--

00:34:19.579 --> 00:34:21.370
so that's your licensed
marriage and family

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:25.402
therapist, LPC, a CAC3.

00:34:25.402 --> 00:34:26.860
We talked a little
bit about those.

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.985
Those are showing up there.

00:34:27.985 --> 00:34:30.489
But also more letters,
clusters of letters that we

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:31.989
didn't cover.

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:33.880
It gets confusing.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.080
In this case, EMDR is eye
movement desensitization--

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.070
I don't remember
the full acronym.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.429
But it's a body-based
therapy that's

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:45.429
used frequently for
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:48.070
DVT is dialectical
behavior therapy,

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.980
which is an offshoot of
cognitive behavior therapy

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:52.909
that's very focused on--

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:55.750
that basically combines
cognitive behavior therapy,

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.820
which is very
thoughts and behavior

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:00.814
changes, with mindfulness, which
is being in the present moment

00:35:00.814 --> 00:35:02.980
and being aware of what
you're doing in each moment.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:12.452
But if you see on the
right side of the screen--

00:35:12.452 --> 00:35:13.910
yes, the right side
of the screen--

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:18.520
you have your various filters,
which helps you narrow things

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.270
down very quickly.

00:35:22.382 --> 00:35:24.090
And so that's where
we're going to start.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:30.087
So first you select
your insurance or not.

00:35:30.087 --> 00:35:32.170
Maybe you don't actually
want to select insurance.

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.367
There's a whole lot of
reasons you might not.

00:35:34.367 --> 00:35:36.200
There are a lot of very
qualified therapists

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:40.180
who don't take insurance because
getting on insurance panels

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.180
is a chore and a half.

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:45.010
It's a huge amount of paperwork.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.164
And then billing for
insurance is also

00:35:47.164 --> 00:35:48.830
an additional large
amount of paperwork,

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.460
and then getting
reimbursed by insurance

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.387
is a lot of difficulty.

00:35:53.387 --> 00:35:54.970
And so a lot of
therapists, especially

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.511
people who are in their private
practice, and it's just them,

00:35:57.511 --> 00:35:59.230
and they don't have
any assistants,

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.564
will choose not
to take insurance.

00:36:01.564 --> 00:36:02.980
Some therapists
also don't take it

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.220
because they have
ethical qualms with--

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.260
because a lot of insurance,
in order to cover,

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.700
requires you diagnose.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.490
And some therapists do
not like diagnosing.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.460
And you have to have the right
diagnosis for the insurance

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:17.770
to be willing to
cover it for longer

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:20.530
than four to six sessions.

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.890
So a lot of reasons
you might not want it.

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:28.270
You might not want to have a
diagnosis, in which case, you

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.042
would probably need
to pay out-of-pocket.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:40.000
So in addition to
that, there's issues,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.130
which are the things you're
going to therapy for--

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.800
more on those in a little bit.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.200
Those top two are probably
the most important ones

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.730
to select for.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:53.440
The rest of it is a little more
based on what your needs are.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.930
So sexuality is if you
need a therapist who's

00:36:55.930 --> 00:36:58.990
competent with gay, lesbian,
bisexual, or otherwise

00:36:58.990 --> 00:37:01.030
queer clients.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:03.830
The only options listed are
gay, lesbian, or bisexual,

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:05.650
but selecting one of those.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.920
There's gender, so some people
will prefer a female therapist.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.140
Some will prefer
a male therapist.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.570
You can sort it by gender
so that it only shows

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:19.859
you male or female therapists.

00:37:19.859 --> 00:37:21.400
Language-- if you
need your therapist

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:25.880
to speak a language other than
English, there's a whole list.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.872
Faith-- sometimes
therapists advertise

00:37:27.872 --> 00:37:29.330
their religion or
the religion they

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.270
specialize in working with.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:34.540
There's a whole list there, too.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.480
Types of therapy-- this
takes a little more knowledge

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:41.740
about what you're looking
for and what kind of therapy

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.280
is out there.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.220
But if you have a
preference, maybe someone's

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.880
recommended that you go
get EMDR for your trauma.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:54.942
Or maybe you would prefer to
get cognitive behavior therapy.

00:37:54.942 --> 00:37:57.400
But there's also stuff out
there like art therapy and dance

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.570
movement therapy.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:01.240
And maybe that's more
your style and sounds

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.170
more appealing to you.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:07.990
But there's also online therapy.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:10.870
Some therapists offer
video counseling.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:14.320
Generally, video counseling
is somewhat less effective

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.260
than in person, because
there's less information

00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.700
for the therapist to go on.

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.710
But there can be reasons
that you might see--

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:24.435
you might go for
video counseling only.

00:38:24.435 --> 00:38:26.560
So there's a whole bunch
of reasons for counseling,

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.370
as we were talking
about earlier.

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:32.920
And the list of issues on
the Psychology Today website

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.232
is pretty comprehensive.

00:38:34.232 --> 00:38:36.190
I mean, it doesn't have
everything, everything.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:37.960
But it has quite a lot.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:42.580
So maybe you're having a
chronic relapse issue, or anger

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:47.800
management, learning
disabilities, pregnancy,

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.690
prenatal or
postpartum depression,

00:38:51.690 --> 00:38:53.920
needing some
medication management,

00:38:53.920 --> 00:39:03.700
or grief, or infidelity, or
suicidal ideation, depression,

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.516
impulsivity, career counseling--
there's a whole bunch of things

00:39:07.516 --> 00:39:09.140
that you might be
going to therapy for.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:16.310
And then selecting a therapist--
so you've got this huge list.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.410
And now what?

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:23.110
Again, a whole list of letters--

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.110
we've gone over a
number of those.

00:39:25.110 --> 00:39:27.350
The only one I think I
haven't defined in there

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:30.890
is NCC, which is a
National Counsel--

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.290
certified counselor.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.929
And that means that they
have passed the NCE, which

00:39:36.929 --> 00:39:38.720
is the National Counseling
Exam, which they

00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:42.440
had to do if they're in Colorado
to get their license practicing

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.870
counselor, anyway.

00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:47.600
So a lot of LPCs
will also be in NCCs.

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:56.940
Registered psychotherapists,
LPCCs and LSWs--

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:04.170
LSWSs-- so a registered
psychotherapist

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:05.665
is a Colorado only thing.

00:40:05.665 --> 00:40:07.290
A couple of other
states have something

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.210
similar or comparative.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:11.970
But if you're a registered
psychotherapist,

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:14.850
it means you are not licensed.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:17.610
It does not necessarily
mean that you

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:21.330
have a master's
degree or a supervisor

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:24.570
or much training at all.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:27.060
In the state of
Colorado, all it means

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:29.340
is that you've taken
the jurisprudence exam

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:33.840
to pass a very legalese
exam on the legality

00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:39.480
around counseling and
your ethical requirements,

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:43.770
and you've gotten the department
of regulatory agencies

00:40:43.770 --> 00:40:46.530
to sign off and give
you a license number.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:49.110
So a registered psychotherapist
might not necessarily

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.580
be unqualified.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.040
I mean a lot of times, interns--

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.220
so people who haven't
graduated grad school yet

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:58.801
and are interning somewhere
under a supervisor--

00:40:58.801 --> 00:41:00.300
might be registered
psychotherapist.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.900
It's kind of a CYA
on the legal end.

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.620
LPCCs are people who have their
master's degree in counseling

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:12.180
and have passed their exam,
their national counseling exam.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:17.760
But have not done
the full two years

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.260
and gotten the
full 2,000 hours of

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:23.040
supervised clinical experience
to get their full licensure.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.205
So they're postgraduate,
pre-licensure

00:41:26.205 --> 00:41:28.650
So they're usually
under supervision.

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:31.080
And for other people,
looking remote,

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:36.990
who are not in Colorado,
these letters and stuff

00:41:36.990 --> 00:41:39.340
varies by state.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:44.340
So for instance, in Ohio, an
LPC is the pre-licensure version

00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:48.310
and the LLPC is the
fully licensed version,

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:49.510
just to be confusing.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.330
But in Colorado, it's
LPC is post-licensure.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:54.630
LPCC is pre-licensure.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:59.020
LSW is a pre-licensed,
postgraduate social worker.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:05.290
LCSW is a post-licensure
social worker.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:06.070
Confusing enough?

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.699
So things to keep
in mind when you're

00:42:12.699 --> 00:42:14.240
looking through a
therapist's profile

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.564
is, do you like what they say
on their profile or website?

00:42:17.564 --> 00:42:18.480
Does it appeal to you?

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.820
Does their tone appeal to you?

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:24.300
Do they seem fluffier than
you'd like or more intellectual

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:24.990
than you'd like?

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:29.552
Do they meet your needs?

00:42:29.552 --> 00:42:31.760
Do they work with the issues
that you're looking for?

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.170
Do they work within your
budget or insurance?

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:36.456
Do they work for your location?

00:42:36.456 --> 00:42:38.580
The number of people I've
had message me and ask me

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.430
if I can work with their child,
when I list that I only work

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.450
with adults is pretty high.

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:46.695
So check those things before you
message a potential therapist

00:42:46.695 --> 00:42:51.160
so you're not wasting your time.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.750
So here's an example
of a therapist profile.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.780
I'm using mine,
because that's easy.

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:04.890
So as you can see, we've got
my name, picture, credentials,

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:09.480
summary, a link to my
website, my office address,

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.050
a number to reach me
at, a way to email me.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.600
Under that specialty
section on the left side,

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:18.390
therapists are allowed to
list up to three specialties.

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:20.760
And that's basically
their top three issues

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:24.000
that they specialize in working
with or prefer to work with

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.860
or have the most
experience working with.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.940
And then issues continues on.

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:33.060
I just wasn't able to fit
them all on the screenshot

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.330
of the slide.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:38.430
So that's the first half.

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.960
You also see that up in
the upper left hand corner,

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.912
it says verified by
Psychology Today.

00:43:42.912 --> 00:43:45.120
That means they've checked
your license number to see

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.470
that you are actually licensed.

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.890
And in the second half, it
shows my qualifications,

00:43:52.890 --> 00:43:55.350
years in practice.

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.640
A note on that--
sometimes you might want--

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:00.250
there's advantages to a
therapist with less experience.

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.791
And there's advantages
to a therapist

00:44:01.791 --> 00:44:02.840
with a lot of experience.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.500
Therapists with a
lot of experience

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.700
obviously have more
years on their belts.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.220
They have worked with more
people and more different kinds

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:13.200
of people.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:18.930
Therapists who have
fewer years of practice

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:21.870
often have more up to date,
more recent information,

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:23.954
are a little more flexible.

00:44:23.954 --> 00:44:25.620
So there's little
advantages either way.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:31.890
If you have a lot of alternative
lifestyle or minority

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:37.590
identities that are
not as well-defined

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.990
and/or well-known in
older generations,

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:44.970
then seeing a younger
therapist can be a good go to.

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:47.910
If you are concerned
that you might

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:49.577
be too much for a
therapist or that they

00:44:49.577 --> 00:44:51.993
might be overwhelmed by you
or not know how to handle you,

00:44:51.993 --> 00:44:54.390
going to a more experienced
therapist is not a bad idea.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:01.930
So this also has that
I work with adults.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:03.250
I work with LGBT clients.

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:07.261
It shows the modality.

00:45:07.261 --> 00:45:08.260
I work with individuals.

00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:10.060
I don't do couples and
family at this time.

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.060
So if you were looking
for couples counseling,

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:13.060
you'd go somewhere else.

00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:18.670
It also has what I
[INAUDIBLE],, what I charge,

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:21.310
and what payment methods I take,
any insurance plans I take,

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:22.630
which is currently none.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:27.040
I hope to change that, but like
I said, a lot of paper work.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:27.640
Yes?

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.895
AUDIENCE: Is there any
unique way to interpret

00:45:30.895 --> 00:45:32.805
the average cost per session?

00:45:32.805 --> 00:45:34.180
DANI HIGGINS: So
the average cost

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:37.750
per session, how
to interpret it?

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:40.886
AUDIENCE: I guess the
question is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:40.886 --> 00:45:42.230
DANI HIGGINS: How what?

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:43.230
AUDIENCE: How low is it?

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:45.520
Like, how much information
is really-- is it

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.820
a case by case
[? random thing? ?]

00:45:48.820 --> 00:45:52.090
DANI HIGGINS: So assume that
the highest part of the average

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:53.120
cost--

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.880
so in this case the
$80 to $120-- the $120

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.910
would be the therapist's
standard cost.

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:02.620
$80 would be how low they
will sometimes flux or flex,

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.780
based on your ability to pay.

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:14.080
And their reasons for that
or the criteria for that

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:17.080
would be variable per
therapist, so you'd have

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.721
to ask in the consultation.

00:46:21.370 --> 00:46:23.711
And then types of
therapy is something

00:46:23.711 --> 00:46:25.210
that you don't even
necessarily need

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:26.830
to worry about too
much right away

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:28.889
because unless you
know a lot about what

00:46:28.889 --> 00:46:30.430
different types of
therapy you'd like

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:33.940
or what kind works for you or
you think might work for you.

00:46:33.940 --> 00:46:36.520
Because what's most
important is, actually,

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.830
the relationship between
you and the therapist,

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.050
which we'll get to in a
little bit in more detail.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:48.047
So the first step is you
email or leave a voicemail

00:46:48.047 --> 00:46:50.380
with your name, phone number,
email address, and briefly

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.796
what you're looking
for help with.

00:46:51.796 --> 00:46:54.190
And I say leave a voicemail
because most therapists

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:57.017
are probably not going
to pick up the phone.

00:46:57.017 --> 00:46:58.600
It's pretty standard
practice for them

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:01.510
to just let calls
go to voice mail.

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:05.110
Because you don't want to be
available 24/7 immediately

00:47:05.110 --> 00:47:06.100
to all your clients.

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:09.430
That can lead to some
unhealthy dependencies or you

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:13.160
as a therapist not taking care
of yourself and burning out.

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.909
So it's pretty
standard procedure.

00:47:14.909 --> 00:47:16.700
So if you are calling
a bunch of therapists

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:20.970
and no one's picking up the
phone, that's probably why.

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:23.650
But they should contact you
within the next 24 hours,

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:26.920
by the next business day.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.386
And then most therapists
offer a free consultation,

00:47:29.386 --> 00:47:30.760
either on the
phone or in person.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.900
And this is a
chance to interview

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.030
your potential therapist.

00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:39.730
You're essentially
looking for a--

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:41.050
it's a relationship.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.550
It's a professional
relationship,

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:45.760
but the relationship aspect of
it is the most important part.

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.140
How will you click?

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:49.300
That's hard to find
and hard to figure out

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.630
who you click with, right?

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:52.030
You don't click
with every friend

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:54.730
every potential friend you meet
or every potential partner.

00:47:54.730 --> 00:47:59.260
So this can be some
trial and error.

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.939
And you also want to know,
are they actually going

00:48:01.939 --> 00:48:02.980
to be a good fit for you?

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.650
Some therapists offer
a free initial session,

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:11.570
but I haven't actually
seen that in years.

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:14.651
So I don't know if people
actually do that anymore.

00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:15.650
AUDIENCE: They [? do. ?]

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:16.387
DANI HIGGINS: OK.

00:48:16.387 --> 00:48:17.790
Yeah.

00:48:17.790 --> 00:48:18.490
OK.

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:21.040
So we have someone who
has experienced that

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.724
or know someone who's done that.

00:48:24.724 --> 00:48:26.140
So things you might
ask are what's

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.870
your experience with the issue
I'm coming to see you for?

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:32.590
What's your experience
with my demographic?

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:34.430
Like, maybe, I'm a trans person.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:36.460
What's your
experience with that?

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:43.330
So you might also ask how would
you work with someone like me

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:45.500
or someone in my situation?

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.990
Get a little bit of a feel for
what their approach might be.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.460
Have you been in
therapy, or do you

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.740
get consultation
and supervision?

00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:57.830
This is-- maybe feels a little
challenging to ask a therapist.

00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.080
And I understand if you don't.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.350
But I really recommend it,
because it's a really bad sign

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.855
if your therapist has not
had therapy themselves.

00:49:05.855 --> 00:49:08.230
They need to be able to have
that awareness of themselves

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:10.063
in order to provide
therapy to other people.

00:49:12.974 --> 00:49:15.390
And anything else you might
be concerned or curious about.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.860
So certain
therapeutic approaches

00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:24.080
are more effective than others.

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:28.840
This is efficacy of different
treatment approaches

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.210
is hard to study, and
it's highly debatable.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:35.080
The best we can figure is
that some treatment approaches

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.570
are better for certain
disorders than others.

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:44.800
But even then, it's a very
minor significance in efficacy

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:46.470
from the studies we've done.

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:50.020
What we do across so
many different studies

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:51.610
at this point--

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:54.550
the link I have down
there is to a meta

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:56.230
analysis of all of those--

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:58.450
is that the quality of the
therapeutic relationship

00:49:58.450 --> 00:50:01.390
is the primary
predictor of change.

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:04.360
And mind you, quality
of the relationship

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.450
doesn't mean that you
never have difficulties

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:10.810
or that you never have
conflict or that it's just

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.586
really easy and stress-free.

00:50:13.586 --> 00:50:15.460
Because actually, we've
found that if there's

00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:17.950
been a rupture, like
a conflict, and then

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:21.310
a successful repair
of that conflict, that

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:27.910
has led to a more healthy,
more change-inducing,

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:31.664
high quality relationship than
if there is no conflict ever

00:50:31.664 --> 00:50:33.580
or if there's a conflict
that wasn't resolved.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.059
So the most important
thing here is,

00:50:38.059 --> 00:50:39.600
when you're interviewing
a therapist,

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.420
your potential therapist, do
you feel like you could maybe

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.630
grow to trust them?

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:46.680
Do you feel like they're
someone you could talk to?

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.600
So do you feel like
this is someone

00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:51.040
you could click with or
have a relationship with,

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:53.730
a therapeutic professional,
talking about some

00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:57.080
of your deep feelings with?

00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:58.830
And then, one is if I
talk about something

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.010
illegal, or some past abuse
that I've experienced,

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:05.250
my therapist will talk to
the police or hospitalize me?

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:08.340
A little tricky--
legally and ethically,

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:11.100
we're bound by HIPPA, which
is the Health Information

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:16.500
Portability and Privacy Act and
confidentiality restrictions.

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:18.990
But there are some
confidentiality exceptions,

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:23.170
things that therapists are
mandated or required to report.

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.930
If you are an immediate
threat to yourself--

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.690
so if you are going
to kill yourself.

00:51:27.690 --> 00:51:28.470
You have a plan.

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:29.940
You have the means.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.760
You're going to do
it after you leave.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.710
They're going to have to
call the police on you.

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:38.340
But if you just say, I'm
thinking about killing myself.

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:40.170
That's not immediately you're
going to be hospitalized.

00:51:40.170 --> 00:51:41.240
That's going to
be-- the therapist

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.530
is going to go, OK, we're
going to do a suicide risk

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.780
assessment now.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:47.939
And they'll go
over some questions

00:51:47.939 --> 00:51:49.230
and try to build a safety plan.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:52.330
They don't want to call the
police on you, trust me.

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:55.270
That's not a good
feeling for anyone.

00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:57.770
So if there's any possible
way we can be safe,

00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:00.840
get you to be safe without
that, that'd be great.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:06.480
Or if you can go to the
hospital of your own volition--

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.850
much better.

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:12.030
Danger to others--
if you are going,

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.299
I'm going to go
shoot this person,

00:52:14.299 --> 00:52:16.590
and I'm going to do it after
I leave here with this gun

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:17.970
that I have in my car.

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:20.230
They're going to call
the police on you.

00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:22.360
Again, this is going to
be a talk it through.

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:27.090
And try to evaluate if
you're an immediate threat.

00:52:27.090 --> 00:52:29.350
Or a danger to space
others might be in--

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:31.275
I'm going to go
blow the building.

00:52:31.275 --> 00:52:33.900
That's going to-- we're going to
have to call the police on you

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:36.450
again.

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.880
If there's child abuse or
neglect happening right now,

00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:40.470
like, if you were
abused as a child

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:44.370
and it's not likely that your
abuser has access to children

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:48.750
now, then that's not
a mandatory report.

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:51.360
If you know a child is
being abused right now,

00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.940
and you have given the
therapist the address

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:57.082
or location or names, then
they have to report that.

00:52:57.082 --> 00:52:59.040
And ideally, they'll walk
you through reporting

00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:01.920
it yourself or you two
can report it together.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.620
But they're required
to report if there's

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:09.180
child abuse or neglect when
they have enough knowledge

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:11.370
for identification--

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.200
same with at-risk
elder abuse or neglect.

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:23.610
So if your spouse or your
doctor called the therapist

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:26.160
and asked anything
about you, they

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.930
have to say I can
neither confirm nor deny

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.617
that that person is
seeing therapy here.

00:53:30.617 --> 00:53:32.950
Unless you have filled out a
release of information form

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:37.530
for that person, which
specifies what they can share.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.290
Court orders will sometimes also
be a confidentiality exception,

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:44.090
if there is a significant
court order for the therapist

00:53:44.090 --> 00:53:45.150
to release their notes.

00:53:47.862 --> 00:53:50.070
And I'm going to speed
through this as fast as I can,

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:52.180
because I'm running
short on time here.

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:54.607
So your first session,
you get orientation.

00:53:54.607 --> 00:53:56.440
They'll tell you, like,
did you get here OK?

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.470
Here is where the bathroom is.

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:00.336
Here's who I am.

00:54:00.336 --> 00:54:01.710
There's probably
intake paperwork

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:05.130
that you might have filled
out before the session that

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:07.770
develops the therapist's
policies and procedures

00:54:07.770 --> 00:54:09.760
and probably lets
you give a history.

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.759
And there's the getting
to know you phase, which

00:54:11.759 --> 00:54:14.040
is one to three
sessions sometimes,

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:17.920
where they get your
history, do any assessments.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.850
So on a scale of
one to five, rate

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:24.869
this thing for the past
two weeks, sort of thing.

00:54:24.869 --> 00:54:26.910
And figuring out your
goals for therapy together.

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:29.431
What do you want out of therapy?

00:54:29.431 --> 00:54:31.680
There's an idea that therapy
takes years or takes four

00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.420
to six sessions, which is--

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:38.790
before the Affordable
Care Act, insurance

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:42.240
would cover four to six sessions
and that was usually about it,

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.740
with flex, based on need.

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:50.120
But the length of therapy varies
per person and their needs.

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:53.250
For about 50% of clients,
it takes 15 to 20 sessions

00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:56.100
to be pretty much better.

00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.300
And a lot of people like to
go 20 to 30 sessions over six

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:03.180
months to really feel like
symptoms are fully in remission

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.310
and got a handle on it
and it's stabilized.

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:09.900
And 12 to 18 month
duration or longer

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:13.680
for some co-occurring
conditions or chronic problems.

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:16.770
I specialized in
trauma, in PTSD.

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:19.530
So a lot of my clients, I
see for six months to a year

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:21.690
and sometimes a little longer--

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:23.040
is my usual with clients.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.945
But shorter is
definitely possible.

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:30.840
And how do you get the
most out of therapy?

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.782
Honesty versus
dishonesty-- therapists

00:55:32.782 --> 00:55:33.990
aren't actually mind readers.

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:38.070
They don't actually teach
us that in grad school.

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:40.800
So if you're not
honest, then they

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:43.400
have to take you at face
value a lot of times.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.930
It's not fun for anyone
and it's not productive

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:49.230
for me to try to figure out
when you're telling truth,

00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:50.250
when you're not.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.776
It works much better if
I'm just believing you.

00:55:52.776 --> 00:55:54.150
And so I tell
people straight up.

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:55.399
I'm just going to believe you.

00:55:55.399 --> 00:55:57.660
It's no great feat
to deceive me.

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.120
Because I'm just going to
choose to believe what you say,

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.350
what you share with me.

00:56:02.350 --> 00:56:05.400
And I will call you out if
there is inconsistencies,

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.040
because maybe there's some
self-deception going on.

00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:10.020
But I'm going to believe
what you say to me

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:12.478
and believe that you're going
to be honest, because there's

00:56:12.478 --> 00:56:14.670
no point in this otherwise.

00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.940
Openness versus closedness--
actually sharing stuff

00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.996
rather than holding stuff
back or hiding stuff.

00:56:20.996 --> 00:56:22.120
Obviously, this takes time.

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:25.620
You want to build trust
first with your therapist.

00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:29.111
And this can be hard to learn
how to do, so that takes time,

00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:29.610
too.

00:56:29.610 --> 00:56:34.470
But efforts towards being open,
rather than just being silent

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:36.930
or holding stuff
way back, will get

00:56:36.930 --> 00:56:38.850
you to get more out of therapy.

00:56:38.850 --> 00:56:40.350
And willingness
versus willfulness--

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:43.620
being willing to
try stuff out, even

00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:46.770
if it's really silly
sounding or feels awkward,

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:47.979
that your therapist suggests.

00:56:47.979 --> 00:56:49.395
Versus going, no,
that won't work.

00:56:49.395 --> 00:56:50.339
No, that won't work.

00:56:50.339 --> 00:56:51.630
No, I'm not going to try that--

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:54.160
you know, shooting
down everything.

00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:56.790
You're not going to get a lot
out of it if you don't actually

00:56:56.790 --> 00:56:57.290
try.

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.340
OK.

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.300
We are very close to
time, but I will try

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.390
to take a couple of questions.

00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:08.944
Oh-- electroconvulsive therapy--

00:57:08.944 --> 00:57:10.860
the effectiveness of
electroconvulsive therapy

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:11.693
and myths and facts.

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.080
I do not feel I'm
entirely qualified

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:20.376
to talk about that
one, because that's not

00:57:20.376 --> 00:57:22.500
something I personally have
studied in great depth.

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:31.140
It definitely used to be
a more common thing that

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.630
was considered to be not
as effective in the way it

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:34.920
was used.

00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.021
But then there's
been developments.

00:57:37.021 --> 00:57:38.520
I know that some
people still use it

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:43.030
in a much different
approach than it

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:45.180
used to be used that
might be more therapeutic.

00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:46.440
But I am really not sure.

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:48.910
I'm going on very
fuzzy memory here.

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:52.086
This is not my area.

00:57:52.086 --> 00:57:54.210
Advice for talking to loved
ones who could possibly

00:57:54.210 --> 00:57:56.001
benefit from therapy,
but believe something

00:57:56.001 --> 00:57:56.850
along the lines of--

00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:58.560
I've been to therapy in the
past and it hasn't helped.

00:57:58.560 --> 00:57:59.393
So what's the point?

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.975
So going back to that
willingness and openness

00:58:04.975 --> 00:58:07.350
about therapy-- therapy doesn't
work if you're not honest

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:09.540
open and willing.

00:58:09.540 --> 00:58:11.820
If you're feeling
coerced to go to therapy

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.620
or are pressured
to go to therapy,

00:58:13.620 --> 00:58:18.120
and you're not engaged
or willing or motivated

00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:20.680
for yourself, you're not going
to get as much out of it.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.930
It's going to be a lot harder.

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:24.540
You're going to
spend months getting

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:29.580
to the feeling motivated and
buy in stage before you actually

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.460
do the work of therapy.

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:34.780
And that can be
part of the process.

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:37.350
But it's a lot of money to spend
on something you're just not

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:40.920
really willing to
do or invested in

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:45.420
or prepared for at this point.

00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:51.040
So I have worked with
someone for a year

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.480
who was very ambivalent,
very not entirely motivated.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.940
And it was exhausting for
both of us, I'm pretty sure.

00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:58.773
I just felt we were
going around in circles,

00:58:58.773 --> 00:59:01.020
and there were times
where I was, like, really?

00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.505
Are you sure you
want to be here?

00:59:02.505 --> 00:59:05.364
If you're not getting
benefit out of this,

00:59:05.364 --> 00:59:06.780
you should not be
paying me money,

00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.363
and I should not be
taking your money.

00:59:08.363 --> 00:59:10.740
They're, like, no,
no, no, no, no.

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:14.460
So after about a
year, they finally

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:18.030
left for a month or two,
and then they came back.

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:20.825
And I'm like, OK, so--

00:59:20.825 --> 00:59:22.200
you have to buckle
down and work.

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:26.100
Or this needs to end, because
I cannot ethically continue

00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.191
to see you if you're
not getting benefit.

00:59:28.191 --> 00:59:29.940
And, like, no, I'm
really ready this time.

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:32.064
I've had these experiences
over the time I was out,

00:59:32.064 --> 00:59:33.150
and I really want to work.

00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:36.030
And then they suddenly over
the course of three months

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:37.130
made huge progress.

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:41.480
They went from a
level 1 to level 2.5.

00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:44.910
And so when someone's at
that point of readiness

00:59:44.910 --> 00:59:48.840
then they can get
a lot of benefit.

00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:52.680
If they're just trying to be
convinced by everyone else,

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.800
and they're not
willing or ready,

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.550
they're not going to
get a lot of benefit.

00:59:56.550 --> 00:59:59.400
And there isn't going
to be much of a point.

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.540
And getting them there--

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.237
sometimes you just have
to be patient and talk

01:00:06.237 --> 01:00:07.320
from your own experiences.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.977
Maybe therapy has
helped you a lot

01:00:08.977 --> 01:00:11.310
and you can share how it
helped you without telling them

01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:12.960
what they should be doing.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.430
Speaking from your
experience can

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:18.810
be one of the more
powerful ways of swaying

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:22.650
someone or influencing someone,
rather than telling them

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:23.820
what they should be doing.

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.710
Again, that should
word is more shaming.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.460
Well, thank you.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.510
Appreciate it.

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:33.960
[APPLAUSE]
