Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:05          All right, so we touched on the first amendment a little bit in the first half, but I think there's also just a fundamental misunderstanding about what speech is related to the First Amendment in that the first amendment basically is about what the government is not allowed to do. And people have now extrapolated that to think it means what everyone can't do. Can you talk to, is that famous xkcd comment comic about, uh, people have the right to tell you you're an asshole on the internet and it doesn't violate the first amendment. And that's true, although I see it all day long, I get, yes, I get that comic thrown at me sometimes even when it's a government institution doing the censorship. So it's, it's overused a little bit too. And that Kinda just gets in my craw a little bit. But the first amendment really only does protect you from the government and it doesn't just protect you from Congress and protects you from the states and protects you from the mis municipalities.

Speaker 2:          00:55          It protects you from the public colleges and universities and their administrators. Um, those are all state actors for the First Amendment when it doesn't protect you against is your private employer. Um, which means that I could well be fired for anything I say on this show today. I'll see what I can do. Um, not to give you an idea is yeah. Uh, you know, your parents don't, uh, if you say, I remember her saying free speech to my parents and I was very young probably right after I read it about the Skokie case and my mother giving me a side eye either probably burn a hole through my skull at this point. Um, but you know, it only protects you against the government. It doesn't protect you from criticism of your peers and your contemporaries and it shouldn't, you know, that's kind of part and parcel of having the public conversation is if you have a bad idea and you're out there spouting it, we all have the right to tell you you got a shitty idea and we should say that because otherwise, well we might see that shitty idea spreading.

Speaker 2:          01:54          And that's kind of the point of, like we were talking about earlier about letting these terrible ideas out there is so that we can stand up and defeat them. Yeah. Are you seeing any major threats right now from the government related to free speech? Because a lot of times I'll see people saying, well, Trump is attacking this, or you know, he texts journalism a lot now. It's no secret what my feeling about the mainstream media is these days. I mean I think it's largely just partisan garbage. I don't think you should be killing these people are harming these people in any way. Just to be very clear, I hope that by by mocking them and exposing their nonsense, we'll get a new generation of better journalists and people who really live to the code of trying to find truth and all of that. But do you see a direct threat right now coming from the government, either from Trump or or elsewhere?

Speaker 2:          02:41          There's always a direct threat yet. I mean, let's be clear. People in power will always, if given the opportunity, silence their opponents, they will preserve the status quo. And it's not just people in power. It is an entirely human reaction to want to censor the people we disagree with. We think we have terrible ideas. That's kind of a baser instincts that we all have. Now. We have to overcome that and understand the value of, of not doing that, but it's, it's kind of understandable and weight and that's why we have to be so vigilant in protecting free speech because once the tools are there, they don't go away. And we've seen this throughout history and they are wielded and people laughed at me when I was talking during the election cycle to I guess kind of betray some of my personal political beliefs. Then, you know, I was kind of talking about how the executive branch overreach as many people did of the last administration was problematic because you know, what about the next guy who comes to power?

Speaker 2:          03:43          Maybe he's going to do something crazy and nobody, they all laughed at me. Hey, I was talking about that then I was talking about it when Bush was doing it. I was talking about it when Obama was doing it, and I tell you, he laughed. And then Donald J. Trump was elected president. And I looked at them and I said, what now? Uh, and you know, you, you said, oh, it couldn't be possible that somebody, we disagree with all that much who we think is really terrible would ever get elected president. And when they started melting down over the election, I looked at them and I said, told yourself, you can't be forwarded if executive actions when it's the guy you like, but then not for them when it's the guy you don't like, of course they're all going to do it if you give them the power to do it.

Speaker 2:          04:30          And it's the same thing with free speech. And I think what's really important to remember is that those mechanisms, there's tools of censorship are never ever going to run down to the benefit of the marginalized communities that people are oftentimes seeking to protect. It just doesn't happen. The reason that I'm marginalized is that they don't have political power. They're not going to be the ones implementing these rules. And that's incredibly problematic and people don't understand that very practical reality that those tools of censorship are going to be used to defend the status quo, which is what these people are trying to disrupt. And disruption is kind of the, just the major threat that everyone in power fields. And we've seen it throughout history, that they're in the civil rights movement. When protestors were arrested for sitting at lunch counters or for engaging in nonviolent protest, but were arrested for disorderly conduct because people reacted to their protests in violent ways because there were violent Vicodin thugs.

Speaker 2:          05:38          They were only exonerated because of the first amendment. And it took going to the supreme court. And it's really important to remember, I mean how many LGBT artists and authors and publications faced censorship and had their materials deemed obscenity at times and not even sent through the mail. You know, sometimes before you know, food and preventing them from integrating into the national consciousness. I mean it's, it's really, really important. So is there something happening right now via the government that you think shouldn't be happening? I get the broad sense, sort of the, the blue sky version of this that yes, people in power always are going to want to maintain power and do what they have to do to silence people, etc. But at the college and university level specifically, I think a lot of it is coming from um, the Department of Justice. Uh, and the office for civil rights of the Department of Education a few years back had an agreement that they called a blueprint for sexual harassment policies at colleges and universities.

Speaker 2:          06:45          And it basically defines sexual harassment is any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including verbal conduct, which we also know as speech. Yeah. And the breathtaking broadness of that policy really kind of spread like wildfire. Um, and you know, these harassment policies have always kind of been problematic at times. This is directly tied to title nine, right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. And you know, it's, it's one of the, I don't know if it's even an unintended consequence. It might be a very well unintended consequence, but you start seeing things at, for example, just the number of years back, there was a student at the University of Oregon who was sitting on the ledge in a dorm room window and she saw a couple outside and as a joke she shouted, I hit it first, which I didn't even know what that meant when it first came in and I had to look it up and realize that it was about Rayjay.

Speaker 2:          07:44          Uh, having sex with Kim Kardashian and Kanye. I guess that's a thing people care about nowadays. I don't know, you know, behind the, he is the leader of the free speech movement now. So boy, maybe I do need to find another job. But anyways, that the couple was offended and ran upstairs and talk to the Ra and this student was hit with several disciplinary charges including sexual harassment. First just shouting. I hit it first. And this is because of the latitude that these laws gave colleges too. Once, you know, department of Education said, this is what we consider sexual harassment. No College University administrator in the right mind is going to look at that and say, oh, we'll just ignore that. They're going to write new policies because they don't want huge investigations that costs a lot of money, take a lot of time, and have ultimately the potential to cost the school all of its federal funding when it comes down to it.

Speaker 2:          08:39          So we've seen the proliferation of these really broad policies, some of which have hilarious lists of examples of things that could constitute sexual harassment, like inappropriately directed laughter, elevator eyes is another fire fame for it. These are all things that are known as flirting, recording or whatever you want to call it. I'm sure there's a whole their term, but like that's how you meet people. And sometimes it really is, and honestly it's the sexual harassment angle has become a broader discriminatory harassment angle because a lot of these policies start to look the same based on any protected class. And so when you say that, you know, any unwelcome comment based on a protected class, you know, and that's drawing from a particular policy or anything is harass discriminatory harassment. Well that's a big problem because that cuts off subjectively, whichever way you go. Basically half of a debate, people for instance, on different sides of affirmative action are both going to find their opponents ideology probably offensive.

Speaker 2:          09:48          Of course, if you are against affirmative action for whatever reason, you might be, uh, people who support affirmative action, they're going to say, well that is discriminatory based on a protected class race and they shouldn't be allowed to say that. And yet we've seen students hosting events like affirmative action bake sales to kind of make a point about what they think is the unfairness and affirmative action. And administrators have tried to shut them down and sometimes have succeeded and shutting them down. Uh, and you know, I can give you countless examples of things just like that, but it's dangerous because it kind of creates an orthodoxy of what we're allowed to say, what we're allowed to think. And you know, there is no position in that. I can think of that. And I can say actually I think there is no position that shouldn't be subject to challenge.

Speaker 2:          10:44          There is nothing that shouldn't be susceptible to somebody disagreeing with it in a public way and starting that conversation. Nobody has the right to declare this is how it is. That is, I guess our collective to circle all the way back to the beginning. It's our collective right to participate in that decision of what we believe. Yeah, and that's why I have such the problem with this related to the way that the modern left bules with these things. Because if you're going to say, all right, we're not going to draw cartoons about certain things. Now I'm not saying you should go out of your way to offend people, but once you say we're going to allow certain things not to be done, you've handed all of your faculty, all of your power, all of your decision making capability over to a certain set of people.

Speaker 2:          11:34          It doesn't matter what those, what those people believe in or are. But then it's like, well then they know, well we got them with something and we can just keep going and going and going. And before you know it, you know it's too late to, to fight back. I mean, and again, it's going to backfire. It's going to backfire against the people. And, and I think that you see it backfiring sometimes. You look at the faculty members recently who have been targeted by outrage mobs and people calling for their heads or their jobs or sometimes both. Yeah. Um, and they, sometimes when, by the way, and my good friend Brett wines, then it still does not have a job. Just recently for more striking example even is a Fresno state ran to Gerard treated, you know, some intemperate and not particularly polite things about Barbara Bush right after she died.

Speaker 2:          12:22          Um, and you're being very kind and she can do whatever she wants. But yeah, it was pretty nasty stuff. My mother told me never to speak ill of the dead and so, you know, I don't know. I don't know. No, I mean you were being nice to, to what was tweeted feelings on here and it was the right that was calling for her head and we, I mean, one of my colleagues, I felt really bad. I was, I was the one who helped write the letter, but he was the one who wrote our public facing blog post on the website. He was getting hate mail and probably still is getting hate mail from people saying, how could you defend this woman? How could you, I mean, it goes both ways. Everyone's going to sense try and censor their opponent. So just really be careful. Right.

Speaker 2:          13:05          Well, I'm glad you brought that one up. So basically this, this woman who's, she's a professor, right? She tweeted some really nasty stuff about Barbara Bush who had just died and by, by every account, Barbara Bush was a totally decent woman, but that's actually irrelevant for this. And yes. Then the right started screaming and oh, she should be fired. She should be fired. She was not fired. The Fresno state. She's still there. Um, I thought, wow, this is an exact example of how free speech is supposed to work. She said what she wanted people mocked her or supported her. The university decided to make a decision. Now, it's interesting. If the university had fired her, let's say they had said, these ideas are beyond the pale, and then people started digging into some other things that she's said that are, that are pretty radical. If that had happened, would you guys have offered her defense?

Speaker 2:          13:50          Because doesn't the university have the right to make the decisions that it wants? I don't know what their policies are on on tenure, for example, or that sort of thing, but don't they have the right to employ people that they want to be employed or not? Not that I want to give that power to the mob because we know that the mob does awful things. It depends when the government as an employer, the government actually is restricted in what it can do for a, an with her spot respect to an employees off duty speech when a, and I think that's particularly important with faculty members who are supposed to be public intellectuals. They're supposed to be out there and kind of discussing and debating and this is what we expect out of faculty members at colleges and universities. But when the government is the employer and the speeches made as a private citizen on a matter of public concern is this very clearly was then the government has to make a pretty high showing that that speech so materially interferes with the provision of services that the government is involved in, that it warrants overcoming the employer employees first amendment rights.

Speaker 2:          14:58          And we actually wrote a long letter and was co-signed they by the Aclu of Northern California, uh, the electronic frontier foundation and a whole bunch of other, uh, organizations and on dryers behalf and sent it in. Incidentally, shortly after they got our letter, the, a university issued their statement that they weren't going to discipline her. Right. So you are making the distinction in this case that because this was not on campus, this wasn't being in a class, you know, taught in the class or, or brainwashing students in the class name that's different what she's doing on her private side. And especially because as you said, as a public intellectual, you're supposed to be talking about stuff that that's different than perhaps if she had said these very same things in class, they could have taken a different stance that maybe would've had a little more legal positioning.

Speaker 2:          15:47          Is that fair to say? That's where it gets tricky because there's a circumstance. Um, the Supreme Court, uh, back in 2006 held that speech made pursuant to official job duties is basically speech that's commissioned by the government and therefore it does not have first amendment protection. You can be fired for it, but they did not decide whether or not that would relate to speech that relates to scholarship or teaching, uh, as a supreme court put it, which is due to the special concern about academic freedom that we have for the reasons of faculty members being public intellectuals. The Fourth Circuit and the ninth circuit or California's have both said that no, this ruling, that speech pursuant to official job duties does not apply at colleges and universities, uh, to speech that relates to scholarship or teaching. So in California she could have been protected either way, but it's not that way all around the country.

Speaker 2:          16:47          Some courts have declined to find that exception to the 2006 Garcetti ruling. Um, others have kind of ignored it for the time being. So one of these days the supreme court's probably going to have to make another decision on that. Yeah. I'm curious, I know you guys are a nonpartisan organization, but if these decisions were left up to the states, do you guys have a position on that in and of itself? I'm sure you have a personal position, but does fire have a position on that? I mean, I think our, our position is that the exception for scholarship or teaching absolutely should be applied across the country. It's really fundamentally important for faculty members to be able to conduct, you know, controversial, disruptive, you know, as it relates to the status quo. Research and writing without fearing for their jobs because that's how we're going to get new ideas.

Speaker 2:          17:41          If you just talk about things that aren't going to rock the boat, if you just research things that aren't going to rock the boat, we're never going to get anywhere you, you need the bomb throwers. Yeah, there's room for that. So what about cases where, and I guess this brings up a little bit related to tenure because I think there is something interesting because it's funny, I hear from professors, I get a ton of emails from professors saying that they love what we're doing here and that they are afraid sometimes tenured professors are still afraid of the mob. They know they're not going to get fired, but they're afraid of the mob. Is there an inherent problem in tenure in a way now? Because you could, if you have that protection, and I'm all for saying whatever you want to say, that technically if you were a history history professor, let's say you could start, you could just start losing your mind and teaching really dishonest, complete reversal of the truth stuff.

Speaker 2:          18:33          Um, and have the protection of not being fired like that actually handicaps the pursuit of knowledge from, from the university, doesn't it? I'm not terribly concerned about that because generally speaking, there are ways for faculty to be disciplined or are removed even with tenure, oftentimes for gross professional, you know, competency issues. Um, you know, if you are, say, teaching math and you're teaching students that two plus two is 17, I think that's in common core. You can, there's ways that the university can address that and that's not really what we're seeing. What we're seeing more often as a, for instance, the professor who's teaching physics, who is on the side of the Holocaust Denier, uh, and he's, you know, maybe not necessarily teaching that in class, but does that have any ramifications for his ability to teach physics? Probably not. Um, that's not a competency competency to teach the topic that you were hired to teach things.

Speaker 2:          19:39          But if it leaked into the classroom then that then it's a separate issue. That's, well, if you are teaching a class on physics and find some occasion to talk about the Holocaust, I think you're probably not teaching the thing that you are hired to do and then it's up to the school to decide what to do. Yeah, that's a different problem I think. Um, I think that that indicates pretty squarely along with the denial of the Holocaust happened that you are in fact losing your mind. Right. So what are some of the cases may be one or two cases that you guys are working on right now or that you have your eye on right now that you think are particularly relevant that people should know about? Well, we just issued a press release this morning. In fact, uh, just Amir hour or two before I came here, uh, at Syracuse University where we sent a letter on Friday.

Speaker 2:          20:23          Uh, this one is, it's just bananas. Yeah. Let me pause you for a second. I haven't read it yet, but I wanted to go to Syracuse to be in broadcasting because I wanted to be like a news anchor or a or a sports center anchor road. I really want it to be, but there are big broadcasting school, so I'm already fascinated by this as a place that's, you know, about disseminating information. Well, you might be glad you didn't hear this. Here we go. A fraternity had an event every year where the pledges or new members would come in. It was a private event and they would do skits that roasted the other members of the fraternity. A lot of fraternities have this kind of tradition. Um, I'm pretty sure that minded. But they went through some skits and one of them, for example, was making fun of a member of the fraternity who was a known and vocal Trump supporter and conservative.

Speaker 2:          21:21          So they satirized him by having somebody who is supposed to be him starting as rival fraternity. That was quote unquote a white empire. And to join people had to take a horrifically racist, antisemitic, uh, oath and sounds like it's all in good fun. Well, whatever. May Be tasteless, but all in good fun. You know what they're, they're satirizing and it's no different than you see comedians doing all the time on a stage. Satirizing people. Yeah. Uh, another one was, uh, they Saturdays, one of their brothers for being chronically whipped by his girlfriend and portrayed him as a mentally retarded and they had him in a wheelchair and all that stuff and this was all on a private event. And you hear the laughter in the audience indicated that nobody was really offended by it. They understood this is kind of just poking fun at people.

Speaker 2:          22:13          The problem is that videos of it leaked and the student newspaper published them, which you know, they have the right to do as well. You can't begrudge them that. And of course, as you might imagine, outrage erupted and the, within a matter of days the fraternity had been expelled permanently from campus. 18 students have been charged with disciplinary conduct or business disciplinary code violations and they're being threatened with suspension or expulsion. Uh, and this is like all right before finals. And meanwhile a, an adjunct faculty member had the gall to express concern about how the university was handling all of this and they immediately told them, uh, because you've used don't align with ours, you are no longer qualified to teach at Syracuse University unbelief. And it's incredibly author authoritarian sounding. I mean, they are, they're just reeling to steamroll over anybody who gets in their way in pursuit of really just giving somebody a head on a pike so that the crowd is mollified, you know, it's, I mean, it's nuts.

Speaker 2:          23:22          They've charged them with, uh, sexual harassment, discriminatory harassment. Uh, nevermind the fact that nobody who the speech was actually intended for actually was offended by it. It didn't, it's not their fault. You know, they don't know how the videos lead. They are posting to a private Facebook page and somebody must've had to somebody's computer or something like that. But the speech was purely private and nobody was offended by it. And if every conversation between two students can be the grounds for disciplinary investigation because a third party later found out what was said during that conversation. Well, um, we'd all be in jail. Yeah, exactly. It reduces free speech to a complete melody. It's crazy. Uh, and you know, it's just, it's really, it's galling and be just really harsh and punitive, uh, bent of the, of the university and all of this is mystifying. Wait, so just on the technical side now, because this is something good that Trump's done related to this, because he got rid of a lot of the title nine expansions and all that and device and they got rid of that stuff, which I assume you agree with, right?

Speaker 2:          24:35          Basically. I mean, it's stuff that we had spent a lot of time fighting against. Right. Okay. So Obama expanded at Trump, got rid of it. I think for the nae in the name of free speech, when you hear stories of like Laura Kipnis who I've had on and and many others, the witch hunts that happen that are crazy. So these policies that they're saying that these students violated, these have nothing to do with government policies, right? These, they're saying they violated school policies, is that correct? I just want to be clear. They're discriminatory harassment policies are obviously drawn on a lot of the same language because they receive federal money in the form of student loans and things like that. So they actually still have to adhere to title nine, even though they're not a state institution, obviously. Um, but you know, they, they've been charged with this laundry list of offenses.

Speaker 2:          25:19          Uh, they've, the administration has been rushing through trying to kind of get the process over with as soon as possible. Meanwhile, not giving them really a lot of details until just recently in terms of what the charges are based on and, and all of this. I mean, it's very clearly a steam rolling and, uh, it's, it's outrageous. Uh, and you know, that's kind of the most recent thing. So tell me a little bit about how you guys get involved in that. So, okay, so you issue a press statement now or a press release. Now they know they have a little bit of public defense. Do you guys actually work with the students? Like just kind of lay out how that whole process goes? Yeah, so, uh, on our website we have a, a format anyone can fill out to request help. And me and my team every morning we'll go through the case submissions and, uh, we'll review them and, you know, follow up for more documentation if necessary.

Speaker 2:          26:09          And like I said, we get damn near close to a thousand of them a year now, uh, which is a lot of work. Um, and we investigate and develop the cases and figure out what the best situation, you know, the best possible tactics in each case would be. Um, usually the next step involves writing a letter telling the university which in Syracuse case we sent out on Friday, uh, telling them, hey, this is the applicable law, are these the, the political applicable norms that you should be adhering to as though college, um, and here's why what you're doing has run a fall of all of that. Um, generally speaking, you know, we'll wait for a response, uh, in good faith, given the university some time to acknowledge our concerns and work through them. And, you know, otherwise we will, excuse me, issue a press release and start bringing public pressure to bear sometimes in public college and university cases.

Speaker 2:          27:03          We'll take it to litigation if we have to. Not every case, obviously, because you know, there's a range of cases that are, uh, you know, make for a good lawsuit. But even just recently filed the lawsuit of Joliet Junior College, and this is kind of again, kind of flips the narrative a little bit because it was a students who saw, uh, people, uh, basically talking about how capitalism is great and decided that she wanted to make a good point about socialism. So she handed out, you know, and distributed flyers about how, you know, they said shutdown capitalism, inviting people to like a workshop, uh, about socialism. This was actually not far from where I live in Chicago's and Joliet junior college. And she was actually confronted by a number of campus police officers who pulled her into an interrogation room, demanded to examine the flyers and then confiscated them and saying, you can't do that here.

Speaker 2:          27:57          You know, the, the political climate, you know right now is, you know, might start something. I'm actually shocked to hear it happening that the story is not the reverse big. This is an odd one. I'm glad you used it as an example. Actually, you know, it goes to show, I actually, you know, you'll be interested to hear this. I, my, my team and I actually did a really a quick analysis and this isn't scientific or anything of all the public cases that we've, uh, have on our website from the beginning of fires history. And actually more than half of them have nothing to do with politics. More than half of them are simply administrators having power again and when they have the power that will use it to regulate or silence speech that they find in convenient or critical of the university or administrators or, or just kind of not nice.

Speaker 2:          28:52          Generally less than half of our cases had to do with speakers being silenced specifically because of the viewpoint they were espousing. On a political level. It's, you know, it kind of undoes a lot of the narrative. And to be honest, I'm kind of a little bit tired of the whole, whether the right or left love censorship, more argument. I think it's completely unproductive and does nothing to solve the problem, which is we all need to understand why protecting free speech is important. I'd much rather focus my time there. Um, and you know, so it's really that whole narrative can, could use a little deconstructing for a little bit. And I'm glad that, you know, we had that case that kind of allowed us to, to show it and people appreciate it. I got a lot of messages from people on the right who said, you know, I disagree with everything that that young woman had to say.

Speaker 2:          29:47          Uh, and I would sit there and I would yell that in her face, but you know what? I'm damn glad you guys stood up for her rights. And you know, when I get messages like that, it just, it warms my heart and I get them from people on both sides saying, you know what, I probably wouldn't have reacted in the same way you did leaping to a defense of free speech. But I'm glad you did it because I got something out of that. You know, it made me think about why my reaction wasn't that. Uh, and if I, if I get, if I can elicit that in people, I feel great about my day. That's the heavy lifting I think. Well, that's a beautiful thing and that's why I did what you guys are doing. Uh, the final thing I want to mention is that I just remembered in this last moment that the reason that you're here, I, so I had wanted to have one of you guys on for about a year or so and you've been on our, our master list of all this.

Speaker 2:          30:39          And then I think about three months or so ago, someone tweeted at me that they were at school, at school library, and they were watching a video of me and Ben Shapiro, and that they were reported to the, either the diversity office or one of these things that it was hate speech and that another student shouldn't be allowed to, to watch these, these evil things, et Cetera, et cetera. It turns out that this was in the UK, so it was not under the jurisdiction that you guys, uh, cover, which obviously is the United States. Um, but it just shows that this thing, this monster that we're fighting is not local to us here in America. It's all over the world. And there are other organizations like fire that do this work. And uh, yeah. And although it's depressing to know that somebody is being reported for watching a video that I put out there, it's good to know that you guys all came to the rush.

Speaker 2:          31:30          You all came to the defense and you were like, who is it? Can we connect with them? You know, I connected them with some of your people. I think, and maybe you've passed them on, so I connected them with spikes. Okay. So there is over there. Yeah it is. And you know, you see it happening in Canada all the time. The UK, I mean you can, I have Google alerts set and every, no, I wouldn't say every morning cause it's more like 40,000 times a day. I get emails from Google with the latest headlines about free speech and it's not just even the UK and Canada. There are students protesting in India about freedom of speech issues and all kinds of countries. Australia, it's a big conversation right now. This is, you know, it's just not limited to here. It's not limited to anywhere. This, the idea that college campuses are kind of a, both a microcosm of society and a training ground and an night, a place where the ideas of the country, uh, kind of come from in a large sense. That's kind of a global concept. I don't think that's limited to higher education in the United States. And you know, it's, I really hope that we can convince students that that's where the safeguarding, uh, it's, it's too important not to. Well said, my friend, I'm with Ya.
