00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.080
Let's talk about
proportionality.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.190
All this means, if we say
that two variables are

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.590
proportional, it just means
that they are constant

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.040
multiples of each other.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:23.920
So if we say that y is equal to
3 times x, we can say that

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.330
y is-- and we can be a little
bit more specific-- we could

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.380
say y is directly
proportional.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:41.670
y is directly proportional
to x.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.110
And of course, we could divide
both sides of this equation by

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.550
3, and we would get 1/3
y is equal to x.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.050
So once again, x is a constant
multiple of y.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.600
We could write this as
x is equal to 1/3 y.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:10.090
So we could also write that x is
directly proportional to y.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.540
If y is directly proportional to
x, then x is also directly

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.920
proportional to y,
by a different

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.570
proportionality constant.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.220
So this term right here,
this is the constant of

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.100
proportionality between y and
x, or between x and y.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.990
This is the constant
of proportionality.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:35.140
So in general, if I say that a
is directly proportional--

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.500
sometimes you'll just see it
written as a is proportional--

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.500
a is directly proportional
to b.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.630
In general, from this statement,
we could write that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.840
a is equal to some constant
times b, where this constant

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.465
is equivalent to that constant
or that constant.

00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:59.040
It's equal to some number.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.710
And you could also say that b is
directly proportional to a,

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.280
where if you divide both sides
of this equation by k, you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.900
would get b is equal to 1/k a.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.690
This is direct proportionality.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.180
Now another thing you might
see-- and we'll see it later

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.170
in this video-- is being
inversely proportional.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.960
So let me draw a little
line here.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.520
So let me give you a few
examples of inverse

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.910
proportionality.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:39.060
Let's say that y is equal
to 5 times 1/x.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.270
Notice what's going on here.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.980
In this situation, y is
proportional to the

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.210
inverse of x, right?

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:55.630
Or you could say that y is
inversely proportional-- I'll

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.890
abbreviate it-- proportional
to x.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.510
It is directly proportional
to the inverse of x.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.820
So here is our proportionality
constant, but it is directly

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.530
proportional to the
inverse of x.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.020
Here's another example,
and I'm just playing

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.260
with letters here.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.310
I could write a is
equal to 10/b.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.270
Once again, a is inversely
proportional to b.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.710
You could rewrite this as a
is equal to 10 times 1/b.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.130
a is proportional to the
inverse of b, or it's

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.280
inversely proportional to b.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.660
So now that we have that out
of the way, let's do some

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.240
examples using our newly-found
knowledge of direct

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.210
proportionality and inverse
proportionality.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.940
So here I have a problem.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.090
It says that x is proportional
to y.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.620
So that means that x is equal
to some constant times y.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.150
And just so you're familiar with
other notation that you

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.150
might see when you're talking
about proportionality.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.570
Other ways to write this
statement here. x is

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.510
proportional to y.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.730
You could write it like this.
x is equal to some

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.490
constant times y.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.100
Or you could write it as
x is proportional to y.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.680
That little, I don't know, left
facing fish looking thing

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.820
means proportional.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.550
This and this mean
the same thing.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.660
This means that x is equal
to some constant times y.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.400
Or sometimes you'll even see
it x squiggly line y. x is

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.790
equal to some constant
times y.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.880
This, this, and this, and that
are all equivalent statements.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.590
But this is the most useful
because you say, oh, there's

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.360
some constant, maybe we can
solve for that constant.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.320
Then the next statement here
says, x is proportional to y

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.540
and inversely proportional
to z.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.180
So that second statement says
that x is equal to k.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.930
It's going to be a different
constant, not necessarily the

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:59.760
same constant.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.520
So let me put a different--
well, I'll call it k2, I'll

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.300
call this k1-- is equal to
some other constant-- not

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.220
necessarily some other, but I'm
guessing it's going to be

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.940
some other constant-- times the
inverse of z, times 1/z.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.530
That's what inversely
proportional to z means.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.530
And other ways we could write
this is, x is proportional to

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.380
the inverse of z.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.460
x is inversely proportional
to z, or x is inversely

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.800
proportional to z.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.150
These things in orange
are all equivalent.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.950
I just wanted to make you
familiar with it in case you

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:33.430
ever see it.

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.710
And then they tell us, OK, if
x is proportional to y,

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.830
inversely proportional to z-- we
wrote that already-- and x

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.250
is equal to 2 when
y is equal to 10.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.992
So let's do that.

00:05:45.992 --> 00:05:49.490
x is equal to 2 when
y is equal to 10.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:57.010
So x is equal to 2 when
k1 is multiplied by y.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.920
That's what that statement tells
us, and y is 10 when k1

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.710
is multiplied by 10.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.770
x is 2 when y is 10.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.310
I just put those numbers
in there.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.850
And then we can actually use
this now to solve for k1.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.130
But before that, let's
see what this next

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.810
statement tells us.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.190
It says x is 2 when y
is 10 and z is 25.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:34.710
So x is 2 when k2 is multiplied
by 1/z or 1/25.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.760
So that's what that second
statement tells us.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.020
So they say find x when
y is equal to 8 and

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.380
z is equal to 35.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.460
So essentially what they're
asking us, hey, why don't you

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.280
use this information that we
gave you in the green and the

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.680
red, solve for the different
proportionality constants, and

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.490
then use that to write, I guess,
the specific equations

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:57.820
for the proportionality or the
inverse proportionality, and

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.940
then solve for y or z.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.390
Let's just do it.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:04.170
So here, up here in green, let
me rewrite it over here.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:10.320
We know that x is 2 when k1 is
multiplied by y where y is 10.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:16.850
Divide both sides of this
equation by 10.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.740
You get 2 over 10 is 1/5.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.880
You get k1 is equal to 1/5.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.460
So that tells us that this first
equation right here--

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.400
I'll write it in that original
color-- is x is

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.760
equal to 1/5 y.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:38.930
Now, that second statement in
red, we know that 2 is equal

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.040
to k2 times 1 over 25.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.460
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 25.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.750
This cancels out.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.730
And we're left with k2--
k2 is equal to 50.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.650
k2 is equal to 50, so we can
write this equation right here

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:05.420
that x is equal to 50 times
1/z or is equal to 50/z.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.660
So we've now solved for
the two constants of

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.930
proportionality for these two
equations, so now we can

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.880
answer the second part
of this question.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.190
Find x when y is equal to
8 and z is equal to 35.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.220
So the situation when y is equal
to 8-- we just go right

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:27.980
here-- x is equal to 1/5 times
8, which is equal to 8/5.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.460
So that's what x is equal
to when y is equal to 8.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:39.289
When z is equal to 35, once
again, x is equal to 50/z, is

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.046
equal to 50/35.

00:08:43.046 --> 00:08:45.170
Now let's see, we can divide
the numerator and the

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:51.070
denominator here by
5, so we get 10/7.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.270
So when z is equal to
35, we get 10/7.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:58.720
When y is equal to 8,
x is equal to 8/5.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.140
So those are our two answers,
right there.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.010
Let's do another one.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.510
Ohm's Law.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:11.180
Ohm's Law states that current
flowing in a wire is inversely

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.170
proportional to resistance
of the wire.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.160
So current flowing in a wire is
inversely proportional to

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.100
resistance of a wire.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.690
So let's use I for current.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.960
I is equal to current.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.550
And we'll use R for
resistance.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.732
R is equal to resistance.

00:09:32.732 --> 00:09:36.700
And you might be wondering why
I picked I, but later on when

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:39.060
you start studying electricity
and maybe you become an

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.920
electrical engineer, you'll see
that I is the conventional

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.330
letter used for current.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.620
And I won't go into the details
of why, just yet.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:51.310
But it tells us that current,
that I, is inversely

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.680
proportional to resistance.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.140
So that first statement I
underlined in yellow says that

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.855
current is inversely
proportional.

00:09:57.855 --> 00:10:02.970
It's equal to some constant
times the inverse of

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.900
resistance.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.440
It's inversely proportional
to resistance of the wire.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:13.530
If the current is 2.5 amperes
when the resistance is 20

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:21.510
ohms. So the current is 2.5 when
k is multiplied by 1 over

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:27.340
a resistance of 20 ohms, 1/20
ohms. And I'm assuming,

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:29.650
because they're going to keep
the units in amperes and ohms

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.680
later on, so we could write the
units here if we wanted

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.240
to, but I'll keep it simple
and not write the units.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.680
They ask, find the resistance
when the current is 5 amperes.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.420
So this first statement,
right here.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.070
The current is 2.5 amperes
when the resistance is 20

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:50.180
ohms. That's this equation,
right here.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.320
So we can use this
to solve for k.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:58.690
You multiply both sides
of this by 20.

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.870
These cancel out, and you're
left with k is equal to--

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.980
what's 20 times 2.5?

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.500
20 times 2 is 40.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.950
20 times 0.5 is 10.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.420
So it's going to be
50, 40 plus 10.

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:14.380
So k is equal to 50.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:21.200
So in this situation, this
equation is I is equal to 50

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.190
times 1/R or 50/R.

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.300
That's our relationship,
right there.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.390
And then they ask, find the
resistance when the

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.940
current is 5 amperes.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:42.610
So when our current is 5
amperes, so 5 is equal to 50

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.220
over the resistance.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:48.930
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by the

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:55.210
resistance, and you get
5R is equal to 50.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.900
I just multiplied both sides
of this equation by R.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.870
These canceled out, so I
got 5R is equal to 50.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.560
Divide both sides of
this equation by 5.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.010
We get R is equal to 50
divided by 5 is 10.

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.090
So the answer is, when the
current is 5 amperes, the

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:19.650
resistance will be equal to 10
ohms. And we could write it

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:24.080
like this, 10 ohms,
just like that.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:25.330
Let's do one more.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:36.520
The intensity of light is
inversely proportional to

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:41.050
the-- now let's be careful
here-- to the square of the

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:47.680
distance between the light
source and the object being

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.860
illuminated.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:54.580
So let's just say, well,
we could use I again.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:03.490
Let's say I is equal to
intensity of light.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:08.260
And let's say that D-- I'm going
to do it in a different

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:17.160
color-- D is equal to the
distance between the light

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.890
source and object being
illuminated.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.070
So that's what?

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:28.250
D, the distance between the
light source and the object

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.850
being illuminated.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.840
Now what does this first
sentence tell us?

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:33.980
The intensity of the light is
inversely proportional.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.760
So the intensity of the light,
I, is inversely proportional.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.070
So it's going to be some
proportionality constant times

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.730
the inverse.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.020
But notice, the intensity
of light is inversely

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.800
proportional to the square
of the distance.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.350
Not just to the distance.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.330
So to the square of
the distance.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:55.010
So to distance squared.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:56.740
If it just said to the
distance, we would

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.080
just have a D here.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.280
But it says the intensity
of light is inversely

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:00.780
proportional.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:04.690
So 1 over the square of the
distance between the light

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.050
source and the object
being illuminated.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:10.600
So that's what this first
statement is going to give us,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.530
this equation right here.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:18.160
Now, they tell us, a light meter
that is 10 meters-- so

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.670
they're saying, when distance
is equal to 10 meters-- a

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.700
light meter that is 10 meters
from a light source

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.640
registers 35 lux.

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:30.780
So when the distance is equal to
10 meters, they're telling

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.280
us that the intensity-- the
lux is a measure of

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:39.830
intensity-- the intensity
is equal to 35 lux.

00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.400
So what intensity would register
25 meters from the

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.340
light source?

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:47.220
So this first statement they
gave us, that I wrote down the

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:50.140
information in this purple
color, we can use that to

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.070
solve for the proportionality
constant.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.680
And then once we have that
constant, we can solve for I

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.980
or D, given one or the other.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:04.020
So that statement told us, they
told us, that when D is

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.400
equal to 10, I is equal to 35.

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:13.690
So I is equal to 35, so 35 is
equal to K times 1 over D

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.780
squared, 1 over 10 squared.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:23.790
Or we could say that 35 is
equal to k times 1/100,

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.600
multiply-- 10 squared is just
100-- multiply both sides of

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.970
this equation by 100.

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.700
These cancel out.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.260
And we're left with k is equal
to-- what is this?

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:40.160
3,500.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.230
So we've solved, we've used this
statement here where they

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.740
gave us some values
to solve for our

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.430
proportionality constant.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.790
So now we know that the equation
is-- the intensity is

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:58.230
equal to 3,500-- that's k
times 1 over D squared.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.440
Or you can just write
over D squared.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.790
Now, they say, what intensity
would it register 25 meters

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.000
from the light source?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.350
So they're saying D is 25.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:18.300
So intensity is equal to 3,500
divided by 25 squared.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.530
Our distance is 25 meters.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:31.870
So the intensity is going to be
equal to 3,500 divided by--

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.270
well, actually, let's
just keep it simple.

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:39.570
Let me see, well, this is
divided by 25 times 25.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.200
It's 625.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.410
Let's just get the
calculator out.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:48.920
So we get, it's going to be
3,500 divided by 25 times 25,

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:54.010
which is 625, which
is equal to 5.6.

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:58.930
It's equal to 5.6 lux,
which is the

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.000
unit for light intensity.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.110
Hopefully you found
that useful.
