00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
do you think that the media with the

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.270
sensationalism and all that you think

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.420
they were responsible in part in

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.370
creating the phenomenon of Donald Trump

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.860
no I think what has created the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.699
phenomenon of Donald Trump is is the

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.449
fact that as the the industry fragmented

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.080
with satellite television and with cable

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.930
and with the internet the level of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.880
competition became so great that now it

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.669
became a faction I mean a function of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.230
how do we draw viewers and how do we get

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.910
more of those of that diminishing number

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.820
of available viewers and we do it by

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.860
focusing more on entertainment

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.469
you got more pussy cats falling into

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:56.129
toilet bowls of the end of news programs

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:59.520
you do it by a a harsher harder-edged

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.870
partisan approach to covering the news

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.000
and i understand that draws more viewers

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.560
but I don't think it's good for the I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.119
don't think it's good for the profession

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.119
I don't think it's good for the country
