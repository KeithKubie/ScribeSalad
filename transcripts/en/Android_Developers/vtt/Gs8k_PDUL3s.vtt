[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.860
ROMAN NURIK: Hello,
and welcome to

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.040
Android Design in Action.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.540
This is our first episode
of this brand new show.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.120
My name is Roman Nurik from
the Android Developer

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.200
Relations team.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.060
We are broadcasting here
from New York City.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.360
We're also joined by Nick
Butcher, who is, I guess, to

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.010
my screen left.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.470
And he's coming from London.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.080
Nick, you want to say hi?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.545
NICK BUTCHER: Hi.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:28.340
It's me here.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.540
ROMAN NURIK: And we also have
a special guest in the back,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.750
Adam Koch, also from the New
York Android Developer

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.430
Relations team, and he's
producing the show today.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.230
He'll be providing some color
commentary here and there as

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.290
he sees appropriate.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.060
And yeah, so that's the team
kicking off this very first

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.400
Android Design in Action.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.220
Now, I'm guessing many of you
don't really know much about

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.190
the show since this is our
first time and we haven't

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.800
really talked much about it.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.610
Very briefly, I just want to
talk about a brief history.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.160
So, many of you are already
followers of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.650
the Friday app clinic.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.040
And in that app clinic, some
of our teammates, including

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.250
Reto Meyer, Daniel Pham, and Ian
Lewis, they look at apps

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.730
that are nominated to the team
through Google Moderator.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.040
They look at those apps, and
they inspect ways in which

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.410
they can improve the apps.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.020
They look at what potentially
could be fixed, what the apps

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.250
do wrong, things like that.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.790
And so this show is basically a
spin-off show to look at the

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.330
design, specifically to look at
the visual and interaction

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.190
design aspects of some of these
apps and see how those

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.560
can be improved.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.030
So today in this first show,
we're going to look at three

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.550
apps from the Friday
app clinic.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.690
We're going to look at the
London Underground app, the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.920
London Bus Checker app,
and m-parking.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.190
And we're going to look at
specific screens from those

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.260
apps and look at how we can kind
of reimagine or rework

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.050
them to better follow our
guidelines from the Android

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.540
design site and, in general,
how to just overall improve

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.800
the design of the apps.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.440
So with that, let's
get started.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.130
Let's look at the
very first app.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.340
We're going to switch
to the demo here.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.050
And you could see that we're
using a fancy little setup

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.670
using Dropbox, thanks to the
developers of the Dropbox app.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.190
We're going to look at the
very first app, which is

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.210
London Underground.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.600
So this is actually one of
the screens from the app.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.660
This is the live information
screen.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.890
You get to this screen from
the top-level one.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.030
There's this little icon.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.980
It's kind of like an exclamation
point that gets

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.610
you to the screen.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.300
And it basically tells you the
status, the state of the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.125
different lines on
the Underground.

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:55.500
It gives you things like
access to weather.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.420
If you look down here, it gives
you access to weather at

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.130
the very bottom.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.970
And then it also tells you the
current departure boards.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.460
And then it actually even
notices-- and this is

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.620
something that I noticed
checking in from New York.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.730
It notices that you are not
actually in London, and it

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.340
notices that you are
in New York City.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.820
And it says, hey, we actually
have an app for that.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.390
We have a New York City version
of this app available.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.080
And that leads you to the Play
Store to get that version.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.190
So it's a pretty straightforward
screen.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.830
Nick, do you have any initial
comments on the screen's

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.470
usefulness since you are
coming from London?

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.940
Do you have any idea on--

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.310
NICK BUTCHER: Yep.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.456
I feel privileged today doing
two London-based apps with me

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:38.350
here in London.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.780
I think when I look at this
screen you pulled out, the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.506
first thing I think is, it's
fairly iOS styled.

00:03:44.506 --> 00:03:47.330
That's my gut reaction when you
have kind of the rounded

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.840
white sections.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.360
That's the first thing that
jumps out at me, really.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.880
They have made an attempt to
adopt some things, like we

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.420
have an action bar, although
it's using some slightly

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.010
non-standard styling there,
which we'll get into later.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.655
But yeah, the first thing
that jumps out

00:04:02.655 --> 00:04:04.750
to me is the iOS-ness.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.145
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.020
And you could tell just by, like
you mentioned, the kind

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.150
of rounded, grouped list items
and then this gray background.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.500
So, yeah, there's definitely
kind of a styling from a

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.779
different platform.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.920
So that's one of the first
things you'll notice that in

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.420
the redesign coming up,
one of the first

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.550
things that we changed.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.430
The thing that stuck out to me
was there's a lot of space

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.890
dedicated here to showing all
the different lines, all the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.390
different lines of the London
Underground, for example, the

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.190
Bakerloo, the Central,
the Circle Line.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.590
And all of them have
good service.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.580
So it seems like it's just
showing a lot of information

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.170
that's the same.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.600
It's not really useful
information, seeing that

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.440
everything is good service.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.190
So if I'm, say, taking the
Waterloo line, you'll notice

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.250
here in the second screenshot,
this is kind of the

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.680
scrolled-down version.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.075
If you scroll down, then you
have to find Waterloo and then

00:04:56.075 --> 00:04:58.930
and only then see that
there's minor delays.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.590
So that was one thing that stuck
out to me, that to see

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.840
any actual--

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.280
I guess actionable information
about the status of certain

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.400
lines, you have to scroll, and
that's never a good thing.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.080
NICK BUTCHER: Also, for me
particularly as a Londoner, if

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.280
I'm pulling out this app and
going to the live Information,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.020
it's probably because I'm
heading towards a specific

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.180
line and I want to know if
there's anything going on.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.530
So I want that information
first and foremost

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.520
right at the top.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.650
ROMAN NURIK: OK, so let's talk a
little bit about some of the

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.390
other interactional elements.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.650
So the first thing that--
well, one of the

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.720
first things that--

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.400
one of the second things I guess
that I noticed was that

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.810
there's no up button, right?

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.405
So this is a subsequent
screen.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.680
So there should be some way
of getting up in the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.156
hierarchy of the app.

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:46.220
So there's an icon here, but
there's no up-caret indicating

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.480
that you can go up.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.770
The other thing is that the
action bar has a bold title.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.120
And while that's sometimes OK,
while that's often OK, it's a

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.050
little nonstandard.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.070
So it kind of takes away some
of the visual attention from

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.730
the content of the screen.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.780
And, also, this is
kind of curious.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.800
There's an update button
somewhere in the middle here.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.410
And really that's probably
something that should be kind

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.930
of like a refresh action,
potentially in the action bar.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.770
So with that--

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:17.630
NICK BUTCHER: Do you mind
if I comment here--

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.840
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, go ahead.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.710
NICK BUTCHER: On the action bar
icon, it doesn't really

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.690
come across in the screenshot,
but the highlight is

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.360
nonstandard as well.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.910
So when you touch the icon,
the highlight behind it is

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.960
kind of tall and narrow.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.380
There's a very--

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.870
nice zoom-in.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.910
There's a very standard size
and shape that you would

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.420
expect with these controls,
and that's part of the

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.300
importance of the action
bar, that it's very

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.980
familiar to the users.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.440
So every time you kind of
deviate from that standard

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.080
size and shape, then all of a
sudden, it's introducing like

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.815
a cognitive speed bump to the
users, where something just

00:06:51.815 --> 00:06:52.680
feels slightly off.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.300
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.870
NICK BUTCHER: So it sounds
nit-picky, but I think it

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.825
really contributes to
making your app feel

00:06:56.825 --> 00:06:59.750
very easy to use.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.420
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.210
And the last thing I want to
point out before we jump into

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:06.700
the redesigned version is the
Send Us Feedback link.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.010
Generally, for things that are
secondary, things like

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.290
settings or send feedback, or
log out, or things like that,

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:17.150
we generally try to put that
into the action overflow since

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.480
that's really what it's for.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.440
It's for actions that users
wouldn't really use on a

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.380
regular basis.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.210
So if 10% of the time, even 1%
of the time they're going to

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.807
be using Send Us Feedback, you
may want to just come up with

00:07:30.807 --> 00:07:31.780
the action real quick.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.810
So moving on, we're running a
little short on time, I guess,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:36.840
for this part.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.350
Let's jump into the redesign.

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.300
So this is a reimagined version
of this screen.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.600
And I'm going to quickly
zoom in here.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.120
So you'll notice that we've
changed some of the colors.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.460
One of the things that we
started with was the dark

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.480
action bar theme.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.600
And this isn't something that
you should do for any app, but

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.810
it kind of conveys a pretty nice
contrast between actions

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:04.390
and screen content.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.550
Also, we put weather as a second
tab that you can swipe

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:13.420
over to since weather is
potentially something that is

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.080
fairly important.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.690
This isn't necessary, but
it is a nice touch.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.580
The other thing you'll notice
here is that we took that list

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.150
of all the different lines, the
Circle Line, the Bakerloo

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.640
Line, the District Line, and we
collapsed it only into what

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.120
the user wants to see,
which is exceptions.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.570
Exceptions to the almost always
well-running London

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:36.299
Underground.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:37.679
So in this case, you
notice that--

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.780
NICK BUTCHER: [CHUCKLES].

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:39.919
ROMAN NURIK: Is that
true, Nick?

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.904
Does the Underground actually
run pretty well?

00:08:41.904 --> 00:08:42.379
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:08:42.379 --> 00:08:42.854
It's running great.

00:08:42.854 --> 00:08:44.100
Underground is running great.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.500
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.840
So right now I'm guessing
that you would see no

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.590
exceptions in this tab.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:53.000
So you see that you Circle Line
is closed, and this is

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.485
just an imaginary situation.

00:08:55.485 --> 00:08:57.630
If the Circle Line is closed,
there's a little bit of

00:08:57.630 --> 00:09:02.210
iconography to indicate that on
top of the yellow color for

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.440
the Circle Line.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.900
And then minor delays on the
Waterloo Line, you would see

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.320
that below.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.610
And you'll see that we actually
use Holo styling

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.090
throughout.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:15.970
We use these standard list
headings that have this all

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:20.380
caps twelve-SP text.

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.630
And then below those two
exceptions, we actually just

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:29.240
say as an additional
confirmation to the user that

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.040
all the other lines have
good service on them.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.280
The other thing I will quickly
point out here is that for the

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.540
traveling in New York City, I
guess, the toast or pop-up,

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.220
that's kind of an exceptional
case that

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:43.090
rarely happens, likely.

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.780
So what you may want to do there
is actually just show up

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:49.800
a kind of like a bottom toast or
a bottom bar that slides in

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.860
and lets the user take action.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.430
And if they don't really care
about New York City, if I just

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.930
happen to actually open the
app in New York City, just

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.930
press the X to dismiss
that and never

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.500
show it to them again.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.900
So, Nick, with that, do you
have any thoughts on this?

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.350
NICK BUTCHER: Well, it
immediately just feels much

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.860
more like at home on
my Android device.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.005
It feels like it fits in with
the system look and feel using

00:10:11.005 --> 00:10:12.546
the Holo styling.

00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:15.410
I especially like the
use of color.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:18.230
It really made the pertinent
information jump out to me.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.820
The things I care about when I'm
opening the line's status

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.090
is what is closed?

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:24.430
What's going to be delaying
my journey?

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.515
I think what it needs to be is
where it points to the app

00:10:26.515 --> 00:10:29.010
where it pops out to me now,
so that's my favorite

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.640
takeaway from that.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.770
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.010
The other quick things we'll
point out before jumping into

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:38.140
the next app is that there's a
refresh button here in the

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.310
action bar to convey that
you can refresh

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:42.150
everything on the screen.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.780
And that's the standard place
to put something like a

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.390
refresh on Android.

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.350
And then for the other piece,
the View Departure boards over

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.790
here, we moved that as well
into the action bar

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.140
as an icon up top.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.080
Oh, and Adam points
out that we should

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.100
probably mention the ad.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.410
So you'll notice that in the
original screen here, there's

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.580
an ad at the bottom.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.070
There's nothing really
preventing you from using that

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:08.900
same ad in the bottom here.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.530
The only thing that really would
detract from it is the

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.470
traveling in New York
City banner.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:16.060
But in that case you may want
to consider that's really an

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:16.880
ad for yourself.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.410
That is effectively
a house ad.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.420
So maybe that could cover up--

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.110
or if that is the case, if you
are traveling in New York

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:27.860
City, hide the other ads
and show this house ad.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.220
And when you dismiss, maybe
show the other ads.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.340
So that's, I think, it for me.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.820
Nick, any parting thoughts
for London Underground?

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:39.600
NICK BUTCHER: I think just if
you take a look at these two

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.560
snapshots next to each other,
you can notice that there's

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:46.180
much less chrome around
the content.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.950
Instead of using bounding boxes
and different background

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.070
colors to give the app structure
there, we've used

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:56.530
typography and consistent
spacing to really convey the

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.790
same information in a much
cleaner way, which to me makes

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.530
the content pop our
much more also.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:04.870
I think this side by side really
sums up the Holo design

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.088
philosophy very nicely.

00:12:07.088 --> 00:12:07.960
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.350
All right.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.720
So, with that, let's move
on to the next app.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:15.000
The next app is m-parking.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.240
And so this app basically--

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.200
I don't really know how to use
this app, because I think

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.630
parking in the States works
a little differently.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:26.010
Nick, any thoughts
on m-parking?

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:26.280
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.930
So here in London, there's a few
schemes like this, where

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.200
you can pay for your parking
fee by sending an SMS to a

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.220
certain premium number.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:38.200
And that will-- you basically
SMS them your vehicle

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.855
registration plate, and that'll
give you parking for a

00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:43.140
period of time.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.100
So this app lets you set up
certain zones which work with

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:50.290
it, with the appropriate SMS
numbers attached to them.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:52.015
And then you just hit
a button, and

00:12:52.015 --> 00:12:53.840
it sends this message.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:54.540
ROMAN NURIK: Interesting.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.190
So and you've tried this out.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.420
At what point did it actually
send the SMS?

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.670
Was it outside of the screen?

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.980
NICK BUTCHER: So this screen
we're looking at now is one of

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:05.570
the set ones.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.850
This is where you actually
configure the parking zone,

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.690
where you enter in the number
that you need to SMS to and

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:12.500
how long that kind of
covers you for.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.700
So once you've configured this,
then on the very home

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.680
screen, it'll show all the zones
you've configured and

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.170
the car registration numbers
you've saved.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:23.603
So the first thing you see when
you open the app is you

00:13:23.603 --> 00:13:26.010
just hit one of the zones
you've saved.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:29.410
And it'll send a message
and basically

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:30.640
give you parking access.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.762
So this is one of the setup
screens you would go through

00:13:32.762 --> 00:13:33.704
in configuration.

00:13:33.704 --> 00:13:35.380
You have to do this step.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.910
ROMAN NURIK: So basically, you
wouldn't use this on an

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.920
everyday basis.

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.630
So things like speed, in
general, if you're using

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.970
something on an everyday basis,
you want to minimize

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:44.770
the number of inputs.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:48.010
You want to make it quick and
easy for the user to just fly

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:49.630
through and obviously
not make mistakes.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:53.630
But this is kind of an auxiliary
screen, right, Nick?

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:53.888
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:13:53.888 --> 00:13:56.796
I could imagine you probably
install this app and configure

00:13:56.796 --> 00:14:00.340
three or four parking zones
which you primarily frequent.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:00.680
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.090
So let's talk about what we
would change in this screen.

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:07.800
So the first thing that jumped
out at me was that

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.390
there is a Save icon.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.680
And in general, barring the
whole discussion of whether a

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.830
floppy disk is actually a useful
metaphor these days for

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.280
Save, there's two ways to
basically leave this screen.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.860
Actually, three ways if you
count the back button as well.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.250
And this is something that I
recently posted about in a

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:27.000
post about the Done button.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.490
We'll talk about that
in a moment.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:33.160
So, basically here, I can press
Back, or Up, or Save to

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.930
basically get out
of this screen.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.770
And it doesn't seem to be a--

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.290
it doesn't seem kind of like
a specific affordance for

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.110
discarding changes
or reverting.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:43.410
That's a whole issue
in itself.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.530
But that was the first thing
that stuck out to me, that

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.070
there's a lot of ways to save
and get out of this screen.

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.270
The other thing is that just
purely from a visual

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:54.010
standpoint, the blue action
bar and the blue screen

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.000
content didn't really
mesh well for me.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.680
Generally, in this kind of app,
where you're entering

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.040
data, lots of data, you probably
want to use a lighter

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.050
background.

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.790
I think the darker backgrounds,
like a black or

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:11.330
the Holo dark theme, those are
best used for media apps like

00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:14.220
Gallery or playing video.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.100
And so when I'm entering text
or entering data, it seems

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.070
like it's a better fit
for a lighter theme.

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:23.470
The darker color action bar, the
blue action bar, is fine

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:24.850
for branding.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.980
But that's just one of the first
things that jumped out.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.590
The second thing was
around visuals.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:34.710
So you have labels here, like
name, SMS number, price,

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.410
things like that.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.410
So the problem there is that
they're not really aligned

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.640
with the content itself.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:46.490
So you have, I'm going to
butcher this, TariffBreak 1

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:49.130
and then the SMS number, and
they're not visually aligned

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.560
with the rest of the text.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.640
So that was another thing.

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.560
And, lastly, I just wanted to
point out that this color

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.040
chooser seems a little
simplistic.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.610
You actually can't tell this
from the screenshot, but the

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.930
background color is the
currently selected color.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.360
So if I touch yellow here, it
would actually change the

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.870
background color of
that to yellow.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:13.210
So that's not a very common way
of indicating selection.

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:16.530
So with that, Nick, any thoughts
on this screen?

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:17.830
NICK BUTCHER: No, you've
pretty much nailed it.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.110
I think they've basically taken
the color palette from

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:22.910
the iPhone and run a little
bit too far with it in my

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:25.785
book, especially when they
haven't customized the Holo

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:29.130
control fields, where I find
that the blue underline in the

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:32.110
text boxes doesn't really
contrast highly with the

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:35.900
background color and making
the focus get

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.880
lost a little bit.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:38.100
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.120
And actually, I just want to
make a callout since you

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.920
mentioned that, Nick.

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.090
Someone-- and I forget your
name, I'm very sorry.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.830
Someone has actually recently
created a generator for

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:49.500
styling, for Holo styling.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.310
So you can just punch in a few
colors and you can generate

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:56.030
all the different assets for
buttons, for text boxes,

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:57.285
things like that.

00:16:57.285 --> 00:17:00.210
If this developer wanted to
disregard our feedback about

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:04.040
the light color and wanted to
have a lighter color for the

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.030
text field, the little bottom
bar, they could use the Holo.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:10.200
I think it's called a Holo
style generator.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.440
We'll link to that afterwards.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.359
OK, so let's jump into
the redesign.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:21.390
So here's a redesigned version
of that screen.

00:17:21.390 --> 00:17:24.580
You'll notice immediately that
we switched from using Save

00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.930
and Up to a single
Done button.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.330
And this mirrors what you would
see in the people app,

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.140
for example, on Ice Cream
Sandwich and later.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.530
So when you edit a contact,
you're presented with this

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.410
similar screen for
entering data.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:43.920
The other thing we did here was
that we took the city, the

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.890
location, and we used-- and this
is, I think, one of Nick

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.860
and my favorite things to do
is turn it into a Roboto

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.190
Light-- or actually in
this case, maybe

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.150
even a Roboto Thin--

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:58.030
large text to indicate that this
is the current general

00:17:58.030 --> 00:17:59.790
vicinity that you're
working with.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.020
The zone you're editing
is in Berlin.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.140
The other thing you'll notice is
that we've realigned all of

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.100
these labels.

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.130
Actually, we removed the name
label because it's almost

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.680
self-explanatory that you're
currently editing this

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.390
specific zone.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.100
But we took all the other labels
like SMS number and

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.220
period suffix, and we aligned
them with the content.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.130
And this is something that is a
little tricky to do with the

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:25.490
framework currently, but it's
something that you can

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:27.850
actually do correctly
with a couple of

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.260
tweaks to your padding.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.460
The other thing is that we
dropped period suffix.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.390
So if you'll notice here, period
suffix was to the right

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.520
of SMS number.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.150
And that conveyed-- to me at
least, it conveyed a sense of

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.310
sequence, so that the period
suffix is almost the suffix to

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.140
the SMS number.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.020
And, again, speaking-- this is
coming from somebody who

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.910
doesn't really know how parking
in Europe works, but

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:55.400
it was kind of a weird
connection to make, that

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.690
period suffix was after
the SMS number.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.390
So we moved that down
to the bottom.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:03.760
And then, lastly, we made
this color changer.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.720
I'm going to actually switch
to the next slide.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.660
We had this color changer so
that when you touch it, it

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.950
gives you a dropdown of the
different colors you can

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:12.830
choose from.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.840
And then you can select which
color you want to change to.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.280
And it shows a little blue
rectangle around the currently

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.190
selected color.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.820
And then it also lets you
discard changes if you select

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.470
the action overflow.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:27.850
It lets you discard changes
that you've made here.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.590
So that's a high-level summary
of what we've done here.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.840
Nick, any thoughts?

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.135
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:19:35.135 --> 00:19:38.650
Immediately for me, I find the
light theme works very well

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.950
for the data entry screens.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:44.950
It's very easy on the eye to
scan and enter quickly and

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.150
just lining everything up.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:50.280
I mean, it makes this screen
flow a lot more with much

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:51.620
better ribbon.

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.380
Like design is going to talk
about grids and patterns and

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.880
ribbons and stuff like that,
but basically it just means

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.750
line stuff up and use the
standard pattern.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.320
I mean, it's a program
and we can then work

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.690
with that in structure.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:06.186
And it just helps make things
really easy and quick to scan.

00:20:06.186 --> 00:20:06.860
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.620
NICK BUTCHER: And I think all
of these patterns as well,

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:13.265
like one of the most important
things in this input screen as

00:20:13.265 --> 00:20:16.290
well is using the appropriate
input types.

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:22.650
So this is a field you can set
on your edit text to hint to

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.500
the system what kind of data
is going to be input.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.540
So you can say it's going
to be a number field

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.300
or number of decimals.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.395
Or it's going to be a proper
name, where it might

00:20:33.395 --> 00:20:34.475
capitalize every letter.

00:20:34.475 --> 00:20:37.060
And I think that's really
critical for making the

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.174
screens flow very fast and
making you very productive.

00:20:41.174 --> 00:20:43.070
So the developer's not
done too bad a job.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.620
They've set a number of input
types in a couple of the

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.920
fields, but not all of them.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.335
So I'd like to see those
used throughout.

00:20:49.335 --> 00:20:50.770
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, a
very good point.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:53.980
I do want to just add on one
little point to the line stuff

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.360
up point you made there, Nick.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.820
In a recent Google I/O video,
I believe it was Advanced

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.420
Design for Engineers, Christian
Robertson, who is

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.480
the lead visual designer for
Android, he mentioned this

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.060
kind of concept of lining
stuff up as part of the

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.520
discussion of a gestalt
principles, or "jestalt"

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:11.990
principles.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:13.420
I don't know how to
pronounce it.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.695
But that was something that
definitely stuck out.

00:21:15.695 --> 00:21:19.100
Line stuff up is a very, very
kind of easy way to make

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:22.360
things instantly look cleaner.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:22.700
NICK BUTCHER: I think
that's where I

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.950
borrowed the line from.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.090
And I just want to
echo, again, the

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.500
use of Roboto Light.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.880
Typography can really, really
help give structure and

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.720
emphasis to your application,
and I think this is a great

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.266
example of setting it like a
header and it really popped

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:43.198
out clearly in that.

00:21:43.198 --> 00:21:44.170
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, totally.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.670
Adam had a point
about discard.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.926
Adam, what was that
point, again?

00:21:47.926 --> 00:21:48.379
ADAM KOCH: I was just looking
at the screen.

00:21:48.379 --> 00:21:50.650
You've got discard
in there, too.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:51.290
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, yeah.

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.940
So Adam was just pointing
out that we also

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.660
have discard, right?

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:55.810
So in the previous screen,
there wasn't

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.450
really an obvious way--

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.260
when you press Back or Up,
it's really up to the

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.100
developer to decide
what to do there.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.110
We don't have strong guidance
on whether Up

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:05.000
or Back should save.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.730
It generally should.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.700
In cases where you have really,
really destructive

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.930
operations, if Save is a really
destructive operation,

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:15.140
like it posts a tweet or
something, or it posts to the

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.190
entire world, you probably
want to have some sort of

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:19.200
confirmation or something.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:23.160
But having that discard in the
action overflow gives that

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.980
extra sense of certainty as to
what that action will do.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.260
So moving on to the last app,
we're going to look at London

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.220
Bus Checker.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.110
Actually, Nick, since you're in
London, do you want to just

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:40.626
briefly talk about what this
app will do for you?

00:22:40.626 --> 00:22:41.530
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:45.520
So it's an application to find
the nearest bus stop to you

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:49.030
and tell you the routes of
those buses and how long

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.420
you'll have to wait until
the next bus arrives.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.300
ROMAN NURIK: OK, awesome.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.150
So it's basically exactly that,
it tells you where--

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:59.600
it's your guide to the bus
system in London, effectively.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:22:59.700
NICK BUTCHER: Yes.

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:01.090
It slides into the system.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:03.650
When you go to a bus stop, it
tells you, you have five

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:04.840
minutes to the next bus.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.740
But not every stop has that,
but apparently there is

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:08.340
information.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:10.600
So this app's actually
super-handy around London to

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.850
find out how long you're going
to have to wait for a bus.

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:14.050
ROMAN NURIK: Awesome.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:14.250
NICK BUTCHER: So I use it.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.310
I paid for this app.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.005
I bought it.

00:23:18.005 --> 00:23:20.460
ROMAN NURIK: So Nick is an
avid user of this app.

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:24.560
So let's see how we can fix
this UI, and not really

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.010
necessarily fix, but improve.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:30.950
So one of the first things that
I notice was that this

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:34.360
map dropdown, and the zooming
is kind of wonky right now.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.490
This map dropdown, this spinner,
is kind of off in its

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:41.340
own place somewhere in the
middle of the action bar.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.920
I don't know if that's
intentional or just because

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.860
the logo's really wide.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.020
But that's kind of like
a weird place for it.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:52.480
Also, the logo here, the
placement of the logo in the

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:57.670
action bar and the blue, I
guess, Holo dark border at the

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.820
bottom of the action bar just
seems kind of out of place,

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:05.190
especially in such a visually
rich app like this.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:09.630
The other thing I'll note is
that these buttons here kind

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.450
of have styling from a
different platform.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.970
And you can't see this in the
screenshot, but touching on

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.510
the bubble doesn't actually
do anything.

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:24.230
To see the details for that
stop, you have to touch on

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:25.610
this blue button here.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.360
And then this is basically a
shortcut to see the bus route

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.740
map for that stuff.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.080
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, just one
thing, the bus route is

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.180
actually one of the most useful
functions of this

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:36.475
application.

00:24:36.475 --> 00:24:40.290
You can walk up to a random
bus stop and hit the route

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:43.740
button and see exactly where
that bus is going to take you.

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.490
But I don't know whether it's at
all conveyed, but it's got

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.790
it on the left in the bubble
and then repeated in this

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.420
action bar at the bottom
with the kind

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.620
of three dots connected.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.640
It did this on the screen
route to me.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:56.930
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.130
And the other thing is that,
maybe it's just me, but it

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.800
resembles sharing.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.475
So the Share action icon, and
this is something that users

00:25:04.475 --> 00:25:08.840
of ICS devices especially are
extremely familiar with Share.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.460
It's used throughout the entire
operating system.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.920
And the icon for Share is
basically this icon with

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.430
filled circles and flipped
horizontally.

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.600
So it may just kind of convey
that unintentionally.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.070
So that's another thing that
jutted out, was that it just

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.360
seems like a version of
Share, but it's not.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.410
It's completely separate.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:29.450
It's a route map.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:30.853
NICK BUTCHER: And actually,
they are

00:25:30.853 --> 00:25:34.010
straight off another platform.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.780
ROMAN NURIK: The other thing is
that, again, you can't see

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:39.203
this in the screenshot, but the
bottom icons are blurry.

00:25:39.203 --> 00:25:43.780
They seem to just be either
MDPI or HDPI resources.

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.550
You should really-- and
this is just for

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.480
everybody out there.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.010
You should really provide XHDPI
resources for your apps.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:52.870
Because lots and lots of devices
that are out now and

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:56.100
coming out, they have
XHDPI screens.

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.450
So, with that, any parting
thoughts, Nick,

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:01.120
on the current screen?

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.360
NICK BUTCHER: No, let's go
straight into the redesign.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:02.590
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.220
So the redesigned
version is here.

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.430
You'll notice immediately--

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.400
maybe I should just stop
zooming and let the

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.010
camera do its trick.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.340
You'll notice that immediately
here, we got rid of the

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.890
branding up top.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.160
And this is kind of
controversial.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.790
A lot of folks may think, oh,
but I want my brand to be

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:22.330
visible at all times.

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:24.770
But you have to remember that
this is an application that

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:26.100
users use every day.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.430
If they're launching into your
app, they probably know that

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.230
they're using Bus Checker.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.070
So it's not necessarily--

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.580
it's not necessary to always
show your brand name.

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.250
Sure, you can show an icon.

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.490
I mean, if an icon represents
your brand really strongly,

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:41.610
then show it.

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:46.620
In this case, just to me
personally, the icon has a lot

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.946
of different things
going on in it.

00:26:47.946 --> 00:26:50.310
And so it doesn't seem
like a great

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.940
representation of the brand.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.450
And so what we did instead was
we thought maybe let's pick a

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.980
strong highlight color, a
strong accent color to

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.230
represent the brand better.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:02.230
In this case, we just chose
a reddish pink.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.540
And you could see that in the
action bar there's kind of

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.920
this reddish pink outline
underline.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:15.330
And then in each of the markers
in the map, it also

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.320
uses that color.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.530
We also decided to show some
additional branding in the

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.720
background of the tab bar.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.020
So basically, you see
the TFL logo there.

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.370
You probably shouldn't use the
TFL logo as-is, but that's

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.140
just an example of somewhere
where you can put some sort of

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.110
square-like branding.

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:35.100
Additionally, very quickly,
since we're running low on

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:41.010
time, we put the Locate Me
button in-line in the maps

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.000
since that's something that
users of Google Maps will be

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.060
accustomed to.

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.810
We've also simplified some of
the icons at the bottom.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:52.380
We've changed the icon for the
route map to an actual map.

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:58.480
And this is actually based on
some iconography from--

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:01.922
blanking on his name,
oh my God, Nick.

00:28:01.922 --> 00:28:03.390
NICK BUTCHER: Guenther.

00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:04.330
ROMAN NURIK: Say again?

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:04.800
NICK BUTCHER: Guenther.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:04.880
ROMAN NURIK: Guenther.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.210
Yes, absolutely, Guenther.

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.960
Guenther from Germany.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.850
I feel horrible, Guenther,
if you're watching.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.320
Sorry for forgetting your
name on the spot.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.390
But Guenther has provided
a couple of icons.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:16.970
I think they're called
androidicons.com or something.

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.770
He's provided a bunch of
additional icons in addition

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.520
to the action bar icon pack.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.880
And so this is based on
a map down there.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.810
And so this conveys
a map of a route.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.730
You can't really see it in the
icon, but it's got two points

00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:30.630
with a route in between.

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:35.750
And then lastly, here, we've
changed this pop-up bubble so

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:40.490
that it uses a styling very
similar to the Maps app.

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:42.900
And touching on the entire
bubble will take you to the

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.080
details as opposed to
having this kind of

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.070
separate icon here.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:49.770
And then there's this additional
action button that

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:54.180
takes you to the route map.

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:58.770
So that's a very high-level
redesign.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:01.170
Nick, any thoughts?

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.930
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, one of my
favorite changes here is the

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:06.530
use of the overlay action
bar as well.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:09.030
I think that really-- with the
map application especially, it

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.280
really, really stands out, that
you get to see this kind

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.200
of a whole larger canvas
across the way.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.840
So I think that works really
well here as well.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.150
ROMAN NURIK: And Adam pointed
this out as well.

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.150
So you could see here, what we
did here was we used, not a

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:24.500
black action bar, but I think
it's like a 111 or a 222 hex

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.450
color with opacity.

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:30.540
So even setting the opacity to
like 90% and using it like

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.160
Nick mentioned in overlay mode,
gives the feeling that

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.460
the entire screen is
really your canvas.

00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.630
The map moves across
the entire screen.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:42.350
So that definitely helps convey
a sense of content is

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:46.250
in front of you and infinitely
pannable, basically.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:46.880
OK.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.950
So, it's 11 o'clock.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.150
I think that's it
for this week.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:55.830
But before we cut off, any
parting thoughts from Nick,

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:59.050
first, and then I'll go after.

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:00.110
NICK BUTCHER: No.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:03.590
I hope that this format's
working well for everyone.

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:06.930
But I think it's a really good
way to demonstrate a before

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:10.010
and after, a good way to
demonstrate the strengths of

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:12.510
designing for the platform and
how you can really remake your

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.965
application to feel right at
home on Android and therefore

00:30:14.965 --> 00:30:17.380
feel easier to use it.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.690
So, yeah, I hope you
guys enjoy it.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:19.910
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:21.500
And I just want to
mirror that.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:25.080
Absolutely, if you do like the
format, definitely provide us

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:28.870
comments, either on the event or
in any of the related posts

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:31.535
on the Google+ page for
Android developers.

00:30:31.535 --> 00:30:33.830
And if there's anything you'd
like to see changed or

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.380
anything you'd like to see in
the future, added or whatever,

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:38.650
definitely let us know.

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:40.026
Like we mentioned at the
very beginning, this

00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:41.430
is a very new show.

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.470
So we're still exploring
different ideas, different

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.250
ways of getting design
in your hands.

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:48.200
Design in action.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.920
So, let us know and thanks,
everyone, for tuning in.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.970
And we'll see you next time.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:31:08.133
