00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.380
The second important decision is the design of the

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.890
interconnect, or how the line cards should be connected to

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.760
one another. Now one possibility is to use a shared

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.510
bus. But the disadvantage of a bus for the interconnect

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.692
is that it can only be used by one

00:00:14.692 --> 00:00:18.530
input-output combination. In any single time slot. What we'd like

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.430
to do is enable input output pairs that don't compete

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.440
to send traffic from input to output during the same

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.260
time slot. For example, one should be able to send to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.350
four, two to six and three to five, all in the same

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.260
time slot. The solution to this problem is to create what's

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.360
called. A crossbar switch, or sometimes is also called a switched backplane.
