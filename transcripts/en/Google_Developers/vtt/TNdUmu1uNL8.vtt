MALE SPEAKER: Let's welcome
Jeremy and the Capella team

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.012
to talk about bringing the
power of YouTube to your games.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:16.999
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:18.040
JEREMY WALKER: All right.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.500
Hi, my name's Jeremy Walker.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.085
I'm a developer
advocate here at Google.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:24.080
And as he said, I'm
going to talk you

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.890
a little bit about bringing
the power of YouTube to games.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.130
But before I got
started I always

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.420
like to start with a demo.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.880
And that's what we're doing
here with Capella today.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.996
So if you're
anything like me, you

00:00:34.996 --> 00:00:37.120
like to get your friends
together in a living room,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.230
and talk some smack,
and play some games.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.620
But you can't really do that
with mobile games, right?

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.030
You can do that with
consoles, but the thing

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.532
that's kind of
missing is playing

00:00:46.532 --> 00:00:48.240
in real time against
each other, and then

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.630
being able to share your screen.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.730
So kind of two items.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.760
Luckily for us, the first
one is taken care of.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.854
We're playing an Android
game called Riptide GP2.

00:00:57.854 --> 00:00:59.770
I don't know If you guys
have heard this game.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.210
It's pretty fun.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.050
It's a racing game.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.030
And they've integrated with the
Google Play Games Services API

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.980
to enable that real time
playing with each other.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.250
But to take it a step
further and share it,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.810
Capella put something
together where we're actually

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.337
out putting from both of
these phones to Capella.

00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:20.670
And they're doing a little
magic with some green screens

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.570
and stuff.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.310
And then we're sharing it up
to YouTube on a live stream.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.230
So we have our gamers here,
and they're playing the games.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.890
Say hello, guys, if you
can-- Kyle and David.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.640
And then we have
[INAUDIBLE] over here.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.460
She's running the studio.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.870
It's called Cambria Live.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.790
It's by Capella.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.030
And then they're using
our live streaming API

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.630
to stream it up to YouTube.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.720
So if the Wi-Fi is working,
and the gods are with us,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.145
I should be able
to see this live.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.890
Please stand by.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:58.390
OK.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.530
So the Wi-Fi is
not with us today.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.310
Well that's OK.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.484
We actually figured
this would happen.

00:02:17.484 --> 00:02:21.260
This probably means the Wi-Fi in
Moscone wasn't quite up to par.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.470
We figured this might happen,
so we recorded ahead of time

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.200
to let you see that,
yes, this does work.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.840
So we still have
the same gamers.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.490
You can see they're
playing right behind me.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.880
That they're live
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.310
is working in Cambria
from Capella [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.230
all together and
streaming out to YouTube.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.660
And you can see behind
me that they're actually

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.370
playing in real time.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.780
So hopefully, this
gives you some ideas

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.250
of how you can use the YouTube
APIs with your mobile games.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.400
And back to you, Jeremy.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.330
All right.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.500
So maybe next time.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.750
But you can see that it works.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.640
We thought that was pretty cool.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.810
So hopefully that's
kind of got you

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.000
feeling a little more awake.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.416
And now I'll jump
into the slides.

00:03:03.416 --> 00:03:05.940
And hopefully, I won't
put you to sleep.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.010
But I basically have three
things to cover today.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.384
I'm going to cover
why you should

00:03:09.384 --> 00:03:11.760
use YouTube with
your mobile games.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.570
How to do it with a replay.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.030
That's just like playing back
a highlight from your game.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.760
And then live.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.320
And then the last
part is a a review.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.690
So I always like to
start with this number.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.530
So we released this
a little while ago,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.790
so it's a little higher now.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.720
But we get one billion unique
users per month on YouTube.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.040
So that's a lot
of people that are

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.190
coming to YouTube
to watch content.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.060
And one of our biggest
categories is gaming.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.670
So a lot of people are coming
to YouTube just, specifically,

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.360
for gaming.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.470
And you guys probably know this.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.719
You've probably gone there
to check out some game play

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.300
videos yourself.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.690
But what I wanted to do is kind
of take a step back, and think

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.350
of this presentation
a little bit

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.940
differently, maybe
from your aspect.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.560
And so I talked to some people.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.500
And the one thing that seemed
to come up a lot for gamers

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.140
is how do I get my
game to stand out?

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.160
And so that's what I'm going
to kind of look at today.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.677
So so I'm going
to-- let's forget

00:04:08.677 --> 00:04:10.510
the stuff where you
follow style guidelines,

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.340
and all that stuff to
get yourself promoted.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.209
Maybe within the play game store
or whatever, or the app store.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.769
We're going to look at stuff
that can influence you.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.590
So let's take a step
back and-- let's

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.120
say you're developing a game.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.320
And usually, when I talk to
game developers, you know,

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.150
they may have like
something like video sharing

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.344
on the list of things to do.

00:04:33.344 --> 00:04:34.760
But as you guys
know, when you get

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.302
closer to launching,
or launching,

00:04:37.302 --> 00:04:39.510
whether that's a new game
or a new feature, you know,

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.100
you probably
something took longer

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.558
than you thought it would, have
and you have to cut things.

00:04:43.558 --> 00:04:46.930
And maybe you have to decide
between a new level and that

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.740
enabling video sharing
or something like that.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.330
And it usually gets cut.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.220
And what people tell me is like
well, a minority of our users

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.960
actually use it.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.725
So we didn't think
it was worthwhile.

00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:01.350
We thought the extra
level or something

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.540
like that would be better.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.380
And so, actually
looked into that.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.380
And you'd be right.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.570
Only 10 to 20% of users,
mobile game users,

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.670
find that feature to
be very important.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.070
And this was from a study
that Amplifier did last year.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.550
So this is sharing.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.175
And what they meant
by this, it doesn't

00:05:23.175 --> 00:05:24.410
mean like sharing
your high score,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:25.660
saying, hey, I like this game.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.900
It means sharing a screen--
three things sharing a screen

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.640
shot, but, more importantly,
sharing video replay,

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.930
or live video.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.780
So that's-- this 10 to 20%
said it's very important.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.780
And what this survey
wanted to try to figure out

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.150
was, you know, is it worth going
after these people, or is it

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.560
not?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.150
So again, this is mobile
gamers only, this study.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.394
But they dove into
a lot of questions

00:05:50.394 --> 00:05:51.560
and they separated that out.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.280
So what they did is they
took that group of people

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.409
and they labeled them sharers.

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:57.950
And then they figured
out how do they

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.690
compare to the non-sharers?

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.391
Now again, both are
mobile game players.

00:06:03.391 --> 00:06:05.140
And what they found
is pretty interesting.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.010
So first, sharers download
and try more games per month.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.440
They actually play more per
week, more hours per week.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.950
They make more purchases,
which is great, right?

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.740
That's in app in the
games themselves.

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.136
And then, lastly,
they're more social.

00:06:24.136 --> 00:06:26.260
So they're going to share
the game play experiences

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.860
with people, not only
online but offline.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.760
They want to recommend them,
which is also a great thing.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.260
So you're probably thinking, OK.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.740
So there's this subset that's
a little bit more important.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.500
That make sense.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.830
But I'm still on the fence.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.900
Like it still doesn't seem
like it's worth the work.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.890
And this one's pretty
obvious, but mobile gamers

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.740
watch game videos.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.934
So in the survey, they ask
them a bunch of questions.

00:06:54.934 --> 00:06:56.350
And there's a
couple that came out

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.960
that I thought were
really important.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.560
And this is one of them.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:06.600
So 65% of people, of mobile
gamers, watch video game play.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.040
80% of the sharers
watched it, as well.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.610
So they were a bit higher.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.110
But what's really
interesting there,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.500
is they broke out
the categories.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.400
They didn't just
say video game play.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.500
They said live streaming,
trailers, video game play.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.980
And video replay, or
watching actual game play,

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.230
was rated number one.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.990
It was actually
rated above trailers.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:29.040
So think about
that for a second.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.950
People-- it's more important
to them to watch the game

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.640
play than these $1,000
or million dollar

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.710
trailers that are put out.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.497
So keep that in
the back your head.

00:07:40.497 --> 00:07:42.330
And then what really
kind of drove this home

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.450
for me was this other
question that I found was,

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:48.930
when a mobile gamer
goes and watches

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.950
a game play clip, what's their
number one action afterwards?

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:56.980
And what they found, was
that 45% of the time they

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.950
download the game.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:59.800
That was number one.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.000
Number two is they would
share it or refer it.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.140
And then, number three, was
they continue researching.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.510
So think about
that for a second.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.260
These free-- they're
making these for free,

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.751
these game play videos.

00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:15.250
They have a high
click through rate.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.190
I mean, you're spending
money making these trailers.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.282
And these free things
are watched more,

00:08:21.282 --> 00:08:22.740
and have a good
click-through rate.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.000
Like why aren't you
taking advantage of it?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.690
That's what I like to say.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:29.850
So hopefully that at least
get you thinking about,

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.950
yeah there is a
minority of users.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.370
But they are going to generate
a lot of videos for me

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.070
that have a lot
of ads for me that

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:40.100
have high click-through rates.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.690
So that's something
to think about.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.230
And then again, with
the YouTube API's, we

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.760
allow you to do
some extra things,

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.897
like in the description, you can
set a link to your store links.

00:08:49.897 --> 00:08:51.980
So they can click right
there and get right to it.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.366
So there's a lot of good
things you can do there.

00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:55.990
Anyway hopefully that
kind of gives you

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.630
an idea of why
you'd want to do it.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.860
So now I'm going to give
you some examples of how

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.810
it was done, both
in replay and live.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.870
So any you guys play football?

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.030
And not American
football, obviously.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:16.006
So actually FIFA did this in
2013 and their game on iOS.

00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:17.630
They actually do in
the newer one, too.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.290
But they allow you
to share on YouTube.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.020
So if you score a goal,
you can share that.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.142
And one of my Polish
colleagues is playing Poland.

00:09:24.142 --> 00:09:25.350
And he's pretty excited here.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.140
He scored a goal.

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.920
So he wanted to share
that experience.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.920
And what they let you do
is they let you go back

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.378
and change the
camera angles so you

00:09:32.378 --> 00:09:34.520
can make it a little
bit more interesting.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.230
And you can see there, in the
lower right, after he scores,

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.696
you can click on a button
there to upload it to YouTube.

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:43.695
And the first time you
go through, obviously, it

00:09:43.695 --> 00:09:46.319
asks you, you know, do you want
to upload this to your account.

00:09:46.319 --> 00:09:46.867
And you can.

00:09:46.867 --> 00:09:48.700
And then on the right
side, you can actually

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.440
see the screen shot of this
actual game play up on YouTube.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.972
What you don't see there is a
description which points back.

00:09:55.972 --> 00:09:58.180
So that anybody that comes
to see this and likes this

00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.740
can click through right there.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.150
And install the game.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.970
And you guys have kids?

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.200
If you do, you probably
heard this game, Talking Tom.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.416
So this is a little game
where you talk to it

00:10:11.416 --> 00:10:13.290
and it reads it back to
you in a funny voice.

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:16.432
And it has a whole
bunch of animals.

00:10:16.432 --> 00:10:18.640
It's got some really, really
funny things that people

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.806
have done with it, or their
singing, or comedy bits.

00:10:20.806 --> 00:10:22.020
I suggest you check it out.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:23.728
I can't show it here
because I'd probably

00:10:23.728 --> 00:10:25.590
get in trouble with HR.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.424
But definitely check it out.

00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:28.590
And they actually integrate.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.990
You can see on the
upper left there,

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:31.560
they integrate a
little record button

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.650
so you can record
your interactions.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.970
And they actually have accounted
for 1.4 million interactions

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.475
uploaded to YouTube.

00:10:39.475 --> 00:10:41.860
But what's more
interesting is they're

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.180
getting over 25 million
views per month.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.660
I think they said they had
800 million views so far.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.500
So think about that.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.320
A couple of these videos have
hundreds of thousands of views.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.160
Like they're making stuff
and it's going viral.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.185
And Talking Tom is
taking advantage of that.

00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:02.560
So anyway, hopefully, that
gets you thinking a little bit

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.590
about that.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.590
So how did they do that?

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:10.530
So there's basically two
parts to sharing video

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.800
from your game.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.852
One part is kind of
separate from YouTube,

00:11:14.852 --> 00:11:16.310
and the other part
is with YouTube.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.945
So I'm going to go through
kind of a high view

00:11:18.945 --> 00:11:20.570
because we don't have
of a lot of time.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:24.135
But the first thing you're going
to want to do-- this example

00:11:24.135 --> 00:11:25.090
is using Unity.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.050
So you need to get--
basically, create a video.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:28.890
That's step one.

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.426
So you need to grab the
audio and video frames.

00:11:31.426 --> 00:11:33.050
You need to pipe them
through something

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.655
that will encode them for you.

00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:37.290
You can use web m
or maybe FFmpeg,

00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.740
if that's better for you.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:42.430
In this case, encoding to VP8
for the video, and then Vorbis

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.470
for the audio.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:45.960
And you put in a
container, like web m.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.690
And then bam, you
have your video file.

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.740
Now is when our API step in.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.910
And you can use-- we have tons
of client libraries in all

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.020
the major languages.

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.728
And we've written
samples in all of them.

00:11:56.728 --> 00:12:01.660
So it's pretty easy for you
just go, pick up an API sample,

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:03.530
make some minor
modifications, and you're

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.050
pretty much ready go.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.134
So that's pretty much it.

00:12:07.134 --> 00:12:08.550
It's a RESTful
API, but, again, we

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.910
have client libraries to
handle a lot of this for you.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:13.830
Now, let's say,
that's a lot of work.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:16.310
And you're like, I don't
want to make the videos.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:19.110
There's actually companies out
there that do this for you.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.070
So Everyplay's a good example.

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.520
They actually
provide an SDK where

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.790
they do everything for you.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.120
So they make the video.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.700
And then they allow the
user to upload to YouTube.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.999
And they've done this
for a lot of games.

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:32.540
I'm sure you guys
recognize this one.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.047
This is one.

00:12:34.047 --> 00:12:36.005
And then there's another
company called kamcord

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:37.575
that does the same thing.

00:12:37.575 --> 00:12:39.260
They have a bunch
of games as well.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.021
Trial Xtreme 3 is one.

00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:43.270
So if you do a really cool
trick, you can share it up.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:47.370
And again, these are just SDKs
that you add to your game.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.810
And they take care
of all this for you.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.490
So at least for
Replay, hopefully, that

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:54.370
gives you a little bit of an
idea of some of the things

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.840
you can do.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.890
So live is a little
bit different.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.500
We have a couple
people that do it.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.860
So Elgato is a big one.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.360
They're actually
separate hardware.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.880
But they allow you to stream
live from their device

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.130
up to YouTube.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:11.172
Now you can do it with a
console, or it's mobile.

00:13:11.172 --> 00:13:13.046
If you want to do
something a little bit more

00:13:13.046 --> 00:13:15.420
like you saw here with Capella,
they have a live studio,

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.420
where you can do all
sorts of crazy stuff

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.800
with the green screen, crop out
people, put text, and then live

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:24.110
stream right up.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:25.320
Wow how did they do that?

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.550
So this one is our-- actually
our live streaming API.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.230
Pretty straightforward.

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:32.270
There's three main
parts to it, really,

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.750
probably only two
you'll be using.

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.720
But you create a broadcast
bind a stream to it,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.060
and you're pretty much set.

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.320
There is a cue point,
but that's for ads,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.280
and not everyone uses that.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:47.340
So anyway, that hopefully
gives you some ideas for replay

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.870
and live.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.787
You could do some live
stuff on the device

00:13:50.787 --> 00:13:52.120
with the new version of Android.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.760
And screen share, you can
do some stuff with that.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:57.100
But you do have to be
aware that it's obviously

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.960
pretty-- encoding a video can
be kind of hard and on a phone,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.422
so you got to be careful
about how you do it.

00:14:03.422 --> 00:14:04.880
And if you're
interested in finding

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.320
about more details about
replay, in doing that,

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.840
we do have an I/O
talk, where we go

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.130
much more into detail on that.

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.490
So review.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.680
Empower your shares.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.450
Yes, they are a minority.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.345
But they spend more money,
they find more games,

00:14:20.345 --> 00:14:21.220
and they'll share it.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.630
They'll make these free
advertisements for you

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.880
that have good
click-through rates.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:29.590
And they're more important
to the mobile gamers

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.216
then trailers.

00:14:30.216 --> 00:14:32.090
Now I'm not saying
trailers aren't important.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.490
They are important.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:36.990
But game play is
even more important.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:37.650
Three times.

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.660
So this, just in the
last year, subscriptions

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.570
for gaming channels have
tripled in the last year.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.190
So gaming is a huge
deal on YouTube.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.830
Take advantage of it.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.410
If you want to find out
more about the tools,

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.690
just go in your favorite search
engine and search YouTube API.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.800
It'll probably be the
first thing that shows up.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.372
We have samples, libraries,
all that great stuff.

00:14:58.372 --> 00:15:00.580
And if you want to follow
more information on YouTube

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:05.300
and the developer community,
just go to YouTube-- oop,

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.690
sorry, youtube.com/dev.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:11.560
And we have a Google+
and Twitter handle.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.910
So thank you.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.980
Oh we have some
extra schwag, too.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.570
So after the next
presentation, if you

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.720
want to get some stickers and
pins for free, come on up.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:21.590
Thank you.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:26.359
[APPLAUSE]
