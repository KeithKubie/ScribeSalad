00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.490
Wow, that was a lot of feedback.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.970
&gt;&gt; That was a lot of feedback, but
very good, constructive feedback.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.340
&gt;&gt; Yes, good constructive feedback.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.900
&gt;&gt; You know,
we found some issues that we knew about,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.395
we found some issues that
we didn't know about.

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:16.530
One thing that strikes me here though is
that maybe we went a little overboard

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.500
on producing high fidelity mocks.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we definitely did,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.980
because we're going to need to
change a lot of these things.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.735
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.

00:00:22.735 --> 00:00:26.560
&gt;&gt; And man, I spent so
long getting this little plus, or

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.260
this little check marks to work right.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.580
I spent so long getting these fabs up.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.280
Wasted hours.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that we probably
could have dialed it back just a bit,

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.120
we probably could have gone with
some wire frames to suss out some of

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.380
the details that we were looking at.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.364
Particularly when we talked to Hugh and
we talked to Parima,

00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:49.155
we talked to them a little bit about
fab placement, things like that.

00:00:49.155 --> 00:00:53.950
Perhaps we could have done
that with a wider frame.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:54.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we could of.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.830
And I think that would have saved us a
lot of time, because we could've gotten

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.630
this feedback faster and then not had
to lose as much work as we're going to.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.390
One of the things we were sweating is we
were talking about some of these mocks

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.050
too is like the color and
position of some of these things.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.520
And I think that was largely
irrelevant to the feedback that we got.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.140
So I think that maybe some of
those discussions could have

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.810
waited until later in the cycle.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.480
&gt;&gt; They could have.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.140
Some of those things, some of
the design issues are things that came

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.810
up, like-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.970
&gt;&gt; We had the check box.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.580
That we asked people to
check off these apps.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.150
And Parema was able to find the little
check box here very quickly but

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.380
Hugh could just not find that there was
something in this app for to-do list.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
That's right.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.720
You know, I did find it interesting too,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.330
that we got contradictory feedback in
that regard from both participants.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.530
They wanted to look at the home screen.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.700
Hugh felt strongly that he
wanted to see past events or

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.850
completed events, where as Parema didn't
feel that she wanted to see them.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.386
She really want to see that be
as clean and clear as possible.

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:55.840
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.360
&gt;&gt; So I think we probably should
start annotating some of this stuff.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.030
&gt;&gt; We should.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.290
&gt;&gt; I think that one of the things we're
going to have to do is probably dig into

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.430
this screen a little bit.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.880
And we're probably going to have
to add a stronger affordance for

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.508
task completion.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.220
&gt;&gt; And yeah, it's clear that
even if we had intended for

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.750
the tasks to be swipeable here,
that's not intuitive.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.290
Yeah, let's get you
some post-it notes too.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; because we're going to take a lot

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.806
of notes here,

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:24.960
because we're really going to have
to focus on the next iteration here.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.900
We really need to settle in on
a specific interaction, so that we can

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.540
make sure that the next round of testing
we get a really cohesive flow and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.677
that our users really
understand that clearly.

00:02:34.677 --> 00:02:37.710
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So task completion was one thing

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.400
and the other thing we talked about
was whether or not we actually need

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.840
a strongeraffordance here for
completing tasks.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.495
&gt;&gt; This is a heads up
display screen though.

00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:47.330
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.440
So it is a heads up display screen and
we had intended it to be sleek and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.220
not have all of these
extra things on it.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
It's an at a glance type thing.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.570
&gt;&gt; But if we also, we had decided
originally that this was going to be

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.960
sort of equally a calendar app and a to
do app and so both those things should

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.020
be doable from the home screen from
whatever we screen we land people on.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.755
&gt;&gt; Well, actually Hugh had some
interesting feedback there, though.

00:03:10.755 --> 00:03:11.520
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.630
&gt;&gt; He was confused as to whether or not
this a calendaring app or a to-do app.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.190
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; We initially set out with the intent

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.040
of doing, I think, a mash up of both.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.460
he was really confused because it didn't
seem to be any task management here.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.170
There was, no what are we doing?

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.550
&gt;&gt; That's true.
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of who,

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.675
what, and where.

00:03:29.675 --> 00:03:31.675
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, who, where when.

00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:33.470
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
But now what.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; We're really missing

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.340
that what aspect.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.140
&gt;&gt; We are, and

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.750
that's a thing that we just completely
missed in the design process.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.190
We have options then to address that,
we can either say okay,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.610
we need to re-emphasize that.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.680
We need to have these big,
big check boxes here.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.250
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.470
&gt;&gt; Maybe even actually this shape here,
just pasted in,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.740
as the way of doing it,
because our icon is a check box.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.280
That is a thing that we clearly
have in the design up here.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.100
But it's not a thing that we
have in the design down here.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.630
Or we could do something
like change this icon,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.830
make it just a calendar again.

00:04:08.092 --> 00:04:10.270
And that's,
it's addressing a different problem, but

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.970
it's one that we've already
addressed pretty well.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.702
&gt;&gt; Well, but the thing that we really
wanted to go after here was that strong

00:04:17.702 --> 00:04:20.810
marriage between to-do and calendar.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.906
And so I feel like if we abandon
the to-do aspects of the app,

00:04:23.906 --> 00:04:27.915
then maybe we're not holding true to the
true promise of what we intended to set

00:04:27.915 --> 00:04:28.478
out to do.

00:04:28.478 --> 00:04:29.610
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.710
&gt;&gt; I do like your suggestion of re-using
the app icon a little bit more.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.670
Hugh gave us some interesting feedback
that he felt the affordance here for

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.500
the checkbox needed to be stronger.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.765
He missed it when he first looked at.

00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:43.490
Pradema also had some issues with it.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.840
We were talking about these gray circles
not being a strong enough affordance for

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.200
a checkbox, I'm sorry.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.505
So I think we need to really
strengthen this stuff.

00:04:52.505 --> 00:04:53.320
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.180
We can strengthen that
by making it larger,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.880
we can strengthen that by
making it square, because

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.885
again I expect radio buttons to be round
and check boxes to be square usually.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:02.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.450
One of the things that just came to mind
is that perhaps we can take just this

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.560
one screen and do a couple of
iterations on that one screen and

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.279
give those to some users for
some very directed feedback.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.130
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; On those specific elements.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.110
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Do they feel

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.070
good about using this check
box as that affordance?

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.440
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Will they pick up on the fact that

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.990
it is a way of completing the task?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.020
&gt;&gt; Right.
So you're saying we can do user testing

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.900
on just iterations of a specific
screen rather than the entire flow.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.133
&gt;&gt; That's right.
We can actually drill down on specific

00:05:32.133 --> 00:05:33.280
features, too.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.202
One of the pieces of feedback that we
got was actually talking about gesture

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:38.080
based support.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.450
&gt;&gt; Right, because we had one person
who said that the swiping should be

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.900
more options, and we had one person who
said that the swiping should be delete.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.660
&gt;&gt; That's right, or complete.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.965
Yeah so, I certainly think that we
should probably strive to keep our UI

00:05:52.965 --> 00:05:54.126
here very simple.

00:05:54.126 --> 00:05:57.726
So I don't know that Perdema's
suggestions of revealing a panel behind

00:05:57.726 --> 00:06:01.266
these screens is really going to be
the direction that we want to go in, but

00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:05.338
I definitely think gesture based support
is something that we need to investigate

00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:07.127
with a higher fidelity prototype.

00:06:07.127 --> 00:06:10.245
&gt;&gt; Right, and when I'm thinking
about that gesture based support,

00:06:10.245 --> 00:06:13.195
we can rely either on what we expect
users to have already seen in

00:06:13.195 --> 00:06:15.548
other apps or
we can have an instructional thing.

00:06:15.548 --> 00:06:20.242
We have this, mock over here, we have
a place that we can have information

00:06:20.242 --> 00:06:23.630
that's just sort of
an overlay on this screen.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; We could have that inform users about

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.970
how to swipe and
how to complete a task if we wanted to.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.339
&gt;&gt; I think that's something that we're
going to have to test a little bit more,

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:32.055
too.

00:06:32.055 --> 00:06:37.365
Because anecdotal evidence suggests too,
that some of these splash screens,

00:06:37.365 --> 00:06:40.635
that it prevents people from
actually engaging in the app.

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:41.205
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.
&gt;&gt; So

00:06:41.205 --> 00:06:45.000
sometimes they want a little
more serendipitous discovery.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.685
Pradema for instance,
was very willing and

00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:50.785
very tolerant of just playing
with an app to see how it worked.

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:54.170
Whereas I think Hugh was a little
bit more regimented in his need.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Hugh wanted it to be,
if it's a to-do list app,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.460
we should be able to
check things off quickly.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:00.140
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.730
That's right.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.719
What were some of the other
feedback that we got?

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:06.280
&gt;&gt; Well, first off,
we got some positive feedback, right?

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's always good.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.190
&gt;&gt; We got that the,
when we ask people to make a new event,

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.080
both of the testers they
went straight to these fabs.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.560
Especially on these two screens,
they just went straight for that fab.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.237
That's exactly what we'd hoped for and

00:07:20.237 --> 00:07:22.417
the affordances were clearly
big enough for those.

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:24.199
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Smaller than this affordance.

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.424
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the one question that did come
up is maybe this affordance is just

00:07:27.424 --> 00:07:28.640
a little bit too big.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it might cover up.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.910
I can't see whether it's just one
person going to this event or

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.030
multiple because one of them
might be under the fab.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.430
So we might actually be having a little
bit of an issue with hiding some of

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.006
the data there.

00:07:40.006 --> 00:07:43.860
But I agree, that positive feedback
is really encouraging that

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.210
at least the users are able to pick
up where the fat is and what it does.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.178
They all clearly understood
that that was event creation.

00:07:51.178 --> 00:07:54.790
&gt;&gt; We also got feedback that was
something we weren't looking for

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.760
originally, which is both of our
testers, we had them expect to be able

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.492
to click on this and open a screen like
this but that shows current details.

00:08:02.492 --> 00:08:04.320
&gt;&gt; Um-hm.
&gt;&gt; And we actually didn't mock that up.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.860
&gt;&gt; That's true, we did not.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.600
One of the other things that just
caught my eye in our design here and

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.110
perhaps something that
led to Hugh's confusion.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.190
If you look here,
we call this thing a task.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.710
If you look here, we call it a task.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.120
But if you look here in this
screen we call it an event.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.250
&gt;&gt; That's true actually.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.910
That is a thing that I
hadn't thought about because

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.780
as we were designing this we were
thinking of those as the same object.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:28.340
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.220
&gt;&gt; We were thinking
this is a task/event.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.390
&gt;&gt; And
I guess we don't communicate anymore.

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:34.580
That's a thing that we expect.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.390
We sort of had an expert
blind spot there.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.650
&gt;&gt; Yep, yep, that definitely happened.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.445
Well we're going to have to correct,
rectify that.

00:08:40.445 --> 00:08:40.970
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.075
&gt;&gt; Maybe involving a tech writer in this
project would be a good idea if we have

00:08:44.075 --> 00:08:44.735
access to one.

00:08:44.735 --> 00:08:45.800
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.910
&gt;&gt; But, that might cost
a little bit of money, so

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:49.940
maybe we should just keep an eye for
consistency.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:54.090
&gt;&gt; So, as another option we might be
able to present the same flow with maybe

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.720
all of these say events, or
all of these say task, or

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.360
some other word that might
communicate all of that and

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:03.850
just see is Hugh able to figure that
out, is Pardema able to figure that out,

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.830
is anyone else that we have in our
office able to figure that out?

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.830
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I think that's a great suggestion,

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.320
not only testing some of
the UI components, like for

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.100
instance where the fab was, or
whether or not there's a hero element.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.210
But testing the language of the app
is a really important part of

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:20.830
bringing the highest
fidelity to our experience.

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.850
We really want that measure of
consistency through our app for

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.810
our users.

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:26.570
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:27.250
All right.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.530
So wow, we've got a lot of feedback and

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.310
we've got a lot of things
that we can iterate on.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.270
I think right now it's time to take
a quick look at this feedback and

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.570
think about what is actionable.
