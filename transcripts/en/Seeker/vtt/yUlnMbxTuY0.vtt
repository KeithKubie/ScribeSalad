00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.850
With new 3D technology and virtual reality
systems making it mainstream, technology seems

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.420
to have our eyes covered, but what about our
ears.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:13.200
Hey guys Julia here for DNews.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.200
kids these days.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.080
seems they want their reality streamed right
to a screen near them.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.800
Well you’ve heard of 3D tvs and VR on your
phone, get ready for 3D Audio.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.949
This technology dates back to the 1800s, but
mono and stereo sound dominated the scene

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.550
for the past hundred years or so.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.310
3D audio or binaural audio immerses your ears
in virtual world.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.440
In a VR system, you might see a plane flying
overhead and the sound will move right along

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.440
with it.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.640
A lot of that sound depth recreates the doppler
effect.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.469
Think of the last time you were standing on
a sidewalk when an ambulance went by.

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.780
The siren probably sounded higher pitched
as it was screaming towards you.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.750
But as soon as it whizzed past, the pitch
dropped.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.190
And it’s all a matter of sound waves.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.899
When an object, like an ambulance moves towards
you each time a sound wave is produced its

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.670
starting point is closer to you than the last
one.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.379
So by the time the sound reaches your ears,
the waves are closer together, which means

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.299
a higher pitch. and the inverse happens when
the ambulance moves away from you.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.049
The wave is emitted further from the last
one stretching out the space between them.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.340
Which drops the pitch.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.689
So that’s easy enough to recreate with typical
recording equipment, but 3D audio or binaural

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.950
audio as it’s called takes it a step further.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.560
Basically because our ears are on either side
of our head and pointing different directions

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.929
rather than on top and facing the same way,
sound reaches our ears at slightly different

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:25.929
times.

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.369
We’re talking a fraction of a second, milliseconds
here.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.460
We would never notice, but this helps us know
which direction the sound came from.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.039
And it’s not just the position of our ears,
but the shape of our ears and head can change

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.899
how we experience sound.

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.429
Sound traces the shape of an ear in a particular
way and the way sound travels through our

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.489
thick skulls and squishy bits can change the
experience too.

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:49.350
The way anatomy effects sound detection is
called head related transfer function or HRTF.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.329
Without it, sounds sound flat.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.069
So how do we replicate that?

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.559
Well, create a microphone that’s shaped
like an ear and attach two of them to a recording

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:59.439
device or even something that looks like prosthetic
head.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.579
That’s binaural audio.

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.569
Seriously, just like virtual reality cameras
look.. well they still look a little silly

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.849
to me, like a bunch of cameras stuck to a
soccer ball and spiked on a pole. 3D microphones

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:09.849
look a little silly.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.040
There’s a lot of examples of people using
these types of microphones to make ASMR videos.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.420
When their crinkling paper or softly whispering,
they move from fake ear to fake ear, that

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.000
way the sound moves too and it just sounds
so real and intimate.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.349
Some people find this relaxing and even get
chills and tingles from it.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.930
While some of these systems can be used with
regular headphones, some researchers are making

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.930
them custom.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.579
Literally, every person would have a different
sound experience.

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:38.170
The technology came out of Microsoft’s Redmond
labs and uses something like a Kinect sensor

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.000
to scan a person’s head and shoulders.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.310
The software then creates a 3D model of the
person to learn their HRTF and predicts how

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.510
sound would reach their ears.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.319
It also tracks the movements of your head,
that way when you’re in a virtual reality

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.140
setting, the sound matches the direction of
your ears and eerily tricks you into thinking

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.359
a sound came from a specific location, like
a jet flying across the sky.

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.390
Or in a VR concert a cello sounds like it
comes from the right or from the left.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.959
And this technology isn’t just for headphones.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.420
Researchers are working on a way to bring
the power of 3D audio straight into your living

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.420
room.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.640
So the whole family can enjoy it!

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.440
No it’s not surround sound, which uses numerous
speakers to provide a 360 sound.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.621
It’s only 2 speakers, which work in a way
sort of like regular 3D tv does.

00:03:18.621 --> 00:03:21.900
3D works by producing two separate images
that get sent to different eyes.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.340
That works by color coding or by flickering
technology.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.889
3D speakers send slightly different sounds
to each of your ears.

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.340
Some versions only work if you sit in a sweet
spot.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.519
Others use head tracking technology, that
can track up to 8 heads at a time!

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.670
While it’ll be sweet to see how virtual
reality takes off with this technology, already

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.230
artists have starting playing around with
it.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.159
One of my favorite artists Imogen Heap used
it to create her song “propeller seeds”.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.319
It’s great seeing cool technology put to
practical use - something the U.S. Air Force

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.319
does a lot.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.120
And we wanna thank them for supporting DNews!

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.870
The United States Air Force is powered by
Airmen, fueled by innovation.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.459
Every day American Airmen go above and beyond
to break barriers both professionally and

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.459
personally.

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.510
Whether it’s overcoming poverty to become
a nurse and officer or becoming the first

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.440
female Thunderbird pilot, these Airmen are
doing what others once thought was impossible.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.879
So have you ever listened to 3D audio?

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.849
Did it live up to your expectations?

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:18.720
