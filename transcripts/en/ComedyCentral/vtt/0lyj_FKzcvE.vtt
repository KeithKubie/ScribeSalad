 - 'Cause if I say South
 Central, you're gonna think

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:35.301
 of your favorite scene from
 Boys in the Hood or Baby Boy.

00:00:35.334 --> 00:00:38.037
And I grew up where they
kept the craft services.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.272
 - Okay, okay.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:40.506 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You know what I'm
saying, two blocks away

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.675 align:start size:88% position:13%
from the scene is
where I was growing up.

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.010 size:84% position:42%
  - I got it, but
  you could see it.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.745 align:start size:88% position:13%
You could see it
- I could see it, yeah.

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:47.447
 - You could see where the
 (bleep) was happening there.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.948
- Yeah, exactly.

00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:50.183 align:start position:0%

 there, it's crazy down there.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.451 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - It was too blurry
 to know who was

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:52.885
 the good dude and the
 bad dude, you know.

00:00:52.918 --> 00:00:54.454 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:57.390
 - I like that, I just learned
 something new today, adjacent.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:58.724 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Do you feel like
 there's a difference

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.460 align:start size:88% position:13%
in your style of
comedy because you're a

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:03.029 size:88% position:44%
  West Coast based
  stand up comedian.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
 - Definitely because, I
 feel like I'm an L.A. dude.

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.901 align:start size:88% position:13%
 because you know I
 care about how I look.

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:11.871 align:start position:0%
 There's a certain way we
 talk, we enunciate, you know.

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.539
- I don't know, what is
that supposed to mean?

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:14.774 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.110
 - You know L.A. guys
 we talk this way.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.244
- Okay.

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.480 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Properly, improper,
 or something.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:22.148 align:start position:0%
  But you know, I don't
  have like a souther drawl.

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:25.418 align:start position:0%
 - I don't know if I'm going
 to agree with that rule.

00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:28.321 size:88% position:44%
 - I don't have that
 East Coast, B, son.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.922 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I don't have a
 drawl, I'm just like

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:32.291
that L.A. hire him immediately.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.493 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.494 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I want to show
 y'all some pictures

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:35.995
 of James from back in the day.

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:38.564 align:start size:88% position:13%
When James first started
doing comedy, okay.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:41.267 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Let's look at the
 hat, let's I mean uh.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.871 align:start position:0%
 - That's Chocolate
 Sunday's First Impressions.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:46.172
 - [Kevin] First Impressions.

00:01:46.205 --> 00:01:47.140 size:84% position:42%
  - That's when you
  get three minutes

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:48.307
and then they're like, no more.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.742 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And I took it
 straight to the face.

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:50.676
- Okay.

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.178
 - Like three minutes--

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.614 align:start position:0%
  - Let's just back up,
  and let's just not, okay.

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.616 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Yeah, I mean pause.
 - Yeah, yeah.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.884
 - I failed miserably.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:59.218
 - There you go, there you go.

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:02.021 size:88% position:44%
  - With my jokes.
  They did not land.

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.357 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You didn't take
 anything to the face.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.560 size:84% position:42%
  - No, I didn't, I
  took silence and

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:09.562 size:88% position:44%
 disappointment to the face.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:11.964 align:start size:88% position:13%
- There you go, alright,
now we're clear.

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:14.800
 - I'm about to send you off,
 to enter the next level man.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:17.136 size:88% position:44%
 This is big, one of
 the biggest moments

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.137
in your life right now.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.372 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh yeah.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.173 size:88% position:44%
 - And I want you to
 treat it as such.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:21.641 size:88% position:44%
  - Yes sir.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.075 align:start position:0%
 - I don't want you hitting
 the stage with those pants on.

00:02:23.108 --> 00:02:24.644
 - Oh no, this ain't
 even the stage outfit.

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.045 size:84% position:42%
  - Oh this isn't
  the stage outfit?

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:28.047 align:start position:0%
  - I have a whole different
  arsenal of apparel

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.283 align:start position:0%
  that's going to be just
  debuted with the material.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.117 size:84% position:42%
  - I fell much better now.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.951 size:84% position:42%
  - Watch me do it.

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:32.785
 - Okay, okay.

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:33.686 size:84% position:42%
  - Watch me do it.
