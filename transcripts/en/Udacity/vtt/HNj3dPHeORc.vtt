00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
With this answer, the rate of change of the number of recovered persons would be negative,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
meaning that that number shrinks.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This cannot be true. That number has to grow, so we can rule out this answer.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This derivative of a number of persons with respect to time

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
has to be something about persons per days.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It cannot be days times persons, so this cannot be true.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The remaining two answers are correct in that respect.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This answer which need to unbound its exponential growth. This works like compound interest.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The rate of change is proportional to the current value. This cannot be true.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So we are left with this answer, which make sense.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
For instance, if we have twice the number of infectious persons, this rate would go up

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
by a factor of 2--twice as many persons will recover per day.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And imagine you have 5,000 infectious persons, then you get a recovery rate

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
of 5,000 persons/5 days, 1,000 persons per day that recover.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
These 5 days seem to be something like a typical duration for the disease.

00:01:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So this is right answer.
