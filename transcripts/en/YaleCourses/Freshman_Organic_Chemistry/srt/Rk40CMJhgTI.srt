1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,110
Okay,
so this is what we looked at last time.

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:07,620
We looked at an acid base
reaction from a new point of view,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,600
from the point of view of bringing up
some homo to overlap with this unusually

4
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:15,750
low Lumo.
Why is it unusually low?

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,080
The Lumo sigma star of c of
h f why is it unusually low?

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,240
Is the overlap bad?

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,870
Does the hybrid orbital on fluorine
and the s orbital on hydrogen,

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,770
does that have bad overlap or is they
overlap? Well points right at it.

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,620
Good overlap. So that's not
the reason. It's unusual.

10
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:43,621
What's the reason that the energy of
this vacant orbit always unusual Dana?

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,250
Right? Cause blue rain started
very low, so that went down

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,370
well,
that mixed with hydrogen.

13
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:56,450
Hydrogen went up but didn't go up very
far because the energy match was bad.

14
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,300
So that's this Lumo the unfavorable,

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,510
a combination of fluorine and hydrogen,
which is at big on hydrogen or, yeah.

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,970
Fleury the one that
went up hydrogen, right?

17
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,610
The good one is mostly on

18
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,680
fluorine, the bad one. Sigma
Star, mostly on hydrogen.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,820
And it has that node shown as an
anti-bonding node. Sigma Star.

20
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:19,320
The Star means anti-bonding.

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,850
So when Ooh minus with it's high energy
occupied orbital. Now wait a second.

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,850
Why is it unshared pair on oxygen?
High Energy.

23
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:30,810
I thought oxygen had a big nuclear charge,
which would make electron stable,

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,000
not have them be high.
Why is o h minus?

25
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,380
Hi. Oh Vena, do you
have an idea about that?

26
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,260
What is it about o h minus the unshared
pair that makes the electrons unusually

27
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:51,660
high in energy is it didn't matter.

28
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,290
It didn't matter cause it did
mixed with anything else, right?

29
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:58,750
It's not like a bond that went down.
We're comparing it to

30
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,430
c h r I s,
e c Sigma Bonds that wet down in energy.

31
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,350
So even though oxygen started low,
it didn't go down right?

32
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:09,300
So it's on your left,
unusually high.

33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,990
And there's actually another reason
that this one is unusually high.

34
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,933
Josh.

35
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,310
Negative charge on oxygen doesn't
make electrons happy. Okay,

36
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:23,000
so let's tell them as long mixes with
that in the process of putting electrons

37
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:23,560
into that

38
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,180
orbital,
it makes the bond,

39
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,680
but also it makes it anti-bonding
between hydrogen and flooring.

40
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:33,940
So we draw that second curved Arrow
that shows the fluorine leaving with the

41
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:38,710
electrons that it already had.
Most of the electrons that leaves with,

42
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:41,620
not that you can really label
electrons and say, this one is this,

43
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:45,790
this one is this. But remember,
flurry mixed with hydrogen went down.

44
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:49,240
It already has most of those
electrons that came from hydrogen.

45
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,950
Now it has the mall. When it breaks
away, breaks away is that I am f minus.

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,560
Okay?
And that's an acid base reaction.

47
00:02:56,561 --> 00:03:01,561
The more general interpretation of
base than just h plus reacting with Oah

48
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:06,730
minus. Okay? Now let's
generalize a little bit further.

49
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,170
So notice that besides
creating a new bond,

50
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,550
which would happen with h plus mixing
the homo with this Lumo can break a bond,

51
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,320
right? If the Lumo shown there
has an anti-bonding node,

52
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:27,880
putting in electrons means that those
electrons will be more stable if flurried

53
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:32,440
moves away, right? So, so you
can, to not only make a bond,

54
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,940
you also break a bond.
So it's a make and break situation,

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,410
whereas h plus plus o h minus
is just to make situation,

56
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,990
okay? Now let's look at FCH three, right?

57
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,170
And look at the orbital and I'm going
to super impose on it the corresponding

58
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:56,110
Lumo of f c h three watch it.
Change

59
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,840
the carbon carbon bond as long or the
carbon fluorine bond is longer than the

60
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:08,140
carbon hydrogen bond. So it
moved away, but the shape,

61
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:12,860
especially around the fluorine is almost
identical. I'll back up and do it.

62
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,970
Do the change again,
right?

63
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:19,600
So it's going to have very
similar properties to what HF did.

64
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,250
So if I move it over,

65
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,900
you see it's going to be attacked by
something coming here to overlap with that

66
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:26,261
orbital.

67
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:31,180
Some high homo will mix with the low
Lumo and here we show o h minus doing it,

68
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:32,260
and then what will happen?

69
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,880
Remember we have this
anti-bonding node here.

70
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,970
What happens when electrons
go into that orbital Katie?

71
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,640
Okay,
yeah.

72
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,480
The fluorine will take electrons
and move away like that, right?

73
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:53,860
So we get fluoride and methanol,
right?

74
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,610
And this reaction, which we'll study
at the beginning of next semester,

75
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,520
and we'll mention a little bit
more as we go along this semester,

76
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:04,630
but systematically we'll talk about
it next semester is called sn two

77
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:05,620
substitution.

78
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,170
But notice it's from the point of view
of orbitals exactly the same make and

79
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:16,120
break situation that you had
with Oah minus reacting with Hf.

80
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:19,870
It's the same reaction,
just the names have been changed,

81
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,823
right?

82
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,170
So you could in fact have
called the reaction of Ooh,

83
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,590
minus with Hf.
You could have called that a substitution.

84
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,680
It could have been sn two substitution.

85
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,000
The difference would be that the atom
on which the substitution takes place,

86
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,950
the one that gets attacked and then
loses the f minus is hydrogen rather than

87
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:45,880
carbon. So you could call
both reactions, substitution,

88
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:49,210
or you could call them both
acid base reactions. Right?

89
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,240
So that's the way science,
as I said last time,

90
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:55,900
progress by seeing generality,
right?

91
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:59,870
Where things were thought to be before.
Okay.

92
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:04,700
So we have these two reactions, acid
based reaction, sn, two substitution.

93
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:08,030
What would happen if
we had Ethel fluoride,

94
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,410
sometimes known as ethanol,
improperly properly labeled.

95
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,460
Right earlier today. Okay. So that's,

96
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,310
that's the Lumo of ethanol.

97
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,430
Now that doesn't look exactly like the
Lumo we just calculated of ethanol,

98
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,130
but it's, remember it was the Lube
oil plus three wasn't that it?

99
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,090
That we found is either plus two or plus
plus three wasn't that the Lumo plus

100
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:32,721
three remember,

101
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:37,721
had this characteristic that it's a
favorable mixture of two simple pairwise

102
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,620
orbitals.
That one is what?

103
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,170
What's that orbital if you just saw that

104
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:57,220
same thing, it's the same
thing that's up there, right?

105
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,110
It's sigma star

106
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,110
c h instead of CF

107
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,480
or w uh, uh, it's certainly a sigma star,

108
00:07:07,481 --> 00:07:12,280
but it's an HC not of FC. Right?
Everybody got that? So it's,

109
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,200
but it's sigma star.
That's the important thing.

110
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:18,160
It's the anti-bonding combination.
Sigma Star C H.

111
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,200
Okay. And what's the other
thing that goes into this?

112
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:24,720
Lumo or actually the Lumo plus three.

113
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,020
It's this,
what's that?

114
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,690
All right,
Angela,

115
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,390
can you give it the name?

116
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:49,840
It's like
if you then just to Adam's what is that?

117
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,600
You speak up loudly. So everybody
from Sigma Star. So yeah,

118
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,600
everybody say that.
Oh Man.

119
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,170
And I say it's the favorable mixture of
these two because they're put together

120
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:09,130
so as to be bonding between them. Right?
So there were two vacant orbitals,

121
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,230
Sigma Star, CF and Sigma Star
C H. Right. And they mixed.

122
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,800
And the favorable combination where they
overlap favorably between those two is

123
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:22,660
the one we're looking at.
It's still vacant.

124
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:26,590
That's an unoccupied molecular orbital.
But that's the one we're looking at here.

125
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,590
Okay. Now, uh, how should it react? Well,

126
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,670
that one looks like the top right
except that the colors are changed,

127
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,613
right?

128
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,270
So how about doing sn two substitution

129
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:47,630
now Russell cringed when I
did that. What's wrong with
doing sn? Two substitution?

130
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,793
Yeah.

131
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,640
Aha.
What's hidden in here is that Bin,

132
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,940
it's going to be hard to overlap
with the blue on top without heavy,

133
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:59,460
an unfavorable overlap
with the red on the bottom.

134
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,750
So there's another way you could

135
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,880
do it. You could attack here, right?

136
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,500
And get a big orbital,
a big lobe all have the same sign.

137
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,100
So there you're going to get good overlap.
So might it do that?

138
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,120
So there are two possibilities that could
do the same as the topic could do sn

139
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,200
two substitution,

140
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,670
or it could put electrons into this
Lumo by attacking from this second Arrow

141
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,190
position.
And how do you know which one it does?

142
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,330
You do experiment. So this is
lore, right? And what we get to see

143
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,070
studying these reactions systematically,
you'll see that both things can happen.

144
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,450
They're both possibilities and
you can make little tweaks,

145
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,170
insolvent or based and things like that.
What Homo you're using.

146
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,020
That'll make it go a little more one
way or a little more of the other.

147
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,340
But that of course takes time to do all
the experiments and to hear about them.

148
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,590
But anyhow,
there are these two possibilities.

149
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,820
Now let's suppose it does the
second one, uh, now how do,

150
00:09:58,821 --> 00:10:01,130
how did I set it up so that
that would be favorable?

151
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,840
I didn't use the true Lumo have
the lowest energy of the molecule,

152
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:08,510
which I just calculated for
you at the beginning of class.

153
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:13,280
What I did was used that Lumo plus three,
but made it the Lumo.

154
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,350
And the way I made it,
the Lumo was to stretch bonds.

155
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,100
I stretched the ch bond and
I stretched the CF bond,

156
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,360
right?
And then if I,

157
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:30,440
this particular phase of
vibration of the Adams,

158
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,600
this one is in fact the Lumo. Okay,
now why did I want to show you this?

159
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,070
Look what happens if you
do that bottom thing. Okay,

160
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:44,150
so we bring o h minus up and the electrons
go into this and make a bond between

161
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:48,650
h and no, but there's a note
here that anti-bonding node.

162
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,420
What does that mean?

163
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,810
If you put electrons into this
orbital Lexi, what are you saying?

164
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,440
It'll break where?
Between the hydrogen and the carbon.

165
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,030
Okay, so we're gonna, we'll draw
a second curved arrow that shows

166
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,480
those electrons pulling out.
Okay, now where do they go?

167
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:15,890
Look at the, here, there's
an atomic orbital node there.

168
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,510
That's not an anti bonding node because
it's the node of the p orbitals on the

169
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:22,220
carbons.
Everybody see that?

170
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:26,150
That's not anti-bonding because it
doesn't go between the atoms that goes

171
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:28,520
through the Adams.
So in fact,

172
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,750
if you look at that blue and red
lobe in the middle there a little bit

173
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:35,390
distorted.
But what do they look like

174
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,740
if you look just at the red and
blue in the middle of Lucas Dot. P

175
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,543
Greek.

176
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,080
It's the Pi orbital made up of two P
orbitals to p orical at the carpet on top

177
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,110
of p orbital department on the
bottom for electrons in that

178
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:55,340
got a double bond between the carbons.

179
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,273
Okay?

180
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,390
Okay, so there's a pie
bonding between the carbons.

181
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:05,780
That means we can draw a second Arrow
that takes the electrons out of the bond

182
00:12:05,781 --> 00:12:10,781
that's breaking and puts them between
the two carbons to make a double bond.

183
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,023
Okay?

184
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,460
But now there's another node in this
Lumo there that anti-bonding node.

185
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,640
What happens with respect to that?
When we put electric

186
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,790
transit in this Lumo,
Rick, what are you saying?

187
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,370
The bond between CNF we'll break.
How will we draw curved Arrow shows

188
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,800
not starting at the seat,
which are the electrons that are leaving.

189
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,580
You started with the electrons
that are changing, right?

190
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,690
So where are they in this diagram here?

191
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,470
Here.
Tell me when to stop.

192
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,590
When I hit the lifestyle out here,

193
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,990
that's the one that's
building up electrons.

194
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,470
These are the electrons that are leaving
and where do I draw on the curved Arrow

195
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:14,460
to where are they going?

196
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,850
Okay. Onto the APP. So that's
what happens when the, Ooh,

197
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,040
that you get water,
you get ethylene,

198
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,230
the double bond and fluoride.

199
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,720
So this is called,

200
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:35,680
as you'll see just after we
talk about sn two substitution,

201
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,870
we'll talk about e to elimination,
right? And that's what this reaction is,

202
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:46,210
right? Uh, but that's just a cat. An old
category, right? If we want to make it,

203
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:49,510
what it is is the same kind
of Homo Lumo interaction.

204
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:54,511
Except this time we make two bonds and
break to bonds because of where the nodes

205
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:59,350
were in the Lumo that was being attacked,
right?

206
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:02,680
There were two anti-bonding nodes.
We break to bonds.

207
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,350
Okay?
Is anybody have a question about this

208
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,610
to see how it works? Lucas, why?

209
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,330
Why did I do it?
Because I knew the answer.

210
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,310
I knew that this reaction
does this eat to elimination.

211
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,680
Because when I studied organic chemistry,
we

212
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,970
did eat to elimination and never
talked about or bowls at all. Okay.

213
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,540
So I knew where I was going. I knew
what really happened. So I said,

214
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:34,541
how does that happen that this is the
orbital that actually gets attacked and

215
00:14:34,911 --> 00:14:39,680
it's in fact the Lumo plus three, right?
Why do the electrons go into that?

216
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,060
And then I saw that in a certain
phase of vibration of the molecule,

217
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,390
when this bond is long and when this
bond is stretched than it is the Lumo.

218
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,050
So the, when the Oah is attacking,
the Oah minus is attacking,

219
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,130
it's attacking you at a time that those
bonds are stretched at the same time.

220
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,760
Right? And then they break, okay.

221
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,580
It's a little bit of chicken and the
egg as to whether the electrons going in

222
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,590
make them stretch or they're stretching
allows the electrons to go in.

223
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,070
Right? But at anyhow, that's,
I knew what the answer was,

224
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:19,910
which you wouldn't have known if you
had just looked at the orbitals for the

225
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:23,870
minimum energy geometry of the molecule.
Okay.

226
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,990
Now let's look at,
let's generalize this to a complicated,

227
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:30,500
are fairly complicated reactions scheme,
at least by our lights.

228
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,190
So three ammonia molecules
react with chlorine.

229
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,680
That's called oxidation of ammonia,

230
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,460
and it generates hydrazine
the nitrogen nitrogen bond,

231
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,710
or actually hydrazine IOM.

232
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,880
It's a cad I and chloride
and ammonium chloride.

233
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:50,210
That looks pretty complicated.
There's a lot of changes going on.

234
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,380
How does it happen? Could we figure
it out? I think you can. Okay.

235
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,180
So in the starting material, I want to
find a high homo. Where do I find it?

236
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,620
Sherwin, could you help
us? What do I love?

237
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,310
I want to find the high volume only
is starting with Geraldine Hunt,

238
00:16:11,311 --> 00:16:14,730
starting Joe's or ammonia
and the chlorine molecule.

239
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,390
So what about them could give you a high,
unusually high occupied or goals?

240
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,980
Say, say clear. Yeah,

241
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:32,260
the unshared pair of ammonia.
Alright.

242
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:35,030
And has a bigger nuclear charge than c.

243
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,950
So you might expect the
electrons to be low in energy.

244
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,520
Never mixed with anything. So it
didn't go down to become a sigma bond.

245
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:46,790
So unshared, bear on, I
think that that's okay.

246
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,300
Now we have to react
that with some, uh, so,

247
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,410
and unshared payers are often denoted n
I actually the little n and I actually

248
00:16:56,291 --> 00:17:00,040
don't know why that is. It'd
be fun to find out, okay,

249
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:02,920
now we need a low Lumo.
Anybody got an idea

250
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,250
for what a low Lumo might
be in the system? Yeah.

251
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,110
What kinds of things
give rise to low lumos

252
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,030
Sam electro negative
electronegative nuclei, right?

253
00:17:20,031 --> 00:17:23,780
Big nuclear charges. You know,
people always say electronegative,

254
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,060
but that's the cart and the horse.

255
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,170
Why is something electronegative that
means it's a good place for electrons to

256
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:33,500
go because right.
It's because the nuclear charge is big.

257
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:37,100
That's what's fundamental. Okay. Where
do we find that here in the chlorine,

258
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,480
the chlorine now,

259
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,540
which orbital associated with the
chlorine is going to be unusually low in

260
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:48,560
energy. Does it have a, does it
have a vape at the atomic orbital

261
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,810
in mind? What's called chlorine
is in the last column, right?

262
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,030
So it just missing one electron.

263
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:02,100
So a chlorine atom has three
unshared pairs and one odd electron,

264
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,480
which is common with the other
chlorine to make that bond. Right?

265
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,090
So after the cl two forms,
where's the vacant orbital?

266
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,323
Anybody see

267
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,050
we had two chlorine's each with this,
with this odd electron.

268
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,010
They came together and
you got a sigma bond.

269
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,120
Where's the low Lumo Chris?

270
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,140
No,
six Sigma Star,

271
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,440
right? They each had one electron
come together. They went down,

272
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:44,070
but there was a sigma star that went up.
Sig Sigma Stars.

273
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,560
Really high energy, but not in this
case because of Sam pointed out the,

274
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:52,530
the nuclear charge is big, so it's
low. So Sigma Star on chlorine.

275
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,453
Okay.

276
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,610
So what kind of reaction
are we going to have

277
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,820
if we mixed sigma star of glory
with the unshared pair on nitrogen?

278
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:07,520
Have you ever seen a
reaction like this before?

279
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,170
Where are you at the Sigma Star
mixing with an unshared pair.

280
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,103
Kaitlin,

281
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,760
on the last slide we saw lots of
examples, right? And so Katelyn,

282
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:26,340
what happens will tell me how
to draw curved Arrow here.

283
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,543
Okay.

284
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,470
Electrons on the untrimmed bear
nitrogen. That's the high home. Well,

285
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,653
between one,

286
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,800
between the nitrogen and the chlorine.
They mixed with that vacant ornamental,

287
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,340
but the ones that the glory,
now that's an empty bonding.

288
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:56,620
Orbitals sigma star. So a chloride
leaves. So it's exactly the same reaction,

289
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:58,090
make and break that we saw before.

290
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,650
Okay. There. So we get, uh,

291
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,710
ammonium chloride and cl
minus plus minus net neutral.

292
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:14,250
We started neutral. We're still neutral.
Okay. And now we have one of the products,

293
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,390
the chloride up above we have.
Okay.

294
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,310
But we also have this molecule.
Now it has a low Lumo,

295
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:28,550
so it's reactive.
What is the low Lumo?

296
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,640
That's not what I would've said.
Turns out to be right,

297
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,080
but it's not what I would've said
they're going to be.

298
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,450
Nah,
it's gotta be vacant.

299
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:56,590
So what's the name of the
orbital Sigma Star? Nh.

300
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,050
Are there any other Sigma Stars here?

301
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,240
Russell cl,
which is,

302
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:11,241
which is going to be lower sigma
star in cl or Sigma Star and age.

303
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,620
I would add too.

304
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,760
So the most like the
lowest flew mo is for that,

305
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,540
for some homo.
Now what are we gonna use for a homo?

306
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:31,410
We have to have another reagent
for this to react with. Well,

307
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,580
fortunately that sigma star and h
is what we're actually going to use.

308
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,830
Okay.
It's the high homo.

309
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,900
We had three ammonias to begin with so
we can use another one. Same deal again.

310
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:43,950
Right?

311
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,950
So the best reaction I think would be
for the unshared pair to attack the

312
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:53,700
chlorine. At least that's something that
you could imagine. If that happened,

313
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,380
what would the product be

314
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,300
if Nh three attack cl,

315
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,740
it would make an Nh three
cl bond and lose one.

316
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,200
What? Russell. So what about this?

317
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,350
It could happen till the cows come home,

318
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,920
but the product is the same as the
starting material and no one cares.

319
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,220
It would exchange

320
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,100
which, which caloric, which nitrogen
is attached to the chlorine.

321
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,710
But unless you label them
with isotopes or something,

322
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:25,450
you'd have no way of knowing.
So that,

323
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:28,810
that probably does happen or at least
that I suspect that happened some of the

324
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:31,420
time. Right. But you don't care.

325
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,660
So now we resort to une Jews suggestion
that we'll use a different one.

326
00:22:36,971 --> 00:22:40,900
So we get a different product.
Okay. So we'll attack the,

327
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:45,160
the Nh bond. Now, uh, uh, Corey,

328
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,610
tell us how

329
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,900
draw curved Arrow to show this.
Where's the curved Arrow going to start

330
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,560
on the lone pair? The nitrogen.
And where will it end in between?

331
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,220
In between the end of the age
and what else will happen?

332
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,220
Which one? What's going to take
off with the electrons? Can you see

333
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,870
nothing? Well, that is what you Lou,

334
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:20,080
it becomes an unshaded pair on nitrogen.

335
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:25,110
Dan was in plus right now he gets the
electrons that formerly it was sharing

336
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:30,400
with age. So it ends on
nitrogen, right? So there's the

337
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,430
product and now I've highlighted in blue
another one of the ultimate products,

338
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,660
right?
So now we've made ammonium chloride,

339
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,323
right?

340
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,940
We've made one of the products,
but we need the other,

341
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,190
but we have this product
from the second reaction.

342
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:52,580
Now what do we have for a low Lumo here?

343
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,190
Maybe you have an idea.

344
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:09,770
You have only sigma bonds at an unshare
fair on nitrogen and three unshared

345
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:13,500
fairs on Flory, right? No,
but those were all occupied.

346
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,380
What's a vacant on?

347
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:20,381
But I'll hear what kind of vacant orbitals
you get in molecules that have only

348
00:24:21,151 --> 00:24:25,820
sigma bonds. [inaudible] no,

349
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:29,630
the p roles are filled with electronics
here, right? So they're not vacant.

350
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:34,870
Sigma Star.

351
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:39,940
Which segments you have to sit in each
sigma star and you have the sigma star.

352
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,220
Which one do you think it's lower?

353
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,130
No, it wasn't the one that
reacted last time was the Nh,

354
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:54,980
but it wasn't the lowest. The MCL was
the lowest. Why? We're quite ever,

355
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:58,920
we care last time because
the product one that reacted,

356
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,480
you got the starting material
back. So the care. All right,

357
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,200
so this time it's the MCL.

358
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,390
Alright, what's the hot high
Hobo we're going to use?

359
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,960
Ah, Wilson. Oh, we got a third one that

360
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,920
will bring it in and they're
the curve there owns,

361
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:30,970
there's the product
hydrazine high resilience.

362
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,070
It's got a proton and as a plus
charge. Hi Laura. Hi Laura.

363
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,820
All right, so that is the last
product. So we've done it.

364
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,510
So there are three of these
reactions that take place.

365
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,820
Three cycles of Macon break and
notice the difference among them,

366
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:54,080
right?
It's always Nh three that attacks,

367
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,940
but first that a tax chlorine,

368
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,600
none of the tax hydrogen
then at the tax nitrogen.

369
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:03,830
But it's the same reaction we talked
about on the previous slide. Right?

370
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,780
Making break. Okay. Now we're going
to look at for functional groups,

371
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,290
the c double bond o carbon eel amid
carboxylic acid and Al Lithium.

372
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:19,070
And after that we'll have done what we
wanted to do about functional groups,

373
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:23,150
although it will still be in your court
to do functional groups because you have

374
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:26,600
these wikis to do the same
kind of analysis on the
functional groups that we're

375
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:31,601
doing here on these four functional groups
and those are due Thursday and almost

376
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,760
all of them are signed up for,
they're just a few more to do.

377
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,750
So if you want a choice,

378
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:39,050
get there quickly cause I'll assign them
this afternoon I think because we're

379
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:42,050
almost at the end and I have to
make sure everything gets covered.

380
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,710
Okay, so the Carbondale
group, c o double bond.

381
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,270
This is probably the most important
functional group in organic chemistry.

382
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:54,600
Why is it so important?
A, because it strong,

383
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,530
so it gives stable compounds,
low energy compounds.

384
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,300
So you have a lot of Carbondale groups,

385
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,690
but paradoxically it's not only
strong but it reacts easily.

386
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,920
So it's easy to make things
from carbon eels. Okay.

387
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,330
That sounds contradictory, that it
should be both stable and reactive,

388
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:20,850
but it is. And we'll see why. So let's
look at the shape of the frontier.

389
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:25,200
Orbitals there six valence
electron pairs in the, uh,

390
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,350
in formaldehyde shown here from the side.

391
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,520
And we could show the molecular orbitals,
right?

392
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:36,300
The Claude knees style plum pudding,
molecular orbitals.

393
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,070
So the lowest,
uh,

394
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,220
so the lowest one is one s or two
s if you want to count the core,

395
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,750
right, which is at, which is mostly
on the oxygen, a little bit on carbon.

396
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,700
And then there's a two Px, two
p y n two P, Z as plum pudding,

397
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:58,410
orbitals. And then there's this
three s orbital and this three d x,

398
00:27:58,411 --> 00:28:02,970
y orbital. But let's look a
little more closely at that. Uh,

399
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:06,000
from the point of view
of Pairwise Interactions,

400
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:08,580
what things interacted with
one another to give these,

401
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,870
so let's do the kinds of pairwise
mixing we've been talking about.

402
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:16,860
There's the Homo [inaudible],
an older style picture of the Homo,

403
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:20,730
the one that's called
three d, x, y on the right.

404
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:25,350
And this is drawn at a w was based on a
different calculation and it's drawn a

405
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:29,790
different contour level, but you
can see what it, what is it? Mostly

406
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,260
the whole bone.
If you had to give a simple name to it,

407
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,150
what would you call him?

408
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,160
If you have neglected the
little tiny pieces on the right,

409
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,960
what does the look like,
chairman?

410
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,000
It's a p orbital on oxygen and
unshared Parabox which is mostly,

411
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:53,190
although it is mixed a little
bit with something else.

412
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,770
Now to see what else it's mixed with.

413
00:28:56,010 --> 00:29:00,960
We can go down the list by
three steps and look at that. Or

414
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,500
the one that's called two p y because
it also has that little bit of oxygen in

415
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:09,990
it,
but more of the other stuff.

416
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,660
Now let's look at nodes in these things.

417
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:18,470
There's nodes that are nodes of atomic
orbitals of the oxygen and the carbon.

418
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,670
They bisect the molecule. Those
don't have to do with bonding, right?

419
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:28,380
But the one on the top also
has an anti bonding node.

420
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,190
Can you see where that is?
Shy,

421
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,800
maybe between the carbon and
the oxygen is anti-bonding node.

422
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,930
So this is a favorable

423
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,130
and

424
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,570
an unfavorable combination
of in the front oxygen,

425
00:29:46,571 --> 00:29:50,380
the front left his oxygen and in the
back right as some sort of ch bond.

426
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,900
So we're those molecular orbitals are
made by combining two p of oxygen with

427
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,610
Sigma Chi.
In fact,

428
00:29:57,611 --> 00:30:01,420
two Sigma Chi is okay now,

429
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,330
which one is lower in energy?

430
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,290
The unshared pair on oxygen or Sigma Chi.

431
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:15,760
Notice that the oxygen has something going
for it, which is a big nuclear charge,

432
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,860
but the CHS has something going for it,
which is the bonding of the CH,

433
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:24,540
which lowered it from where carbon
and hydrogen atomic organism,

434
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,250
which one is lower?
The two P of oxygen or Sigma Chi,

435
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,090
which wins.
Can you tell by looking at this

436
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,130
and all

437
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,990
the favorable combination,

438
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:55,170
which looks mostly like the lower one
looks mostly like Cah and the unfavorable

439
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:59,400
one, the one that went up looks
mostly like, oh, so clearly the

440
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,770
Sigma Chi is lower in energy
than the two P of oxygen. Okay.

441
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,630
Now let's look at the Lumo up on top
and the plum pudding column, right?

442
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,980
And here's another version of that,
and you can see what it is.

443
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:16,580
It's made up of a p orbital on
oxygen and a p orbital on carbon.

444
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,560
Those are atomic orbital.

445
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,800
That's an atomic orbital node has
nothing to do with the bonding,

446
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,900
but there is an anti-bonding
node between them, right?

447
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:31,370
So this is the Pi star orbital,
not the occupied one,

448
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:34,160
but the vacant orbital, the Lumo, right.

449
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:38,120
There's poor overlap because as Pi Star,

450
00:31:38,121 --> 00:31:43,121
that's why it's unusually low and it's
also unusually low compared to see cc

451
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,930
because it's got an oxygen
in it high nuclear charge.

452
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:53,350
So poor energy match to Po is lower
in energy than the two P of carbon.

453
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,600
Okay? And there, we're going to show
this on the next slide, those two.

454
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,900
But the top one you see is the favorable
combination of two po and to peasy the

455
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:11,390
one of which this is the unfavorable
combination, but it's not the homo,

456
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,860
right? The homo is that unshared
pair on, on, uh, oxygen,

457
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:19,970
which is the dominant
thing in three d x y. Okay,

458
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:24,020
so now let's look at these. There's
the CEO, Pi bonding or bundle.

459
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,530
Now, which one should that
be big on? Don't look at it.

460
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,970
Which one should it be?
The Pi,

461
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,750
the favorable combination of
pee on oxygen and fee on carbon,

462
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:38,280
which should it be big on?
There's pee on oxygen,

463
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,540
P on carbon.
They mixed pie overlap.

464
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,970
Not Too much overlap so they
don't get so much up and down.

465
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,260
But what does this most of the bonding,
the bonding would,

466
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:51,410
what does it mostly look like?
Should look mostly like oxygen.

467
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,880
When you're looking at this picture,
it doesn't look

468
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,713
that way.

469
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:59,290
That's because of which contour tour we
drew because oxygen holds its electrons

470
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:03,700
closer, so by the time you get
out to a certain low you you,

471
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:08,750
so you get through the most
of the electron density of
oxygen as you go out one

472
00:33:09,141 --> 00:33:13,190
contour by the other of the onion.
That's the oxygen it.

473
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,930
They're more electrons inside.

474
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:19,430
So indeed it does have more electron
density on oxygen than it does on carbon,

475
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,020
but it doesn't show well in
this particular contour. Anyhow,

476
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:26,270
that's the pie bonding,
and this one is an unsafe,

477
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,610
a different unshared pair on oxygen.

478
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:33,110
That's mostly a p rich hybrid,
atomic orbital of oxygen,

479
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,250
but it's got a little bit of the ch
bonding and it's a favorable combination.

480
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:42,020
There's a little bit of favorable
bonding between there. Okay, and but,

481
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,360
but the nodes that you see in this,

482
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,780
it neither orbital are
the nodes anti-bonding.

483
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:52,100
They're always the nodes that go through
Adam's. They're part of atomic orbitals.

484
00:33:52,101 --> 00:33:56,090
These are bonding orbitals, the
occupied winds as you expect them to be.

485
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,900
Okay, but now let's look at that Lumo,
that vacant orbital, the Pi Star orbital.

486
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,300
What direction should a high energy homo
approach this in order to mix with it?

487
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:13,670
So it has to get good overlap as it comes
in and not run into the other nuclei

488
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,830
or the other electron density associated
with other oracles on the way yet.

489
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,540
Okay, well, here are three
possibilities. You could have

490
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,870
attack from within the plane,
from the oxygen end,

491
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,970
from within the plane toward the carbon,

492
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,050
or from straight up the halfway
between carbon and oxygen.

493
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:35,500
How do those look as ways for an
orbital to come in and overlap?

494
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,820
Suppose it came from the right.

495
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,980
Suppose you had a big ball like Ooh,

496
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,020
minus coming in along
that Arrow from the right,

497
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,730
you're going to get good overlap.

498
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,160
What would you call that situation?
Orthogonal.

499
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:56,110
Right? So you're not going to get over.
How about the left? The Arrow on the left,

500
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,700
that's also going to be orthogonal.
How about if you come from the top?

501
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,720
It's not precisely orthogonal,

502
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:07,960
but it's pretty close to her thought and
all you have both positive and negative

503
00:35:07,961 --> 00:35:10,180
overlap. So in fact,
none of those are good.

504
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:15,190
Now here are two other possibilities.
You could attack the oxygen

505
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,050
or on the top or you could
attack the carbon on the top.

506
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,300
Which of those do you think looks better?

507
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,090
Carbon wire on Jolen cause it's bigger.
Okay,

508
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:30,200
so I'd say that one smaller. So forget
that. So come in from the car and then,

509
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:30,800
okay,

510
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,800
so here's a better drawing of that orbital
and we want to come in actually from

511
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:40,500
that direction at a certain angle,
not 90 degrees.

512
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:44,040
With respect to the oxygen carbon bond.
Now,

513
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:47,880
why come in from that angle?
Why not come straight down on top?

514
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:56,990
There are the nodes, right?
This is furthest from the node.

515
00:35:56,991 --> 00:36:01,610
So you can overlap the load you want to
overlap with without getting near the

516
00:36:01,611 --> 00:36:05,300
blue ones. I'd say you shouldn't
come into the certain angle.

517
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,840
Now there's a prediction.
Is it true?

518
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:15,830
So what we're going to do is rotate this.
So the orientation

519
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:20,330
corresponds to a graph
that appeared in a paper,

520
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,560
uh,

521
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:26,560
buy donuts and Borghi in 1983
when they were analyzing this,

522
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:31,520
now what did they do? They looked at
ex-ray crystal structures of many,

523
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:35,120
many crystals that had
both a nitrogen in it.

524
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,560
So the unshared pair,

525
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:41,740
and they had a carbon oxygen double
bond and they looked to see in many,

526
00:36:42,021 --> 00:36:47,021
many different structures how those
atoms are arranged because they must be

527
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:51,880
arranged in a low energy way
next to one another. Okay?

528
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,800
That's the way they would
pack it in the crystal. Okay,

529
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:57,770
so now how's this diagram made?
Well,

530
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,340
notice that the carbon and
oxygen are drawn there.

531
00:37:01,341 --> 00:37:04,010
So that's the carbon and
oxygen and they're made.

532
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:07,310
So all these different crystals,
some have the group oriented this way,

533
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:09,110
some this way,
so this way some this way.

534
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:14,290
So you rotate all those crystals so that
their carbons are super imposed with

535
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:16,130
one another and all the structures,

536
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:21,350
the carbons are all there and the
oxygen is along this particular line,

537
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:25,280
which lies in the plane of the screen.
Right?

538
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,980
And then there are things attached to it,

539
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,330
which are our groups and our,
our group too,

540
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,600
that vis whatever group, hydrogen or
carbon or something attached to the,

541
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,630
to the carbon. There's one in front of
the plane and one behind the plane. Okay.

542
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:45,830
So we rotate all of these different
structures around that carbon oxygen bond.

543
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,640
So those things are all one,
Heidi and the other one,

544
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,830
the R in front hides the are behind.

545
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:57,490
And now we look with that orientation
to see where the nitrogen is nearby and

546
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:04,370
those dots up on the top show in many
different structures labeled a, B,

547
00:38:04,371 --> 00:38:08,990
c, d, e, f, g, H, I, j, k, l. Okay.

548
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,700
In all those different structures.
Where's the nitrogen? So in structure, uh,

549
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,280
g of particular compound,

550
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:19,040
the nitrogen is where the blue.is on top.

551
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,300
The carbon is all,
all the carbons are always there.

552
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,820
That's the origin right here.

553
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,580
The oxygens are along this line.

554
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,160
So the oxygen's along that
line and at that position,

555
00:38:31,161 --> 00:38:34,820
that distance and the art groups are
bent down a little bit from being,

556
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,160
one is here and the other one is behind.
Yeah.

557
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,493
Okay.

558
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,280
Okay. But now look, let's go. G, h.

559
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:47,281
I.

560
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,373
J. K. L. G. H. Hi.

561
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:52,460
Hey.
Hello.

562
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,130
Do you see what happens?
Let's go back.

563
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,130
Okay.
I h.

564
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:06,290
G these are five different
crystal structures. Look again.

565
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:10,340
So the nitrogen comes down
from one structure to the next.

566
00:39:10,341 --> 00:39:11,630
What happens to the RS

567
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,310
as the night as the night comes down,

568
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,710
right? The RS bend down. So the
nitrogen, the carbon, pardon me,

569
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:29,400
in the middle becomes a pyramidal
rather than planer. Back Up.

570
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,920
What happens to the oxygen as we do this?
There's g

571
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,660
H. Okay, now.

572
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:48,190
All right. Okay. So here's what
happened. The nitrogen moves down,

573
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:50,550
the RS bend down and the oxygen away.

574
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,170
Why does the oxygen move
away from the carbon?

575
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:57,400
From a theoretical orbital point of view,
where are you putting electrons?

576
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:02,050
Where are you putting the electrons here?
When you put them into this Lumo

577
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:09,550
into an orbital, that's Auntie
bonding between carbon and oxygen.

578
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:14,551
So the oxygen stretches away from
the car nowadays on the screen,

579
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,200
the units,
what does that that's on?

580
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:21,910
So it's zero is the origin.
That's where the carbon is.

581
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,630
And there's one offs from 1.0 2.0 3.0
so they start three the nitrogen starts

582
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:34,351
three on the carbon and comes in and
gets to be within about 1.6 or something.

583
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:36,300
And I forget my,

584
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,970
I'm guessing that that could an actual
bond between that nitrogen Carmen's

585
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,870
probably the order of 1.3 or something.
I'm not actually sure it is.

586
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:47,830
So they haven't quite bonded,
but it's following the pathway

587
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:51,680
of reaction when you look at a
lot of these different structures.

588
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,330
Okay.
Now that angle a 110 degrees,

589
00:40:56,350 --> 00:41:01,340
the along the path that they follow
is called the Borges Danette's angle.

590
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:04,490
That's the guys who did the paper hotspot.

591
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,630
Bergie and Jack Donaldson in Switzerland.
So,

592
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,070
so there is a,

593
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,400
a bunch of what we might
consider snapshots of a
reaction actually taking place.

594
00:41:16,761 --> 00:41:21,380
And you can see that there's a well
defined angle from which the nitrogen

595
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:24,020
approaches that Lulo as it mixes with it.

596
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:30,980
No resonance is in trauma,
like Eular,

597
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:36,050
Homo Lumo mixing. We've looked here
at intermolecular, which is reaction.

598
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,680
But next time we'll go onto this slide
and look at the analogous thing that

599
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:42,130
happens within a molecule.
Okay.
