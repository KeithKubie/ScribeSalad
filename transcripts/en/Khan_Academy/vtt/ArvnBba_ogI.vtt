00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.460
Diya is looking to buy a plot
of land to build her home on.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.020
She finally narrows
her search to two plots

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.090
that both have good locations.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.530
The plot at 314159 Apple
Lane has a width of 30 meters

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.930
and a length of 40 meters.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.340
The plot at 11235 Fibonacci
Drive has a width of 50 meters

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.520
and a length of 20 meters.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.410
They are each being
sold for $36,000.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.850
Which one is a better deal?

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.670
So they're the same
price, and they're

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.350
in comparable neighborhoods.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.480
So really, the better
deal is the one

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.390
that actually gets me more area.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.640
So I encourage you to pause
the video and think about,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.300
which one of these am
I getting more land

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.632
for the same amount of money?

00:00:51.632 --> 00:00:53.590
Well, to think about how
much land I'm getting,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.298
I'm really thinking
about, how much space

00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:56.394
is that plot taking up?

00:00:56.394 --> 00:00:57.810
Or I'm really
thinking about, what

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.670
is the area of each
of these plots?

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.640
And we've already
figured out that you

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.690
can calculate the
area of a rectangle

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.120
by multiplying its
length times its width.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:18.670
So the area of Apple Lane is 40
meters times 30 meters, which

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.706
is equal to-- 40 times 3 is 120.

00:01:22.706 --> 00:01:26.820
40 times 30 is 1,200.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.590
And then it's
meters times meters.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:37.322
Or you can view this as square
meters, 1,200 square meters.

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:38.780
Now let's think
about what the area

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.610
of the plot at
Fibonacci Drive is.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.850
So its length is 20.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.650
Its width is 50.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:55.680
So here the area is 20
meters times 50 meters, which

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.720
is equal to-- 20 times 5 is 100.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.680
20 times 50 is
1,000 square meters.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.090
So it's pretty clear when
you calculate the area

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.880
that Apple Lane, you're getting
more square meters than you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.550
would get at Fibonacci Drive.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.940
And literally, when we say
1,200 square meters, that

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.390
means if you were to
put a 1 meter by 1

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.390
meter square here--
so a really small one

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.180
like that-- then you
could fit 1,200 of these

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.270
on this plot of land, while you
could only fit 1,000 of them

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.080
on this plot of land-- of these
1 meter by 1 meter squares.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.190
So we have a larger area, same
neighborhood or comparable

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.890
neighborhood for the same price.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.160
I would go with Apple Lane
being the better deal.
