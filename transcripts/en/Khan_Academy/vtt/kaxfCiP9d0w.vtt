00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.210
- [Voiceover] We're told
carbon-14 is an element

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.065
which loses exactly half of
its mass every 5730 years.

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:09.188
The mass of a sample of carbon-14

00:00:09.188 --> 00:00:11.405
can be modeled by a function, M,

00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:14.620
which depends on its age, t, in years.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.149
We measure that the initial mass

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:20.587
of a sample of carbon-14 is 741 grams.

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.497
Write a function that models the mass

00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:25.210
of the carbon-14 sample remaining t years

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.066
since the initial measurement.

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:29.143
Alright, so, like always, pause the video

00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:30.978
and see if you can come
up with this function, M,

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:33.067
that is going to be a function of t,

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:36.457
the years since the initial measurement.

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:37.908
Alright, let's work through it together.

00:00:37.908 --> 00:00:39.545
What I like to do is, I
always like to start off

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.785
with a little bit of a table
to get a sense of things.

00:00:42.785 --> 00:00:46.266
So let's think about t, how much time,

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.812
how many years have passed
since the initial measurement,

00:00:48.812 --> 00:00:53.625
and what the amount of
mass we're going to have.

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:55.527
Well, we know that the initial,

00:00:55.527 --> 00:00:56.859
we know that the initial mass

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.885
of a sample of carbon-14 is 741 grams,

00:01:00.885 --> 00:01:05.885
so at t equals zero, our mass is 741.

00:01:06.062 --> 00:01:10.010
Now, what's another interesting
t that we could think about?

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.446
Well, we know at every 5730 years,

00:01:13.446 --> 00:01:17.150
we lose exactly half of
our mass of carbon-14.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.982
Every 5730 years.

00:01:19.982 --> 00:01:24.521
So let's think about what
happens when t is 5730.

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:26.761
Well, we're going to
lose half of our mass,

00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:30.441
so we're going to multiply this times 1/2.

00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:34.702
So this is going to be 741 times 1/2.

00:01:34.702 --> 00:01:37.244
I'm not even gonna calculate
what that is right now.

00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:41.123
And then let's say we have
another 5730 years take place,

00:01:41.123 --> 00:01:42.445
so that's going to be,

00:01:42.445 --> 00:01:45.986
and I'm just gonna write two times 5730.

00:01:45.986 --> 00:01:47.589
I could calculate what it's going to be.

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:48.319
10,000,

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.303
11,460 or something like that.

00:01:51.303 --> 00:01:54.147
Alright, but let's just
go with two times 5730.

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.145
Is it 10? Yeah.

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:59.104
10,000 plus 1400 so 11,400 plus 60.

00:01:59.104 --> 00:02:00.764
Yeah. So 11,460.

00:02:00.764 --> 00:02:02.285
But let's just leave it like this.

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:04.665
Well, then, it's gonna be this times 1/2.

00:02:04.665 --> 00:02:09.665
So it's gonna be 741 times 1/2 times 1/2.

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:13.662
So we're gonna multiply by 1/2 again.

00:02:13.662 --> 00:02:18.662
And so this is the same thing
as 741 times 1/2 squared.

00:02:20.338 --> 00:02:21.765
And then, let's just think about

00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:25.062
if we wait another 5730 years,

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:28.695
so three times 5730.

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:31.760
Well, then it's going
to be 1/2 times this.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.183
So it's going to be 741,

00:02:34.183 --> 00:02:39.058
this times 1/2 is gonna
be 1/2 to the third power.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.903
So you might notice a little
bit of a pattern here.

00:02:41.903 --> 00:02:45.141
However many half-lifes we
have, we're gonna multiply,

00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:47.358
we're gonna raise 1/2 to that power

00:02:47.358 --> 00:02:51.237
and then we multiply it
times our initial mass.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.105
This is one half-life has gone by,

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:55.543
two half-lifes, we have
an exponent of two,

00:02:55.543 --> 00:02:57.737
three half-lifes, we multiply by three.

00:02:57.737 --> 00:03:00.697
Sorry, we multiply by 1/2 three times.

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:03.634
So what's going to be a
general way to express M of t?

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:08.634
Well, M of t is going to be
our initial value, 741, times,

00:03:09.381 --> 00:03:11.518
and you might already be identifying this

00:03:11.518 --> 00:03:13.677
as an exponential function,

00:03:13.677 --> 00:03:16.063
we're going to multiply times this number,

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:17.878
which we could call our common ratio,

00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:20.235
as many half-lifes has passed by.

00:03:20.235 --> 00:03:22.719
So how do we know how many
half-lives have passed by?

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.298
Well, we could take t,

00:03:24.298 --> 00:03:26.501
and we could divide it by the half-life.

00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:29.446
And try to test this out.

00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:31.804
When t equals zero, it's gonna
be 1/2 to the zeroth power,

00:03:31.804 --> 00:03:34.984
which is just one, and
we're just gonna have 741.

00:03:34.984 --> 00:03:37.317
When t is equal to 5730,

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.545
this exponent is going to be
one, which we want it to be.

00:03:40.545 --> 00:03:43.482
We're just gonna multiply our
initial value by 1/2 once.

00:03:43.482 --> 00:03:45.943
When this exponent is two times 5730,

00:03:45.943 --> 00:03:48.464
when t is two times 5730,

00:03:48.464 --> 00:03:50.099
well then the exponent is going to be two,

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.177
and we're gonna multiply by 1/2 twice.

00:03:52.177 --> 00:03:54.047
It's going to be 1/2 to the second power.

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:56.658
And it's going to work
for everything in between.

00:03:56.658 --> 00:03:58.701
When we are a fraction
of a half-life along,

00:03:58.701 --> 00:04:01.696
we're gonna get a non-integer exponent,

00:04:01.696 --> 00:04:03.763
and that, too, will work out.

00:04:03.763 --> 00:04:05.423
And so this is our function.

00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:07.107
We are,

00:04:07.107 --> 00:04:09.220
we are done.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.435
We have written our function, M,

00:04:11.435 --> 00:04:13.455
that models the mass
of carbon-14 remaining

00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:16.307
t years since the initial measurement.
