00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.110
- [Instructor] Let g
of x equal one over x.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.140
Can we use the intermediate value theorem

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.028
to say that there is a value c,

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:11.067
such that g of c is equal to zero,

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:14.380
and negative one is
less than or equal to c,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.900
is less than or equal to one?

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.204
If so, write a justification.

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:21.890
So in order to even use the
intermediate value theorem,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.420
you have to be continuous
over the interval

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.253
that you care about.

00:00:25.253 --> 00:00:27.450
And this interval that we
care about is from x equals

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.350
negative one to one.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.953
And, one over x is not
continuous over that interval,

00:00:32.953 --> 00:00:36.240
it is not defined when x is equal to zero.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.693
And so, we could say, no, because,

00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:45.463
g of x not defined, or I
could say not continuous.

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:55.290
It's also not defined on
every point of the interval,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.290
but let's say not continuous
over the closed interval

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.290
from negative one to one.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.960
And we could even put in
parentheses not defined,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.270
at x is equal to zero.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.288
All right, now let's start
asking the second question.

00:01:13.288 --> 00:01:15.800
Can we use the intermediate
value theorem to say

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.934
that the equation g of x is equal to 3/4

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:21.510
has a solution where 1 is
less than or equal to x,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.270
is less than or equal to two?

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.817
If so, write a justification.

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.930
All right so first let's
look at the interval.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.444
If we're thinking about the
interval from one to two,

00:01:29.444 --> 00:01:31.900
well, yeah, our function
is going to be continuous

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.900
over that interval, so we
could say g of x is continuous

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.849
on the closed interval from one to two.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.200
And if you wanted to put
more justification there,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.373
you could say g defined
for all real numbers,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.373
such that x does not equal zero.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.380
I could write g of x
defined for all real numbers

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.296
such that x does not equal to zero,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:14.740
and you could say rational
functions like one over x,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.337
are continuous at all
points in their domains.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.306
That's going really
establishing that g of x

00:02:30.306 --> 00:02:32.200
is continuous on that interval.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.473
And then we wanna see what
values does g take over,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.940
take on at the end point, or actually,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.060
these are the end points we're
looking at right over here.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.500
G of one is going to be
equal to one over one is one,

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.500
and g of two is going to be one over two.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:56.254
So, 3/4 is between g of one and g of two,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.910
so by the intermediate value theorem,

00:03:08.015 --> 00:03:12.233
there must be an x that is in the interval

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:24.993
from where it's talking about
the interval from one to two,

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:31.205
such that g of x is equal to 3/4.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.155
And so, yes, we can use the
intermediate value theorem

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:42.240
to say that the equation
g of x is equal to 3/4

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.723
has a solution, and we are done.
