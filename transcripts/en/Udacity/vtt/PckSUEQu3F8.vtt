00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[David Evans, Professor, CS101] Welcome to the first "Office Hours" for CS101.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.410
 [Peter Chapman, Assistant Instructor, CS101] I'm here with Peter Chapman, the assistant for the class.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.710
You've been seeing Peter a lot online, you may not have seen him in person until now.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.000
We want to thank you all for all the questions you've been posting in the forums,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and voting on the popular questions. And we will get started answering them now.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.460
&gt;&gt; Okay, so our first question is from user Mortazavi from Iran--and he asks-- 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.000
He liked Sergey Brin's presence in the class at the beginning, his guest appearance, 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.630
and he wants to know if that will be repeated later on?

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.000
&gt;&gt;Well, I liked having Sergey in the class as well--Sergey is quite a busy person, 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.800
he's running a company that you may have heard of 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.960
that has hundreds of millions of people 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.940
wanting their queries responded to everyday--

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.440
so he doesn't have a lot of time to help us out with a class.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.550
There will be at least one more appearance of Sergey somewhere later in the course.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.680
I won't tell you where exactly now.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.590
We will have lots of appearances from other people that are experts in search engines,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.420
as well as other areas of computing, and those will be scattered throughout the units--

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.000
as well as we will especially focus on that--

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
putting computing in a broader context in the last unit, 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.960
and we'll have lots of interviews with interesting people in that unit.
