00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.520
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.270
There are so many good fighters that are coming out of Dagestan right now and

3
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:11.150
all technicians.
So it's incredible.
It's incredible.
Whatever's in the water,

4
00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:14.220
they styles too.
Like Zebbie legs up beat style.
Very,

5
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:18.120
very different than a wrestling heavy style.
Look at this guy.

6
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.410
I met Jesus Christ.
Oh my God.
What a scramble.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.120
So this is a,

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.970
I'll do Russia aid Rashid Abdulla Rashim called and said alive.
No,

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.940
don't tell me how to say it.
I'll figure it out.
I don't know.

10
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.710
She told her she'd do her.
She had said alive so alive.

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.490
And you know what the,
there's a poetic,
uh,
cause him,

12
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.520
there's a poetic nature to the,
to these guys.
I mean,
they're just,

13
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:46.470
that could be really,
I mean there's simple good people,
right?

14
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:49.530
They're a,
they're pretty religious and they just kind of,

15
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.450
they don't even believe in fame.
They just believe in excellence.

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.643
Well,
you know,

17
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.710
Dan was sort of evident and the mindset behind them was sort of evident at the

18
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:05.841
end of that fight with Conor where they went crazy and he jumped into the crowd.

19
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:08.610
He's like,
he's not playing games.
Like he's not,

20
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.470
he's not doing this for Instagram likes or for,
you know,
this is really,

21
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.620
he takes trash talking all this stuff very seriously.

22
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:18.000
This is all about honor for him.

23
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.700
I think that was kind of upsetting because true.
But,

24
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.060
but don't do that.
Yeah.
And to that,
and uh,
also respect,

25
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.010
I'd hate to say,

26
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.020
but I think there's a certain ethic and honor to the way Conor McGregor carries

27
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:37.920
himself to all that trash talk.
If you look at the end of the fights,

28
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
he's very calm.
He's very kind and respectful and defeat.

29
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.770
And when they guess it's a different culture,

30
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.940
if you compare the Dagestani versus Irish culture is just a different culture

31
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:52.170
and you have to respect that I think could be,
to be honest,

32
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.550
disrespected Connor's culture as much as of just suspect to Qvc.

33
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.940
I get what you're saying.
But I mean,
when he was done with the fight,

34
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:01.260
he didn't keep attacking Connor.

35
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.590
It was people in the audience that we're talking shit that were training

36
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:07.220
partners and motion for as high.
That's,
yeah,
he would,

37
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.430
he had heard that for weeks and he was,
he was done for months.
He was done.

38
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.760
He was like,
fuck you,
I beat his ass.
I'm gonna beat your ass.
And he just said,

39
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:16.860
I'm not playing games.
And he jumped into the fucking crowd.

40
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.120
I think security could have been handled far better and we'll be in the future

41
00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:23.820
to prevent things like that from happening where people just jumped into the

42
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:28.410
cage and you know,
I,
but I,
I hate seeing that shit,

43
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.240
but I,
but I appreciate where he's coming from.
I mean,

44
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:34.830
that's who the fuck that guy is,
man.

45
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.030
That's one of the reasons why he's so good as he does have that mindset.

46
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.030
It's one of the reasons,
man,
one of the reasons why he's so relentless.

47
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.330
Like he's not playing games.
He is who he is.

48
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.960
What you see is what you get and what you get as a killer and he's,

49
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:52.670
he's there smash.
I would've loved to see Conor McGregor versus could be,

50
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.330
it could be before the Mayweather fight,
like,
um,

51
00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.660
before Conor [inaudible] gotten,
I think the money makes you less hungry.

52
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.600
Oh for sure.
And do it ain't hungry at all.
I mean,

53
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.790
he's got $100 million,
but I think he still loves to compete,

54
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.820
but there's no hunger anymore.
Like Dan,
no hunger.
I mean,

55
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:17.050
he might be hungry for success,
but he's,
there's no desperation.
Yeah,

56
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.590
I dunno if that's,
I know what you're saying.
Like he has a lot to lose now too.

57
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.950
It's a different thing.
He enters into a fight with $100 million in the bank.

58
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.300
It's a very different experience than entering into the fight with 1 million and

59
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:32.200
hoping that you could make three more tonight than,
you know,
like many,

60
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.270
I'm sure fights that he's had in the past.

61
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.520
It's a different world wants whatever he wants forever.
I mean,

62
00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:43.010
once a fighter though is a fighter and that there is an element there that he

63
00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:47.890
still wants glory,
I believe.
Still only 30 yeah,
right.
You still do it.
Yeah.

64
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.570
I mean he's,
I think,
how old's Connor
at the most?

65
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:57.220
He's like 32 or some shit 30 yeah.
He's young man.

66
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.690
To be set for the rest of your life at 30 is kind of fucking bananas.

67
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.930
And I don't think he's at his peak as a fighter.

68
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.660
So if he just decides who gives a fuck about the money,
I'm just,

69
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:10.030
I'm here to leave a legacy and I'm going to,

70
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.540
I'm going to just train like a fucking demon and he kicks aside all of the bad

71
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:19.900
influences and all the distractions in his life and just focuses on training

72
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.470
mean he's a motherfucker,
man.
I mean,
you saw what he did to Aldo.

73
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.760
So what he did to Chad Mendez style,
but he did the Dustin poor.
Yay.
I mean,

74
00:04:27.761 --> 00:04:30.340
he is a bad motherfucker,
period.

75
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:32.830
I know you're going to shut this down as most fans do,

76
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:36.790
but if he drops everything and goes to like Siberia to train,

77
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.410
I would love to see him and could be two.
Well,

78
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:45.460
there's nothing that's my friend Hollins and camp and a con or sparring just

79
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:48.640
fucking around powerful on it.
Logo in the background.
It's like a Goddamn on it.

80
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:51.160
And that,
um,
yeah,

81
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:54.860
I mean he's always going to have a problem with QB.
Could,
bebes.

82
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.260
Wrestling is so high level,
it's so different.

83
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.590
He smothers you in a way that you think you have good takedown defense to.

84
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:08.830
You run into that motherfucker and he just gets a hold of everyone who does it

85
00:05:08.831 --> 00:05:12.330
to everyone,
whether you're Michael Johnson or Edson Barboza,

86
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.700
no matter how good your take down defense looked in the past and the Barboza

87
00:05:15.701 --> 00:05:20.410
fight,
he was just basically just waited towards him,
waited through the fucking,

88
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.120
the fury of leg kicks and punches and just clamp,
drag,

89
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.460
smash.
And that's what he does to everybody,
man.
Yeah.

90
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.920
The real thing about a guy like him would be seeing a guy like him against a guy

91
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:33.850
like Jordan burrows.

92
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.270
Like could he do that to a guy who was a spectacular wrestler as well?

93
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:44.410
Then it becomes me and his striking,
which is gotten very high level.

94
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.590
He's very dangerous striking.
So I dropped Connor.
I mean he can,

95
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:52.390
he can fuck people up.
He stopped.
Um,
there was some,
he's,
he stopped.

96
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:55.120
A few people strikes.
He me,
he's dangerous.

97
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.090
He's dangerous enough on the that you would have to,

98
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.373
I don't know how much,

99
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.330
how many really high level grapplers also have like striking that can stand with

100
00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.850
them.
Cause if he decided to keep it up,

101
00:06:06.851 --> 00:06:09.860
you'd have an advantage there until they got good at it.

102
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.410
Him versus Ben asking it would be very interesting.
Well,

103
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:16.850
he would have an advantage and striking over aspirin and a in wrestling.

104
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:21.440
I don't know.
No big fellow too.
Are they the same way?

105
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.490
No.
Oh,
he's 55 her 70 okay.
Okay.

106
00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.820
So I'll ask her and could probably make 55 I mean if you tortured him,

107
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.440
he's got a dad bod though and he's
rude.

108
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.150
No,
he's,
he's proud.
Dad is proud of his body.

109
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.790
I think he was that way in college too.
He was never,

110
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.780
it was never likes Brock Lesnar.
No.
And he was super technical.
