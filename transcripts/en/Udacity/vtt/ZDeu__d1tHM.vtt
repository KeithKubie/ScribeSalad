00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.000
You now know the basics of finding,
installing and enabling a plugin.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.607
I've provided you a link in the notes,
but the search for

00:00:06.607 --> 00:00:10.247
autoprefixer plus gulp on Google would
have reveled the MPM plugin right away,

00:00:10.247 --> 00:00:12.064
and installation process is the same.

00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:15.360
MPM installer gulp-autoprefixer
in the terminal.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.050
And in a requirement of the gulp file.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.400
Here's the key part.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.250
The autoprefixer object is just
another receiver of a pipe dream.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.980
Pipe stream.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.070
I was just testing if
you're listening closely.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.200
And since we already have
a pipe coming from Sass,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.390
we simply add a new line right before
it arrives at its destination.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.680
Like so.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.620
Almost there.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.156
We finally insert a configuration object
to specify the browser's option of

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:41.770
autoprefixer, which tells autoprefixer
for which browser versions to prefix.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.390
In this case,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.760
we'll just instruct it to use the last
two versions of every popular browser.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.320
And as step two of three, see the filter
property used on the image in main.scss?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.130
Remove the prefix,
then rerun gulp styles in the terminal.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.120
And here's the generated CSS file
with all the right prefixes.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.620
Excellent.
