HERBERT GROSS: Hi, our lecture
today is entitled

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.770
differentiation of inverse
functions.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.800
And it pulls together
two previous

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.720
topics that we've discussed.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.510
Namely, inverse functions
themselves, and secondly, the

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.400
chain rule that we've
discussed just

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.800
a short time ago.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.720
And perhaps the best way to
introduce the power of

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.250
differentiation of inverse
functions is to start out with

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.450
such a problem.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.720
Let's actually try to
differentiate a particular

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.870
function, which at least up
until now, we have not been

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.430
able to differentiate.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.440
The function happens to be y
equals the cube root of 'x'.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.200
In other words, 'y' equals
'x to the 1/3'.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.210
Let's find 'dy dx' if 'y'
equals 'x to the 1/3'.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.380
Now, the whole idea of inverse
functions is what?

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.240
That it gives us a chance
to paraphrase.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.310
That we can interchange the role
of the dependent and the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.810
independent variables.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.740
And like any other form of
paraphrase, even though two

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.250
things may be synonymous,
psychologically one of the two

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.920
may be easier for us to
visualize than the other.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.970
In particular, in this
particular case, if 'y' equals

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.130
'x to the 1/3', another way
of writing the same

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.280
thing is to say what?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.780
'x' equals 'y cubed'.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.590
And now, given that 'x' equals
'y cubed', in other words,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.280
with treating 'x' as a function
of 'y', we certainly

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.430
know how to differentiate 'y
cubed' with respect to 'y'.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.470
Namely, we know that for
a positive exponent to

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.900
differentiate, all we have to do
is bring the exponent down

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.780
and replace it by one less.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.000
In other words, right away what
we can say is that 'dx

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.280
dy' is '3y squared'.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.290
Now if we use the result of last
time that we talked about

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.590
when we were discussing the
chain rule, and I'll review

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.540
that result in just
a few moments.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.150
But for the time being, let's
assume that we have the result

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.190
that 'dx dy' is the reciprocal
of 'dy dx'.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.950
In other words, if 'dy dx' is
'1 over 'dx dy'', that tells

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.450
us that 'dy dx' is '1
over 3y squared'.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.770
And I guess to write that in a
more convenient form, that's

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.670
'1/3 y to the minus
2' if you're used

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.400
to exponential notation.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.450
If we now recall from above that
'y' is equal to 'x to the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.500
1/3', this can now be written
as ''1/3 x to the 1/3'

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.360
to the minus 2'.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.740
And we now arrive at an answer
'dy dx' is '1/3 x

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.440
to the minus 2/3'.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.020
By the way, let me point out
there certainly was nothing

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.320
wrong with leaving our answer
in this particular form.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.980
It's just conventional that
wherever possible, if the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.040
original problem was given as
a function of 'x', we would

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.130
like our answer to also
be a function of 'x'.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.110
I mean, here for example, we
could have said that the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.020
answer is '1/3 y to the
minus 2', where 'y'

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.760
equals 'x to the 1/3'.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.270
All we've done here is to fill
this thing in explicitly.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.370
By the way, there may have
been a tendency--

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.620
and here's an example of
circular reasoning.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.110
There may have been a tendency
to say, didn't we already

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.500
learn that to differentiate a
power, we just bring the power

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.240
down and replace
it by one less?

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.490
In other words, if we did that
bringing down the 1/3 would

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.000
give us a factor of
1/3 in front.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.030
Replacing 1/3 by one less,
1/3 minus 1 is minus 2/3.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.100
We would then see that 'dy
dx' should be '1/3 x

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.640
to the minus 2/3'.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.640
Which is exactly what
we got this way.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.550
The point that we should mention
at this particular

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.920
stage is that the derivative of
'x' to the 'n' being 'nx to

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.550
the 'n - 1'' was proven only
for the case that 'n' is an

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.690
integer, either positive
or negative.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.020
One uses the binomial theorem
to prove the result for a

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.170
positive integer.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.810
One uses the quotient rule
to prove the result for a

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.930
negative integer.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.700
And now, even though I didn't
do this thing in general, I

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.710
think you can see how this
will generalize.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.470
For fractional exponents,
one uses the

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.080
inverse function idea.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.760
Namely, we did have to use the
fact that if 'y' is equal to

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.750
'x to the 1/3', 'x' equals
'y cubed' was

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.910
an equivalent equation.

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.910
And we could differentiate
that.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.910
Now, what is the hang up here,
in so far as how certain are

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.190
we that 'dy dx' and 'dx
dy' are reciprocals?

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.710
You may recall that when we used
the chain rule, we showed

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.650
that if 'y' is a differentiable
function of

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.830
'x', and if 'x' is a
differentiable function of

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.720
'u', then 'y' is a

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.520
differentiable function of 'u'.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.580
And in particular, 'dy du' is
''dy dx' times 'dx du''.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.750
And if we now take the
particular case where the

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.000
first variable equals
the third, way 'u'

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
equals 'y', we get what?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:49.340
'dy dy', which is 1, equals
''dy dx' times 'dx dy''.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.140
And at first glance, it might
seem that we've proven

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.290
rigorously now the result that
'dx dy' and 'dy dx' are

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.300
reciprocals of each other.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.140
Product is 1.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:02.990
The one logical hang up
that we have right

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.680
now is simply this.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.230
In the statement of the chain
rule, it did not say that 'y'

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.440
had to be a function of
'x' and 'x' had to be

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.880
a function of 'u'.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.040
It said 'y' had to be a

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.480
differentiable function of 'x'.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.230
That was the first variable
had to be a differentiable

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.460
function of the second.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.400
And the second had to
be a differentiable

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.770
function of the third.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.980
In other words, coming down to
here, if we know that 'y' is a

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.470
differentiable function of 'x'
and 'y' has an inverse

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.160
function, and if we also knew
that the inverse function was

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.220
differentiable.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.740
See, in other words, this must
be a differentiable function

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.290
of this and this must be a

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.760
differentiable function of this.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.915
In other words, the one point
that was missing was is that

00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:49.490
if we knew that if a function
is differentiable, then its

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.460
inverse if it exists, is
also differentiable.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.420
The chain rule would have given
us a rigorous proof.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.090
The point that we're missing
though is we do not as yet

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.680
know that the inverse of a
differentiable function is

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.760
also a differentiable
function.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.460
Now if you recall on our earlier
lecture on inverse

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.060
functions, we pointed out that
there was a rather interesting

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.660
graphical interpretation between
'y' equals 'f of x'

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.600
and 'y' equals 'f
inverse of x'.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:25.310
By the way whenever I say, you
may recall, that's just my

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.680
polite way of saying perhaps
you don't, but you'd better

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.970
look it up because we had it.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:35.370
So recall that the two curves
are symmetric with respect to

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.660
the line 'y' equals 'x'.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.700
By the way again, just
a brief aside here.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.840
Notice that either one of these
functions could have

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.470
been called 'f of x' and the
other one could have been

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:47.280
called 'f inverse'.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.920
In other words, just another
piece of brief knowledge here

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.870
that the inverse of the inverse
is the original

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:56.090
function again.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.350
In other words, thinking in
terms of our function machine,

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:01.650
if you interchanged the input
and the output, and then of

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.390
the resulting machine again,
interchange the input and the

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.660
output, you're back to the
original machine again.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.650
So in this particular diagram, I
certainly could have labeled

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:14.730
this curve 'y' equals 'f of x'
or 'g of x', then this curve

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.020
here would have been 'y' equals
'g inverse of x'.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:19.610
But the important
point is what?

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.890
That 'y' equals 'f of x' and
'y' equals 'f inverse of x'

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.050
are symmetric with respect
to the line 'y equals x'.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.450
Now you see we have a
particularly simple geometric

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.830
argument as to why an inverse
function should be

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.039
differentiable if the original
function is differentiable.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:42.120
Namely, pictorially, what does
it mean to say that a function

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.380
is differentiable?

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.450
It means that when you
plot its graph,

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.820
the graph is smooth.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.940
In other words, if 'f' is a
differentiable function, the

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.120
curve 'y' equals 'f of x'
will be a smooth curve.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.620
Now simply ask yourself the
following question.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:00.360
If you take a smooth curve and
take its mirror image with

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.490
respect to the line 'y' equals
'x', or for that matter with

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.550
respect to any line,
do you expect the

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.780
curve to become un-smooth?

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.250
You see, in other words, the
mirror image of a smooth curve

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.700
will again, be smooth.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.650
And that's perhaps the most
intuitive way of picking off

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:20.780
in your mind why if a function
is differentiable, its inverse

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.240
function will also be
differentiable.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.240
Of course, as we've seen many
times already in this course,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.800
we must distinguish between
geometric intuition and

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.270
mathematical analysis.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.880
That on more occasions than
one, what seemed to be

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.220
happening geometrically was
complicated by something

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:40.800
unforeseen when we tried to get
the results in terms of

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.360
analytic methods.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.250
Let me give you an illustration
of this.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.910
You see, what we're really
saying is, granted that a

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.270
picture can be a good visual
aid, let's suppose we're given

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.295
the curve 'y' equals
'f inverse of x'.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.200
Well, first of all, what is
that the same as saying?

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.920
It's the same as saying that
'x' equals 'f of y'.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.740
At any rate, the question
is this.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.780
We're assuming that 'f' is a
differentiable function.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.980
What we would like to do is to
prove that 'f inverse' is also

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.580
differentiable.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:14.100
Now you see the whole thing
again is that whenever you

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.570
want to prove anything, what
do you mean if you take 'f

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:20.540
inverse' and differentiate it?

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.500
And by the way, that may look
like a funny notation.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.690
Think of 'f inverse' as
being one symbol.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:27.360
Call it 'g'.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.430
Call it whatever you want.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:32.060
All we're saying is, how would
we, by definition, find the

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.780
derivative of the inverse
function say,

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.110
at 'x' equals 'x1'?

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:40.120
And the answer is that by
definition, it's just what?

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.700
It's the limit as 'delta
x' approaches 0.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.620
Same definition as before.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:51.060
''f of 'x1 plus 'delta
x' minus 'f of

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.000
x1'' over 'delta x'.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.120
And in fact, if you want to
write that a little bit more

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.160
explicitly, what is another
way of writing 'delta x'?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:06.790
'Delta x', of course, is ''x1
plus 'delta x' minus x1'.

00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:08.490
Now the idea is--

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.600
this is 'f inverse'.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.580
See we want to find the
derivative of 'f inverse'.

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:14.960
Who cares what the name
of the function is?

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.920
Whatever the name of the
function is, what do you do?

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:21.250
You compute the function at 'x1
plus 'delta x', subtract

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.830
off its value at 'x1', and
divide by 'delta x'.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.810
So by the same definition that
we had the first time we

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.230
defined derivative, this is
the basic definition for

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.870
finding the derivative
of 'f inverse'.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.840
Now, how do we use the
fact that we already

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.480
know what 'f' is like?

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.170
Remember, we mentioned when we
talked about inverse functions

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.640
before is at the
time you use--

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.120
the way you really effectively
handle inverse functions is

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.340
when you know properties of
the original function.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:53.220
We're not just working blindly
with 'f inverse' here, we're

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:58.040
working with the case that 'f
inverse' is the inverse of the

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.350
function 'f', and that we know
that 'f' is differentiable.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.000
And now we want to see if
knowing that 'f' is

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.980
differentiable, can we prove
that 'f inverse' is

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:08.340
differentiable?

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.610
And you see, the idea is not
really that difficult.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.780
We can work this thing out step
by step from out little

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:15.160
diagram over here.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.180
You see, notice that another
name for 'f inverse of 'x1

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.310
plus 'delta x'' is 'y1
plus delta y'.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.130
Let me just work with what's
in the bracketed

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.950
expression over here.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.330
See, the numerator is
'y1 plus 'delta y'.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:32.490
That's this term.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.900
Now, what's 'f inverse of x1'?

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.480
As we come up over here,
remember the curve is 'y'

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.760
equals 'f inverse'.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.230
So 'f inverse of x1'
is just 'y1'.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:47.480
Now what's our denominator?

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.260
'x1 plus 'delta x' maps into
'y1 plus 'delta y'.

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.250
Well, the idea is this.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:13:00.810
In terms of inverse functions,
'x1 plus 'delta x' is just the

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.150
back map of 'y1 plus
'delta y'.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.600
In other words, since
'f inverse'--

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.570
let's write that down.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:14.360
Since 'f inverse of 'x1 plus
'delta x' is equal to 'y1 plus

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.030
'delta y', that's another
way of saying that

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.925
'x1 plus 'delta x'--

00:13:19.925 --> 00:13:22.160
we might as well write this
because this is what we're

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.410
emphasizing.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.340
In other words, this
becomes what?

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:35.680
'x1 plus 'delta x' is just 'f
of 'y1 plus 'delta y''.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.130
And 'x1' is just 'f of y1'.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.220
See again, I used the picture
as a visual aid.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:52.200
But notice that everything I've
written down here follows

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.090
analytically by my basic
definitions.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.770
I don't want to overwhelm you
with formal proofs here.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.210
These are all done
in the text.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:03.700
And I think that again, for
those of you who are

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.437
proof-oriented, the proofs are
done excellently enough so

00:14:06.437 --> 00:14:08.170
that you'll get them
from that.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.410
And for those of you who are not
proof-oriented, an extra

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.490
few minutes here will not make
that much of a difference.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.570
But what I want you to see over
here is how this thing

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.220
starts to set up now.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.230
In other words, notice that this
starts to look like what?

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.820
Let me just come over here where
we have some more space.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:25.380
This is what?

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.705
The limit as 'delta
x' approaches 0.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.400
'f 'delta y' over ''f
of 'y1 plus delta

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.470
y' minus 'f of y1''.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.390
And see, if you look at this
thing, remember 'f' is a

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.060
differentiable function
of 'y'.

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:52.520
If this had been a 'delta y'
approaching 0, this would have

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.250
just been what?

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:57.050
If we could assume that as
'delta x' approaches 0, 'delta

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:00.130
y' approaches 0, this just
would have been what?

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.440
This is the reciprocal of the
derivative of 'f of y' with

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.300
respect to 'y'.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.650
In other words, this would be
what one would call 'dx dy'

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.210
evaluated at 'y' equals 'y1'.

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.020
This is what?

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:23.410
''f of 'y1 plus delta y' minus
'f of y1'' over 'delta y' as

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.580
'delta y' approaches 0
is that derivative.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.390
And we have what?

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.550
The reciprocal of this thing.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:34.000
And in other words, what we will
have proven is that 'dy

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.340
dx' evaluated at 'x' equals
'x1' is the same as the

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:44.590
reciprocal of 'dx dy' evaluated
at 'y' equals 'y1'.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.000
The only thing we have to be
sure of in terms of the formal

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.880
proof is to make sure that as
'delta x' approaches 0, 'delta

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.310
y' approaches 0.

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.170
And that is not too difficult
a thing to do.

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.400
As I say, the proof is
done in the book.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.990
We could do it here, but I think
that that would take

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:04.550
away from the flavor of what
we're trying to show.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.840
The idea is it's fine to think
in terms of intuitive ideas.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.640
In fact, to level with you as
much as I can, of all of my

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:16.470
mathematician friends who are
outstanding in various aspects

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.030
of mathematics, to my knowledge
not one of them

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:23.020
works without some sort of
mental picture as to

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.390
what's going on.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.040
In other words, you can take
something that's very, very

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:29.870
abstract and somehow or other,
you associate in your mind

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.720
some kind of a visual aid
that gives you a hint as

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.100
to what to do next.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:38.360
But once you know what to do
next, you always formulate the

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.700
thing in terms of mathematical
precision.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:44.290
In other words, another way of
looking at this-- let's give

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.500
this a broad title.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:49.950
Let's call this 'Proof
versus Intuition'.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.770
And this is a topic that comes
up very, very early in

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:53.790
mathematics.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:57.350
Perhaps the first place that
it's extremely noticeable is

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.690
in the subject called
plane geometry.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.330
Let me give you a
for instance.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.060
Let's take a typical
traditional

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.890
plane geometry problem.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:09.099
We'l take an isosceles
triangle ABC,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:12.020
with AB equal to AC.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.030
And what we would like to prove
is that the base angles

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:16.650
of this triangle are equal.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:19.400
We'd like to prove that angle
B equals angle C.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.329
Now you remember how you tackled
this problem in high

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:24.300
school geometry.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.810
You said something like this.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:29.850
Well, let me draw the
angle bisector here.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:36.350
That meets BC at D. AD equals
itself by identity.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:40.350
These two angles are equal by
definition of angle bisector.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:45.000
Therefore, triangle ABD is
congruent to triangle ACD.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.880
And corresponding pots of
congruent triangles are equal.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.230
And you then proved that the
base angles of an isosceles

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.440
triangle were equal.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:57.260
Now, at this stage of the game
if you were anything like me,

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.850
what you would have done
has said, this is

00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:59.630
the end of the problem.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.190
Let's go onto the next one.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.910
But if you had passed this in
this particular way, you would

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:06.150
have got a 0.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.360
And why'd you get a 0?

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:10.690
Well, if you remember from plane
geometry, there was a

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:13.230
particular format that
had to be followed.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.970
It was called the statement
reason format.

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.930
For every statement that
you wrote down, you

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.220
had to give a reason.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:23.890
And the reason couldn't be
things like because, or why

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:25.910
not, or obvious.

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.290
The reasons had to be what?

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:32.610
Either definitions, or rules, or
previously proven theorems.

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:35.080
In other words, notice that
even though we never

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.820
emphasized it, back in plane
geometry when you were drawing

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:42.400
this diagram and getting the
result, that was the geometric

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.650
intuition part.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.320
In other words, this was
where you showed

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.100
the result was plausible.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.300
The logic part--

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.690
and this is why geometry is
being stressed particularly in

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.880
the modern curriculum.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.060
In terms of logic, notice that
once you had your intuitive

00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.660
picture, the statement reason
part followed independently of

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.110
the picture.

00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:06.090
You used the picture to set
yourself up, but the final

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.660
proof hinged on what?

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.730
Having the result follow
purely from the axioms

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.250
themselves.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.530
From the assumptions.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.080
And by the way, this is the
basic difference between

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.550
traditional and modern
geometry.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:22.961
In modern geometry, let's go
back to the same proof.

00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:25.370
And it's a rather interesting
point and I think you'll see a

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:28.400
connection between what's
happening in geometry and

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.540
what's happening in calculus.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.360
You see, remember how
we proved this.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.120
We said draw the angle bisector
and call this point

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:40.600
D. And then we went through
this and got this result.

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.550
In modern geometry
they say look it.

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:44.790
Without looking at the picture,
how do you know that

00:19:44.790 --> 00:19:46.750
D falls between B and C?

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.190
It's obvious in the picture
that it does.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.280
But if everything has to follow
inescapably from your

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:59.850
rules when you go through the
statement reason part, then

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.980
unless you have some rule or
definition that tells you that

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.800
D must fall between B and C,
you can't use this result.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.430
In other words, your result
will be plausible from a

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.340
picture, but not provable
analytically

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.590
So in modern geometry, we
add a few axioms, a few

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:16.820
rules of the game.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.790
They're called the axioms of
betweenness, the axioms of

00:20:19.790 --> 00:20:20.740
separation.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.570
How one point separates other
points and what this thing

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.710
means analytically, so that we
can continue on this way.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:29.570
Now you see what I'm driving
at is simply this.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.670
The Utopian way I think of
learning is to first have an

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.160
intuitive picture of
what's going on.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:39.360
Then you proceed gradually to
learn what rigor means.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.780
As I may have said to you
before, in the language of

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.880
functions, rigor is a function
of the 'rigoree'.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.250
In other words, if a person is
perfectly willing to accept a

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:50.200
result, and he's not going to
get into any trouble using it,

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.380
let him use the intuitive
result.

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.010
On the other hand, if you wanted
to teach him later that

00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:58.620
there are pitfalls using his
intuition as a background,

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:01.150
then we can come ahead and start
to do things in a little

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.280
bit more of a sophisticated
manner.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.110
Now, you see what I'm driving
at I guess is this.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.290
If a youngster survives this
procedure of going from the

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.670
intuitive approach to the
rigorous approach to the

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.080
logical difference between
analysis and geometry, he'll

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.320
be in great shape when
he gets to calculus.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.090
You see, the idea is
exactly the same.

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.570
What we're saying in the
calculus is simply this.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.070
Given the derivative of an
inverse function, we do it

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.380
first in a way that makes good
geometric sense to us.

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.100
Then to make sure that the
results do not depend on our

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.860
picture, and that our results
can be generalized to more

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.650
variables or to tougher analytic
situations where we

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:40.530
can't draw the picture, then
we tried to pick up the

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:45.190
sophistication that allows us to
remove the picture proceed

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.060
purely by analysis.

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.590
What I'm telling you as you read
the text is if you can do

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.100
both, fine.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.570
Learn the proofs and
the intuition.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:56.410
If you have trouble with the
proofs, at least satisfy

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.220
yourself that they're there.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.960
That they do seem to follow
from the basic axioms and

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.050
other assumptions.

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:06.320
But meanwhile, rely heavily
on the intuitive results.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.710
And the important thing being
that you have a picture as to

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.060
what's going on.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.930
The second aside that
I'd like to make--

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.600
and in fact, I would like to
conclude our lesson for today

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.650
with this very important
aside--

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:17.840
is the following.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.530
You remember when we were first
learning limits and we

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:21.540
talked about--

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.590
well, let me just make
an aside right at

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:24.400
the beginning here.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.320
Hate to do that, but it
just occurred to me.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.900
Remember when we said, let's
compute the limit of 'f of x'

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.390
as 'x' approaches 'a'.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.370
And our first approach was to
say, OK, let's just replace

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.690
'x' by 'a'.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.800
And you said, OK, this is fine,
but what happens if you

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.890
get a 0/0 form?

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:43.490
And the counterargument to that
was, well, if 'f' and 'a'

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.120
are chosen at random, how likely
is it that we're going

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.810
to get a 0/0 form?

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:50.600
Answer's well, it's not
too likely at all.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.480
And then the answer to that
was, well, but look it.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.700
Every time you take a
derivative, you're going to

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.120
get a 0/0 form.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.300
And so the question
was, in calculus

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.370
0/0 was very important.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.090
Now we're going to ask the same
kind of a question about

00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:06.390
1:1 functions.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.610
I guess the best way to
state it is bluntly.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:13.690
How likely is it that a given
function f is 1:1?

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:18.840
For example, if I draw a curve
like this, is this graph 1:1?

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.400
The answer, of course, is no.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.990
For example, if I pick the point
'y1' over here and come

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.380
across here, I find at least
in this picture, three

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.230
different candidates, three
different "x's".

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.180
'x1', 'x2', and 'x3'
for which what?

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:43.810
'f of x1' equals 'f of x2',
equals 'f of x3' equals 'y1'.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.910
And at first glance, you might
be tempted to say, oops, we

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.070
can't apply any of our theory
to this particular function.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.300
But here's the very
important point.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:57.560
Very often in calculus we do not
start with 'y1' and look

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.250
to see whether we have
'x1', 'x2', or 'x3'.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.560
Very often in calculus we're
starting at something like,

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.860
oh, for the sake of
argument, 'x3'.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.640
And we say, hey, I wonder
what's going on in a

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.920
neighborhood of 'x3'.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.440
If you want a fancy word to take
care of that, it's what

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.900
the mathematician calls the
difference between local and

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:19.270
global properties.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.440
And those words are exactly
what they sound like.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.050
Local means in a neighborhood
of a point and global means

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:30.210
let's look at the curve
in the large.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:31.250
And the point is this.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.920
That very, very often in
calculus, we are not

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.070
interested in what's
happening globally.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:39.680
For example, when you're driving
in a car and you're

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.980
driving along say, the New York
Thruway, and you're near

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.670
Albany and somebody says, what's
our gas situation?

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.710
Somehow or other, what your
gas situation was when you

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.830
were near Buffalo has no bearing
on the problem here.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:56.002
How full the gas tank is and the
problems involved with a

00:24:56.002 --> 00:24:58.500
full gas tank are local
properties.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.640
And whether this gets more
abstract or not is irrelevant.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:04.830
All we're saying is that in
calculus, very often you're

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.830
dealing with a neighborhood
of a point.

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:10.330
And notice this, and we'll
do is intuitively.

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.640
The book again, supplies
the rigorous proof.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:17.635
Notice that if 'f prime
of x3' here is not 0.

00:25:17.635 --> 00:25:19.670
Well, for the sake of argument,
in this case, we

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.250
notice that the curve
is always rising.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:24.370
Notice that with a smooth curve,
if it's rising at a

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:27.970
particular point, obviously it's
going to be rising in a

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.370
neighborhood of that point.

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:32.820
Just look at the picture here.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:34.160
And what we're saying is this.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.790
What does it mean for a
function to be 1:1?

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:41.170
For a function to be 1:1 on an
interval, it's sufficient that

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.290
either 'f prime' never be
negative, or 'f prime' never

00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:46.270
be positive.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:48.510
In other words, what
it means is this.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:52.360
That as long as the derivative
is not 0, we can find a

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.510
neighborhood, a local
neighborhood, that will make

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:59.400
that function 1:1 on that
particular neighborhood.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.240
In other words, once I'm working
with this particular

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.570
neighborhood, and I can't
stress this point enough

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.100
because it's going to come
up over and over again.

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:08.780
It's going to come up in more
sophisticated forms when we

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.860
deal with functions of
several variables.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.970
But the idea is what?

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:15.510
That in a neighborhood of a
point where the derivative is

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:19.390
not 0, the function may be
viewed as being 1:1.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.890
You see, the tough part is that
if you start with 'y1',

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:26.580
you have no way of knowing just
from that whether you

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:30.100
want a neighborhood near
'x1', or 'x2', or 'x3'.

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:33.150
But if you know what
neighborhood you want, in a

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:35.420
sufficiently small neighborhood,
the function

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.400
always behaves like it's 1:1.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.470
In fact, the only problem that
one runs into is the case

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:46.540
where at the point in question,
the derivative is 0.

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.580
And I think you can see
pictorially what happens in

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.000
that case right away.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.090
As soon as the derivative is 0,
notice that no matter how

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.750
small an interval-- well, I
shouldn't say this is a

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:57.790
possibility.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:58.780
Let me show you what
I mean by that.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.500
Suppose the curve has
a low point here.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.640
What I'm saying is if the
curve does this, then no

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:09.130
matter how small an interval
we choose surrounding 'x1',

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.480
the function will not be
1:1 in that interval.

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.690
No matter what interval you pick
here, if you look at the

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:16.990
image for every point
in the image, there

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.860
are going to be what?

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.890
Two back mappings, two points
that come from here.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.010
The reason I say you have
to be careful is this.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:29.330
You see, you can have a case
where the curve does this.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:33.310
It comes in, gets tangent
to the x-axis, and then

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.650
goes down like this.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.510
You see, at this particular
point, the

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.140
derivative at 0 is 0.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.860
Yet, the curve is still never
falling in this area.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.500
This particular curve is 1:1.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:46.650
I guess what we're saying here
is that when a derivative is

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.990
0, be careful because something

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.150
like this can happen.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:57.160
If the derivative is not 0,
then we know that in the

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.545
neighborhood of the point in
question, as long as the curve

00:27:59.545 --> 00:28:03.400
is smooth, it represents
a 1:1 function.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.210
And this is what we'll be doing
very, very often in

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:08.100
calculus, is using neighborhoods
of points at

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:10.400
which the derivative is not 0.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.960
Now, what this leads
to is this.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.280
When you start talking about
things like a derivative being

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.500
0, and intervals and
one-to-oneness, I think you

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:23.510
can see that this suggests a
rather powerful means or need

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.760
for doing the geometry
of curve plotting.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.780
This will be the topic of
our next investigation.

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:31.350
And so until next
time, goodbye.
