00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.760
 
I think the most important thing about

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:10.770
I think the most important thing about
 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.440
I think the most important thing about
an astronaut is is you know you have to

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450
an astronaut is is you know you have to
 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.440
an astronaut is is you know you have to
take four first of all take for a given

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
take four first of all take for a given
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.500
take four first of all take for a given
that person's done done pretty well in

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510
that person's done done pretty well in
 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.390
that person's done done pretty well in
school you know has has the intelligence

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400
school you know has has the intelligence
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.609
school you know has has the intelligence
and all that to learn new systems and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619
and all that to learn new systems and
 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.620
and all that to learn new systems and
new things but after that the most

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
new things but after that the most
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.180
new things but after that the most
important thing I think is being able to

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190
important thing I think is being able to
 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.110
important thing I think is being able to
get along with others you know

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120
get along with others you know
 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.870
get along with others you know
flexibility and teamwork those issues

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
flexibility and teamwork those issues
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.119
flexibility and teamwork those issues
because as we get fly longer and longer

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129
because as we get fly longer and longer
 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.490
because as we get fly longer and longer
in space those are really important

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500
in space those are really important
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.049
in space those are really important
factors even on short shuttle missions

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
factors even on short shuttle missions
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.310
factors even on short shuttle missions
you know those are important factors to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
you know those are important factors to
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.869
you know those are important factors to
put a crew together that can work

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879
put a crew together that can work
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580
put a crew together that can work
together effectively as a team that can

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590
together effectively as a team that can
 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.079
together effectively as a team that can
get along and so I think for an

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089
get along and so I think for an
 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:44.689
get along and so I think for an
individual you know I think the most

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699
individual you know I think the most
 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.220
individual you know I think the most
important thing is being able to work

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
important thing is being able to work
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.150
important thing is being able to work
with others

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
 
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.310
 
you know NASA interest in laying hadn't

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320
you know NASA interest in laying hadn't
 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.280
you know NASA interest in laying hadn't
done that much until fairly recently

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290
done that much until fairly recently
 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.900
done that much until fairly recently
because we'd always flown short missions

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
because we'd always flown short missions
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.780
because we'd always flown short missions
and we're all professionals and and the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790
and we're all professionals and and the
 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.280
and we're all professionals and and the
thinking as well you know everyone get

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290
thinking as well you know everyone get
 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.740
thinking as well you know everyone get
along for a you know two-week mission

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
along for a you know two-week mission
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.440
along for a you know two-week mission
right so and everyone can so it hasn't

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450
right so and everyone can so it hasn't
 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.760
right so and everyone can so it hasn't
really been a problem the Russians have

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
really been a problem the Russians have
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.350
really been a problem the Russians have
been flying long duration crews since

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360
been flying long duration crews since
 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.109
been flying long duration crews since
the early 70s and in in the early days

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
the early 70s and in in the early days
 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.030
the early 70s and in in the early days
they've ended at least two missions

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
they've ended at least two missions
 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.770
they've ended at least two missions
early because of conflicts within the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
early because of conflicts within the
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.120
early because of conflicts within the
crew so they learned early on the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
crew so they learned early on the
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100
crew so they learned early on the
importance of studying this and making

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
importance of studying this and making
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.590
importance of studying this and making
sure you put the right crew together

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600
sure you put the right crew together
 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.180
sure you put the right crew together
since our we began our work together on

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190
since our we began our work together on
 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.710
since our we began our work together on
the International Space Station with the

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720
the International Space Station with the
 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.710
the International Space Station with the
Russians in the you know early early

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720
Russians in the you know early early
 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.800
Russians in the you know early early
2000s we've started to NASA has started

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
2000s we've started to NASA has started
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.450
2000s we've started to NASA has started
to learn the importance of this kind of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
to learn the importance of this kind of
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.400
to learn the importance of this kind of
work and so NASA is looking much more

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410
work and so NASA is looking much more
 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.710
work and so NASA is looking much more
into it and funding more work into this

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
into it and funding more work into this
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.990
into it and funding more work into this
through both directly by NASA as well as

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
through both directly by NASA as well as
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.540
through both directly by NASA as well as
through the NS PRI and so I think it's

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550
through the NS PRI and so I think it's
 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.999
through the NS PRI and so I think it's
important work and we are now fully on

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009
important work and we are now fully on
 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.109
important work and we are now fully on
board and recognizing that it's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
board and recognizing that it's
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.600
board and recognizing that it's
important
