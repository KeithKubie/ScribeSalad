00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.140
What I want to show
you in this video

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.800
is that implicit
differentiation will give you

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.050
the same result as,
I guess we can say,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.620
explicit
differentiation when you

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.822
can differentiate explicitly.

00:00:10.822 --> 00:00:12.530
So let's say that I
have the relationship

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.300
x times the square root
of y is equal to 1.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.140
This one is actually
pretty straightforward

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.620
to define explicitly in
terms of x, to solve for y.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.390
So if we divide both sides
by x, we get square root of y

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.590
is equal to 1/x.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.990
And then if you square both
sides, you get y is equal to 1

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.870
over x squared, which
is the same thing as x

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.667
to the negative 2 power.

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:42.250
And so if you want
the derivative of y

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.550
with respect to x, this
is pretty straightforward.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.500
This is just an application
of the chain rule.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.780
So we get dy dx is
equal to negative 2 x

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.630
to the negative 2 minus 1--
x to the negative 3 power.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.005
So that's pretty
straightforward.

00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:00.110
But what I want to see is if
we get the same exact result

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.710
when we differentiate
implicitly.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.560
So let's apply our
derivative operator

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.557
to both sides of this equation.

00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:15.140
And so let me make
it clear what we're

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.157
doing-- x times the square root
of y and 1 right over there.

00:01:19.157 --> 00:01:20.740
When you apply the
derivative operator

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.752
to the expression on
the left-hand side,

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:26.960
well, actually, we're going
to apply both the product

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.070
rule and the chain rule.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.910
The product rule
tells us-- so we

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.100
have the product of
two functions of x.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.246
You could view it that way.

00:01:33.246 --> 00:01:34.870
So this, the product
rule tells us this

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.470
is going to be the
derivative with respect

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:50.620
to x of x times the
square root of y plus x,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.040
not taking its derivative,
times the derivative

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.012
with respect to x of
the square root of y.

00:02:00.012 --> 00:02:01.470
Let me make it
clear, this bracket.

00:02:06.757 --> 00:02:08.590
And on the right-hand
side, right over here,

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.850
the derivative with respect
to x of this constant,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.930
that's just going
to be equal to 0.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.040
So what does this simplify to?

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.730
Well, the derivative with
respect to x of x is just 1.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.790
This simplifies to
1, so we're just

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.370
going to be left with the square
root of y right over here.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.550
So this is going to simplify
to a square root of y.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.600
And what does this
over here simplify to?

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.880
Well the derivative with respect
to x of the square root of y,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.590
here we want to
apply the chain rule.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.590
So let me make it clear.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.070
So we have plus this x plus
whatever business this is.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.757
And I'm going to
do this in blue.

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:56.090
Well, it's going to be the
derivative of the square root

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.645
of something with respect
to that something.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:00.270
Well, the derivative
of the square root

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.103
of something with respect
to that something,

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:04.160
or the derivative of
something to the 1/2

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.370
with respect to that something,
is going to be 1/2 times

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.920
that something to the
negative 1/2 power.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.150
Once again, this right
over here is the derivative

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.089
of the square root of
y with respect to y.

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:24.380
We've seen this multiple times.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.090
If I were to say the derivative
of the square root of x

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.010
with respect to x, you would
get 1/2 x to the negative 1/2.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.872
Now I'm just doing it with y's.

00:03:38.872 --> 00:03:39.830
But we're not done yet.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.205
Remember, our
derivative operator

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:42.580
wasn't to say with respect to y.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.550
It's with respect to x.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.640
So this only gets us
with respect to y.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.280
We need to apply the
entire chain rule.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.390
We have to multiply that
times the derivative of y

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.490
with respect to x in order
to get the real derivative

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.470
of this expression
with respect to x.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.040
So let's multiply
times the derivative

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.175
of y with respect to x.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:04.300
We don't know what that is.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.130
That's actually what
we're trying to solve for.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.340
But to use the
chain rule, we just

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.100
have say it's the derivative
of the square root of y

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.891
with respect to y times
the derivative of y

00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:12.200
with respect to x.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.990
This is the derivative of
this thing with respect to x.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.089
So we get this on
the left-hand side.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:22.100
On the right-hand
side, we just have a 0.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.670
And now, once again,
we can attempt

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.560
to solve for the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.250
And maybe the
easiest first step is

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.470
to subtract the square
root of y from both sides

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.640
of this equation.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.420
And actually, let me move
all of this stuff over,

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.620
so I have, once again,
more room to work with.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.990
So let me cut it, actually.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.840
And then let me paste it.

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.620
Let me move it over,
right over here.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.110
So we went from there to there.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.080
I didn't gain a
lot of real estate,

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.850
but hopefully this
helps a little bit.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.320
And actually, I
don't even like that.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.280
Let me leave it
where it was before.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.160
So then, if we subtract
the square root of y

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.370
from both sides-- and
I'll try to simplify

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:13.570
as I go-- we get this thing,
which I can rewrite as x

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.540
times-- well, it's just going
to be x in the numerator divided

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:25.100
by 2 times the square root
of y. y to the negative 1/2

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.250
is just the square root
of y in the denominator.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.180
And 1/2, I just put the
2 in the denominator

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.080
there-- times dy dx
times the derivative of y

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.090
with respect to x
is going to be equal

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.840
to the negative
square root of y.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.902
I just subtracted the square
root of y from both sides.

00:05:43.902 --> 00:05:46.110
And actually, this is
something that I might actually

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.330
want to copy and paste up here.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.750
So copy and then paste.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.470
So let's go back up here, just
to continue our simplification

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.470
solving for dy dx.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.250
Well, to solve
for dy dx, we just

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.850
have to divide both sides by
x over 2 times the square root

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.690
of y.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:15.044
So we're left with dy dx--
or dividing both sides

00:06:15.044 --> 00:06:16.710
by this is the same
thing as multiplying

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.550
by the reciprocal of
this-- is equal to 2

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.220
times the square root of y
over x-- over my yellow x--

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.056
times the negative
square root of y.

00:06:32.056 --> 00:06:33.680
Well, what's this
going to simplify to?

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.644
This is going to be
equal to y times--

00:06:35.644 --> 00:06:38.060
the square root of y times the
square root of y is just y.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.590
The negative times the
2, you get negative 2.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:48.020
So you get negative 2y over x
is equal to the derivative of y

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.660
with respect to x.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.350
Now you might be
saying, look, we just

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.260
figured out the
derivative implicitly,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.390
and it looks very different than
what we did right over here.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.390
When we just used the power
rule, we got negative 2 x

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.730
to the negative third power.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.260
The key here is to realize
that this thing right over here

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.270
we could solve explicitly
in terms of-- we

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.270
could solve for y.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.940
So we could just make
this substitution

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.230
back here to see that these
are the exact same thing.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.830
So if we make the substitution
y is equal to 1 over x squared,

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:25.250
you would get dy dx, the
derivative of y with respect

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:35.040
to x, is equal to our negative
2 times 1 over x squared,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.820
and then all of that over x,
which is equal to negative 2

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.720
over x to the third, which is
exactly what we have over here,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.731
negative 2 x to the
negative third power.
