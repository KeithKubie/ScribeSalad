00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:02.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: At Google,
we're surrounded by technology,

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.590
but we may rarely think
about the first pain

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.631
years and the struggles
that they faced to get us

00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:07.819
to where we are today.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:09.360
The word brilliant
is frequently used

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.810
to describe Alan Turing, who
was not only one of the earliest

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.500
computer scientists, but also
a mathematician, logician,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.060
biologist, and encrypt
analyst famous for breaking

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.450
the German Enigma encryption
during World War II

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.360
and saving millions of lives.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.680
His story has inspired films,
literature, and even music,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.730
and I'm honored today
to introduce his nephew

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.910
and biographer.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.160
So please join me in giving
a warm welcome to Sir Dermot

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.963
Turing.

00:00:34.963 --> 00:00:37.424
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:39.590
SIR DERMOT TURING: So thank
you for having me today.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.240
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.502
I thought what might
be of interest to you

00:00:45.502 --> 00:00:51.200
to pick out some of the details
of Alan Turing's life, which

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.530
are perhaps some of the
lesson known aspects,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.155
but I'd thought I'd
focus on machinery.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.350
I'm not going to go into
the intricacies of coding

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.980
of the first British
computers, but I

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.290
thought you might like to
see some of the hardware,

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.620
if you like, that
Alan Turing worked on.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.100
And there's some really quite
interesting aspects of this,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.430
because it starts off really
quite early in his life,

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.831
perhaps earlier than
you might have expected.

00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:23.330
I'm sure you're all familiar
with this horrible thing, which

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.160
is the paper that he wrote in
1936 on computable numbers,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.420
and I expect you could actually
explain to me what it means,

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.620
so I'm not going to
try and patronize

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.350
you buy giving you any
sense of it, but of course

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.570
the key point here is, if you
take yourself back to 1936.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.205
They haven't actually
got machinery

00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:47.610
that was capable of doing
more than one thing,

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.910
and that's very hard for
us from our viewpoint

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.424
to grasp that idea,
but the easiest way

00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:54.840
I think to think
of it is when you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.180
go to your kitchen your
kitchen equipment is only

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.340
capable of doing one thing.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.420
So your kettle, for example, is
a kettle full of boiling water,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.640
but it is not very useful
for frying eggs in.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.960
A frying pan is great
for frying eggs in,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.430
but it's pretty useless
for the making frothing up

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.710
egg whites to make a
meringue, for example.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.440
Each piece of equipment
has one function,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.480
and that was the
same with essentially

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.210
computing equipment,
calculating machinery

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.790
that was in place around
the prewar period.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.590
So the idea that
Alan Turing came up

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.760
with in trying to solve
this mathematical problem,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.810
the Entscheidungsproblem, the
idea of a multi purpose machine

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.010
that could change its
functionality by being fed

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.060
a different set
of instructions--

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.150
essentially what we call these
days a program-- that was just

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.900
a really radical
breakthrough, but of course,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.940
everybody-- nobody
though of this as other

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.470
than just essentially a
mathematical device, a theory

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.080
to enable people
to get to the heart

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.680
of the Entscheidungsproblem, but
you might well then ask, well,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.880
where did this idea of a machine
to solve mathematical problems

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.604
actually come from?

00:03:19.604 --> 00:03:21.270
The answer to this
is quite interesting,

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.020
because it probably comes
from the guy whose picture is

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.060
on the left hand
side of this slide,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.050
a professor at
Cambridge University

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.310
called Max Newman,
who was giving

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.230
the talks, the lectures on
mathematical problems including

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.340
the Entscheidungsproblem,
and he'd

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.220
described the
Entscheidungsproblem

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.150
in terms of is there a
mechanical process which

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.990
could be applied to any given
theorem to know whether or not

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.690
it was provable?

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.910
And so it's this phrase,
the mechanical process,

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.350
that I think started
Alan Turing's though

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:09.500
processes running to see if
there was a way of tackling

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.090
the Entscheidungsproblem,
and hence

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.330
this sort of
theoretical blueprint

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.470
for a universal
computing machine.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.160
But he doesn't just leave it at
this theoretical mathematical

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.000
stage.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.480
Actually, he's quite a
hands on sort of guy,

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.180
and so actually what he wants
to do is start thinking about

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.450
what would those instruction
tables, essentially

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.880
the programs, look like?

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.020
And this becomes
quite interesting,

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.250
because this is
also roughly 1936,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.385
and he's explaining
to this lady,

00:04:47.385 --> 00:04:51.630
and this lady is the
mother of this school days

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.150
friend Christopher Morcom.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.590
He's still in touch with
her for about 10 years

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.880
after leaving school, about
10 years after Christopher

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.670
Morcom's died.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.720
Any of you seen "The
Imitation Game,"

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.340
you know about this-- it's
slightly mythical, actually--

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.364
this story about this strong
childhood friendship he

00:05:08.364 --> 00:05:09.530
had with Christopher Morcom.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.530
In fact, they only knew each
other for about 15 months.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.780
Alan was much more interested
in Christopher's mother.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.520
It was this lady, and
he's explaining to her

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.660
in the mid 1930s,
the rules of Go.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.501
You know the Japanese
game you play

00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:26.750
with black and white counters.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.291
Yeah, there's lots
of people nodding.

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:30.120
So what he's doing
is he's actually

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.130
writing algorithmic
processes down

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.430
to explain to her
how to play Go,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.460
and this is quite interesting
because he's actually not

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.060
only thinking about the theory
of a universal computing

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.560
machine.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.740
He's thinking about how you
actually write programs,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.740
and he's also thinking at
the same time about how

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.620
you go about building machines.

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.960
Now, this thing-- he started
building this machine

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.580
in about 1937,
'38, and what he's

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.470
trying to do-- there's some
mathematicians amongst you--

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.300
the Riemann zeta function
might-- oh yes, we're

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.170
getting one or two
nods, so that's good.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.780
Don't ask me.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.960
I have no idea what it is.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.918
Anyway, it's something
to do with prime numbers

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:17.624
and how spaced out they are.

00:06:17.624 --> 00:06:18.790
No, I don't mean spaced out.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.920
That could mean
something involving

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.545
the use of inappropriate
substances,

00:06:22.545 --> 00:06:28.650
but they're not evenly
distributed, are they?

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.380
Along those sort
of numerical axis.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.810
So this Riemann
zeta function helps

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.390
you understand how they're
spaced out so I understand.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.860
So he wanted to build
an analog machine that

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.030
would help find the solutions
to the zeta function,

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.250
and this involved
apparently cutting

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:56.350
gear teeth, each of which would
have a prime number of spokes

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.910
around it.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.820
It's a prime number of
teeth around the wheel,

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.230
and you put these
gear wheels together,

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.185
and then you crank
a handle, and it

00:07:07.185 --> 00:07:08.700
would spit out the solutions.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.320
So this blueprint, which was
not drawn by Alan Turing,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.030
but it's of his
machine-- it's actually

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:16.480
in the archive at King's
College, Cambridge,

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.380
and apparently he started
making these wheels out

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.750
of brass, these gear wheels.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:24.690
And if you've visited his
rooms at King's College,

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.270
Cambridge just before
the Second World War,

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.170
you would probably
have tripped over them.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:32.870
They were scattered all over the
floor and all over the table,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.425
and unfortunately
World War II broke out

00:07:35.425 --> 00:07:41.460
and prevented essentially the
machine ever being assembled.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.769
So we'll never know
whether it worked, and it

00:07:43.769 --> 00:07:46.310
would be very nice to know one
day if somebody could actually

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:53.150
use this blueprint try and
put the thing together.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.810
Anyway, so he's
not only thinking

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.380
about the theory of
machinery, and he's

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.440
thinking about the
possibilities for programming,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.680
but he's also very
interested in a hands

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.790
on sense in the hardware.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.190
And that probably makes
him an ideal candidate

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:15.380
to be hired to join the code
breaking team of Bletchley

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:19.560
Park, because as you all
know, the key problem in 1939

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.370
was that the Germans were using
the Enigma machine to encipher

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:30.110
their communications, and with
the vast number of permutations

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.640
as the way the
machine can be set up

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:35.640
there is a serious challenge.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.039
You can't use one
World War I methods

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:44.620
for code breaking to solve the
problem of how was the Enigma

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.590
machine set up this morning.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.170
It would just take too
many people too long.

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:51.830
You need a mechanical
method to go

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.230
through at least a big
chunk of the permutations

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.110
and eliminate the impossible.

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:02.950
So again, if you've watched
"The Imitation Game,"

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.140
you will know-- because this
is now an established fact,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.810
because that's what movies
like "The Imitation Game"

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.320
do for us-- they tell us what
the facts are-- you will know

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:16.550
that it is an established fact
that in the nick with five

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.460
seconds to go before
the D-day landings,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.610
Alan Turing finally
soldered the last connection

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:24.380
on his bombe machine.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.280
And lo and behold, the
bombe was able to spew out

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.260
decrypts of German
messages just in time

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:34.230
to save hundreds of British,
but unfortunately not

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.130
American lives because you guys
got to go on the wrong beach.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.005
I'm sorry about that.

00:09:38.005 --> 00:09:38.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.450
Actually some of that
might not be true.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.960
In fact, that bit that
is particularly not true

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.420
is that it took the entire
war for this machine to work.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:50.130
Alan Turing had
designed a bombe, which

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.010
is this thing you can
see on this slide,

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:57.640
to find at least
some candidates which

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.400
were potential plausible
settings of the way the Enigma

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.670
machine had been set
up, and he designed

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:13.720
methodology for program
that and discussed

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:19.510
with an engineer called Doc Keen
how that might be transformed

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.450
into a real device.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:28.230
That had all been done by
Christmas 1939, at which point

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.260
the war in Europe had
involved the Russians

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.566
and the Germans
taking over Poland,

00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:35.940
but otherwise
there wasn't really

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:41.000
a hot war going on at all in
Europe, and so by the time

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.050
the Germans invaded Norway
in April 1940 and France

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.680
in May 1940, they had actually
got a prototype machine

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.430
delivered at Bletchley
Park, and by the time

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.280
of the battle of Britain
in September 1940,

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.160
the bombe machine was already
producing intelligence,

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.940
intelligence that could be
used in the Battle of Britain

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:07.240
to help the Polish
and British air

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.390
forces defeat the Luftwaffe.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.480
And so the first real
use of this intelligence

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.460
was actually really,
really in the war,

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.190
but that's very interesting,
but the point is, of course,

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.710
that Alan Turing had come up
with a design for a working

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:22.590
machine.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.270
Now, his prototype was
improved by another Cambridge

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.870
mathematician called
Gordon Welchman,

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.330
but the fact is that
really astonishingly early

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.780
in the war-- and this is a
very interesting machine, this,

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.620
because it's actually
a digital machine.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.740
It's producing a
yes or no answer.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.180
It's not a universal machine,
because it's a single purpose

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:44.680
device.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.750
It's designed to find
settings on Enigma machines,

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.840
but it's actually
quite interesting.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.850
It's programmed.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.740
It's programmed around the back.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.760
There's a very complex
festoon of wires and stuff,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.415
which enables it to
be set up to solve

00:12:02.415 --> 00:12:07.670
a different problem every day
or for every Enigma network that

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:12.892
was in use, but this is a
step up from the Riemann zeta

00:12:12.892 --> 00:12:13.600
function machine.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.840
It's not an analog machine.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.410
It is digital.

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.740
It's not electronic, and
it's programmable only

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:25.220
within a limited
purpose range, but it's

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:31.810
a big step on the road towards
universal computing machinery.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:33.560
You may have come
across this thing.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.090
This is Colossus.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:39.400
This is the machine that
was used at Bletchley Park

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.030
to break a different
kind of German code,

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.070
the teleprinter code, which was
enciphered on a machine called

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:52.800
the Lorenz SZ42, and
the Colossus, again,

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.150
was another step forward on the
road towards modern computing

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.610
technology because this
is an electronic machine,

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.990
unlike the bombe, which
is electromechanical.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.510
It's got moving parts in it.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:08.530
This is an electronic
machine, and what's more,

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.030
the contents of one of the
messages they were testing

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.410
is actually programmed
into the machine

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:22.290
by flicking switches which
store the contents of a message

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.410
electronically using valves.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.189
I'm sorry, in American, tubes.

00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:28.730
That's right.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.300
Yes, you call them tubes.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.944
We call them valves,
but anyway these days we

00:13:32.944 --> 00:13:33.860
call them transistors.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:42.680
So the Colossus is a
very interesting-- now, I

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.800
can't claim that Alan
Turing designed Colossus.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:50.210
This would be a complete
travesty, but what we do know

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.420
is that he was involved in
the team that was headed up

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.840
by none other than Max Newman,
that professor who started

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:01.400
Alan Turing off on
the computable numbers

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.770
work back in the '30s.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.550
Max Newman was heading
up a machine group.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.710
One of the responsibilities
of the machine group

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.970
was to develop
things like Colossus,

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:16.980
and Alan Turing was a
member of the machine group,

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.600
so he was essentially a
consultant to the project.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:24.390
So he knew all about it, and
although he wasn't involved

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:30.240
in the design, it meant that he
was very well equipped in terms

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.020
of know how for the
big postwar projects,

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.890
both here in the United
States, but also in the UK.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:43.520
There were going to be massive
computer building programs.

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.580
Everybody wanted
to try and bring

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:52.010
the whole concept of a multi
functional universal computing

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.750
machine to life, and the
reason they wanted to do this,

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:59.040
because this was basically John
von Neumann's project, which

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:05.420
was to try and find machines
that would solve much more

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.850
quickly the very, very
difficult equations that

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.530
needed to be processed
for doing things

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.070
like designing atom bombs.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.190
And military needed
computing power,

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:20.806
and instead of hiring
roomfuls of people

00:15:20.806 --> 00:15:22.680
with adding machines,
which is the way they'd

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.850
gone about in the
past, they thought

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.190
that actually having a
computing machine that

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.670
could be programmed
to do different kinds

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.630
of mathematical calculations
was a really good idea.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:37.460
And the Brits had pretty
much the same thinking.

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.520
In fact, they this sort of
vision of a national computer

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.520
that people would be able to
send their problems off to,

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:47.470
and the national
computing service

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.170
would solve their
problems for them.

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:52.800
And would we need
one, or might we

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.450
need two computers to serve
the entire United Kingdom?

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:58.490
And that was the kind
of thinking at the time.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:03.760
So Alan Turing was hired to
work on the UK's computing

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:10.500
project, which was funded
by the National Physical

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.010
laboratory in the UK,
and he was basically

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:16.400
hired as their chief
computer designer,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.430
and he wrote a paper
heavily influenced

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.790
by John von
Neumann's work, which

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.210
was going to lead to the
creation of something

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.010
called the automatic
computing engine.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:30.220
It's a nod back to the
Babbage calculators

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.700
of the 19th century.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:39.090
This picture is of ACE
while it was being built.

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.830
That picture is
probably mid 1950s.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.860
I would say about '55, '56.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.160
The ACE, which Alan
Turing designed,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.170
didn't actually complete
it's building process

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:55.740
until 1959, which was
12 years after he'd

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.912
completed his design.

00:16:57.912 --> 00:17:01.620
Alan Turing did not kick
his heels for that 12 years.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:06.819
In fact, he got so fed up that
within two years of completing

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:10.099
his design, he'd moved
on, and again, he'd

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:12.700
moved because he'd
been phoned up

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.060
by his old mate, Max
Newman, who was now

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:21.640
the professor of computing
at Manchester University.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.990
Max Newman had asked
the UK government

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.220
if he could take away the
leftover bits of Colossus

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.750
at the end of the war, and
he filled a seven ton truck

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:34.520
with pieces of
Colossus and took him

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:39.130
to Manchester, where he built
something that "The London

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.560
Times" described as
the mechanical brain,

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.710
and rather better there's
another UK newspaper

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.900
described it as a
marvel of our time.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.740
That's a picture of it
from "The London Times."

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.200
It's got wires all
hanging from the ceiling,

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.200
and it really does
look a bit of a mess.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.770
I thought you might
like to hear a quote

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:09.370
from my book about this, and
I can do this shamelessly

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.740
because I'm not actually
quoting my own words here.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.920
The Manchester
Computing Laboratory

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.735
is actually described by
Professor Williams, who

00:18:19.735 --> 00:18:23.565
had invented the
memory device that

00:18:23.565 --> 00:18:25.570
was being used in this machine.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:32.930
And he describes the Royal
Society Computing Machine

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:34.620
Laboratory, which
sounds very grand.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.770
So Professor Williams says
this, "a fine sounding phrase,

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.100
but what was the reality?

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.870
It was one room in a
Victorian building who's

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:47.160
architectural features are best
described as late lavatorial.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.850
The walls were
brown glazed brick,

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.740
and the door was
labeled magnetism room.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.115
And in fact, actually this
building is quite interesting,

00:18:54.115 --> 00:18:57.029
because it's where Rutherford
had done his experiments

00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:58.820
at the end of the 19th
century on splitting

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.476
the atom, and actually
the brown glazed brick--

00:19:01.476 --> 00:19:03.100
it's still there,
and you're not really

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.725
allowed to go into the building
because it's a bit radioactive.

00:19:05.725 --> 00:19:07.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.910
So it's an interesting
place, but they actually

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:14.557
were able to use this machine
to solve some real problems.

00:19:14.557 --> 00:19:16.390
Now, this is quite
interesting, because they

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:19.100
had a memory of 1,024 bits.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:21.170
So that's not really
a lot you can do.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:25.730
It's not really a powerful
computing machine,

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:30.230
but they got this problem, which
again, Max Newman clever guy

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:33.742
that worked out that there's a
problem about Mersenne primes.

00:19:33.742 --> 00:19:36.200
So again the mathematicians
around you will all be nodding.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.070
2 to the power of n minus 1.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:42.176
Are those numbers
prime or are they not?

00:19:42.176 --> 00:19:43.842
Well, some of them
are, and some of them

00:19:43.842 --> 00:19:45.425
aren't is the answer
to that question,

00:19:45.425 --> 00:19:49.840
but Mersenne, who was a French
monk from the 16th century

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.770
had made a list
of these numbers,

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:56.450
where for the values
of n up to-- let

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:59.650
me check my notes-- 257.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:03.900
And he said, these ones are
prime, and these ones are not,

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.300
but to do the sums
to actually work out

00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:10.290
whether for n equals
2, 5, 7 requires

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.270
an awful lot of squared paper
and an awful lot of patience.

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.360
And so Max Newman thought, a-ha.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:24.650
In binary, 2 to the n
minus 1 is 111111111.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:27.960
So in other words, it's a great
problem for a computer that's

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:33.850
only got a memory of
1,024 bits, and so he

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:36.043
got the computer
working on this,

00:20:36.043 --> 00:20:38.280
and they checked
Mersenne's work.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.890
And this is all
very interesting,

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.170
because it all found
its way once again

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.490
into "The Times" newspaper.

00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:45.810
So not only were they
running this splendid

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.700
rather grubby looking
photo, but they were also

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.887
running a nice little article
called "The Mechanical Brain."

00:20:52.887 --> 00:20:53.470
There you are.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.970
You can see from Saturday,
the 11th of June 1949.

00:20:56.970 --> 00:21:01.460
"The Mechanical Brain, Answer
Found to 300 Year Old Sum."

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.490
So it goes on like this, but
the interesting thing about this

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:08.840
is it's not so much what it
says about the 300 year old sum,

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:10.900
it's actually what it
says about Alan Turing,

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.460
because they phoned him up.

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.430
And Newman was out
of the lab that day,

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.210
and so they got Alan Turing,
and what he said was this.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:21.630
"This is only a foretaste
of what is to come

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.000
and only a shadow of
what is going to be.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
We have to have some
experience with the machine

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.850
before we really know
its capabilities.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.550
It may take years
before we settle down

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.930
to the new possibilities,
but I don't

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.346
see why it shouldn't enter
into one of the fields normally

00:21:33.346 --> 00:21:35.480
covered by the human
intellect and eventually

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.040
compete on equal terms.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:40.100
I don't think you can even draw
the line about writing sonnets.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.510
The other comparison is
perhaps a little bit unfair

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.570
because a sonnet
written by a machine

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.950
will be better appreciated
by another machine."

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:48.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:54.540
All this about a computer that's
got a memory of 1,024 bits.

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.470
Oh dear, when you
can imagine that

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:01.360
in the rather staid
environment in the early 1950s,

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.760
or rather late 1940s
as we were, this

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.220
didn't go down
particularly well.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.850
Max Newman's wife wrote a
letter to one of her friends

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.390
while this was going
on, and she said this.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:18.720
Did you see the extraordinary
report in the times

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.290
two weeks ago on the
Manchester calculating machine

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.120
with the fantastic
remarks attributed

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.470
to Alan Turing and Max's
letter the following day

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:26.710
trying to clear things up?

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.640
"The Times" wired Alan,
who isn't on the telephone,

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.790
to ring up their office,
and they interviewed him

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:32.440
on the phone.

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.020
He's wildly innocent about
the ways of reporters,

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.295
and he has a bad stammer
when he's nervous or puzzled.

00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:39.420
It was a great shock to
him when he saw "The Times"

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.690
and to Max who had been flying
back from Belfast that day.

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.000
We had a wretched weekend.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.860
Starting at midnight
on the Friday night

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:50.470
when some sub editor of a local
paper ran up to get a story.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.490
By Sunday, Max was
getting a bit gruff,

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.700
and when he said, what do
you want, to one newspaper,

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.790
the reporter replied only
to photograph your brain.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.170
So we had some fun and games
at the end of the 1940s

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:09.245
with the Manchester
baby computer.

00:23:09.245 --> 00:23:11.370
Actually, that was kind of
like a proof of concept,

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.170
and what they wanted
to do was to use

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.150
that to prove that
it was actually worth

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.860
spending some money on
a decent computer, which

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.190
was commercially
manufactured, and so this

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.310
is a photograph of it.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.960
It was delivered to Manchester
University in, I think,

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.770
about 1951.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.310
This was sometimes called
the Manchester Mark

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.770
1 or the Ferranti Mark 1.

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:39.000
It's, as you can see, a
rather more sort of swish

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.490
looking thing, and there's
a marketing photograph

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:46.280
of this elegant young woman
sitting in front of it

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.030
looking very professional.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:55.090
You've also got an example of
what a computer program looks

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:59.780
like from the same period.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.580
All these pound signs,
and forward slashes,

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:06.740
and half signs-- they're
programming basically

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.470
in the teleprinter code,
which is a nightmare.

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:13.540
And you can see Alan
Turing's handwritten comments

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.510
on the program with, how did
this happen, written across it.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.680
Something has gone wrong
in this particular program.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.090
It was not easy.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:28.070
It was not easy, but actually I
think this is very interesting.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.300
Here's a picture of him
with two of his colleagues.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:32.990
He's the one standing
looking to the left.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:39.280
He's standing by the Manchester
Mark 1, and what is he doing?

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.240
He's not actually
designing the machine

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.100
at this stage in the 1950s.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.090
What he's doing is
designing the programs,

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.510
and he's designing the
programs to solve problems

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.710
that are of interest to him.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.010
He's moved into a
completely different sphere.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:57.650
What he's interested in
is developmental biology,

00:24:57.650 --> 00:25:04.640
and he is modeling the
way that chemicals diffuse

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:11.690
through an embryo to see
if he can explain problems

00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:12.850
in shape and form.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:17.530
So to quote him again, "why
is a horse not a spherically

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.550
symmetrical object?"

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:24.870
There must be some variations
in concentration of chemicals,

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:30.205
whatever it is, that cause
the organism to develop

00:25:30.205 --> 00:25:31.080
the way that it does.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.163
So he's looking at plants.

00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:33.300
He's looking at animals.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.730
He's looking at things
like the patterns

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:41.110
that you see on the coats of
leopards, or friesian cows,

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.790
or whatever.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.360
So he can explain some of
these using his differential

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:49.850
equations, and he's
using the computer

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:58.014
to essentially run contour
maps for him of the results

00:25:58.014 --> 00:25:59.430
from these
differential equations.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.060
So you can see that
he's taken-- this

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:05.120
is a piece of squared paper
that he has written out

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.129
the results that the computer
has given him, bearing

00:26:08.129 --> 00:26:10.670
in mind that it probably came
out on a piece of punched tape,

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.690
so he's had to translate
it back into square paper.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:18.110
There weren't graphical readouts
on computers in the 1950s.

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:26.500
So he's written the data in
these two digit hexadecimal

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:30.770
codes, and he's drawn
a contour map over it.

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:32.415
So when you've got
high values, he's

00:26:32.415 --> 00:26:36.690
shaded it darker than where
he's got medium and low values,

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.430
and so you can see there's
a pattern emerging from that

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:44.500
which might or might not look
like a coat on an animal,

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.119
for example.

00:26:46.119 --> 00:26:47.410
So that's what he's been doing.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:51.320
So he's moved completely
now from a machine

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:57.760
as a theoretical thing for
solving a problem in pure maths

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.050
right through to using
a computer as a tool

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:06.090
to help him solve a problem in
biology much in the same way

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.720
that we would use
computers nowadays,

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:13.150
and all of that in the
course of about 15 years.

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:16.390
It's quite remarkable really.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:21.320
As we all know, Alan
Turing died far too young,

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.030
but I thought you
might just like

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:30.740
the way that the UK tabloid
press reported his death.

00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:36.220
Some of this-- it's sad,
but you just have to-- there

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.920
is some dark humor in here.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:43.230
So we've go scientist robot
brain man is found dead,

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.772
and then you've got
a picture of him,

00:27:44.772 --> 00:27:46.313
and then underneath
that you probably

00:27:46.313 --> 00:27:48.140
can't read what it
says, but is says,

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.080
Dr. Turing, he fed the brain.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.790
And mechanical brain
expert found dead.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:59.330
Scientist [INAUDIBLE]
apparatus in room.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:03.400
This is just classic the tabloid
reporting, and did own cooking.

00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.315
I mean, what?

00:28:04.315 --> 00:28:07.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:12.219
Anyway, so you
there is something.

00:28:12.219 --> 00:28:14.260
I should think it was
probably pretty distressing

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:16.343
for the family to read all
this stuff at the time,

00:28:16.343 --> 00:28:24.470
but 60 years on it's got
its entertainment value.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:29.340
I'm done with the formal
speech part of this.

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.170
Thank you for
listening patiently.

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.920
I'm very happy to
take questions,

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.780
and then I think at some
stage I will be encouraged

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.370
to go outside, and if
people are interested,

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:44.490
I'm signing books, as well,
but anyway, let me stay here

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:47.747
and take questions
to begin with.

00:28:47.747 --> 00:28:49.330
Now Rachel's coming
around with a mic.

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.019
AUDIENCE: Can you give
the history of your title?

00:28:56.019 --> 00:28:57.060
SIR DERMOT TURING: I can.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:02.392
It's got nothing to do
with Alan Turing, but OK.

00:29:02.392 --> 00:29:10.690
In the middle part
of the 17th century,

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:13.590
King Charles I was
trying to raise

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:20.700
funds to establish a new
British colony on the Northeast

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:27.081
coast of the North
American continent.

00:29:27.081 --> 00:29:28.455
In fact, what he
was trying to do

00:29:28.455 --> 00:29:31.680
was found a colony called
New Scotland, or Nova Scotia.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:36.680
And these kinds of
ventures cost money,

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:40.697
and the tax raising methods
of the time were rather poor.

00:29:40.697 --> 00:29:43.030
As those of you who know your
English history will know,

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:47.130
this is what caused Charles I
to have his head chopped off--

00:29:47.130 --> 00:29:50.480
was his inadequate
approach to taxation.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.416
You talk to Americans
about British taxation.

00:29:52.416 --> 00:29:53.790
This kind of
dangerous territory.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:30:00.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:05.180
So we're talking about Canada
rather than the other 13

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:11.220
colonies, but so what happened
was that Charles I was selling

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:13.000
essentially titles.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.580
He was selling peerages,
and in my case,

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:21.770
baronetcies, heritable titles
that you would contribute

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.830
so much money to the
Nova Scotia scheme,

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:30.320
and the you would get given
this stupid thing which

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.820
is sort of like a
piece of furniture

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.250
that you can pass
on to your children.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:35.740
So that's where it comes from.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:39.410
It's got nothing to
do with Alan Turing.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.585
I've never been to Nova
Scotia, but never mind.

00:30:44.234 --> 00:30:45.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
just wanted to ask

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.170
is so obviously a number of
biographical works about Turing

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.350
have appeared over the
years, and I was just curious

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.880
if there were any
particular things you

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.140
felt that they had got wrong.

00:31:00.594 --> 00:31:03.010
SIR DERMOT TURING: No, I don't
think that there's anything

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:06.530
that previous biographers
have particularly got wrong.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:16.920
Andrew Hodges, whose biography
is probably the most well known

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:19.550
and probably the most
thorough in terms

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:22.100
of exhaustive
coverage of things--

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:27.080
he wrote that 30 years ago,
and actually that's a long time

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:32.215
ago in terms of knowing
new things about what

00:31:32.215 --> 00:31:33.380
happened at Bletchley Park.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:38.020
There's been lots of
revelations about Alan Turing's

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.870
wartime work in
particular, including

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:43.690
some new documents that
were released by the UK

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:45.050
equivalent of the NSA.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:49.060
GCHQ released some
documents last year.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:52.880
So it's not so much that
there's anything wrong.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.680
It's just that there's
more detail available now,

00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:04.040
and I also think I've
been slightly-- well,

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.680
so to make this
no sound like I'm

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.960
wanting to be negative
about other biographers,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:15.120
because I don't think that
was ever part of my mission,

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:23.860
but I am slightly curious
and maybe not comfortable

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:29.070
in some senses with the way
that Alan Turing comes across.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.650
We all get our
mental picture of him

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.060
from watching stuff in
the media, don't we?

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.631
Benedict Cumberbatch's
performance in "The Imitation

00:32:35.631 --> 00:32:36.255
Game" is great.

00:32:36.255 --> 00:32:39.631
I mean, it's a great movie, but
that's kind of the Alan Turing

00:32:39.631 --> 00:32:42.590
that we carry around
with each other.

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:44.620
Is that true?

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:49.570
And there's been a number of
what turned out in some cases

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:53.890
to be myths when I looked
into them about his childhood,

00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.140
and his upbringing, and
how he got on with his work

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.490
colleagues, and so forth.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:03.777
I it feel to some extent
that there's a need to,

00:33:03.777 --> 00:33:05.360
first of all,
investigate that and see

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:09.690
whether those myths turned
to have any substance,

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:14.310
and on the whole, they turn
out to be over dramatizations.

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:17.176
And I think Alan Turing would've
fit in quite happily here

00:33:17.176 --> 00:33:18.800
working with you
guys, and you probably

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.210
thought he was no different
from half your other work

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:21.710
colleagues.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.020
He wasn't that weird, you know?

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.422
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:24.422 --> 00:33:26.005
I mean, at least
that's the impression

00:33:26.005 --> 00:33:27.117
you get from talking
to the people who

00:33:27.117 --> 00:33:28.992
worked with him at
Bletchley Park, people who

00:33:28.992 --> 00:33:30.610
worked with him in Manchester.

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:35.770
Yeah, you wouldn't necessarily
have wanted to have him

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:36.860
at your sherry party.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.020
Indeed, my father did want
him at his sherry party.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.070
Badly dressed.

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.300
Rude to the other guests.

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.430
Fish out of water.

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:46.957
Very uncomfortable in that
kind of social setting.

00:33:46.957 --> 00:33:49.290
Would've thought working
would've been absolutely great,

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.540
because you're talking about--

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.587
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:52.587 --> 00:33:55.045
None of you have ever been to
a sherry party in your lives,

00:33:55.045 --> 00:33:58.217
and what's more, you'd all
be talking about the stuff

00:33:58.217 --> 00:34:00.050
that you all enjoyed
talking about together,

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.710
so it's you just put people
in the right environment.

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:09.090
So I think there's been
a tendency, if you like,

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:13.990
for the actors who are
portraying him to make him out

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:17.400
as being this sort
asocial genius,

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:20.030
when actually he might have been
a bit more normal, a bit more

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.960
approachable.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.190
Yeah, a clever guy, but you all
work with really clever people,

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:31.110
so that doesn't mean that it's
sort of like he's unattainably

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.020
distant, his cleverness.

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:39.150
I think it's more in some senses
to try and normalize things.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:43.310
I wouldn't want to say that
any of the other biographers

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.389
were guilty of the
hype themselves.

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:49.760
There's some nuances that I
wouldn't perhaps go along with,

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:52.440
but I think it's just
a matter of bringing

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.929
the story up to date and perhaps
normalizing a bit against some

00:34:56.929 --> 00:35:00.210
of the dramatizations that
we'll have seen and built up

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.414
our own picture of.

00:35:05.325 --> 00:35:07.450
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'd like to
ask you a little bit more

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:09.920
about what you were just
talking about with some

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.920
of the recent information that's
been coming out about Colossus.

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.277
I listen to the
Bletchley Park podcast,

00:35:16.277 --> 00:35:17.860
and they were talking
about that, too,

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.470
and they were saying
that, as much as we now

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:23.290
know about Enigma,
we might come to know

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.820
about Colossus, much
of which was still

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.670
classified until recently.

00:35:27.670 --> 00:35:30.720
And they never really
talked, though.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.760
What do you know about what
Turing's role was on Colossus?

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.060
I know Newman was the head.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:40.940
What role did Turing play in it?

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:43.250
Do we know?

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:46.010
SIR DERMOT TURING: Well,
more than what I've already

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:48.620
said to you this afternoon.

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:53.070
I think it's probably
not right to imagine

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:57.180
that Alan Turing was very
closely involved in Colossus.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:02.360
What I can tell you is
that he was certainly

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.465
being one of the top
code breaking team

00:36:04.465 --> 00:36:06.550
at Bletchley Park.

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:11.070
When they found the
teleprinter code problem, which

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.300
sort of surfaced
early in the war,

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:19.060
they certainly gave it to him,
and indeed, a bunch of others,

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:24.960
to work on, and so he
was certainly responsible

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:31.210
for some of the methodologies
they were using to try

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:35.790
and break into these codes.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.752
So there's a technique
called Turingismus,

00:36:38.752 --> 00:36:41.210
for example, which I'm not
going to try and explain to you,

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.700
but it involves basically
adding together two messages

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.170
to try and find out where the
settings on the wheels were,

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:49.440
and you're basically
doing binary addition

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.030
and seeing some
patterns coming out

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.470
of that tells you
something about the way

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:57.640
that the machine was set up.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:01.500
So we know we know that he was
involved in the teleprinter

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:06.750
code project, but also
I think the real work

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.660
on developing
Colossus as a machine

00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:14.510
to solve the problems
was basically

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:17.760
the brainchild of other
people, because by that stage,

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.280
Alan Turing moved on
to different role.

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:30.230
So by 1942, he's moving across
from being a code breaker

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:35.150
essentially to being-- I
wouldn't say in charge of,

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:39.910
but to have a role within
essentially a security

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.710
organization that's
looking at the security

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:44.020
of Allied communication.

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.200
So he's spending time
over here in the US.

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.610
He's looking at things
like the machinery that's

00:37:50.610 --> 00:37:55.670
being used to encrypt
voice communications.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:59.370
So a classic example of this
is Roosevelt and Churchill

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:02.020
having conversations
over the radio telephone.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.561
The Germans were listening to
those for the first three years

00:38:04.561 --> 00:38:05.450
of the war.

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.400
So Alan Turing
sent over to the US

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.330
to check out the security
of the device that

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:16.070
had been invented here
at Bell Labs in New York

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:20.980
to encrypt those communications.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:24.180
He's also checking
out the effectiveness

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.430
of written
communication security

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:34.720
so that basically the Allies
own teleprinter encryption

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.220
techniques.

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:40.510
So he's kind of moved across
from being a code breaker

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:42.790
into being more of
a security person,

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:46.290
but I think the idea of
Newman's machine group

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.400
is actually quite good,
because that encompasses

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.087
both sides of that
divide, but it just

00:38:52.087 --> 00:38:53.670
means that his role
has changed a bit,

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.520
and he's moved away from the
front line of code breaking,

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:59.500
which means that the
Colossus project,

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:02.230
while he was aware of it,
and as I say, basically

00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:05.550
acting as consultant to it,
it's not really his project.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:06.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.238
SIR DERMOT TURING:
For a long time,

00:39:08.238 --> 00:39:10.140
people wanted it to
be, because you've

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.050
got Alan Turing, the
father of the computer,

00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:14.040
the author of the
computer [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.850
the great Bletchley
Park code breaker.

00:39:15.850 --> 00:39:18.560
Of course, Colossus
had to-- but that was

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.710
like a guess in the absence
of decent quality information,

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:25.800
and I think nowadays
there's enough known

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.640
to be sure that that's
not really his main thing.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.509
He knew all about, but he
wasn't really doing it.

00:39:33.509 --> 00:39:35.050
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
if you can talk

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:38.200
a little bit about the
story of writing this book.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.210
What inspired it?

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:42.830
How much of it was internal
knowledge in the family?

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:44.410
How long it took
you to right it?

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.590
What were the hard parts?

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:47.294
Et cetera.

00:39:47.294 --> 00:39:49.210
SIR DERMOT TURING: Thank
you for the question.

00:39:52.117 --> 00:39:54.200
In fact, there were about
five questions in there,

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:54.866
weren't there?

00:39:54.866 --> 00:39:59.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:01.600
I think you've probably
got the flavor already

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.520
of some of the things that
were slightly nagging at me

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.999
before I started work on it
and whether I could investigate

00:40:09.999 --> 00:40:11.540
these myths, if you
like, to find out

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.930
whether they were myths and
also to bring the story up

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:16.740
to date a bit.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:22.200
I also felt that for a non
mathematical reader, a non

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.670
specialist reader, somebody who
isn't prepared to say, right,

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:29.380
I am now tacked up with
enough Starbucks coffee

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.490
that I can tackle chapter
three and this business

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.250
about computable numbers.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:37.730
Not everybody has got
the intellectual courage

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.032
to take that journey.

00:40:40.032 --> 00:40:42.490
So I thought that there might
be something that I, as a non

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:46.950
mathematician, could
bring to a wider audience

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:49.672
without hopefully
getting bogged too much

00:40:49.672 --> 00:40:50.630
and that kind of stuff.

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:51.690
So that was part of it.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.240
And then you asked
how long did it take

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.260
and what were the hard parts.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.335
And the really
interesting thing about it

00:41:00.335 --> 00:41:02.210
was that it didn't take
anything like as long

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:06.101
as I thought it was going to,
because the hard parts-- well,

00:41:06.101 --> 00:41:08.100
apart from things like
computable numbers, which

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.600
I recognized were
out of my depth,

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.770
so I wasn't even going to
try and swim in those waters,

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:17.580
but the really interesting
thing is how easy it all

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.930
was, how easy it
was because people

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:24.050
make stuff available to you
actually going and talking

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.550
to people.

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.633
It was really interesting.

00:41:25.633 --> 00:41:26.640
People opened our doors.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.265
They said, have you
thought about this?

00:41:28.265 --> 00:41:29.700
And did you know
about so and so?

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.871
And actually suddenly you
find that loads of people

00:41:33.871 --> 00:41:35.745
were really, really
interested in the project

00:41:35.745 --> 00:41:37.950
and wanted to help with it.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:42.450
And so I have to say it's been
a really, truly good experience.

00:41:42.450 --> 00:41:43.780
It's been very, very good.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.450
Is that the positive
note to finish on?

00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:50.432
I don't know.

00:41:50.432 --> 00:41:53.262
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:53.262 --> 00:41:54.720
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Thank you very much

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.720
SIR DERMOT TURING: All
right, sounds like it is.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.280
