00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.603
Being a nerd is hard work, you
guys.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:06.039
Uh, but don't ask me.
I'm a fake geek girl.

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:08.041
Now, there's a ton of comics.
There's...

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:11.110
That's so true. That's funny.

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:12.979
There's comics to read,
there's games to play,

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.380
there's so many movies to watch,

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:16.282
people with bad opinions online
to argue with,

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.117
and now, suits to buy!

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.254
OppoSuits just introduced
the PAC-MAN suit.

00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:23.890
Now, a lot of people tweeted me
this suit right here.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:26.092
Which, um, I really have
to point out now--

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:30.029
this legit looks like a suit
people would wear to my funeral.

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.397
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.800
Now, I knew this would be
remarkably on brand for me,

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.602
but as a 44-year-old man
who's about to get married,

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:39.605
I think maybe,
maybe a head-to-to PAC-MAN suit

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:42.475
is just a little much at this
point in my life, all right?

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:43.676
Maybe I'm not gonna do that.

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:47.013
Why, yes, I actually did buy
the Pac-Man suit after all.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.348
Um, I'm sorry
if it's hard to hear me

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:52.652
over your screaming genitalia
right now.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:55.688
Ladies and gentlemen,
this arcade is closed!

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.790
-Uh... I...
-(laughter)

00:00:57.823 --> 00:01:00.626
I know what I said before
in the opening of the show,

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:03.196
but the truth of the matter is,
I bought this (bleep) thing

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.698
the second
it became available...

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:07.864
and here it is,
and it's amazing.
