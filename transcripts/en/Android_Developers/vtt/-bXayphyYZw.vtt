TAMZIN TAYLOR: So
the next session

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.920
is about how to manage your CEO.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.390
So let me ask you
how many people--

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.110
hands up if you're an
employee and not the CEO.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.500
Excellent, so
hopefully, you'll be

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.730
able to take away some
tangible lessons and tips

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.670
that you can take to rein
those crazy people in.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.660
Who can empathize
with this meme?

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.255
Hands up.

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:33.755
Yeah.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.580
Knowing how to handle the
prioritization of what

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.570
to build in your product when
you have so many competing

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.520
opinions, stakeholders,
self-interest,

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.950
not to mention important
people like your CEO or CFO's

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.150
very strong views, maybe on
the type of color of green,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.840
for example.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.160
So how do you avoid
opinion-based product

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.000
prioritization?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.300
Well, this was an
interest of mine,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.460
so a few months ago, I
interviewed about 15 to 20

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.560
of our top developers.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.320
I interviewed Google engineers,
Google product managers,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.670
directors of growth.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.660
And I tried to tease
out of them, how

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.920
did they approach this problem?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.020
And you know what
struck me was there

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.350
were two key characteristics.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.130
The first is that successful
developers rely on data

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.630
to make a call on what
to experiment on first

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.800
and what to build.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.440
And the second really
important factor

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.910
was that they had imbued this
culture of data and sharing

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.800
of information throughout
their organization.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.604
So to add color and
context of this discussion,

00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:04.020
in a few minutes,
I'll be inviting

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.039
on stage both 1tap and 2017
app of the year winner Memrise

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.560
to share with us their
experiences on reigning

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.939
in their crazy CEOs.

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.480
I know one of them
is there laughing.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.920
He's not that crazy.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.010
So let's get started
with prioritization.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.940
And just to note, the
models and suggestions

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.540
that we make here today are
just some of the best practices

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.280
that you can use.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.790
So they're not the
only ones you can use,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.540
but hopefully, you'll
be able to take away

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.890
some key nuggets of gold.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.040
So just a few seconds
ago, many of you

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.830
had put up your hands to say
that prioritization was hard.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.790
But it can be made
easier with data.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.510
Thank you for reconfirming.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.250
So over the last month, I've
worked with the 1tap team

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.380
to test out a model that
Google used internally

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.280
for deciding how to
prioritize what we build.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.350
We use this model on
Allo, YouTube, Gmail,

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.870
and we actually have
an internal growth

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.830
team who gets a conduit out
to our different products.

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.720
So I harnessed that team,
and we worked with 1tap.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.100
Now, again, this is not
the only way to do it.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.830
Bear with me.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.810
But if it gives you a
different perspective,

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.470
this is a good thing.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.620
Now, before I introduce
John on stage,

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.020
let me just give you a brief
overview of this Google model.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.700
So as you can see,
it's pretty simple.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.790
It looks pretty simple.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.060
It's made up of
four components--

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.740
the North Star metric,
user flows, a growth model,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:53.700
and a spreadsheet.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.750
Because, let's face
it, what database model

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.490
would be complete
without a spreadsheet?

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.370
Now, the model serves to help
you uncover opportunities,

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.160
and more importantly, it serves
as a common communication

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.835
tool for your whole company to
talk about growth, products,

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:15.650
and prioritization.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.620
So to kick off and go deeper on
this, the first one I mentioned

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.600
was the North Star metric.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.120
Now, listening to
Anthony [INAUDIBLE] talk

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.700
about behavioral
design, it struck me

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.070
that we were talking about
the same thing, which

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.180
is it's that key
engagement user metric.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.240
Now, the way that we
define a North Star metric

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.270
is that it
encapsulates everything

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.200
that you do in your app, and
it encapsulates all the value

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.210
that you're providing to a user.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.750
So as an example, if anyone here
is staying at Airbnb this week,

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.730
it would be nights booked.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.450
For WhatsApp, it would
be messages sent.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.519
So again, the purpose is
to create a shared goal

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:01.810
across all of your different
divisions in your company,

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.470
so they're all going
for the same goal.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.740
The next element is
mapping the user flows.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.410
Has anyone here mapped
their user flows?

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.720
A few of you, good, so this
might be familiar to you.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.130
The way that we approach it is
that, essentially, we define

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.600
user flows as a visual
representation of your user

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.600
journeys throughout your app
across acquisition, engagement,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.610
conversion, and retention.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.220
And that flows from sources
of acquisition, critical user

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.990
journeys, you drill down on
some important aspects, perhaps

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.290
your engagement activities,
and your retention activities.

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.790
Now, I can see you
taking photos madly.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.140
The next bit's going to
really mess it up, so

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.050
take your photo now.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.970
Once you've mapped this out--

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.440
and I quite like
the color coding.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.450
It helps me visualize it better.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.410
The next thing you want to do
is mess it up with some lines.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.100
So you stick in how
all of these components

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.330
relate to one another, the
idea being that this will then

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.000
show you where some
of the activities

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.210
are not supporting
the rest of the app

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.990
and help you identify
opportunities to improve.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.850
Now, that's all
well and good, but I

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.400
mentioned this was all
about data, didn't I?

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.710
So what's missing here,
and which will really

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.100
rely on you having a very
robust analytics system,

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.310
is to put in the proportion
of users who are successfully

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.250
going from step A to
step B, which will then

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.310
allow you to see where the
weak points are in your flow.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.710
For example, there
might be some issues

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.470
with return from
notifications and some issues

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.150
with notification permission.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.800
You can draw a conclusion there.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.910
So this mapping of
user flows really

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.410
helps everyone in
your business talk

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:53.120
about the product
in the same way

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.940
and understand how
their activities impact

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.630
the overall North Star metric.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.750
Once you've worked out where
your area for improvement is--

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.650
I mentioned notifications was
something in this example--

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.140
then next step is to drill down
on what are the key levers that

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.060
will impact that metric.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.070
So in the case of
notifications, for example,

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.680
we had average users opted in.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.360
We had average number
of notifications

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.580
sent, and for example,
the click through rate

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.860
of those notifications.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.870
This is not rocket science,
but just drawing it out

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.070
helps everyone to be clear
on what the potential levers

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.660
you have are.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:35.790
Now, I mentioned
there's this need

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.670
to have a spreadsheet
in here somewhere.

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:39.770
So once you've mapped
out that subsection,

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.770
transfer it to a spreadsheet,
link it all up together,

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.660
and you can run
scenario analysis

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.790
to compare your
different competing ideas

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.435
to see which one will have the
biggest impact on your North

00:07:50.435 --> 00:07:52.640
Star metric.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.900
Now, to tell us more
about their experience--

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.150
because as I said,
the North Star metric

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.700
seems pretty simple,
but I think we

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:05.220
know there's a lot more complex
thinking that goes into it--

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.060
I'd like to welcome on
stage John Butterfield, head

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.324
of growth of 1Tap.

00:08:10.324 --> 00:08:12.740
JON BUTTERFIELD: So one of the
things we did when we first

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.400
started making this product
is focusing on analytics,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.500
and we track everything a
user does within the app.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.240
And this is something that
we are really proud of,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.220
but we'll see how that unraveled
while working with Tamzin.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.980
So the first thing we did,
as Tamzin showed you earlier,

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.320
was we've created this user
flow, this thing up here.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.380
This is about the
10th iteration of it.

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:40.250
The first one had thousands and
thousands of different things

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.080
in it, and it was
just a cluster thing.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.100
I won't say the word.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.050
And so we dumbed
it down to this.

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.550
And we actually worked
with the head of growth

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.870
at Google on this one as well.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.100
And the thing he really
gave us as a key takeaway is

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.190
don't include everything from
the app, just the key moments

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.000
in the key journeys.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.670
And the first thing
listed for us,

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.440
actually, was show that
we have some problems,

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.230
and it's at the end, that
weird mustardy colored bit,

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:12.620
where it's essentially
like an exit point.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.820
The user journey doesn't
come all the way back around.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:23.300
So this was the first useful
part of building this model.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.084
So the next thing was about
the North Star metric.

00:09:26.084 --> 00:09:27.500
And now this is
an interesting one

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.490
because, for us,
it's pretty simple.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:32.030
So our mission as a
company, as you can see,

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.840
is to make being self-employed
easier than being employed.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.740
And so if we want
to make this easier,

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:45.770
the best thing we can
do is, quite simple--

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.790
there we go-- is
collect transactions.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:50.880
The more transactions
we collect for a user,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.790
the more we can
provide value, and it's

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.860
all about providing that value.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.900
So transactions per user is
a really easy one for us,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.340
but then we break
it down per product.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.160
So with 1tap receipts,
the obvious thing here

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:09.424
is the transaction in that term
is a receipt, receipt per user.

00:10:09.424 --> 00:10:11.090
Now, the tricky part
here, and the thing

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.500
that really threw us off,
was what's more important,

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.170
users adding a lot of receipts,
or a lot of uses just adding

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.584
a few receipts?

00:10:19.584 --> 00:10:21.500
So again, you've got to
think about the value,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.980
and the value is, if
they give us more data,

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.230
we can then help
them with their taxes

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.470
and do everything for
them, essentially.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.381
So it is all about receipts
per user, and the more receipts

00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:34.880
the better.

00:10:37.254 --> 00:10:38.920
So then we put it
into our growth model.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.640
As you saw, it's this really
long document of all things--

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.440
the whole equation
of the growth model.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.190
So I didn't put all that in
because it's just too much

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:50.350
and it's really boring.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:51.790
But when we first
wrote that out,

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.830
it is about 16 pages
of this document,

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:55.780
and it was just crazy.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:59.530
So again, we took the idea of
just dumbing it down and making

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.330
it something that
anybody can understand.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:05.740
And the headline here was
Receipts Added Per User,

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.710
and it's broken down by
the [INAUDIBLE] divided

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.800
by the receipt submissions.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.464
And then it's the receipt
submissions, as you can see,

00:11:14.464 --> 00:11:15.880
are defined by the
different entry

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.570
points and new and
returning users.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.084
So what was interesting
in here-- as I said,

00:11:22.084 --> 00:11:24.250
we're really proud of the
analytics and the tracking

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.550
that we put in within the app.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.450
But while we started
working on this,

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.540
we suddenly realized, hang on,
we're not tracking this, this,

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.956
and this, and these
are all things

00:11:32.956 --> 00:11:35.050
that provide value
and make it easier

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.609
for us to deliver our
North Star metric.

00:11:38.609 --> 00:11:40.150
So suddenly, it made
us realize we've

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:45.070
got to go back and update our
analytics and things like that.

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.680
And with this growth model, one
of the most interesting things

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.230
it did was that
it made it easier

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.170
for us to explain to the CEO--

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.450
who I won't bash in
this session today

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.100
because he's sat right there.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:57.730
Hi, Nick.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.680
He's filming as well,
actually, which is even worse.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.970
So it made it so he could see
where the [INAUDIBLE] comes

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.740
from, and then the CFO could
see where all the revenue comes

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.240
from.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.160
And products, who is
also sitting there,

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.000
could see what essentially
would work next to--

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.750
what levers to pull to get
the most amount of value.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.830
So then we put it
into this calculator--

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.840
this growth model, spreadsheet.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.090
This is just the
first part of it,

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.200
but again, you can see here,
with the starting values,

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.127
essentially what
happens over 10 days.

00:12:32.127 --> 00:12:33.460
And this is just the high level.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.487
It goes further into
detail as you go into it,

00:12:35.487 --> 00:12:37.070
but again, that's
boring to show here.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:39.830
Nobody really wants to see that.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.510
But the best thing
is, it's a predictor.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.160
And this-- and in this
calculator, this spreadsheet--

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.817
we actually renamed
it the Calculator.

00:12:46.817 --> 00:12:49.150
That's why I keep calling it
that, because to be honest,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.760
nobody really cares about
spreadsheets, especially

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.960
myself.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.680
Calculator, because it helps
us predict what we can do.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.950
So actually while
bringing in the equation

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:01.670
from the previous
one-- can we go back?

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:02.450
That one.

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.241
So once we had this
equation, and we put it

00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:06.310
into the spreadsheet,
we suddenly

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.720
started questioning where
the value was as well.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.178
So there was a lot
of things we put

00:13:10.178 --> 00:13:14.030
into the original model that
suddenly just made no sense.

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.390
So it really gave
us a good lesson

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:19.390
on what we should
be tracking and why,

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:20.510
so it was really useful.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:27.180
And then the next part is what
the model actually gave us.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:31.670
So the first thing is, it
gave us clarity about what--

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.070
across all departments,
about what it is we're doing.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:37.469
So the CEO, Nick,
no longer had to ask

00:13:37.469 --> 00:13:39.260
about where the
[INAUDIBLE] was coming from

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.060
and how we could increase it.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.320
Clear as day in this model.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:45.710
And then products didn't
have to necessarily ask

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.920
what are we going to do next?

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.170
What's the priority?

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.000
It's all based on this.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.526
And the CFO knew that,
by increasing revenue,

00:13:53.526 --> 00:13:56.150
we increased retention, so they
could see from the growth model

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.420
as well, essentially,
what is happening next.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:03.330
Although the CFO does still
sometimes go very Jerry Maguire

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:07.190
and "Show me the
money," but that's--

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.080
it's not too bad.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.550
And then the resources--

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:13.390
the big thing we realized is
that, because we're a receipt

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:15.800
app, and we do a
lot with finances,

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.599
we should be putting a lot
of priority into accountants.

00:14:19.599 --> 00:14:21.140
And that's something
we've not really

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.750
done too much of in the past,
so it was a huge wake up call.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.600
That was a huge lever there,
that if we put more effort

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.180
into that, we could
essentially get

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:33.020
lots more users a lot easier
and help them keep retained.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.420
Now, that also
helped with hires.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:39.170
So one of the problems you
have, that we certainly have,

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.240
is going trigger
happy on glass door

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.275
and just hiring the wrong
people at the wrong time.

00:14:44.275 --> 00:14:45.650
So this really
helps with knowing

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.860
who you should hire per a kind
of problem you have at the time

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.360
and what levers
you want to pull.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.300
So for us, it was
partner channels,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.300
so that was really good.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.461
And that's it.

00:14:57.461 --> 00:14:57.960
That's it.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.496
Thank you, Tamzin.

00:14:59.496 --> 00:15:00.372
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:00.372 --> 00:15:01.690
TAMZIN TAYLOR: Thank you, Jon.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.716
Oh-- wait, I think
mine's working.

00:15:03.716 --> 00:15:04.340
Thank you, Jon.

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.445
That was fantastic.

00:15:07.445 --> 00:15:10.060
Hopefully, that gave you
some really good insights

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.480
into, I guess, one model,
one way of working.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.340
Oh, thank you, yes.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.673
What was I going to click with--

00:15:15.673 --> 00:15:17.360
my fingers?

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.980
One way of working to help
you prioritize and bring

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:22.810
the company together.

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.750
Now, one thing you
may have picked up on,

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.360
apart from the fact that
there's CEOs in the audience,

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:33.090
was that the model really
helped Jon to communicate

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:37.000
why they were doing certain
things with products,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.650
marketing, CEO, and
all the other teams.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.860
So let me ask you a question.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.000
How many people in
the audience today

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
do prioritization or
experimentation by them--

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.500
just by themselves without
working with anyone else?

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.900
A few people.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:01.550
How many of you
do this in a team?

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.610
Just one team?

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.700
A lot more.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.830
If you're not doing it
across your company,

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:10.770
you can do better in
a very positive way.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:14.620
So top developers I've
spoken to ensure that there's

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:17.720
cross-functional
representation when they

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.900
do this kind of prioritization
so that everyone's on board

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.340
and aligned towards
that common goal,

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.300
whether you call it the North
Star metric or anything else

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:28.340
you'd like to choose.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.380
And culture is critical to this.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:33.470
Need to have an acceptance
of risk and return,

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.520
and to take us through
their approach,

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.200
more on the riskier
side, I'd like

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.930
to invite on stage
Kristina Narusk, head

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:43.900
of product for Memrise.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.530
Thank you.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.600
KRISTINE NARUSK: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.040
So happy to be here, and I
know that we are running out

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.710
of time shortly, and
everyone is quite excited

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:04.200
to get to the longer
networking break.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.700
I think my talk is
going to be brief.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.680
I have to apologize.

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.315
I should be doing
this in German.

00:17:10.315 --> 00:17:11.940
I'm working in a
language learning gap,

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.440
but English is not
my first language.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.369
So maybe this is an
excuse for this time.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.550
Memrise is a favorite
language learning gap

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.800
for about 25 million people.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.880
It's very vibrant
and lifelike way

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.140
to become confident in
using a foreign language

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:36.090
in any country or any
situation, people experience.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:41.040
And we have a record number
of over 200 language pairs

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.900
that people can learn and
hopefully eventually speak.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.710
And the next few
minutes, I will be

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:54.720
sharing some insights of how
we do product prioritization

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.780
and also manage our CEO.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:04.000
Memrise has had a very
unique journey so far.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.330
So we've been super
lucky with having

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:12.560
one of the most creative and
experimental CEOs out there.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.080
It has its upsides, which means
that it's a great inspiration,

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:22.430
and it injects a lot of creative
thinking and experimentalism

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.700
to the rest of the team.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.840
The downside is that it kind
of sets a slightly different

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.320
challenge for product
people and product team

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.590
to manage the whole thing and
manage all these creative ideas

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:38.650
coming out of the
brains like that.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:44.020
And as an example,
about two years ago,

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.620
I got a text message
from Ed, our CEO,

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:52.600
on Sunday morning, saying
that, good morning, Kristina.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.010
I'm in Scotland.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.040
I bought a double decker bus.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.230
I'm going to find
a repair man who

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:04.030
is going to fix it, a
driver, and a film crew,

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:08.560
and the bus is going to
tour the rest of the Europe

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.640
filming videos of native
speakers saying phrases

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.400
and sentences in all these
different languages that

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.740
are spoken in these
European countries.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.690
So it was quite a
unique experience

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.430
to get a message like that.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:28.630
And what happened was that
we had to come up ways

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.630
how to handle these
kind of creative ideas

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.110
and very often
slightly crazy ideas,

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.780
and how to turn them
into successful features

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.470
for our product.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:45.310
So what happened was we
had to come up with a way

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:50.200
how to filter and how to assess
and measure such crazy ideas

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.470
that not just the CEOs, but
also everyone in the team

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.940
can come up with.

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.680
And we kind of felt
like spreadsheets

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.420
and different models
and frameworks

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.160
and systems and
processes are maybe

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.730
too harsh for filtering
out some genius

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.940
pieces of creative glimpses.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.970
And we ended up
having and coming up

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:18.400
with six criteria for how to
filter out useful ideas out

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.710
of generic nonsense.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:24.070
And the six criteria
that we came up with

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.280
was every single idea
has to be iterable,

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:30.460
which means that we
should start small.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:34.090
We should take every
feature as an MVP

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:37.600
and then iterate if
it is successful.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.290
We think that the idea has
to have an immediate impact,

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:43.540
so as soon as we
rollout the feature

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.880
and launch it for
our users, we do

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.610
want to see some kind
of behavioral change

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.330
or some change in metrics.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:55.060
It has to have a
lasting effect, which

00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:00.730
means that one trick ponies
do not quite work for us.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.120
We do want to build features
that have an impact on language

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.010
learners for an
extended period of time,

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.880
not just for the first five
minutes or the first day.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.090
Everything has to be
measurable, obviously.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:17.389
And it has to have a power
of localization, which

00:21:17.389 --> 00:21:18.930
I think, for a
language learning app,

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:23.740
is maybe a unique but user
base for almost any app in--

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.240
out there is very global.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.810
So its good to benefit
from making sure

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:30.430
that it works in
every single language

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.460
for every culture for
right to left and left

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.330
to right languages.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.510
And finally,
obviously, it all has

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:41.950
to fit into a coherent product,
so even the craziest ideas just

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.430
have to fit in somewhere
and make sense.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.400
And we went even deeper.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.050
So in order to keep this kind
of creative and experimental

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.890
mindset in the company
and in every single team,

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.820
we divided our product
development lifecycle

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:04.630
into three stages, the first
one being the discovery stage

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:06.490
where we prototype.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.480
We sketch.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.200
We design.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.100
We draw.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.160
We user test the idea.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.520
We build something that
we can get random people

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.830
from the street to test it out.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:23.170
In the Memrise Membus
case, the discovery phase

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.660
included sending the
bus to a mini trip

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.750
to Oxford to film the
videos in English first

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:31.150
to see whether this
makes any sense

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.720
or not before touring
the rest of the Europe.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:41.200
And after doing the dry runs
and testing these ideas out,

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.510
we define it in
a fairly detailed

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:48.340
spec with all the
functionality described,

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.970
everything, all the sketches,
all the designs drawn out.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:56.230
We do involve data team in
this stage of the process

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.310
quite heavily because
we have to make sure

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.520
that we build the feature
for the right user

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.860
for the right use case, we
track and implement the data

00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.630
points in a correct way.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:13.500
So it's super important
that the data people

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:15.930
are involved in the process.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:20.010
Once everything is
ready and set up,

00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:23.670
the development teams take
over and actually start

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.650
building the features.

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.440
Because everyone has been
quite nicely involved

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.280
in the discovery and in
the definition phase,

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.016
it's fairly easy
for the developers

00:23:34.016 --> 00:23:35.640
to understand why
we're building things

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:39.240
and how exactly they
need to be built.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.560
From the product perspective, a
super key thing to keep in mind

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.110
is that, even with the
most sophisticated systems

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:50.310
and processes in place, it
even happens for the most

00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:53.520
experienced product managers
that you sometimes forget

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.680
to switch on the
feature and experiment

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:59.640
when it goes out, so that the
users will actually see what

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:05.170
you built. And once
everything is nicely set up,

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:09.310
and the new version
of the app is out,

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.930
and now it's time to take
a photo of this as well,

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:18.960
it's the joyful moment
of watching when and how

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.110
the results come in.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.300
We are organized as
well, so it's not

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.400
like we're all over the
place with crazy ideas.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.590
We have a standard
set of metrics,

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:32.070
standard graphs for every
single experiment, AB test

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.730
feature that goes out.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:38.160
And the day after the release
is like refreshing this page

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.670
all the time, which is the
reasonable and sensible way

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:47.430
to see how the feature and
the new idea has performed.

00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:51.550
In our team's case, it
shows you the joy and fun

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.890
of seeing the results coming in
and learning whether we built

00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:58.350
something super successful
that people enjoy

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:01.390
or whether we need to go
back to the whiteboard

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:03.640
and sketch and start
thinking again.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.042
So I think EuroVision is
quite popular in Germany,

00:25:07.042 --> 00:25:09.000
so it's almost like
watching the results come--

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
votes coming in and then
seeing whether we're

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.770
on a winning in
case or losing case.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.920
So hopefully, this has
given you a few ideas

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:20.610
how to do product prioritization
without spreadsheets as well,

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.940
and also manage the crazy
ideas coming from your CEO.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:25.440
Thank you.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.490
[APPLAUSE]
