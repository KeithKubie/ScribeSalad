00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
&gt;&gt; I think there's definitely a great chance
that China will pull us

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:11.620
out of the economic crisis that we're in.
A lot of the talk last year was about whether

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.580
China would be decoupled
from the rest of the world.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.390
I think that's happened to a certain extent,
but I think we'll see that

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.590
investment in the Chinese domestic economy
has become so great that

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.330
it's pulling in a lot of imports from the
Asia -- the Asian-Pacific

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.570
region.
And I think this has stimulated the economy

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.360
in this particular region
and it's also dragging in imports from around

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.940
the world.
So I think the first steps will be an Asian-Pacific

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.949
recovery and the
then the recovery will spread to the rest

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:42.219
of the world.
