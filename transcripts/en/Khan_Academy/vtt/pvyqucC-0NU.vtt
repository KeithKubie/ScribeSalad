00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.496
- [Voiceover] If you up all of the spots

00:00:02.496 --> 00:00:05.863
on these dominoes, there are 63 spots.

00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:08.208
So if you counted all of these dots,

00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:10.193
they're telling us that would be 63.

00:00:10.193 --> 00:00:11.597
So we don't have to do that.

00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:15.231
And then they tell us,
that is 42 more spots

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:18.794
than the total number of
spots on a six sided die.

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:21.430
So they're saying if you
took a six sided die,

00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:25.318
so a six sided die, might
look something like this.

00:00:25.354 --> 00:00:27.409
It's a cube, it might have one dot

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.974
and then it might have
three and then over here

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:33.271
it might have maybe two
and so if you count up

00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.871
all of these dots, the ones we see

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.019
and then the ones on
the other side as well,

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.536
that's the number of
spots on a six sided die.

00:00:40.887 --> 00:00:43.725
Now what they're saying
is that the 63 spots,

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:44.855
they said if you add up all the spots

00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:47.409
on these dominoes there is 63.

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.998
And they're saying that is 42 more spots

00:00:49.998 --> 00:00:53.757
than the total number of
spots on a six sided die.

00:00:55.457 --> 00:00:57.431
Let's now figure out how many spots

00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:59.891
are on a six sided die.

00:01:00.554 --> 00:01:03.108
The first thing you should
always ask yourselves

00:01:03.108 --> 00:01:04.931
is what they're asking for.

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:08.437
Is this going to be more or less

00:01:08.437 --> 00:01:12.335
than the number of spots that
you have on these dominoes?

00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:14.798
You might say, "Hey, I'm reading 42 more

00:01:14.798 --> 00:01:18.697
"I see this word more, there
must be 42 more spots."

00:01:18.838 --> 00:01:21.717
But you have to be very,
very, very, very careful.

00:01:21.717 --> 00:01:22.994
Whenever you do a word problem,

00:01:22.994 --> 00:01:24.515
don't just look for words and say

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:27.168
"Oh it's more I'll add or if
it's fewer I'll subtract."

00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:29.594
Because that's not going
to be the case always.

00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:31.532
You really need to think about

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:34.190
what is the problem asking for?

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:38.313
Because they're saying that
this 63 dots right over here

00:01:38.313 --> 00:01:41.795
that is 42 more than the
total number of spots

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:43.676
on a six sided die.

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:45.951
Another way of thinking about it is,

00:01:45.951 --> 00:01:48.308
if you took the number of
spots on a six sided die

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:50.467
that's what they're asking for.

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.592
So if we say that's question mark.

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:56.167
If you took the number of
spots on a six sided die

00:01:56.167 --> 00:02:01.167
and you had 42 more than that,

00:02:01.496 --> 00:02:03.086
then that is going to be equal to

00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:04.955
the number of spots on these dominoes

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:07.972
and they tell us that is 63.

00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:12.733
The number of spots on a
six sided die plus 42 is 63

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:17.609
or 63 spots is 42 more
spots than the total

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.652
number of spots on a six sided die.

00:02:19.652 --> 00:02:21.730
Always think about what they're saying.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.471
So now we can try to figure out

00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:25.828
what this question mark is.

00:02:25.828 --> 00:02:29.206
Well if question mark
plus 42 is equal to 63,

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:32.430
that's the same thing as
saying that question mark

00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:36.608
is equal to 63,

00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:40.391
63 minus 42.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.110
So what's that going to be?

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.933
We can calculate it.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:50.393
So 63, six tens three ones.

00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:54.141
42, four tens and two ones.

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.498
We want to subtract that, and when we do

00:02:56.498 --> 00:02:58.762
we're going to figure
out the number of spots

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:00.919
on the six sided die.

00:03:01.246 --> 00:03:03.220
We'll go to ones place, three ones

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.064
minus two ones is one one.

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:10.046
Six tens minus four
tens, those are two tens.

00:03:10.046 --> 00:03:13.319
So two tens and one one that's 21 spots.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.319
21 spots on a six sided die.
