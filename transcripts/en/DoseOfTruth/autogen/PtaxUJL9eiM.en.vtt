I understand it completely but it
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.119 align:start position:0%
I understand it completely but it

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 align:start position:0%
correct and I mean the potential that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 align:start position:0%
someone and then copy them and you can
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.170 align:start position:0%
someone and then copy them and you can
see<00:00:58.620><c> that</c><00:00:58.829><c> that's</c><00:00:59.010><c> obviously</c><00:00:59.579><c> part</c><00:00:59.940><c> of</c><00:01:00.030><c> their</c>
