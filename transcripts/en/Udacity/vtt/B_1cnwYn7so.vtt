00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.170
Let's talk more about the two sample t-test, since we'll want

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.880
to compare two different samples in our class project. There are

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.455
a few different versions of the t-test that one might employ

00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:12.580
,and they depend on really on what assumptions we make about the

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.680
data. So we might want to ask questions such as ,do our

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.290
samples have the same size ?,and do they have the same

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.831
variance? . Let's discuss a variant of the t-test called Welch's

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:25.686
t-test in more depth. Since it's the most general. It doesn't assume

00:00:25.686 --> 00:00:28.498
equal sample size ,or equal variance. In Welch's

00:00:28.498 --> 00:00:33.510
t-test ,we compute a t-statistic using following equation.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.950
T equals mu1 minus mu2, divided by the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.260
square root of sigma1 squared over n1. Plus

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.950
sigma 2 squared over n2. Where mu I ,is the sample mean for the Ith sample.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.150
Sigma squared I is the sample variance for

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.010
the Ith sample. And NI is the sample size

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.410
for the Ith sample. We'll also want to estimate the number of degrees

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.200
of freedom, nu, using the following equation.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.315
Nu is approximately equal to. Quantity sigma1

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:08.911
squared ,over n1 ,plus sigma2 squared over n2 ,squared over sigma1 of the

00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:16.220
4th over n1 squared nu1 ,plus sigma2 to the 4th ,over n2 squared nu2.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.390
Where mu I is equal to mi minus one ,and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.320
this is the degrees of freedom associated with the Ith variance

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.560
estimate. If you're unfamiliar with degrees of freedom again it might

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.620
be a good idea to brush up on your stats concepts

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.510
with the audacity's intro to stats course. A link is

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.550
provided in the instructor comments. All right so once we have

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.372
these two values, we can estimate the P value. Conceptually, the

00:01:37.372 --> 00:01:41.420
P-value is the probability of obtaining the test statistic at least

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.835
as extreme as the one that was actually observed

00:01:43.835 --> 00:01:47.562
,assuming that the null hypothesis was true. The P

00:01:47.562 --> 00:01:50.630
value is not the probability of the null hypothesis

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.570
is true given the data. So again, just as a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.090
thought experiment. Say we were testing whether left handed

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.196
or right handed baseball players. Were better batters by looking

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:03.040
at their average batting average. If the P value

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.440
is .05, this would mean that ,even if there is

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.320
no difference between left handed and right handed batters, since

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.590
that's our null hypothesis. So, even if this was true,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.570
we would see a value of t ,equal or greater

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.320
to the one that we saw 5% of the time.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.420
When performing a statistical test like this, we usually set

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.200
some critical value of P. Let's call it P critical.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.910
If P falls below P critical, then we would reject

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.440
the null hypothesis. In the two sample case, this is equivalent

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.270
to stating that the mean for our two samples

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.260
is not equal. Calculating this P value for a

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.070
given set of data can be kind of of tedious.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.390
Thankfully, we seldom have to perform this calculation explicitly.
