00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.090
Okay, here's a quiz! So, just to get at this issue of why it's

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.230
so important that we consider infinite hypothesis

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.610
spaces, let's look at some hypothesis spaces that

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.330
have come up in prior lectures. So, for each one on this list check

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.190
it off if it's infinite, and otherwise don't check it off. Does that make sense?

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.990
&gt;&gt; Makes sense to me.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.410
&gt;&gt; Alright, let's do it.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.190
&gt;&gt; Go.
