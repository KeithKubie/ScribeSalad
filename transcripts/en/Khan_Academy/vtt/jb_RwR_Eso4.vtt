00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:02.877
- We're told that Casey buys a bracelet.

00:00:02.877 --> 00:00:07.708
She pays for the bracelet and
pays 72 cents in sales tax.

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:10.208
The sales tax rate is 6%.

00:00:11.283 --> 00:00:15.987
What is the original price
of the bracelet, before tax?

00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:19.839
So pause this video and see
if you can figure this out.

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.294
Well, let's think about how
your sales tax is calculated.

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:27.461
Your sales tax would be
equal to the sales tax rate,

00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:32.180
I'll just call that the
rate, so that's going to be

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.847
equal to the rate times
your original price.

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.435
And what do we know here?

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:44.369
Well they tell us what our sales tax is.

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:48.536
Our sales tax is 72 cents,
so I'll write that here.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:53.563
So 72 cents is going to be
equal to my sales tax rate,

00:00:53.563 --> 00:00:56.127
they also tell us that, that is 6%,

00:00:56.127 --> 00:01:00.446
is going to be equal to
6% times my original price

00:01:00.446 --> 00:01:03.062
and that's what they're asking
for, the original price.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:06.482
So times, I'm just going
to call it P for short,

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:07.754
original price.

00:01:07.754 --> 00:01:08.587
And so you have it.

00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:10.965
We have a fairly
straightforward equation now.

00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:13.235
And now I'm just going to
rewrite everything as decimal,

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:16.735
so we could write 0.72 is equal to 6%

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:22.229
is the same thing as six per 100,

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.094
which is the same thing as six hundredths,

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:27.511
0.06, six hundredths times p.

00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:32.819
And now we can just divide
both sides by six hundredths

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.375
to solve for the original
price, so let's do that.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:38.208
Alright.

00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:41.206
So on the right-hand side I have a P.

00:01:41.206 --> 00:01:44.495
On the left-hand side
if I have 72 hundredths

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:47.676
divided by six hundredths,
well that's going to be

00:01:47.676 --> 00:01:50.863
equal to 12, 12 times six is 72.

00:01:50.863 --> 00:01:54.247
Six hundredths times 12
would be 72 hundredths.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:57.497
And so this is going to be equal to 12.

00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:02.860
So the original price of the
bracelet, before tax is $12.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.092
And you can verify that.

00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:08.259
6% of $12, 0.06 times 12
is indeed 72 hundredths.

00:02:12.513 --> 00:02:14.596
Let's do another example.

00:02:15.582 --> 00:02:18.999
A store has a 25% off sale on coats.

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:24.316
With this discount, the
price of one coat is $34.50.

00:02:25.446 --> 00:02:28.877
What is the original price of the coat?

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:30.335
So once again, pause this video

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:32.510
and see if you can figure it out.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.464
These examples, they're
actually quite useful

00:02:34.464 --> 00:02:36.713
because you will encounter
this all of the time

00:02:36.713 --> 00:02:39.261
when you are shopping or
you're trying to calculate tax

00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:41.548
or you're buying something,
so think about this.

00:02:41.548 --> 00:02:44.806
Can you figure out the
original price of the coat?

00:02:44.806 --> 00:02:46.284
Alright, well let's just write it out

00:02:46.284 --> 00:02:48.253
the same way we did last time.

00:02:48.253 --> 00:02:52.420
Let's say our original
price and then there's a 25%

00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:59.649
discount, so minus 25%
of the original price

00:03:05.678 --> 00:03:08.178
is going to be equal to $34.50

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.873
because that the price with the discount.

00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:17.448
So can we solve for the original price?

00:03:17.448 --> 00:03:20.022
So one way to think about it, this is 100%

00:03:20.022 --> 00:03:22.766
of the original price or
one times the original price

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:26.536
minus 25% of the original
price is going to equal this.

00:03:26.536 --> 00:03:30.703
Well, 100% minus 25% of
something is going to be 75%

00:03:32.682 --> 00:03:34.515
of our original price,

00:03:37.323 --> 00:03:39.103
this is why people use
letters for variables,

00:03:39.103 --> 00:03:41.478
so they don't have to keep
writing this over and over again,

00:03:41.478 --> 00:03:44.061
is going to be equal to $34.50.

00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:48.074
Now to solve for our
original price we just divide

00:03:48.074 --> 00:03:50.350
both sides by 75%.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.155
And 75%, that's the same thing as

00:03:52.155 --> 00:03:54.488
75 per 100 or 75 hundredths.

00:03:56.123 --> 00:03:59.956
So I could divide both
sides by 75 hundredths.

00:04:02.612 --> 00:04:04.273
On the left-hand side
these two are equivalent,

00:04:04.273 --> 00:04:06.039
so I'll be left with my original price.

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:08.684
And now I just have to figure
out what is this going to be.

00:04:08.684 --> 00:04:11.401
So if I take 75 hundredths
and let me actually

00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:13.387
multiply both of these times 100.

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:15.207
So this is going to be the same thing as

00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:16.874
3,450 divided by 75.

00:04:18.888 --> 00:04:20.639
I just did that to get
rid of the decimals.

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.825
I moved, essentially, both of the decimals

00:04:22.825 --> 00:04:24.733
to the right two places.

00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:27.703
Multiplying the numerator
and the denominator by 100.

00:04:27.703 --> 00:04:31.620
So let's see how many
times 75 goes into 3,450.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.089
Let's see, 75 doesn't go into three.

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:36.426
Doesn't go into 34.

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:38.093
It does go into 345.

00:04:39.242 --> 00:04:41.598
What is that, four times?

00:04:41.598 --> 00:04:43.431
Four times five is 20.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.793
Four times seven is 28 plus two, 300.

00:04:49.723 --> 00:04:50.653
And then you subtract.

00:04:50.653 --> 00:04:51.813
Get 45.

00:04:51.813 --> 00:04:52.845
Bring down the zero.

00:04:52.845 --> 00:04:54.124
450.

00:04:54.124 --> 00:04:56.374
75 goes into 450 six times.

00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:00.162
Six times five is 30.

00:05:00.162 --> 00:05:03.582
Six times seven is 42
plus three is indeed 45

00:05:03.582 --> 00:05:05.380
and we luckily have no remainder.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.649
So this right over here is
going to be equal to $46.

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:11.560
Our original price is $46.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.790
You take off one-fourth or
25%, you're left with $34.50.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.022
And that makes intuitive sense as well.

00:05:18.022 --> 00:05:20.563
Always good to just take
whatever answer you have

00:05:20.563 --> 00:05:23.356
and put it back in and
see if it makes sense.

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:26.759
In terms of if you somehow
got $460 and you said taking

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.466
25% off you get to $34.50, you'd
say "Well that sounds off."

00:05:30.466 --> 00:05:33.710
Or if you got $4 and you
said you take 25% off

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:36.602
and you got $34.50 that
would have also felt off,

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:38.467
but $46 feels right.

00:05:38.467 --> 00:05:39.475
And you can even calculate that.

00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:44.092
What's 25% of $46, subtract that from $46

00:05:44.092 --> 00:05:46.259
and you should get $34.50.
