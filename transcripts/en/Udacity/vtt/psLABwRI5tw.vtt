00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In summary, what have we learned from our friend the zebra?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, we learned that we took our approach of making a concept inventory

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and then refining the ideas and choosing the simplest implementation we could think of

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then doing a back of an envelop calculation to say how long is it going to take

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to run this simple implementation and then refining the code as necessary,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
making it a little bit faster by swapping around some of the clauses.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We also learned the idea of building tools.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We built tools for timing and counts.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In general we learned this idea of separation of aspects from the program

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to try to keep the design as clean as possible,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
so that you could tell what was working on getting the problem right

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and what was working on making it more efficient.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In the end you might say, wow, that was a clever solution.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It was great to see how it works out,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
but we can see if we just follow the steps

00:00:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
we can arrive at a solution like that every time.
