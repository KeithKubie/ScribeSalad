00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.791
Hey,

2
00:00:01.791 --> 00:00:05.120
what's going on it's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcasts for

3
00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:07.130
Monday. Um,

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.810
December 5th, 2016 what's going on?

5
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:16.280
Our y? Yeah. Um, you're doing your holiday shopping.

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.300
Is that what you're doing? Oh my God. What do I get this person?

7
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.080
And it's just not enough time. Slide a bullet. By the way.

8
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:29.080
Slight Ebola is still left. Um, yeah. Uh, you guys are,

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.670
you're in the same boat as me. Um, you know,

10
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.030
I handled some of the shit I needed to handle. Uh, you know,

11
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:37.880
I go fucking nieces and nephews and all this shit I gotta take care of,

12
00:00:37.881 --> 00:00:39.350
so I don't know what to do. You know what I'm going to do?

13
00:00:39.351 --> 00:00:40.790
I'm going to go on bill bird.com.

14
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.380
Click on the podcast page and click on the Amazon link and go straight to Amazon

15
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:50.360
and kicked me a little dope, right, baby, Huh? Oh No. Bill, you shouldn't have.

16
00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:53.720
Hey, don't worry about it. I made a little bit of fucking Kashi. Shaun,

17
00:00:53.721 --> 00:00:58.040
this one. Oh, enjoy your remote control.

18
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.560
Labra d. Um, anyways, uh,

19
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.910
so I know the podcast is late. I was going to try to do it last night, but, uh,

20
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:11.410
unfortunately I had to go to a memorial service for my friend who died. And, uh,

21
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.480
it was a beautiful, beautiful ceremony.

22
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.810
And also one of the saddest things I've ever seen with these young kids and

23
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:22.400
everything. And, uh, didn't feel too funny last night, but, um,

24
00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.600
I learned a lot, man. I learned a lot by going to that service.

25
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.170
I will tell you that because when they did the collage of his life in the end of

26
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:33.080
it, um, the,

27
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.900
the photos and the videos and everything,

28
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:40.640
like 99% of it was about him with his wife and being a dad.

29
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.530
So it made me feel lucky that I'm going to become a father. Definitely. Because,

30
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.660
uh, I was thinking like, what if I died right now?

31
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:49.220
What would the collage look like for me?

32
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:51.710
And it would just be a picture of me and a bunch of different comedy clubs

33
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.200
making weird faces. Um, obviously the lovely DHEA, but you know what I mean?

34
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.900
I was Kinda like, uh, what me playing drums? Like,

35
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.200
what the fuck did I do to keep, you know,

36
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.080
not to say that you have to have a fucking kid.

37
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.150
Cause definitely I think if you don't have a kid at this point,

38
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:09.080
if you don't want to,

39
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.710
that's a great fucking thing considering all the shit going on with the

40
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:16.430
environment to not just have another person, just to have a person.

41
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.300
But um, you know, like with all of these things,

42
00:02:20.301 --> 00:02:23.630
the great thing was I got to see a bunch of comics that I had not seen in awhile

43
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.921
and uh,

44
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:29.921
I will be seeing a bunch more this Tuesday night at the a laugh factory.

45
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.330
I believe the event is sold out.

46
00:02:32.331 --> 00:02:34.460
So thank you to everybody that came down and bought tickets.

47
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.760
I A or however the fuck you kids do it nowadays. I really appreciate it.

48
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.740
It's going to be a, the money is going to be going to a is a twin boys.

49
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.330
But um, anyway, so yes, I went to, I was a very, very heavy emotional nights,

50
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:50.300
so I did not feel remotely funny because that was the thing. Oh,

51
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.490
typical fucking psycho comic.

52
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.580
I'm going to go to a memorial service for a friend of mine that I've known for

53
00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.320
almost 25 years. And then I'll come home. Then I'll do my after that, you know,

54
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.440
if you think some of my shit is bleak and dark, um, yeah.

55
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.820
I, I'm glad I did not record last night, so I had some shit to do this morning.

56
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.980
I'm a little bit late. I'm,

57
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.100
we're editing the season two of f is for family and all that shit.

58
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.540
Have I made you laugh yet?

59
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.350
All I'm doing is telling you what an album laid in my bed and I bucked it, blah,

60
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.960
blah, blah, you know, fully clothed by the way,

61
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.150
fully clothed this episode. Um, the NC 17,

62
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.670
Thursday afternoon, just before Friday,

63
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.320
Monday morning podcasts did not do well in the ratings as far as the feedback.

64
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.483
You know,

65
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.350
it was something that we here at Monday morning podcast industry's decided was,

66
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:42.700
you know, maybe a different flavor.

67
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:46.300
We could throw the podcast every once in a while I could just be wearing a robe

68
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:50.980
with nothing underneath it that Nia could then comment on. And, um, you know,

69
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.080
it was like new coke. That's, that's what I would say.

70
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.120
I'm kidding actually with some of the funniest fucking photoshops I don't know

71
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:59.720
if you guys saw them on Twitter. Uh,

72
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.230
the Sharon Stone was fucking f that was, I dunno how you taught that one.

73
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:08.080
That was great. So anyways, let's, let's talk about life.

74
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.900
Talk about the world. Let's talk about uh, hey,

75
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:16.990
congratulations to everybody up there.

76
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.810
And the code is that was fighting against the pipeline.

77
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:24.520
Evidently they've been able at least able to stop it for now. You know.

78
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.520
Good Lord. Some of the shit that they were saying,

79
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.170
those corporations with doin man, they were playing for keeps,

80
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.090
they were saying at nighttime they had drones and they were coming in,

81
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.490
they had this pepper spray water mixture they were spraying at the protesters.

82
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.990
Um, that whole thing is so fucked up cause I was just like,

83
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:45.040
why can't they just go down to home depot and buy some of those fucking things

84
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:47.350
that makes the pipe make a 90 degree turn,

85
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:50.620
go up the street a little bit and go around the shit. Um,

86
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.180
evidently all the white towns, the cowboy side,

87
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:57.730
I guess they try to go through other people's towns and they were like, yeah,

88
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.290
you're never running that shit through here.

89
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.430
So even the white people didn't want it. I Dunno.

90
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.760
I guess what I'm saying is I should have bought a Tesla, um,

91
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.330
until they do the research and what those fucking batteries do once they finally

92
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:14.200
take those out. You know,

93
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.940
I remember Michael Jordan telling me not to throw out my batteries, you know,

94
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.930
I believe he was standing next to the children. That's so together. Sneakers,

95
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.750
there's so much, you know, you can never,

96
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.930
you can never not get mud on your shoes no matter what you do. Like,

97
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:31.240
how the fuck do you just like, no matter what you're doing,

98
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.510
I do this and I'm not hurting anybody or the planet.

99
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:37.570
Just the mere fact that you're fucking here, you know,

100
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.950
somebody is crying in factory somewhere, right? Or the inverse,

101
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:45.460
if you're the kid or the person working in the sweatshop, right.

102
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.780
You gotta be doing something, you've probably taken it home with you, you know,

103
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.180
coming home, screaming at your wife.

104
00:05:52.181 --> 00:05:55.540
That's my part of the cockpit flat asleep on right. There's something.

105
00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.570
Who the fuck knows? I Dunno. Maybe I'm just an arrogant con first world country.

106
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.710
I have no idea. But let's talk about Formula One racing here. Everybody.

107
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.910
Nico Rosberg Dude, level of fucking drama.

108
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.100
Like ladies, if you ever wanted to get into a sport, but you just find,

109
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.470
you know,

110
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.470
the four major ones in the u s boring or you're not into soccer or whatever the

111
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:21.560
fuck people watch around the world. Cricket, you like drama.

112
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.060
You like all of that shit.

113
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.070
I highly suggest watching formula one racing this whole Nico Rosberg Lewis

114
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.520
Hamilton thing. Nico Rosberg, right? He's the, he's the upstart guys.

115
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.270
I said he finally won his first championship after being a bridesmaid the last

116
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.560
couple of years. This is my first year watching it.

117
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:42.130
So I'm sure a lot of this shit I'll have wrong. Um,

118
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.980
he wins his first championship. All right?

119
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.540
And then out of fucking nowhere out of the fucking blue,

120
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.190
he retired. He just said, that's it. I'm done.

121
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.350
And somebody tweeted that to me.

122
00:06:57.351 --> 00:07:02.351
So I looked it up and I saw that it was true and the only clip I saw was him

123
00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:07.550
just standing there and his wife was talking to the entire fucking time.

124
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.410
So I'm just sitting there looking, going like, wait a minute, is this guy,

125
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.550
was this her decision? You know, he's got a kid on the way, just like, God,

126
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.120
thank God you really have to drive again this weekend where

127
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.300
I sit. It's just so silly. I mean, you know, I drive a car to, you know,

128
00:07:29.301 --> 00:07:33.530
I don't have to put a number on it and drive around s turns. I just,

129
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:37.700
it's just such a male testosterone thing.

130
00:07:37.701 --> 00:07:38.720
You're hurting the environment.

131
00:07:38.721 --> 00:07:41.210
I don't know if he got in her ear like the whole fucking Yoko thing,

132
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.780
which people always says, Yoko broke up the Beatles, which I, I don't,

133
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.591
I don't believe that.

134
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:49.850
I think John and Paul kept bringing their work home,

135
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.040
bitching about one another. And after a while, both Linda and Yoko were like,

136
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:59.390
Hey, well why don't you just quit? I mean, you're not happy. Right?

137
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.380
And then they just threw that out there and then they're ego. You know,

138
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.230
like they would call them their bluff. They couldn't be like, what?

139
00:08:06.231 --> 00:08:07.250
But there would, I,

140
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.610
I don't know if I could write without him. Right. So they just, they,

141
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.520
they couldn't do that. So they just fucking,

142
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:19.010
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Let's get back to the,

143
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.540
let's get back to the race in here.

144
00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.740
So I didn't know if it was that version and then I read that, uh,

145
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.630
what's his face? That was a Kiki Lotto or whatever he was trashing.

146
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:34.370
Nico Rosberg said he made them look silly and stupid and all of that.

147
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.150
And I'm just sitting there, why the fuck would this guy quit 31 years old.

148
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:40.670
You just won your first one. Now you're going to walk away.

149
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.570
You know what, why would you do that?

150
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:48.200
And then I was thinking maybe it's his wife, he's got a kid coming along.

151
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.410
He just wanted, he was very emotional.

152
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.070
He had to come down afterwards within this,

153
00:08:56.071 --> 00:09:00.150
the little bit of a melancholy slash depression. And then you're like, fuck,

154
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:04.530
now I've got to do this again, and you gotta climb back up the mountain again.

155
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.970
I don't think it's, you know what I think it is? I think that, um,

156
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.010
Louis Hamilton was the favorite son. This is,

157
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.020
that's just total fucking guests at Mercedes.

158
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.710
He sick of dealing with that dynamic, you know?

159
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:20.710
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.950
<v 0>And he wanted to get out of his fucking contract and the only way out was to</v>

161
00:09:23.951 --> 00:09:27.370
retire. So he might leave for, I don't know how long.

162
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:28.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

163
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.760
<v 0>You know, and then he'll come back with a different team.</v>

164
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.150
There's no fucking way. He's not coming back 31 years old.

165
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.110
There's no fucking way he's not coming back. He's going to take a year off,

166
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:40.960
get his kid up and running, you know,

167
00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:45.640
get the kid to be able to use the fucking shit. Right.

168
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.360
Mama Dadda throttle break, right. You get it.

169
00:09:49.361 --> 00:09:52.990
Say a few fucking words and then he's going to be right back out there again.

170
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.610
You know,

171
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.010
I think he's going to be out there and he's going to race for a different team.

172
00:09:57.011 --> 00:09:58.000
But here's the thing though,

173
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.150
those Mercedes cars were so fucking good that all they had to do was just get to

174
00:10:04.151 --> 00:10:06.640
the first turn. We, whoever won the first term, right?

175
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.370
One the Goddamn race had seen. So I'm going to guess,

176
00:10:09.371 --> 00:10:11.260
I'm going to guess he's going to go with the red bull team.

177
00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.810
Cause that was the only other team that seemed to fucking win anything this year

178
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.890
as far as the shit that I watched. But uh, Jesus Christ.

179
00:10:17.891 --> 00:10:21.760
So Nico's getting fucking trashed people like what the fuck?

180
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.300
Five reasons why you would quit. Um,

181
00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:30.430
Kiki Rosberg calls him a contracepting something key league. Niki Lauda.

182
00:10:30.431 --> 00:10:34.410
Sorry Kiki. Nikki clot. I'm like combining names here.

183
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:39.411
Slams Nico Rosberg for making Mercedes look dumb dude.

184
00:10:40.031 --> 00:10:42.490
In that last race with Lewis Hamilton,

185
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.800
slow down because if Nico Rosberg came in fourth place or worse,

186
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.750
Lewis would've won the championship.

187
00:10:49.751 --> 00:10:54.160
So he deliberately slowed the fuck down to let the third and fourth place guys

188
00:10:54.161 --> 00:10:56.560
catch up. And um,

189
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.940
and then he disobeyed a direct order from his fucking pit crew. This is,

190
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.610
I'm telling you, it's fucking top gun. You know, you do.

191
00:11:03.611 --> 00:11:06.070
Characters are going to top gun, right? And He,

192
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.480
they tell him to speed up and Louis was like, Nah, yeah, I'm good.

193
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.220
I can still win this race.

194
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.970
Let's just fucking add 40 years of stress to this fucking guy. Maybe he'll,

195
00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:19.050
he'll spin out now when, and I'm,

196
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:19.920
<v 1>yeah.</v>

197
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.620
<v 0>Rosberg's also talked about sometimes, you know when they're out on the track,</v>

198
00:11:22.621 --> 00:11:24.420
he doesn't know how far Lewis is going to go.

199
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:27.390
Is he going to push me off the track? But prospect's done the same shit.

200
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:28.740
He did that like twice.

201
00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:32.220
He has his fucking move where he goes into a turn and it's like go straight for

202
00:11:32.221 --> 00:11:35.850
way too long and then oops at the last second turns away and drive some guy into

203
00:11:35.851 --> 00:11:40.620
the gravel. Oh Geez. Belt. You don't know anything about this sport, do you? Um,

204
00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:42.480
<v 1>yeah,</v>

205
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.090
<v 0>I dunno. We'll see what the fuck happens. But that's my call.</v>

206
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:48.240
I think he's gonna stay home for a year with this kid. Right.

207
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.280
He's going to go out of his fucking mind.

208
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.500
As much as he's gonna love his kids much.

209
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:56.680
He's going to love wife the entire time that Kenny Loggins song is going to be

210
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:59.480
going on in the background. Well,

211
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:06.270
what did you do? Did do fucking substance up? Did do, but deputy,

212
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.290
but though

213
00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.540
<v 2>he been, I ain't in Bernie now.</v>

214
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.680
<v 0>Right. Um, what about John at JFK said,</v>

215
00:12:14.681 --> 00:12:16.900
and then the guy in the fucking pumps said, he said, I am a,

216
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:19.810
I am an egg or I'm a cookie or something. Yeah,

217
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:23.470
it's going to drive them up the fucking wall and he's going to have to go back

218
00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:25.270
out there again and uh, you know,

219
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.480
and then I think he's going to drive for the rest of his fucking career. Um,

220
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.540
that's my guess. All right. So there you go. There's a whole bunch of shit.

221
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.170
How often do you hear a bunch of Formula One talk on a fucking American podcast?

222
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.630
You know, not that I go fuck yourself. Hey, how about that Patriots Rams Game?

223
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.450
You know, that's tremendous. If anybody ever had trouble sleeping,

224
00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:47.530
that would have been a great game to fucking watch Jesus Christ.

225
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.090
I actually did. I actually watched the,

226
00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:52.480
you got to watch the game live with me on Facebook.

227
00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:56.140
It was something last second. We decided to try and all things comedy.

228
00:12:56.141 --> 00:13:01.120
So thank you for the 1500 people or so that tuned in and watched me watch the

229
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:03.600
game. I'm sure they'll put together some sort of clips from that.

230
00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.420
<v 3>Um, [inaudible]</v>

231
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:10.220
<v 0>so if you guys like it enough, if it gets enough hits, I might start doing that.</v>

232
00:13:10.221 --> 00:13:13.940
I want to do it for boring fucking games because if the game matters,

233
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:17.450
you're not gonna want to listen to me talking. But patriots first rams,

234
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:21.530
that's a good one. Right? And all I do is I just do the first half.

235
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:23.903
<v 3>Um,</v>

236
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.630
<v 0>so anyways, I might do it with Joe Bark, nick or somebody like that.</v>

237
00:13:26.631 --> 00:13:30.150
Maybe with Paul Versey at some point we'll figure it out. So anyways,

238
00:13:30.151 --> 00:13:34.940
so I have to go to this, um, memorial service. Um,

239
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.420
last night I was so proud of my friend that, you know,

240
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.760
I could really see what a great husband and father he was.

241
00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:42.490
So I already knew the suit that I was gonna wear. Cause you,

242
00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:45.160
when you get to my age, you know, it's fucking sucks man.

243
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:49.090
You start losing people and you have your funeral soon. You know,

244
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.340
for a lot of people it was,

245
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.790
I'm going to a wedding suit and then that big as you get older than they come.

246
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:58.660
So I'm going to a funeral. Fucking sucks. So, um,

247
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:02.860
you remember last year I got into the best shape of my fucking life and I went

248
00:14:02.861 --> 00:14:07.000
to put on the suit that I fucking bought during that time.

249
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.410
Jesus Christ,

250
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.450
I could barely get the pants on and I couldn't wear a tie to the event cause I

251
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:17.350
couldn't get the shirt closed and all I did, I put on like 15 fucking pounds.

252
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.030
It's like how skinny was I?

253
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.010
And I was just sitting there screaming at myself in the mirror. My mother, my,

254
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.680
uh, I know my mother always told me when I was, you know,

255
00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.130
she was always like fucking, I don't know,

256
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.820
she was always honest about not being fat fuck kids, which is hilarious to me.

257
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.680
Cause who wants a fat fuck for a kid? Right?

258
00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:41.330
So I'm sitting there screaming at myself in the mirror, right. And, uh,

259
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.130
my wife is just sitting there fucking laughing her ass off at me.

260
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.730
I would go look at you, love your fucking discuss me.

261
00:14:50.731 --> 00:14:55.100
Just just completely trashing myself cause that's how I get myself back into

262
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:57.320
shape. So, um,

263
00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:02.630
I remember I mentioned last podcast that I was going to do a half hour cardio

264
00:15:02.631 --> 00:15:06.860
every fucking day this month cause I'm not putting on the pigs in a blanket

265
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:11.240
fucking apple strudel. What's a good Christmas goose? What do you have?

266
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:14.180
What do you, what do people have? Chinese food. The Jewish people, right?

267
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.100
What's the shit that everybody fucking eats this month makes you a fat fuck?

268
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:24.080
All of this stuff. The pies, the cookies, the Christmas party, the bows,

269
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.830
all of that shit. You end up putting on all this fucking weight.

270
00:15:27.831 --> 00:15:29.750
Then what happens? Everybody joins a fucking gym.

271
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:35.300
Everybody joins the gym in January. Right? And it's just fucking mobbed.

272
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.620
Right?

273
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.650
And all you gotta do is just hang in there too about the second week of February

274
00:15:39.651 --> 00:15:44.120
and everybody just starts dropping off like the Bataan death march or some shit.

275
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:47.390
Right? That's such a fucked up reference.

276
00:15:47.391 --> 00:15:50.510
But I've been watching a lot of world war two shit probably even said it wrong.

277
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.680
They say baton, like what? Your twirl, the Bataan death march.

278
00:15:54.681 --> 00:15:59.360
It was a bunch of high school bands that had to walk to the prom that none of

279
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:03.770
them have dates to. Oh, you have to be that me and you know what?

280
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:08.630
I don't, but it's funny, isn't it? Isn't it?

281
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.970
Um, anyways, so you know, it's great.

282
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:14.930
Why don't you beat the fucking new person to the gym rush?

283
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:20.510
Why don't you do yourself a favor and not go into the new year, 1520,

284
00:16:20.511 --> 00:16:23.930
30, 40 50 pounds overweight. Let's say you knocked that numbered number.

285
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.790
What's that first number? Huh? Unless you're in triple digits, I,

286
00:16:28.791 --> 00:16:30.470
you know, I don't want to fucking give you to him, but if he,

287
00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:33.200
if he got a double digit figure you're trying to lose,

288
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:34.640
let's say you're 20 pounds overweight,

289
00:16:34.641 --> 00:16:37.970
why don't you try to get that two down to a one, you know,

290
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.820
get that 18 down to a fucking nine. Get that 20 down to a 10.

291
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:48.590
Just knock it down. Run some fucking miles off. You fucking Oh,

292
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:52.640
domino, right? Come on. Admit it. Good. Nobody's looking.

293
00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.370
Nobody's looking at cubicle. Reached out, reached down, grab, grab a handful.

294
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.240
I look at you, Huh? That's still, that's what you're gonna do.

295
00:16:59.241 --> 00:17:04.070
You're going to add to that Jesus Christ. Come on, say it with me.

296
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.500
I'm a fat cunt, right? Just say it. One, two, three.

297
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:11.900
I'm a fat cunt. All right?

298
00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.670
Then the first thing you got to do is, is,

299
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.810
is admitting it to yourself and you've lost control over so many of those

300
00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:22.730
fucking Christmas cookies. But let's be honest,

301
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.170
they don't really taste that good.

302
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:29.240
A lot of them are bad shortbread with some shitty frosting and some sprinkles on

303
00:17:29.241 --> 00:17:33.680
it, right? You don't need that shit. Right? Half Hour,

304
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.290
half hour every day. Make a God damn playlist.

305
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:41.810
You know what's funny is I've actually, because I'm so dreading doing cardio,

306
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.290
rather than listening to some testosterone aggressive shit,

307
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.920
like I actually was listening to like Paul Simon,

308
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:54.630
like my cardio thing starts off with something so right by Paul Simon,

309
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:58.470
which were you really listened to that song? I should look up the fucking I.

310
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.290
My Internet doesn't work down here. The fucking lyrics are really annoying.

311
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.660
He's like, when something goes wrong, I'm the first to admit it.

312
00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:07.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

313
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:12.320
<v 0>Um, the first two ed made it, but the last one to know, Whoa, whoa.</v>

314
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.720
Right. So He's already said like, you know, hey,

315
00:18:14.721 --> 00:18:17.960
if there's something wrong like I, I'm the first one to admit it.

316
00:18:17.961 --> 00:18:21.680
I just never know what that is. I don't know if it Yale,

317
00:18:21.681 --> 00:18:24.940
fuck you Paul Simon, you can't,

318
00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.030
I hate when people do that. You know what I mean? They just, they know,

319
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.810
they fucking say that they're an asshole and then they take no responsibility

320
00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:36.470
for it because hey man, I, I just don't, it's hard for me.

321
00:18:36.471 --> 00:18:41.090
It's just like hard for me to tell when I'm being a total selfish dose.

322
00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.760
Who? My Paul, you know that. Okay.

323
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:45.700
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

324
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.740
<v 0>If you could do a fucking sound check. Okay.</v>

325
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.410
And you can hear that the horns are too far down in the mix.

326
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.890
You can't tell me that you can't be in a car with somebody else and not hear

327
00:18:53.891 --> 00:18:57.100
that you're being a fucking asshole, you know?

328
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.020
And then the rest of it is when something goes right. Oh,

329
00:19:02.021 --> 00:19:06.870
it's like you lose me. It's apt to confuse me. Like he's just like, oh,

330
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.930
let's all stop and help Paul Simon. You know,

331
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:14.650
that's why he married Daddy. But cal, I'm telling Ya. You know what I mean?

332
00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.770
No fucking broad. His Age was going to put up with his horse shit.

333
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.780
He had a g etic find some young chick that was still fucking wide. I, you know,

334
00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:23.830
slightly confused.

335
00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.390
<v 4>Here's what I am is what was your Warren? What were your right?</v>

336
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.650
<v 0>She didn't know what the fuck she don't know which way was up. Right.</v>

337
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.320
God Damn oversized sweater walking, walking around.

338
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.460
He fucking shows up. Like, you know, I mean, have you, if something goes wrong,

339
00:19:39.461 --> 00:19:42.940
I'm the first to admit it. But yeah, I never seem to know.

340
00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.440
I'm like the last guy to know. Paul, you're a nice person.

341
00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.390
I like see, you know, he's behind her just banging away.

342
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:56.410
It's fucking to pay. Slap it off the back of his head. Right.

343
00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.830
That's how the whole fucking thing went down. And in the meantime,

344
00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:03.760
he killing the new Bohemians, right? That you know, for a pop band.

345
00:20:03.761 --> 00:20:08.670
I mean those guys could play. Greg Guitars did a great fucking drummer.

346
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.490
And what happened? Fuck it.

347
00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:16.320
Paul Simon comes up with this hat and hand showing up. You know Paul Simon got,

348
00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.940
he got hair plugs right after.

349
00:20:17.941 --> 00:20:22.860
I think Elton John and Elton John got the original ones. So like, you know,

350
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.160
his head was so scarred up. That's why when he was real cooked up in the 80s,

351
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.290
he was wearing like those mannequin wigs because I don't,

352
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.030
I know what I'm talking about. I think that was I at the grocery store in red.

353
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:36.210
A few too many US magazines. Um,

354
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:38.290
<v 1>yeah.</v>

355
00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.480
<v 0>And it's all, how the fuck that again. Oh, we're talking about working out.</v>

356
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.330
Okay. Maria,

357
00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.930
to talk about Paul Simon Edis fucking relationship I think overstepped a few

358
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:52.090
here, especially during this holiday month. So I apologize. All right,

359
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.320
so I start with that, then I go into one trick pony.

360
00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.010
Then I go 50 ways to, to a,

361
00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:04.000
to leave you a lama with Steve Gadd on drums.

362
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.030
Um, oh by the way, he's coming to town with the fucking Eric Clapton.

363
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.780
Somebody offered me a fucking ticket and I forgot to get back to him.

364
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:17.260
I gotta say I've seen Steve Gadd lied before, but I never saw a Eric Clapton.

365
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.960
But anyways, it goes to that and then I go on, I listened to a,

366
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:24.773
<v 3>yeah.</v>

367
00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.130
<v 0>Oh, what the fuck do I live to do a couple of pretenders songs?</v>

368
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.810
Then I get into Aerosmith's first fucking album and then I'm done.

369
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.170
Right. Just like that. I eased my way.

370
00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:40.760
He is my way, you know, we start off really easy.

371
00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:45.290
Then I get to mid range and then I just get to our Smith's first fucking want.

372
00:21:45.291 --> 00:21:48.110
That's what I did because what I was doing before I was,

373
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.440
I was like regretting, like not regretting,

374
00:21:51.441 --> 00:21:56.120
hating doing cardio and I was starting off with like fucking iron maiden or Dr

375
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.450
feel good. Do you know what I mean? Like that's not like if you're,

376
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.190
if you just waking up and you're getting on a fucking elliptical, it's all here.

377
00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.393
<v 2>Oh, is that the band?</v>

378
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.280
<v 0>Just like Jesus, Vince, Vince for fuck sakes.</v>

379
00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:13.160
<v 3>Okay.</v>

380
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.310
<v 0>Well, he's got, at least I could start with home sweet home. Right.</v>

381
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.070
And He'd know I'm a dreamer. Um,

382
00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.920
you know, I just realized we have company upstairs.

383
00:22:21.921 --> 00:22:24.470
Once I put the headphones on, I don't even fucking realize I don't give a shit.

384
00:22:24.471 --> 00:22:27.590
So I was listening to that and like Iron Baden, you know,

385
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.390
it's just like creeps you out.

386
00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:32.900
Like you fucking getting on an elliptical half groggy.

387
00:22:32.901 --> 00:22:36.200
Cause I gotta go into work and Shit. Right. Starting your day off.

388
00:22:36.201 --> 00:22:40.190
We want information, information,

389
00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:45.980
information away. The new number two was number one.

390
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.200
You are number six, right? How about Vincent Price? I'll fucking work.

391
00:22:51.201 --> 00:22:56.190
He got in the early eighties, man. He was fucking crushing it. Huh? Whoa.

392
00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:00.530
Do you o F and c for the Devil's sends?

393
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:05.540
The beef was rad because he knows that diamond shot let him a lot understanding

394
00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:08.880
record the number of the beast. 40 is a human number.

395
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:14.450
It's number is 666 a puppet to Baba two [inaudible] right.

396
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.020
He gets he and then he was on fucking Michael Jackson's thriller, right?

397
00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.520
Yeah. No fucking crazy laugh in the end.

398
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.690
I can't remember the funk of 40,000 years.

399
00:23:27.691 --> 00:23:29.280
I never really listened to Michael Jackson.

400
00:23:29.281 --> 00:23:32.310
Like I was one of those people had way to like pretend to be sad when he died.

401
00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.163
You know what I mean?

402
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.640
<v 2>I'm looking back to bed in the mirror, you know,</v>

403
00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:40.660
share more data.

404
00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.490
<v 0>Right. It just never spoke to me. I like shit when he was a kid.</v>

405
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:48.150
<v 3>Okay.</v>

406
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:51.720
<v 0>Oh baby. Give me more and more chance. I liked right up to off the wall,</v>

407
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.440
uh, somewhere. Uh, I dunno.

408
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:56.583
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

409
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:02.540
<v 0>I guess I liked some, I liked some of, uh, like Billy Jean was okay.</v>

410
00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.030
Thrill I thought was stupid. You know, you know, it's actually thrill.

411
00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.850
It isn't stupid. You know what it is. It's fucking, whenever it comes on,

412
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.630
everybody has to start doing the thriller dance and they always start with the

413
00:24:14.631 --> 00:24:17.510
same thing where it's the claws up in the air on either side.

414
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.230
Always, always there.

415
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.730
Always somebody doing a fucking Michael Jackson impression, you know?

416
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.450
You know what's interesting about that guy is great as he wants the balls and

417
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:31.670
Pete to critique this man is like, he was one of those guys,

418
00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:36.671
he had the sickest fucking dance moves and then he just stopped and he kept put

419
00:24:37.941 --> 00:24:42.350
the loafers and he kept doing the leg thing and he kept rubbing his dick and

420
00:24:42.351 --> 00:24:45.650
then everybody kind of caught up and went past him.

421
00:24:45.651 --> 00:24:49.040
Even though he was still always the greatest dancer of all time. He, she was,

422
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.110
it was like he was doing the Charleston, his whole,

423
00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:55.940
his whole fucking life bad to get through. He comes the Moonwalk,

424
00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:01.280
right. Somebody can't even remotely fucking debts. Um,

425
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:05.720
oh, the fucking balls I'm showing on this podcast. Oh, let's keep going.

426
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:10.970
What other fucking legend can we keep? Can we trash next? Um, yeah.

427
00:25:10.971 --> 00:25:14.810
I never got into a, I never get in. Like when they almost,

428
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:17.930
it was always like Prince First Michael Jackson. Like to me it was,

429
00:25:17.931 --> 00:25:21.530
it was always prints. It wasn't even clothes.

430
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.150
And um,

431
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.713
<v 3>I don't know.</v>

432
00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.440
<v 0>Prince is funny because his bad songs always sound like songs that Molly</v>

433
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.960
Ringwald would have danced around to win like 16 candles.

434
00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:35.293
<v 3>Okay.</v>

435
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.910
<v 0>Like he's got a couple of those. We just like Jesus.</v>

436
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:43.280
I guess everybody's got those right and if he has one of those, Geez, Bill,

437
00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:47.360
can you trash anymore? Dead Geniuses? Yeah, I can.

438
00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.590
Let's go. Let's start talk.

439
00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:52.700
Let's talk about Mark Twain and fucking Albert Einstein.

440
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.870
Is it me or do they both have this same fucking pipe?

441
00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.780
What was it about being a genius back then or someone who was changing the way

442
00:26:02.781 --> 00:26:06.080
people were thinking that you just, you had to have that fucking,

443
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:09.110
that same fucking do it with Sammy,

444
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:15.530
the Sammy Hagar and Van Halen. Fucking do. Except it was white. Right?

445
00:26:15.531 --> 00:26:20.531
Mark Twain had it a fucking a Albert Einstein had it.

446
00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.860
Frederick Douglas had that with that fucking itchy Baird.

447
00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:30.170
Everybody had that when you fucking are just too goddamn smart.

448
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.310
You know what I mean? Like shit and I don't know.

449
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.320
You just got too much shit to think about.

450
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.770
There's something about that hairdo that just, it's just the perfect thing.

451
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:41.770
I bet. Sam looks back. I was like, why did, why did I cut my hair?

452
00:26:41.771 --> 00:26:46.500
Like that was phenol. The haircut he got was like when he was younger,

453
00:26:46.501 --> 00:26:49.230
when he had the longer hair. That's like the chick you marry.

454
00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.380
And then like after she has a couple of kids and she just,

455
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:53.940
I just don't want to deal with it anymore.

456
00:26:53.941 --> 00:26:57.180
He got like literally got that fucking hair cut, you know,

457
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.430
just short of, um, I, you said that you, you know,

458
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.510
are you moving towards an alternative lifestyle here?

459
00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:09.630
Like what is going on with that thing? That was just a bad fucking period, Huh?

460
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.970
They were wearing those, those peach fucking flashdance fucking overalls.

461
00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.720
<v 3>Um, I dunno. All right.</v>

462
00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:20.910
<v 0>Sammy Hagar.</v>

463
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:25.110
I think San Diego would have been better if he didn't join van Halen. Oh,

464
00:27:25.111 --> 00:27:28.920
I'm going after. I'm fucking, I'm talking about everybody this week.

465
00:27:28.921 --> 00:27:29.850
I don't know what I'm doing here.

466
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.850
I think I'm going for fucking a reality show right now.

467
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.830
UV that song heavy metal by Sammy Hagar.

468
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.060
I liked that better. And you watch him performing with his own fucking,

469
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:43.610
I'm gonna fucking tweet that out.

470
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:44.803
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

471
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.230
<v 0>I'm going to tweet that fucking video this week. You know what I mean?</v>

472
00:27:48.231 --> 00:27:51.440
You tell me that. Anything he did van Halen, not trash van Halen.

473
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.610
Cause I fucking love those guys.

474
00:27:52.611 --> 00:27:56.180
But I'm just saying Sammy should've jumped in there. He should've kept going.

475
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:59.540
He was on a path. The man could not drive.

476
00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:02.180
<v 3>All right.</v>

477
00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.170
<v 0>Tall [inaudible] heavy metal. Right. He was fucking great.</v>

478
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.330
I don't know what happened then all of a sudden

479
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.290
<v 1>I get that</v>

480
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:19.130
<v 0>right. I don't know what happened. I fucking voice is cracking. All right.</v>

481
00:28:19.131 --> 00:28:22.610
I think I've trashed enough people that are way, way,

482
00:28:22.611 --> 00:28:26.090
way more talented than I'll ever be. So now it's time.

483
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:30.740
Now it's time to say goodbye to all you fucking counties.

484
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.280
I gotta I gotta read a little bit of advertising. Oh, and there's a lot that,

485
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.850
oh, a lot this week. Everybody piling on trying to get your holiday money,

486
00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:42.290
trying to get that holiday money. Oh look who's back.

487
00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:47.030
Look who's back. Always nosing around during the holidays, right?

488
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:51.290
Oh See, oh, Sherry's berries. Oh,

489
00:28:51.291 --> 00:28:54.770
these things are fucking delicious. No matter who you're shopping for.

490
00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.120
Sherry's berries is the one stop shop for everyone on your list.

491
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.890
No matter who you're shopping for. Sherry's berries is the one stop shop.

492
00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:04.970
I read that twice.

493
00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:09.590
You don't have to battle the crowds to get the perfect gift shop with

494
00:29:09.591 --> 00:29:14.360
convenience right from your home Christmas. Um,

496
00:29:17.511 --> 00:29:20.060
Christmas is only 20 days away, man.

497
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:26.490
So that's a, it's owning also. I already did the days you can't. All right.

498
00:29:26.491 --> 00:29:30.600
What do you want to hear? They okay? It's, it's three weeks and four days away.

499
00:29:30.601 --> 00:29:34.710
That's 25 days left to shop. Rapid. Deliver your gifts.

500
00:29:34.711 --> 00:29:37.920
Choose a gift from Sherry's Barry's incredible collection of gifts.

501
00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.070
And Go ahead and skip the crowds in the hassle altogether. Who to fuck it?

502

Somebody chocolate strawberries for Christmas.

503
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:49.600
The the don't get these for your wife unless you've got a nice fucking backup,

504
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.820
unless you put that on the hood of a fucking Toyota.

505
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:55.650
Cressida why I picked that one? I don't know. Um,

506
00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.280
this is the perfect gift for someone that you have to acknowledge that you're in

507
00:30:00.281 --> 00:30:04.360
your life, but you don't have time to shop for them or spend any fucking money.

508
00:30:04.361 --> 00:30:08.770
Let's get down to brass tacks or this is a great accrued for mom for a really

509
00:30:08.771 --> 00:30:12.520
great gift, okay? And it's fucking easily as easy as hell.

510
00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:14.050
What are Sherry's berries?

511
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.790
They're freshly dip strawberries from Sherry's berries started just 1999 that's

512
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:21.280
over 30%. So it's a round a fucking drinks.

513
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.990
Unless you're in a shit hole that's over 30% savings or double the berries for

514
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:28.750
just $10 more. You can double them. 30 bucks.

515
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.060
You get twice as many berries.

516
00:30:31.061 --> 00:30:33.130
They still haven't told me how many fucking berries I get.

517
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.520
You just need my code to take advantage of this deal.

518
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:40.240
Can I get Barry Manilow to sing in the background for Sherry's berries? Right?

519
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.310
I ate strawberries there.

520
00:30:42.311 --> 00:30:46.210
Make the whole world sing descriptive words for berries.

521
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:51.400
Evidently I'm supposed to use these words. These strawberries are decadent,

522
00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.100
fresh, juicy, sweet. I hate that word. Decadent.

523
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:56.710
It's always used by dumb people to describe something,

524
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.810
you know is a decadent like fucking something that's like ornate.

525
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.740
Another word I never fucking use. They really use decadent to disk. Oh,

526
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:10.480
have you tried these chocolate covered pretzels now? Are they any good?

527
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.450
Any good dude? They're decadent.

528
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:17.740
Alright, there you go. That's your challenge.

529
00:31:17.741 --> 00:31:21.010
This weekend I want you to go to a dive bar and I want you to you,

530
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:25.840

Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day.

598
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:04.730
And uh,

599
00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:09.050
and the home security industry wants you to believe it's your only option, man.

600
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.160
They got hoods of salesmen out there trying to scare the fuck out he into

601
00:35:13.161 --> 00:35:16.070
signing one of those longterm contracts. You don't need that shit.

602
00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:20.060
You get stuck writing huge checks month after month with no way out.

603
00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:22.910
It's a robbery by contract and it can cost you a thousand,

604
00:35:22.911 --> 00:35:26.660
but there's a better way to protect your home. Simply safe home security.

607
00:35:34.521 --> 00:35:36.650
I don't know who that could have been.

608
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:38.490
Somebody at the company that didn't say who said it,

609
00:35:38.491 --> 00:35:41.940
they just put quotes around it. A security professionals watching,

610
00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:45.540
ready to instantly send the police. And it's just 1499 per month.

611
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.690
That's less than half of what most companies charge.

612
00:35:48.691 --> 00:35:51.180
Protect your home the smart way. Why do they make peeping toms?

613
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:53.760
Just get into security. Then you kill two birds with one stone.

614
00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:56.670
You know what I mean? They get to look in and they get their little heart on.

615
00:35:56.671 --> 00:36:00.480
They rub it out into their fucking awful fucking security guard pants,

616
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.020
but they're also making sure that no one comes in the house. Right?

617
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.770

let's get to some of the questions here for this week. Hey,

624
00:36:29.851 --> 00:36:32.280
did you guys see over in England there? They got the fucking

625
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:34.090
<v 1>okay.</v>

626
00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:37.180
<v 0>They got some shit that we would even make Snowden go. God Damn,</v>

627
00:36:37.181 --> 00:36:38.170
I didn't even think of that.

628
00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.750
They got some stupid thing over there where they just going to everybody,

629
00:36:40.751 --> 00:36:44.230
anything you do on your phone or on the internet or anything like that,

630
00:36:44.231 --> 00:36:46.270
any of that shit, they can just look at it.

631
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:49.360
It's fucking unbelievable.

632
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:50.810
<v 1>Okay.</v>

633
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:53.480
<v 0>It's unbelievable. Pope presidential election goes by.</v>

634
00:36:53.481 --> 00:36:57.050
They never talk about any of that shit. Why the fuck do you think that is? Oh,

635
00:36:57.051 --> 00:36:58.460
fucking Obama, right?

636
00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.510
He was in office when all that Snowden Shit went through the big fucking

637
00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:05.540
liberal. All you pussies who cried when Hillary didn't get in.

638
00:37:05.541 --> 00:37:10.210
You see what the fuck happened when Obama was in? Yeah.

639
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:13.310
Bunch of baby scuffs. So disappointed. Anyways, let's,

640
00:37:13.311 --> 00:37:16.070
let's read some fucking shit here. Here we go. Advice on the future.

641
00:37:16.071 --> 00:37:19.520
Dear Bill Murphy [inaudible] first of all, congrats on the kid. New,

642
00:37:19.521 --> 00:37:21.050
special Yada Yada. Thank you.

643
00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:24.830
I'm an 18 year old guy out of high school and need, need career advice.

644
00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:29.180
I graduated with honors. Good for you. Straight A's, Jesus and all that crap.

645
00:37:29.181 --> 00:37:33.380
But I currently don't attend college and I'm working some shit job in a pasta

646
00:37:33.381 --> 00:37:38.030
factory. Sounds like you're burned out on the academics there. Um,

647
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.210
he's, oh, he said this is because what I really want to do

648
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.540
is sing parentheses classical shit,

649
00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:50.190
take piano lessons and be happy. My dream isn't to be famous or anything,

650
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:54.600
but I love music and want to pursue it. Problem is I have zero background,

651
00:37:54.601 --> 00:37:57.330
can't sing, can't play anything. Literally zero.

652
00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.730
There's a great place nearby where I,

653
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.660
I lived that gives vocal and piano lessons and all I want to do is start

654
00:38:04.661 --> 00:38:06.130
training my voice to start playing,

655
00:38:06.131 --> 00:38:09.070
but I feel like there's no point because I have no experience.

656
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.560
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

657
00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.600
<v 0>Jesus Christ. Dude, you know what it is. You're one of these people,</v>

658
00:38:12.601 --> 00:38:16.200
you get straight A's, you're an overachiever and you're so God damn smart.

659
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:18.150
Every time you come up with the option,

660
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:22.020
you know when the f the normal level of fear comes up,

661
00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.900
smarties like you can come up with like,

662
00:38:24.901 --> 00:38:26.880
rather than just 10 reasons not to do it,

663
00:38:26.881 --> 00:38:28.890
you'll come up with a thousand and you're, you're,

664
00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:33.060
you're paralyzed right now is what's going on. He said,

665
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:35.740
I spent my free, you're only 18 old dude.

666
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:42.580
You know, nobody has any experience till they till they start experiencing it.

667
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.850
You're already being way too hard on yourself. He goes, all right. He goes,

668
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:49.480
I spend my free time listening to countless covers of the same song,

669
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:54.070
watching videos on vocal exercises and fantasizing about being a singer one day.

670
00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.350
I feel I can really do it sometimes,

671
00:38:56.351 --> 00:39:01.240
but other times I feel like not even trying. Yeah. Yeah.

672
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:03.700
That's a, okay.

673
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.460
That first emotion where you feel like trying to do it,

674
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:09.790
you need to listen to that. That second one that talks you out of it.

675
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.640
You need to stop listening to that voice. You need to out loud.

676
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:15.100
Tell that voice to shut the fuck up. That's what I did.

677
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:19.840
I literally would talking to the, you gotta beat the fuck out of that voice.

678
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.570
That one that goes, Nah. Yeah, yeah, but what if this happened?

679
00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:28.840
Nobody's going to like me. Sit down and shut the fuck up. All right.

680
00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:33.820
I don't need you on this one. I need you. When I'm thinking about doing heroin,

681
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:37.390
then I need you going away. Well, if you get it [inaudible] you die.

682
00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:40.180
You make everybody cry yet. Yeah. Then I'll listen to you.

683
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.980
But not when you're going after a dream.

684
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.790
You don't listen to any of that negative shit because you'll talk yourself out

685
00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:49.600
of it. Um, anyways, I know you always preach about following your dream born.

686
00:39:49.601 --> 00:39:53.350
It actually comes to doing it. It's very scary. Of course it is. However,

687
00:39:53.351 --> 00:39:55.750
I don't want to be 40 years old and think, man,

688
00:39:55.751 --> 00:40:00.070
what if my 99 year old aunt always tells me to do what I want and forget about

689
00:40:00.071 --> 00:40:03.250
money, but my parents say that I need a real job. Well,

690
00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:07.040
who has more life experience? Your 99 year old aren't and what does she say?

691
00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:10.240
Huh? Your parents that too close to you, you know,

692
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:12.640
they're worried you're going to be homeless and all that shit.

693
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:13.540
So they're always going to say,

694
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:17.800
just get a fucking job so you can have enough money to put a roof over your head

695
00:40:17.801 --> 00:40:20.260
and eat a sandwich. That's, that's all they're thinking of.

696
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.060
Nobody dreams of that.

697
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.290
Nobody dreams about just having a roof over their head and eating a sandwich.

698
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.460
Unless you're, I don't know, unless you live in some fucking squallor. Right.

699
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:32.680
But even then after a while, once you had the roof over your head,

700
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:36.760
then you're going to at some point be like, I want to do something right.

701
00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:40.300
I don't know. Anyways, I've been in between for a year.

702
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:43.330
I've been in between for a year now and need help.

703
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.690
I don't want to get massively in debt for something I don't really want.

704
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:48.550
That is so fucking smart.

705
00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.880
All these poor kids coming out of fucking college,

706
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.640
hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt at this fucking point,

707
00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:57.190
or at least the high 10 thousands, you know,

708
00:40:57.250 --> 00:40:59.140
that's why you love being a fucking moron, you know?

709
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:02.980
Cause then your community college doesn't cause shit. You work at Dunkin donuts,

710
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.490
throw a couple of coffees at people and all of a sudden you got money for your

711
00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:07.330
next semester.

712
00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:11.440
I'm maybe pursuing music will open doors to majoring in music in the future.

713
00:41:11.441 --> 00:41:15.400
I Dunno. What should I do? You Pale Bitch. Ah,

714
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:19.150
ps give clearly a head scratch for me. Pitbulls are awesome. Um,

715
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.930
and he says Asian need advice from bill birth. Oh, that's the next person.

716
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:28.150
Is that it? Oh, all right. Yeah. You know what's fucked up? I was going to say,

717
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.490
Oh, you're Asian dude. You're going to crush the piano.

718
00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.440
That's one of those stereotypes that I guess is racist,

719
00:41:33.441 --> 00:41:36.170
but it's like positive racism. You know what I mean?

720
00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.450
Don't take up the cello.

721
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.680
You'll be playing for your fucking major cities philharmonic.

722
00:41:44.130 --> 00:41:46.120
All right? This is what I would do. Uh,

723
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:51.140
I would just start taking lessons immediately. I would sign up immediately.

724
00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:54.800
I would not listen to the rest of this podcast. Hit Stop,

725
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:58.910
walk over to the phone, call the number and get a lesson as soon as you can.

726
00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.980
Go to the lesson. Okay? And then keep going and,

727
00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:08.030
and just see what that feels like. Don't stop BAFTA one. It'd be like, well,

728
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.730
I only went to one. I can't even play chopstick yet. Fuck this. Fuck that voice.

729
00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:16.270
Keep going. All right. Just say,

730
00:42:16.271 --> 00:42:19.750
I'm going to stick with this for three months. All right?

731
00:42:19.751 --> 00:42:21.610
That's the big thing with it. With anything,

732
00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.270
you gotta stick with it for three months and really work at it. Working out,

733
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:28.990
learning an instrument, learning a language. God knows I always end up quitting.

734
00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.340
I can't even get fucking a hundred days together. Um,

735
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:38.530
just stick with it and see how you feel after three months.

736
00:42:38.531 --> 00:42:41.230
If you feel like this isn't for me, you're not going to have that. Well,

737
00:42:41.231 --> 00:42:45.730
what if, what if? Bullshit because you tried it so this isn't,

738
00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:50.940
you're not making a decision that's going to affect the rest of your life.

739
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:53.590
Don't look at it like that. You just looking at the next three months,

740
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:55.840
the next three months are going to happen.

741
00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.700
Do you want to after 90 days still be sitting there going,

742
00:43:00.701 --> 00:43:02.800
I have no experience. I don't know what to do.

743
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:06.490
Working in a pasta place and you want to be in this fucking pasta place and you

744
00:43:06.491 --> 00:43:10.010
know how to play a couple of songs. Dude, you be fucking excited man. A few.

745
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.490
If you actually, if this is what you really want to do,

746
00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.080
you'll be at work thinking about it.

747
00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:17.280
Can't wait to get home and play the fucking piano or,

748
00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:22.120
or try my singing some songs or whatever. And then once you get that,

749
00:43:22.121 --> 00:43:27.010
then that gets in your DNA and when you have stuff to look forward to in life,

750
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.260
all of a sudden shit that you don't look forward to,

751
00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:33.880
you start looking at it like, why the fuck am I doing this? The sucks.

752
00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:36.220
You know, I don't want to do this.

753
00:43:36.221 --> 00:43:39.520
And then that gets you out of that and you start going down a path of what the

754
00:43:39.521 --> 00:43:40.570
fuck you want to do.

755
00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:46.300
Then the other side of that is then your whole fucking life is nothing but fun

756
00:43:46.301 --> 00:43:49.420
shit. Then when you actually have to do shit that you don't want to do,

757
00:43:49.421 --> 00:43:52.990
like go down to the fucking DMV and find the title for your Goddamn Prius,

758
00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:56.690
right? Then you can be a big fucking baby about it. So there, there,

759
00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.140
there's always a price to pay. But dude, that's what I would do. I would,

760
00:43:59.141 --> 00:44:03.400
I would stop listening right now and sign up for those lessons and go in there

761
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.940
and just tell your teacher, so this is something I've always wanted to do.

762
00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:08.310
I'm just nervous about it.

763
00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.250
Just fucking just say what you said to me and they'll be like, hi. All right,

764
00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.880
well let's, let's get you on that dude. You'd be fucking playing piano,

765
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:21.210
Bob. How easy it is to make a change in your life.

766
00:44:21.211 --> 00:44:23.340
Just fucking pick up the phone,

767
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:27.870
say what you want to do and then when it's time you show up and you do it and

768
00:44:27.871 --> 00:44:31.800
then you're doing it. You know, you just got to get around all those blocks.

769
00:44:31.801 --> 00:44:35.550
So a, I hope you listen to me, man, cause you're only 18 years old,

770
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:38.880
so it's not like you have 50, 60, and even then,

771
00:44:38.881 --> 00:44:41.910
I would still tell you to do it because who gives a fuck whether you get

772
00:44:41.911 --> 00:44:45.720
anywhere with it. But if you want to do that, you know, you should do it.

773
00:44:46.460 --> 00:44:49.110
All right. That's it for that. Okay.

774
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.320
Asia needs advice from Bill Burke. Bill,

775
00:44:52.321 --> 00:44:56.760
I love your podcast and you really awesome. Um, Asian male, uh,

776
00:44:56.790 --> 00:45:00.570
Chinese with squinty fucking eyes and can't drive for shit. Dude. You know,

777
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:05.250
kind of shit on yourself. Um, anyways, I need your advice.

778
00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:10.050
I came to America, I guess I always do. I'm a Paul pasty con. Um, anyways,

779
00:45:10.051 --> 00:45:14.130
I need your advice. I came to America a year ago and I really love tall,

780
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:17.880
slim Irish German girls with red hair. Jesus Christ.

781
00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:21.780
I just missed, I just missed be in your fucking dreamboat.

782
00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:26.550
I think they're beautiful. I'm a tall Liam. A blonde is beautiful too.

783
00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:30.450
Never seen such beauty where I'm from. Holy Moly.

784
00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:35.400
The problem is I'm not like tall and confident like white guys and I live in

785
00:45:35.401 --> 00:45:39.870
Texas. Jesus Christ. Dude, this is a fucking reality show waiting to happen.

786
00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:45.570
I tried to ask this redhead at the gym out and she won't take me seriously.

787
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.430
All right. Time the fuck out.

788
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:52.980
Dude hat off to you for the fucking balls you got.

789
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:56.880
You came here from China. You've learned the fucking language, right?

790
00:45:57.060 --> 00:46:00.690
You're in Texas, you're at the gym. You're talking shit right.

791
00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:05.040
Gives a fuck. You went up to the plate. You didn't get on base.

792
00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:08.640
Who gives a shit? Talk to another red head. Talk to a blonde,

793
00:46:08.641 --> 00:46:11.010
talk to whatever the fuck you want to keep talking to them. Say,

794
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:16.020
what do I need to do to data redhead? Now Jesus Christ.

795
00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:18.210
Wait, because I'm a red head, like I know,

796
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:20.100
like there's some secret fucking handshake.

797
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:24.600
He said they want me to be their Asian friend, but I really want to marry him,

798
00:46:24.601 --> 00:46:28.110
Bang them, and have cute kids. This driving me nuts. I mean,

799
00:46:28.111 --> 00:46:29.610
am I going against nature?

800
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.840
Is an Asian guy dating white girls frowned upon and not accepted in America?

801
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.800
Thanks in advance. I don't really cuss that much and don't mean to offend you,

802
00:46:38.430 --> 00:46:43.170
but uh, wanting to talk and act like you Jimmy Chow out.

803
00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.610
Um, yeah. Okay.

804
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.660
His is Asian guys dating white guys found upon like everything is frowned upon

805
00:46:51.661 --> 00:46:53.550
in every fucking country. Generally speaking,

806
00:46:53.551 --> 00:46:57.150
people are afraid of anything fucking new. Who gives a shit?

807
00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:00.780
Literally like that guy before me who said he wanted to play piano,

808
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:04.980
if he told somebody he wanted to do that, you know? Um,

809
00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.640
I think initially people be encouraging or whatever. They'll always be,

810
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:10.470
there's always gonna be people telling you not to do shit.

811
00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:15.630
Is this what you want to do sir? Yes. Then I would go out and do it. All right.

812
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.830
So it sounds like to me from your email that you've, uh,

813
00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.720
you know, I don't know. It's like, it's like you just got into the majors. Okay.

814
00:47:24.721 --> 00:47:27.030
It's the first week. You haven't gotten your first hit yet.

815
00:47:27.810 --> 00:47:29.980
What are you going to do? You're just going to baseball.

816
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.170
Go back down to the miners. Fuck dead. Keep,

817
00:47:32.171 --> 00:47:36.280
I would keep talking every time you hit on a woman, you get better at it.

818
00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.370
All right. And I would just, I would just continue,

819
00:47:39.371 --> 00:47:42.610
like you're doing everything you need to do. You go into the gym,

820
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:47.020
you stay in shape and you're talking shit. I mean, I don't, I don't,

821
00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:51.100
I don't see anything wrong with your game plan other than, you know,

822
00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:55.750
it hasn't happened for you yet. And um, this is something, uh,

823
00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.920
you know, it's going to take a minute. You know,

824
00:47:59.921 --> 00:48:02.680
if you can just walk up and talk to some chicken at the gym and get laid,

825
00:48:02.681 --> 00:48:04.690
I mean, then everybody would be fucking doing it.

826
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:10.210
The reason why most people don't do it is because they know that 99.9% of the

827
00:48:10.211 --> 00:48:13.570
time you're going to get the fucking Heisman. A Z easy.

828
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:17.230
This is my elliptical over here. This is your elliptical over there, right?

829
00:48:17.410 --> 00:48:20.200
Fuck off. Right? And for all the women, they're going like,

830
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:24.730
can you just like not hit on us at the gym? Can you just fucking not,

831
00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:28.240
can I just have this fucking place? Hey, they make gyms for that.

832
00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:31.600
They make the all ladies fucking gems. All right,

833
00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:35.620
the fuck you going to go? They're working out looking good.

834
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:37.810
And then you're upset that the guy's coming up and hitting on you

835
00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.790
some day ladies, some days they're not gonna want to talk to you.

836
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:46.990
Take it from somebody, okay? Who? The women, they don't even,

837
00:48:46.991 --> 00:48:51.300
they don't even like, you don't even like register.

838
00:48:52.290 --> 00:48:52.630
<v 3>Okay?</v>

839
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:54.760
<v 0>Like I'm, I'm like, I'm a fuck. I'm a sir.</v>

840
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:59.860
I became a sir or mister like fucking 15 years ago and it's all

841
00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:05.020
alright. Okay. Boyfriend's obsessed with video games.

842
00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:07.360
Now I know somebody in seminary mill fucking,

843
00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:09.970
they're gonna talk about some borderline sexual assaulting. Obviously,

844
00:49:09.971 --> 00:49:10.960
that's not what I'm talking about.

845
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:15.400
I'm just talking about a little playful flirtation of someone who wants to fuck

846
00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.400
you. Boyfriend's obsessed with video games.

847
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:22.000
How far into this podcast am I? All right,

848
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:24.910
this one's going to be a little bit short. I usually go a little over an hour,

849
00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:27.780
but, uh, that's what I'm going to have to stop today cause uh,

850
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:32.230
I get to go into fucking why gotta go to [inaudible]. Um,

851
00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.530
boyfriend's obsessed with video games. Hey Buffalo Bill.

852
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:40.600
I love your podcast and I'm a huge fan by boyfriend and I love a both.

853
00:49:40.601 --> 00:49:44.470
Love to listen to your rants about whatever bullshit comes to mind. Uh,

854
00:49:44.471 --> 00:49:48.760
I myself have add and can find myself rambling about something completely

855
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:52.540
different than whatever it was I started to ramble about. Anyway.

856
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:56.230
My boyfriend has always been a huge fan of video games and he can play them all

857
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.580
day if he could. Uh,

858
00:49:57.581 --> 00:50:01.930
more recently he has been obsessed with one game in particular for the last

859
00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:05.050
eight plus months and it's really put a strain on our relationship.

860
00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:09.790
He will turn on his x-box from the second he gets home until about four hours

861
00:50:09.791 --> 00:50:13.090
before he has worked the next morning. Jesus.

862
00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:16.750
So we pretty much spend no time together and lets them,

863
00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.210
unless it's me watching him play with his friends,

864
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.970
he talks to his friends while he plays online,

865
00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:25.330
in which case even if I do say something to him,

866
00:50:25.331 --> 00:50:27.530
he either doesn't hear me or just ignores me.

867
00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:31.820
I've tried talking to him about it and he refuses to change or compromise.

868
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:34.110
It's even started to affect our sex life.

869
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:37.640
I imagine it would because he has no time for sexy time.

870
00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:41.510
We are both still young and in our late twenties and I hate that I'm practically

871
00:50:41.511 --> 00:50:43.040
begging him to turn off the game.

872
00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:47.660
Sweden canoodling the sheets I've been contemplating just breaking off our

873
00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:52.430
relationship of five plus years because it's been this way for months and it has

874
00:50:52.431 --> 00:50:56.870
only gotten worse. I'd love to hear what the Wise Nir has to say as well.

875
00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:01.400
Thanks for all the good laughs and congratulations on both of use on the new

876
00:51:01.401 --> 00:51:05.840
baby birth. Thank you. Um, unfortunately Nias not here.

877
00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:10.400
Let me see if I can get her, hold on one second. Okay.

878
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:12.980
She's on her way down. Um, I would say first of all,

879
00:51:12.981 --> 00:51:17.330
you've been together for five plus years. Um,

880
00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:21.160
initially my first thought when you were doing this is what I would do if, if,

881
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:25.870
what would get make me pay attention is I would just start going out with your

882
00:51:25.871 --> 00:51:30.130
friends and just start wearing fucking sexy outfits and shit.

883
00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:32.080
And he'll get the message immediately.

884
00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:37.300
If you walk out the door looking good and he's sitting there fucking playing

885
00:51:37.301 --> 00:51:41.680
video games and stuff and he, if he doesn't get that hint, then yeah,

886
00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.890
you gotta be thinking like, well, what the f this guy is just,

887
00:51:44.891 --> 00:51:47.730
this guy's more interested in this shit than that.

888
00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:52.300
What I'm doing over here with my fucking Christmas leggings going out to a

889
00:51:52.301 --> 00:51:55.170
Christmas party dress like a fucking hot piece edge.

890
00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.130
[inaudible] that's what the fuck I would do.

891
00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.340
You've already tried to talk to them. Um, I gotta be honest with you.

892
00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:02.790
I understand people becoming obsessed with video games.

893
00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:05.760
It's why I don't play them. But to me this, I, I'm a,

894
00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:09.970
I'm a bit of a cunt when it comes to video games. To me that's a child activity.

895
00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:14.440
You know what I mean? It's like what is this person working towards?

896
00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:18.430
What do they have for a fucking job that come home from their job and they just

897
00:52:18.431 --> 00:52:22.600
play a video game for the whole fucking rest of the day does not sound like a

898
00:52:22.601 --> 00:52:26.590
driven man. Um, that's another fucking red flag.

899
00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:31.030
Um, so that's what I would, I would just start building a life.

900
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:36.970
Initially I would start building a life without him to see if he notices and

901
00:52:36.971 --> 00:52:40.630
maybe you guys can get back to where you were or if he doesn't notice,

902
00:52:40.631 --> 00:52:43.720
then you already have a head start on getting the fuck away from this guy.

903
00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:49.000
So the lovely Nia is here. I'm going to hit pause a letter. Read this email, um,

904
00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:50.350
or Nia want, if you just want to,

905
00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:54.520
if you could just read this while I continue to ramble here. Uh,

906
00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:59.230
it starts right here. My boyfriend's been a fan of the video games. Okay. Yada,

907
00:52:59.231 --> 00:53:02.560
Yada, Yada, knowledge shit. So that's, that's basically a,

908
00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:05.200
that's what I would do. And as I mentioned a long time ago,

909
00:53:05.201 --> 00:53:09.550
the last video game that I played was grand theft auto three,

910
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:13.930
and it literally consumed my life. I would be walking

911
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:15.320
<v 5>okay</v>

912
00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:18.650
<v 0>to the comedy clubs getting on a boat and I would be thinking about the game</v>

913
00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:21.890
when I wasn't even a, I wasn't even at home.

914
00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:26.400
I'd be waiting to go on stage thinking about, okay, you know,

915
00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:28.080
I'll finish this set and I'll go home and I'll,

916
00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.470
I'll use the cheats and I'll just go on a fucking rampage and all that shit.

917
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:35.790
And it just kind of took over my life. So here's the lovely Nia with her advice.

918
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:37.103
Oh,

919
00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:39.243
<v 6>um,</v>

920
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:44.970
<v 7>first of all, can I just say that this problem really sucks and um,</v>

921
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:49.740
it's really annoying and that you're both in your 20s and he's like addicted to

922
00:53:49.741 --> 00:53:52.260
playing video games. I'm sorry,

923
00:53:52.261 --> 00:53:56.580
but that's a lame ass and you need to move on. Seriously.

924
00:53:57.660 --> 00:54:00.240
Five years, five plus years.

925
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:04.020
It's been this way for months and it's only gotten worse. Yeah.

926
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:08.940
You said you tried to talk to him about and he refuses to change or compromise?

927
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:13.860
Well it's just, yeah. And he obviously his priorities for this video game,

928
00:54:13.861 --> 00:54:14.700
I don't know if he,

929
00:54:14.701 --> 00:54:19.020
is there something else going on and your relationship or did he have some kind

930
00:54:19.021 --> 00:54:19.854
of

931
00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:20.760
<v 6>yeah,</v>

932
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.420
<v 7>something bad happened recently that he doesn't want to deal with or something</v>

933
00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:27.270
and that's why he's so consumed by the video games.

934
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:31.440
Cause I'm just trying to think like what normal healthy, happy person.

935
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.650
Just all of a sudden he didn't want to bang his broad yeah.

936
00:54:34.651 --> 00:54:36.690
And hands over his life to a video game.

937
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:41.580
Like I feel like something happens and he's not able to like what you talked to

938
00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.770
client legal. Okay. Cause you're sticking it in

939
00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:47.180
<v 0>my face like, well cause you do this, he started talking all the way.</v>

940
00:54:47.181 --> 00:54:49.650
I'll be hand that people can't hear you. Oh okay. Going at the levels. Yeah.

941
00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:53.910
All right. I'm so sorry. That's all right.

942
00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:59.080
<v 7>Um, yeah, I, I would not necessarily say less listen,</v>

943
00:54:59.081 --> 00:55:00.370
it's the video games or May,

944
00:55:00.670 --> 00:55:04.270
but you can just say something along those lines of like, listen,

945
00:55:04.271 --> 00:55:07.090
I feel like I'm not a priority in your life.

946
00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:10.120
And if that's the case then we really need to talk about this relationship.

947
00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:11.230
Cause if you're not into it,

948
00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.330
then just let me go so I can find somebody who was into me and it's gonna pay

949
00:55:16.331 --> 00:55:18.340
attention to me and not their x box.

950
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:20.220
<v 0>This is what I was saying she should do.</v>

951
00:55:20.221 --> 00:55:24.240
She should just fucking dress like a whore and go out that night and just see if

952
00:55:24.241 --> 00:55:26.640
he notices like just to have like fucking, you know,

953
00:55:27.870 --> 00:55:31.620
fucking sty highs on and all that shit. If he doesn't get it then my highest.

954
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:35.500
Yeah, just dress like a fucking whore. I highs their stockings,

955
00:55:35.501 --> 00:55:39.970
they go up to your thighs and then they stop and there's this glorious little

956
00:55:39.971 --> 00:55:41.800
fucking hint of leg.

957
00:55:41.801 --> 00:55:46.130
You're so old that you feel like women are going out and like thigh high.

958
00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:51.120
It's like they're like saloon mistresses like on Westworld. Why?

959
00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.880
Cause I came of age in the 18 hundreds why you guys?

960
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:56.560
Why you acting like you guys don't always whore it up every fucking holiday

961
00:55:56.890 --> 00:55:59.950
you'll hoard up on your birthday. You're hoard up on Halloween.

962
00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:04.830
You're hoard up on Christmas sex. It's called being sexy. Sexing it up.

963
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:09.010
[inaudible] it up when you're coram on the fucking head bladder.

964
00:56:09.070 --> 00:56:12.010
That's what you guys do. It's different to be titties out.

965
00:56:12.730 --> 00:56:14.100
Clam peeking out from it.

966
00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.681
<v 7>No, cause I don't,</v>

967
00:56:15.681 --> 00:56:18.820
I don't believe in that passive aggressive shit that's just like, listen mother,

968
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:23.120
fuck are you into this or not? Because if not then I need to move on.

969
00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.350
The thing is though, honey, he has made his choice.

970
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:31.120
That's what I think that you don't necessarily want to fully admit to.

971
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:32.530
He's made his choice.

972
00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:36.370
He's more interested in the video game for whatever reason he won't talk about

973
00:56:36.371 --> 00:56:39.310
it. He won't compromise. He's made his choice.

974
00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:42.790
Maybe he's not into the relationship anymore.

975
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:44.770
Is that a possibility?

976
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:48.940
Is it a possibility that he maybe she needs to or it up.

977
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.650
She's saying she's like trying and she's trying to like beg him to,

978
00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.670
to even have sex, which is ridiculous.

979
00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:02.440
It could be that he is just not into the relationship anymore and he's such a

980
00:57:02.441 --> 00:57:07.441
fucking pussy ass puss that he's waiting for you to be the one to dump him

981
00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:12.760
because a lot of people do that. A Pussy Hess plus I don't even know.

982
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.560
But you know some people are,

983
00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:18.970
they don't want to be the bad guy or they're just immature and cowardly so they

984
00:57:18.971 --> 00:57:19.990
don't want to say, listen,

985
00:57:19.991 --> 00:57:22.750
I think we should break up because they feel guilty cause it's been five plus

986
00:57:22.751 --> 00:57:23.230
years.

987
00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:28.180
So they do shit like this to like make you be the one to break up with them

988
00:57:28.181 --> 00:57:31.770
because they're cowards. You know what I mean? So it is possible to,

989
00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:35.350
in conclusion, what do you say? I'd say dump his ass by.

990
00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:39.750
<v 0>There you go. That's all right. See that? All right.</v>

991
00:57:39.751 --> 00:57:43.530
Now you want to listen to me read out loud. Oh God. I know.

992
00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:49.080
This would be hilarious is a fucking baby realizes that I'm not good at reading.

993
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.970
What age do you think they're going to be fucking turnaround panel?

994
00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:55.730
Look up at me like mommy doesn't sound like this and you'll be

995
00:57:55.820 --> 00:58:00.580
<v 7>good at reading like children's stories. All</v>

996
00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.830
<v 0>right. I walked into that one. All right. Here's some adult advertising.</v>

997
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:08.510

00:58:16.071 --> 00:58:18.410

1001
00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:23.090
or I think it's the readers. We get it. Holiday shopping can be tough.

1002
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.490
Yeah, it's more sympathy.

1003
00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:30.520
It's not hostility which that's your default emotion is hostility.

1004
00:58:31.761 --> 00:58:36.260
This is more of a we. Yeah, we understand. Okay. Any excuse to trash bill.

1005
00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:37.430
I see how it works now.

1006
00:58:37.431 --> 00:58:40.910
I played the victim just like Paul Simon with something goes wrong.

1007
00:58:40.911 --> 00:58:45.800
I'm the first to admit it and the last one didn't know. Oh Paul,

the Tampa guy who likes to wash his nuts.

I thought it was like peanut butter and jelly or Turks and Caicos. Yes. Builded.

1060
01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.720
No. That Turks and Caicos was an actual place that is the worst name ever.

1061
01:01:56.870 --> 01:02:01.870
He said Turks and Caicos as if you could believe Turks or Kinkos but not turns

1062
01:02:03.531 --> 01:02:07.100
and cage. The word and that you have and in your country,
