If Dave's mother is homozygous for the dominant allele,

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.500
then she has to pass at least one copy on

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.480
to each child. Therefore, all three children will be heterozygous,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.240
and show at least some level of alcohol flush reaction.
