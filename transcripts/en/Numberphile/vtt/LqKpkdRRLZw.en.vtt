00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.307
What do you think this is?

00:00:03.634 --> 00:00:06.041
Like maybe seaweed? Or...

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:08.810
-It definitely looks like something from the sea, like...

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.810
Okay well it's interesting mathematical seaweed,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.740
and I can explain exactly how we made that image,

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.406
because to me that image is one of the most mind-blowing pictures,

00:00:18.406 --> 00:00:21.630
illustrations of very simple math ideas.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.577
So it is - and we're going to get there - the Collatz Conjecture.

00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:38.671
I know you've done videos on the Collatz Conjecture,

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.445
but here is your quick refresher.

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:43.760
When you take a number and we can do two things to this number depending on its parity,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.390
that's whether it is odd or it is even.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.046
If it's even, we're going to divide by two,

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:56.570
and if it's odd, we're going to multiply by three, so triple it, and add one.

00:00:57.012 --> 00:00:59.349
-Which will then make it even. -Which will then make it even.

00:00:59.464 --> 00:01:02.104
and then we know what we do even numbers, that we divide them by two.

00:01:02.184 --> 00:01:03.947
Let's say start with say 13.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.140
So 13 is odd, so x 3 and add 1

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.093
so 13 will go to 39+1, 40 - goes to 40.

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.577
Okay it's even, so divide that by 2, goes to 20.

00:01:14.577 --> 00:01:16.493
Okay we divide that by two, goes to 10

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.535
again divided by two, goes to 5.

00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:22.295
Uh-oh, odd, multiply by 3, 15, add 1, 16.

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:23.652
I get 16.

00:01:23.652 --> 00:01:27.617
And then look, 16 to 8 to 4 to 2 to 1.

00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:34.782
The conjecture made by Collatz is that every number that you choose

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:37.172
is eventually going to go down to 1.

00:01:37.617 --> 00:01:40.010
So some of them are going to go all over the place,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.681
but eventually everything's going to 1 as a conjecture,

00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:46.914
which is, we think is true but we can't prove it

00:01:46.914 --> 00:01:52.361
and one of the reasons why the conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in math

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:57.446
is that we appear to be nowhere close to a solution, nowhere close at all.

00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:02.326
People believe that whole new bits of math need to be invented before we can do this,

00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:07.547
and is one of the few things that is so simple to state, yet still so complicated.

00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:11.373
It's got the sort of mythical status now among advanced mathematicians,

00:02:11.582 --> 00:02:18.455
and what I want to do is show how Edmund Harriss, who is a mathematician who I work with,

00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:24.601
has created this amazing image that illustrates what's going on with Collatz

00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:27.746
and when he first showed it to me, I was like blown away.

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:30.601
I've started at 13 and then a line like that.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.074
Actually already what people do is you've built this big tree,

00:02:35.074 --> 00:02:36.932
because eventually things are going to have to get to one.

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:39.920
So if they get to one they're going to have to come from two,

00:02:40.128 --> 00:02:43.259
then they're going to have to come down from four,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.022
and so you can build this big tree.

00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:49.478
What you see with the tree is that you've got all these branches coming down like this,

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.869
you know, and going into it.

00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:54.977
And normally when you see this done,

00:02:55.168 --> 00:03:01.314
they're done to try and maximize the sort of logic of how it's done,

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:06.389
so the distance will be the same, they'll be done so it like kind of looks good on the page,

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.130
and it looks like something in a math textbook.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.958
But actually what Edmund has done is to make it so it's...

00:03:14.782 --> 00:03:16.024
interesting to look at,

00:03:16.222 --> 00:03:19.770
but so that you get more of an insight about why this whole problem is interesting.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.325
Imagine if you start at the bottom,

00:03:21.603 --> 00:03:24.834
either we are going to go up to an odd number or an even number.

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:29.415
If we're getting to an even number, it's going to slightly go off in that direction.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.311
If it's going to an odd number it's going slightly in that direction.

00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:38.650
-Clockwise or anti-clockwise.       -Yeah anti-clockwise for odd, and clockwise for even.

00:03:39.026 --> 00:03:44.128
And then you get - the tree becomes this.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.019
This is something already... startling to look a bit interesting.

00:03:47.335 --> 00:03:49.909
And then obviously we're not that interested in the individual numbers,

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.954
we're interested in sort of the overall feel.

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:53.641
He gets rid of the numbers,

00:03:53.902 --> 00:03:58.320
and sort of he just looked at the lines between them, how the lines relate,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.224
and sort of thickens the lines to make them look like branches,

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:07.787
and then carried it on until he includes every number less than 10, 000.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.700
You end up with hundreds of branches,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.387
and then it looks like that.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.133
It is so messy.

00:04:19.547 --> 00:04:21.133
It's so disorderly.

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:23.133
We've seen this incredibly simple thing:

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:27.099
divided by 2 or multiply by 3, add 1, and then divided by 2.

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.208
Who would have thought that you would get this thing here?

00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:31.606
But it looks organic.

00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:34.758
Brady you were saying it looks like something definitely floating at the bottom of the sea.

00:04:34.838 --> 00:04:36.326
So you've got two things going on there:

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:42.320
you've got the nature of the growth, that you've also got the windiness of the waves.

00:04:42.462 --> 00:04:48.768
And to think that something so natural looking, something so organic,

00:04:49.106 --> 00:04:53.436
something so complicated, comes from something so simple,

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.233
this to me is the best way to explain the kind of complicated nature of the Collatz Conjecture,

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.393
because what it's doing is you're looking and you're thinking,

00:05:02.393 --> 00:05:03.954
oh my god that looks complicated,

00:05:03.954 --> 00:05:07.342
and you think, oh now I understand why no one's got a clue.

00:05:22.299 --> 00:05:26.699
