00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
All righty.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.654
So we've been talking about,
the last time we talked about

00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:24.027
the
different ways that this

00:00:24.027 --> 00:00:29.797
extraordinary process called
evolution has resulted in

00:00:29.797 --> 00:00:33.750
different ways that organisms
exploit the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.000
carbon and energy sources that
are available on earth.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.104
And as we talked about that we
find that whatever is

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:47.749
thermodynamically
possible in terms of redox

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:51.428
gradients in the environment you
will find an

00:00:51.428 --> 00:00:54.856
organism that has evolved to
exploit it.

00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:59.803
And one thing I haven't
mentioned to you guys yet --

00:00:59.803 --> 00:01:05.107
Maybe I've mentioned it but I
haven't driven it home is that

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:08.250
in the microbial world right now
99.9%

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.045
of the microbes that live on
earth have never been

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:12.897
cultivated.

00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:15.916
So it's
a vastly unknown universe,

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:16.916
the details.

00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:21.481
So the metabolic pathways
that I'm describing here are

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.750
just the tip of the iceberg in
terms of

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.410
what's possible.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.250
So last time we were talking at
the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.291
biochemical scale.

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:36.375
This time we're now going to
scale

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:41.110
up and think of these
biochemical processes on a

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.419
global level.

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:45.606
And
we're going to talk about

00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:49.875
primary productivity which is
really just

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:56.625
another word for the collective
photosynthesis of all of the

00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:59.583
photosynthesizers on earth.

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:04.169
So who are the dominant primary
producers?

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:07.756
Well, we've already talked
about this.

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:12.341
And just to get
ourselves oriented let's think

00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:15.998
of in water the primary
photosynthetic

00:02:15.998 --> 00:02:20.443
organisms, the primary
producers are phytoplankton.

00:02:20.443 --> 00:02:24.776
And let's just look
at one phytoplankton cell,

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:25.050
OK?

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.799
This is a single cell so this
would be

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.083
maybe ten microns in size.

00:02:32.083 --> 00:02:37.333
And inside that cell we have a
chloroplast,

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:44.000
and you've learned all this in
other lectures and including

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.014
my lectures,
which takes up CO2 and evolves

00:02:49.014 --> 00:02:53.500
oxygen and makes sugars
which go to,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.000
what's the organelle where
respiration takes place?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.379
Mitochondria.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.367
Which goes to the mitochondrion
and is respired.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:10.293
CO2
is evolved and oxygen is taken

00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:10.611
up.

00:03:10.611 --> 00:03:16.281
So this little single cell gets
through life through

00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:21.331
photosynthesis primarily,
but it also takes the

00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:27.123
products of photosynthesis and
burns them inside the cell.

00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:31.050
So this is
what we call respiration.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.908
And it's important to remember
that

00:03:34.908 --> 00:03:38.578
even photosynthetic organisms
respire, OK?

00:03:38.578 --> 00:03:43.256
But then there's this
whole other group of organisms

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:46.544
that last time we called
heterotrophs

00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:48.427
that can only respire.

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:52.363
They rely on the photosynthetic
product from

00:03:52.363 --> 00:03:54.383
photosynthetic organisms.

00:03:54.383 --> 00:03:55.918
So that's in water.

00:03:55.918 --> 00:04:00.616
And then on land the main
primary producers,

00:04:00.616 --> 00:04:04.000
productivity are plants.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.580
And we'll just symbolize these
as a tree.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.694
And we all know that the tree
takes up CO2,

00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:13.137
evolves oxygen.

00:04:13.137 --> 00:04:16.887
If you blow this up,
you just take a

00:04:16.887 --> 00:04:17.794
leaf, OK?

00:04:17.794 --> 00:04:19.405
That's a blowup.

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:23.331
And then you blowup again and
take a

00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:25.106
cell from the leaf.

00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:29.776
This cell is identical in
function to the single

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:32.688
microscopic phytoplankton cell,
OK?

00:04:32.688 --> 00:04:37.405
So the process in both of these
ecosystems, this could be

00:04:37.405 --> 00:04:40.800
grass, it could be moss,
it could be anything

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.000
else, the process is the same
in terms of what's involved in

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.965
productivity.

00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:47.188
OK.

00:04:47.188 --> 00:04:51.199
Now, you have a handout for
this lecture that has a

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.399
lot of the definitions that I'm
going to now very briefly

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.955
put on the board.

00:04:57.955 --> 00:05:01.250
Oh, I should tell you also that
in

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.068
the last ten minutes of the
lecture I'm going to show you

00:05:05.068 --> 00:05:07.562
another
incredible clip from the Blue

00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:10.250
Planet series that I showed you
last time

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.779
so you have something to look
forward to.

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:24.000
So let's
define some terms.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.455
Biomass we're going to call B.

00:05:26.455 --> 00:05:30.296
And as I said this is all
in the handout.

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:34.100
So I'm just going to give you
the

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.807
short version here.

00:05:35.807 --> 00:05:40.300
And the units of this can be of
course anything,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.152
but normally it's something
like grams carbon per meter

00:05:45.152 --> 00:05:45.871
squared.

00:05:45.871 --> 00:05:48.378
And
what does that mean?

00:05:48.378 --> 00:05:52.699
Well, it means if you have,
in a terrestrial

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.987
ecosystem, OK,
where you have trees,

00:05:55.987 --> 00:06:01.211
it would mean that you would
calculate the biomass.

00:06:01.211 --> 00:06:05.100
You'd take a square meter and
you'd

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.237
integrate up and collect all of
the biomass in that surface

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:11.300
area, OK?

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.538
So that's what that means.

00:06:13.538 --> 00:06:16.638
So grams carbon in that square
meter.

00:06:16.638 --> 00:06:19.870
For an
aquatic ecosystem it's the

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.691
opposite.

00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:25.077
You take a square meter of the
surface water,

00:06:25.077 --> 00:06:29.899
let's put some waves on here,
and you integrate

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:31.702
all the way down.

00:06:31.702 --> 00:06:32.550
How far?

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.250
When will you not have
anymore primary,

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.301
oh, no, biomass?

00:06:37.301 --> 00:06:39.600
When will you no longer have
any

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:44.000
more photosynthetic biomass in
the oceans or in a lake?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:55.231
Pycnocline. Oh, that's a good 
answer.

00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:57.090
Not necessarily,
though.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.000
But it often corresponds to
that.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.797
The pycnocline is a density
gradient in aquatic ecosystems.

00:07:03.797 --> 00:07:06.664
But what is
absolutely essential for

00:07:06.664 --> 00:07:07.883
photosynthesis?

00:07:07.883 --> 00:07:08.371
Light.

00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:08.859
Light.

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:11.398
So
you go down until there's no

00:07:11.398 --> 00:07:11.820
light.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:12.594
Absolutely.

00:07:12.594 --> 00:07:16.425
There won't be any
photosynthesis where there's no

00:07:16.425 --> 00:07:16.867
light.

00:07:16.867 --> 00:07:19.903
This is the one thing we
know for sure,

00:07:19.903 --> 00:07:20.128
OK?

00:07:20.128 --> 00:07:23.569
And that's usually in the
oceans around 200

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:24.048
meters.

00:07:24.048 --> 00:07:27.054
And in lakes it depends on how
rich they are.

00:07:27.054 --> 00:07:30.641
In the Charles
River it's about one meter

00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:33.000
because it's such a mess.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.448
In fact, well,
I shouldn't say a mess,

00:07:35.448 --> 00:07:37.102
but it's very productive.

00:07:37.102 --> 00:07:38.906
In
fact, legend has it,

00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:42.000
and I don't know if this is
true, that it's

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.562
actually safe to swim in the
Charles in terms of the water

00:07:45.562 --> 00:07:48.428
quality, but
the reason you're not supposed

00:07:48.428 --> 00:07:51.000
to swim is because the
visibility is so

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.143
bad that if anything happened
they'd never find you.

00:07:54.143 --> 00:07:56.829
But I don't know if
that is true.

00:07:56.829 --> 00:08:00.000
That could be an urban legend.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.388
OK, so we're going to define
gross primary productivity.

00:08:07.388 --> 00:08:13.584
GPP, gross
primary productivity is the

00:08:13.584 --> 00:08:26.000
rate of photosynthesis --
-- and grams carbon per meter

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.944
squared per year.

00:08:27.944 --> 00:08:31.833
And of course the units here
are

00:08:31.833 --> 00:08:36.267
not, the absolute units,
this could be per day and this

00:08:36.267 --> 00:08:39.387
could be per
square millimeter if you

00:08:39.387 --> 00:08:43.164
wanted, but the units are amount
per unit area

00:08:43.164 --> 00:08:44.624
per unit time,
OK?

00:08:44.624 --> 00:08:48.831
And then we're going to define
the respiration

00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:52.395
rate, the respiration of the
autotrophs.

00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:56.707
So this would be the
respiration rate of the

00:08:56.707 --> 00:09:00.164
photosynthetic organisms,
which is

00:09:00.164 --> 00:09:02.804
why we call them R sub A.

00:09:02.804 --> 00:09:06.500
And that's going to have the
same

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.514
units, OK?

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:13.500
So it's grams carbon per meter
squared per year respired.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:19.527
And net primary productivity is
then gross primary productivity

00:09:19.527 --> 00:09:22.391
minus R
sub A so net primary

00:09:22.391 --> 00:09:27.500
productivity of an ecosystem is
the amount of carbon

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:33.227
CO2 that's drawn into the
system through photosynthesis

00:09:33.227 --> 00:09:37.787
minus the
amount that was respired by the

00:09:37.787 --> 00:09:41.500
plants, by the organisms that
did

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.706
the photosynthesis.

00:09:43.706 --> 00:09:47.888
In a sense, you can think of it
as

00:09:47.888 --> 00:09:52.038
the amount of carbon that
actually goes into a plant

00:09:52.038 --> 00:09:56.299
growing, OK, that
goes into the biomass of a tree

00:09:56.299 --> 00:09:59.442
or that goes into the division
of a

00:09:59.442 --> 00:10:03.570
single celled phytoplankton
into two phytoplankton.

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:08.344
And then a lot of
that is lost through

00:10:08.344 --> 00:10:10.219
respiration.

00:10:10.219 --> 00:10:11.000
OK.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We can also define mean 
residance time --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
-- as MRT, which is the biomass
divided by the net primary

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.263
productivity.

00:10:32.263 --> 00:10:35.666
So what are the units of the
mean

00:10:35.666 --> 00:10:36.829
residance time?

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:45.625
It should be obvious but --
Years, right, or time. Mean 

00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:47.350
residence time is time.

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:50.875
And that's really,
if you want to think about

00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:55.459
it, if you think of yourself as
a carbon atom that's drawn into

00:10:55.459 --> 00:10:57.982
a tree
through photosynthesis,

00:10:57.982 --> 00:11:01.375
it's the average amount of time
you will

00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:03.757
spend, your one atom in that
tree.

00:11:03.757 --> 00:11:03.973
OK?

00:11:03.973 --> 00:11:06.500
It's the average residence,
the

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.087
mean residence time.

00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:10.309
Well, actually,
that's wrong,

00:11:10.309 --> 00:11:10.785
right?

00:11:10.785 --> 00:11:13.485
It's
not the amount of time that

00:11:13.485 --> 00:11:16.500
you, that one atom will spend,
but it's

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.630
on average the amount of time
that atoms will spend in the

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.992
tree.

00:11:20.992 --> 00:11:21.500
OK.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:30.000
And then the fractional
turnover --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.539
-- is equal to one over the
mean residence time.

00:11:34.539 --> 00:11:39.084
And it has the
units of obviously years to the

00:11:39.084 --> 00:11:40.021
minus one.

00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:44.924
And it's the fraction,
if you think of a tree again,

00:11:44.924 --> 00:11:48.544
it's the fraction of the carbon
in that

00:11:48.544 --> 00:11:52.463
tree that is renewed by new
carbon every year.

00:11:52.463 --> 00:11:57.090
Now, these two concepts
will become very important

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:00.908
again when we start to talk
about global

00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:03.471
biogeochemical cycles.

00:12:03.471 --> 00:12:07.666
And we'll talk about the
residence

00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:14.998
time, the various elements in
various components in the earth

00:12:14.998 --> 00:12:15.711
system.

00:12:15.711 --> 00:12:16.016
OK.

00:12:16.016 --> 00:12:20.498
So now let's go on and look at,
first of all,

00:12:20.498 --> 00:12:25.287
I should have
shown this slide last time.

00:12:25.287 --> 00:12:29.666
I'm trying to not walk around
too much

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:37.000
because this fellow is filming
me or filming these classes.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.318
But we should briefly take a
look at the absorption spectrum

00:12:42.318 --> 00:12:45.997
of all of
the plants in the biosphere.

00:12:45.997 --> 00:12:49.799
Could we turn the lights down a
little?

00:12:49.799 --> 00:13:01.000
Or I guess I'm in charge of
that.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.486
There.

00:13:01.486 --> 00:13:03.596
A little bit better maybe.

00:13:03.596 --> 00:13:06.599
This is the absorption spectrum
of

00:13:06.599 --> 00:13:10.307
the pigment chlorophyll,
chlorophyll A that is the

00:13:10.307 --> 00:13:14.422
pigment that all green
plants have and they use to

00:13:14.422 --> 00:13:15.740
absorb sunlight.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:20.104
And you'll notice that
over the course of evolution

00:13:20.104 --> 00:13:23.399
all of these white bands are
accessory

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:24.119
pigments.

00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:29.000
That different organisms have
evolved to also capture light.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.588
And they pass on that energy to
the chlorophyll molecule.

00:13:32.588 --> 00:13:35.649
And the point
is that if you look across all

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:38.227
of the visible light and even
beyond

00:13:38.227 --> 00:13:42.213
there are pigments that have
evolved to capture that solar

00:13:42.213 --> 00:13:44.766
energy
collectively in the ecosystem.

00:13:44.766 --> 00:13:47.458
OK, so let's look at,
now we're going to

00:13:47.458 --> 00:13:50.648
look at world net primary
productivity.

00:13:50.648 --> 00:13:54.218
So essentially
photosynthesis on a global

00:13:54.218 --> 00:13:54.712
scale.

00:13:54.712 --> 00:13:58.518
And I'm going to tell
you right up front.

00:13:58.518 --> 00:14:02.202
These numbers are extremely
approximated.

00:14:02.202 --> 00:14:05.921
And I've taken these numbers
from various textbooks.

00:14:05.921 --> 00:14:09.765
Your textbook doesn't even have
a table like this in it.

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:12.475
In fact,
your textbook is very weak in

00:14:12.475 --> 00:14:14.080
this section of biology.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.170
But there are
always tradeoffs in choosing

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:17.891
textbooks.

00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:21.690
So I've taken this from
textbooks and I've rounded off

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:22.587
these numbers.

00:14:22.587 --> 00:14:26.909
And so I just want you to
go through and understand the

00:14:26.909 --> 00:14:29.000
structure of the table.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.884
The idea is not to memorize
particular numbers but

00:14:33.884 --> 00:14:37.382
understand
and have a feeling for the

00:14:37.382 --> 00:14:41.363
relative amounts of productivity
in different

00:14:41.363 --> 00:14:42.393
ecosystems.

00:14:42.393 --> 00:14:46.702
So, first of all,
here's our units of grams per

00:14:46.702 --> 00:14:50.405
year,
world net primary productivity.

00:14:50.405 --> 00:14:53.081
These are grams of carbon,
OK?

00:14:53.081 --> 00:14:56.149
And
if we first look at the total

00:14:56.149 --> 00:14:59.908
amount on land,
in this particular table is

00:14:59.908 --> 00:15:02.601
177 versus the marine total is
54.

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:05.538
But the new estimates,
I've taken

00:15:05.538 --> 00:15:09.142
this out of sort of more
primarily literature than

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:12.747
textbooks, really
show these numbers to be more

00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:13.483
like this.

00:15:13.483 --> 00:15:16.355
That shows you how variable
this is.

00:15:16.355 --> 00:15:18.352
It changes every decade.

00:15:18.352 --> 00:15:23.150
Showing that the amount of
photosynthesis in the oceans is

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.842
roughly on par with the amount
on

00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:26.227
land.

00:15:26.227 --> 00:15:30.921
And to remind you of our units
here, weight-wise this is 50

00:15:30.921 --> 00:15:36.000
to 70 billion Volkswagen's
worth of carbon.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.353
I mean that's a lot of carbon
every year that is going into

00:15:41.353 --> 00:15:43.015
these
ecosystems.

00:15:43.015 --> 00:15:48.000
OK, so let's look and dissect
the table a little bit.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.542
Looking at tropical forests
like the rainforest in the

00:15:52.542 --> 00:15:57.115
Amazon that are
some of the most productive

00:15:57.115 --> 00:16:00.000
ecosystems in the world.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.489
You can see that over here
their net primary productivity

00:16:05.489 --> 00:16:08.218
per meter
squared is 2,000.

00:16:08.218 --> 00:16:13.331
And then you look down here at
the open ocean which on

00:16:13.331 --> 00:16:18.821
a per meter squared basis,
a very unproductive ecosystem,

00:16:18.821 --> 00:16:22.405
there are
tiny little phytoplankton,

00:16:22.405 --> 00:16:23.053
is 100.

00:16:23.053 --> 00:16:26.664
But looking further,
before I get to

00:16:26.664 --> 00:16:29.447
the but which is the punch
line.

00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:32.769
That's the trouble with
animation.

00:16:32.769 --> 00:16:36.688
The biomass in the tropical
forest is enormous,

00:16:36.688 --> 00:16:40.869
obviously trees,
whereas the biomass in the open

00:16:40.869 --> 00:16:42.439
ocean is very tiny.

00:16:42.439 --> 00:16:46.075
But if we look
at the percent of the surface

00:16:46.075 --> 00:16:49.383
of the earth that is covered by
these two

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:54.038
different ecosystems the open
ocean is huge compared to the

00:16:54.038 --> 00:16:55.508
tropical
forest.

00:16:55.508 --> 00:16:59.788
So on a global scale,
because of the aerial coverage

00:16:59.788 --> 00:17:04.363
here
these two ecosystems contribute

00:17:04.363 --> 00:17:06.000
equally, OK?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.136
So it's a combination of net
primary productivity and the

00:17:12.136 --> 00:17:15.599
coverage of the
global ocean.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:15.969
OK.

00:17:15.969 --> 00:17:20.153
Let's go back to that for a
minute.

00:17:20.153 --> 00:17:29.912
So let's --
-- talk about turnover times or

00:17:29.912 --> 00:17:33.064
mean
residence times.

00:17:33.064 --> 00:17:38.332
Just eyeballing it,
can you give me an estimate in

00:17:38.332 --> 00:17:41.600
terms of days,
months, years,

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.220
decades, centuries,
order of

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:51.408
magnitude for the mean
residence time of carbon in all

00:17:51.408 --> 00:17:56.894
the
phytoplankton in a marine

00:17:56.894 --> 00:17:59.000
ecosystem?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.347
Is it days, months,
years, centuries,

00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:02.000
decades?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.204
Well, don't guess.

00:18:08.204 --> 00:18:15.289
Well, you can
guess but minutes is wrong.

00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:18.125
So having guessed minutes is
wrong now

00:18:18.125 --> 00:18:21.669
you use your analytical brain
and you look at this,

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:25.250
mean residence
time, which is biomass divided

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.625
by net primary productivity.

00:18:27.625 --> 00:18:29.516
Here's the biomass.

00:18:29.516 --> 00:18:31.009
Round that off.

00:18:31.009 --> 00:18:43.000
And here's the net
primary productivity.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.449
And the units here is years.

00:18:46.449 --> 00:18:49.405
Like a month did I hear?

00:18:49.405 --> 00:18:51.500
I didn't hear.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.364
Right.

00:18:52.364 --> 00:19:00.000
It's about one-tenth of year
which is about a month.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.225
About a month.

00:19:01.225 --> 00:19:03.589
Does everybody follow that?

00:19:03.589 --> 00:19:07.858
It's just to round
this off, five over 50 is 0.1,

00:19:07.858 --> 00:19:09.235
biomass over NPP.

00:19:09.235 --> 00:19:12.537
How about for the
terrestrial ecosystem,

00:19:12.537 --> 00:19:16.284
what's the average amount of
time a carbon atom

00:19:16.284 --> 00:19:24.000
spends in the average tree?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.611
Years, right?

00:19:24.611 --> 00:19:24.987
Decades.

00:19:24.987 --> 00:19:25.505
Many years.

00:19:25.505 --> 00:19:26.775
Maybe decades to centuries.

00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:28.983
This
is a way we think about these

00:19:28.983 --> 00:19:29.414
things.

00:19:29.414 --> 00:19:31.714
We don't have
an exact number.

00:19:31.714 --> 00:19:35.713
But you want to get an order of
magnitude feeling.

00:19:35.713 --> 00:19:39.284
So carbon is turning over very,
very fast in the

00:19:39.284 --> 00:19:42.703
marine ecosystem but very
slowly in the terrestrial

00:19:42.703 --> 00:19:43.387
ecosystem.

00:19:43.387 --> 00:19:46.416
And the
simple way to think about that

00:19:46.416 --> 00:19:51.034
is that phytoplankton don't have
trunks, but there's a more

00:19:51.034 --> 00:19:53.855
complicated way to think about
it.

00:19:53.855 --> 00:19:58.079
OK, so now, all of this primary
productivity that we've made,

00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:00.100
all of
this photosynthesis,

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.569
as we talked about,
is the base of the food webs

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:05.229
in all ecosystems.

00:20:05.229 --> 00:20:08.979
And so we're going to start to
dissect this.

00:20:08.979 --> 00:20:12.544
This is a marine food web
showing phytoplankton that are

00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:13.872
eaten by zooplankton.

00:20:13.872 --> 00:20:16.907
We used to talk about food
chains, but we well

00:20:16.907 --> 00:20:18.601
now that it's not a chain.

00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:21.270
It's really a very complex web
and very

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:24.790
hard to put organisms and
assign them to particular

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.634
sections.

00:20:25.634 --> 00:20:30.000
Phytoplankton are eaten by
zooplankton.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.661
Zooplankton are eaten by worms.

00:20:32.661 --> 00:20:35.665
You've got blue crabs,
barnacles,

00:20:35.665 --> 00:20:39.615
and the top predators shore
birds and sea bass.

00:20:39.615 --> 00:20:44.120
Now, an important
part of these food webs is also

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.998
all of the carbon,
the primary

00:20:46.998 --> 00:20:50.857
productivity that is not eaten
while it's alive.

00:20:50.857 --> 00:20:53.580
So some things just
die, right?

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.331
You have dead carbon lying
around.

00:20:56.331 --> 00:21:00.467
And that dead carbon
falls into what's called a

00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:04.000
different food web,
the detritus food web.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.575
And we're going to talk about
that.

00:21:06.575 --> 00:21:11.109
And it comes from all of these
different components in the

00:21:11.109 --> 00:21:11.812
food web.

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:16.301
So now we're going to more
analytically look at the flow

00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:17.095
of carbon.

00:21:17.095 --> 00:21:21.000
And when we talk about
carbon we are also talking

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.461
about energy,
right?

00:21:22.461 --> 00:21:25.826
Carbon and energy
are the same thing.

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:29.000
I mean they're
interconvertable.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.127
So we're going to look at the
flow of carbon from the

00:21:33.127 --> 00:21:36.890
phytoplankton to
the zooplankton through that

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.017
trophic level.

00:21:38.017 --> 00:21:42.526
And to do this we have to
talk about some definitions.

00:21:42.526 --> 00:21:45.907
And again this is in your
handout so I'm

00:21:45.907 --> 00:21:50.727
not going to write all this on
the board but we'll just walk

00:21:50.727 --> 00:21:51.952
through
this.

00:21:51.952 --> 00:21:56.200
The flow of carbon or energy
through a trophic level,

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.947
which is
one of these links,

00:21:58.947 --> 00:21:59.226
OK?

00:21:59.226 --> 00:22:01.643
This is one trophic level.

00:22:01.643 --> 00:22:04.417
This is
the next trophic level.

00:22:04.417 --> 00:22:07.998
Or you can also think of this
as an organism.

00:22:07.998 --> 00:22:11.033
This type of analysis applies
to both.

00:22:11.033 --> 00:22:15.673
And we start out with the
productivity at trophic level

00:22:15.673 --> 00:22:17.047
and minus one,
OK?

00:22:17.047 --> 00:22:20.972
And so the first
would be primary productivity

00:22:20.972 --> 00:22:22.803
coming into the system.

00:22:22.803 --> 00:22:25.116
Some of that
productivity,

00:22:25.116 --> 00:22:29.332
some of that carbon is not
ingested by the next

00:22:29.332 --> 00:22:30.833
trophic level.

00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:34.799
That's lost as dead organic
matter,

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:37.802
detritus, whatever we want to
call it.

00:22:37.802 --> 00:22:41.469
So that's D sub n the portion
not consumed.

00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:45.010
Then some of it is ingested by
the organism,

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:45.999
I sub n.

00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:51.022
And then some fraction of that
is assimilated by the organism.

00:22:51.022 --> 00:22:54.144
That
means it's taken into its

00:22:54.144 --> 00:22:59.211
biochemistry and goes toward
building biomass.

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:04.454
And some of it is lost as fecal
matter produced,

00:23:04.454 --> 00:23:05.818
that's F sub n.

00:23:05.818 --> 00:23:09.000
And urine would also be a part
of

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.852
this, waste products.

00:23:10.852 --> 00:23:15.000
And then some of it is then,
the rest of it is

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.950
then available,
oh, some of it,

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:21.000
this is important,
is lost as

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.074
respiration.

00:23:22.074 --> 00:23:27.000
And then the rest is available
as productivity for the

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.032
next trophic level.

00:23:29.032 --> 00:23:29.354
OK.

00:23:29.354 --> 00:23:33.098
So different types of
organisms.

00:23:33.098 --> 00:23:37.770
First, before we get to that,
using this analysis we can

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.334
start to define
efficiencies of energy

00:23:41.334 --> 00:23:44.203
conversion through this system.

00:23:44.203 --> 00:23:47.801
And this is
because different types of

00:23:47.801 --> 00:23:51.699
organisms assimilate carbon with
different

00:23:51.699 --> 00:23:52.920
efficiencies.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:57.898
And that is important in the
flow of carbon through

00:23:57.898 --> 00:24:00.819
different types of ecosystems.

00:24:00.819 --> 00:24:05.835
So let's look at the first
efficiency that would be I,

00:24:05.835 --> 00:24:11.025
ingested, reflecting the amount
that's ingested relative to the

00:24:11.025 --> 00:24:12.876
amount that's available.

00:24:12.876 --> 00:24:15.859
And this
is called the exploitation

00:24:15.859 --> 00:24:17.091
efficiency, OK?

00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:20.248
I sub n divided by
P sub n minus one.

00:24:20.248 --> 00:24:23.907
The next one similarly would be
A sub n, the

00:24:23.907 --> 00:24:28.138
amount that's assimilated
relative to the amount that's

00:24:28.138 --> 00:24:29.000
ingested.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.452
And that is the assimilation
efficiency.

00:24:32.452 --> 00:24:37.193
And finally the amount
that goes to the next trophic

00:24:37.193 --> 00:24:40.332
level divided by the amount
that's

00:24:40.332 --> 00:24:43.011
assimilated,
which is the production

00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:45.998
efficiency, the amount that
actually

00:24:45.998 --> 00:24:50.045
goes to productivity that is
assimilated.

00:24:50.045 --> 00:24:53.997
And these all
multiplied together give you

00:24:53.997 --> 00:24:56.165
the ecological efficiency.

00:24:56.165 --> 00:25:00.570
And that is
sometimes called the trophic

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.000
transfer efficiency.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.736
That's the amount of carbon
that is basically lost as you go

00:25:08.736 --> 00:25:11.484
through one
trophic level.

00:25:11.484 --> 00:25:15.939
And usually,
and we'll talk about this in a

00:25:15.939 --> 00:25:19.625
minute,
this is 10% to 20% actually

00:25:19.625 --> 00:25:24.000
makes it through the system,
and the rest is

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
lost to respiration or detritus
or fecal matter.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.163
OK, so let's talk about now how
different organisms vary in

00:25:37.163 --> 00:25:47.000
terms of
efficiencies.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
We have, in terms of the
exploitation efficiency,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.060
if you're
talking about,

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:02.000
for example,
tree insects.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:08.887
So insects feeding on trees is
about 1% to 10%.

00:26:08.887 --> 00:26:14.841
They don't take that
much of the tree.

00:26:14.841 --> 00:26:21.188
If it's grass to animals it's
more like 20%.

00:26:21.188 --> 00:26:26.282
And if
it's phytoplankton to

00:26:26.282 --> 00:26:33.000
zooplankton it's more like 20%
to 40%.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.082
In other words,
zooplankton harvests much of

00:26:36.082 --> 00:26:39.689
the primary productivity,
no, almost half of the

00:26:39.689 --> 00:26:43.180
productivity that the
phytoplankton have made.

00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:43.438
OK.

00:26:43.438 --> 00:26:46.372
What about assimilation
efficiency?

00:26:46.372 --> 00:26:49.542
How does this vary
between organisms?

00:26:49.542 --> 00:26:52.584
Well, this one,
you can think about it as if

00:26:52.584 --> 00:26:54.321
you eat
food that is,

00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:57.420
I was going to say not you,
but it is true,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.839
we are all
animals so it applies to us,

00:27:00.839 --> 00:27:01.180
too.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.333
If you eat food that is similar
in

00:27:04.333 --> 00:27:09.528
composition to your own bodily
composition you're more

00:27:09.528 --> 00:27:13.645
efficient at
assimilating it because you

00:27:13.645 --> 00:27:17.664
don't have to break it down as
much and

00:27:17.664 --> 00:27:19.079
reorganize it.

00:27:19.079 --> 00:27:23.624
So herbivores,
organisms that eat plant matter

00:27:23.624 --> 00:27:28.829
are
20% to 50% efficient in their

00:27:28.829 --> 00:27:31.000
assimilation.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.257
But carnivores is more like
80%.

00:27:34.257 --> 00:27:38.250
Because you are meat and if you
eat

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:44.239
meat you don't have as much
waste than if you eat a lot of

00:27:44.239 --> 00:27:44.869
fiber.

00:27:44.869 --> 00:27:48.126
So
there are big differences

00:27:48.126 --> 00:27:48.757
there.

00:27:48.757 --> 00:27:52.750
And then in terms of,
that is not a

00:27:52.750 --> 00:28:00.000
value judgment on whether you
should eat meat or not.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.395
I just want to make that very
clear.

00:28:03.395 --> 00:28:03.880
What?

00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.171
OK.

00:28:04.171 --> 00:28:09.566
But later on we'll talk
about the difference between

00:28:09.566 --> 00:28:13.776
eating meat globally and being
vegetarians

00:28:13.776 --> 00:28:19.696
in terms of utilizing primary
productivity on the earth.

00:28:19.696 --> 00:28:23.535
But in
terms of production efficiency

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:27.554
you have warm-blooded organisms
having a

00:28:27.554 --> 00:28:31.050
2% production efficiency.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:40.674
Whereas cold-blooded have a 40%
production efficiency.

00:28:40.674 --> 00:28:45.000
Why would that be?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:45.980
Yes.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:53.333
If you're warm-blooded,
does

00:28:53.333 --> 00:28:57.142
anybody know the technical term
for that?

00:28:57.142 --> 00:29:00.000
It is if you are homeotherm.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.935
Or what did you say?

00:29:01.935 --> 00:29:03.096
Endothermic.

00:29:03.096 --> 00:29:04.354
I'm not sure.

00:29:04.354 --> 00:29:06.937
I think that's
chemistry.

00:29:06.937 --> 00:29:09.093
It sounded good,
though.

00:29:09.093 --> 00:29:13.218
So there are homeotherms and
heterotherms.

00:29:13.218 --> 00:29:14.906
It doesn't matter.

00:29:14.906 --> 00:29:20.619
The point is that these have to
maintain their body temperature

00:29:20.619 --> 00:29:21.549
like we do.

00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:24.000
That takes a lot of energy.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.353
Whereas, these go with the flow
so to speak, that technical

00:29:29.353 --> 00:29:30.000
term.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.153
But that doesn't take as much
energy.

00:29:34.153 --> 00:29:40.000
If it's cold they just let
their body get cold.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
They don't burn,
burn, burn to keep the

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.316
temperature constant.

00:29:47.316 --> 00:29:51.066
OK, so that's how organisms
differ.

00:29:51.066 --> 00:29:55.858
Now let's
move on to the next chapter in

00:29:55.858 --> 00:30:00.000
which now we are going to look
at --

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.071
We were looking at the flow
through one trophic level.

00:30:04.071 --> 00:30:07.528
Now we're going
to connect a whole bunch of

00:30:07.528 --> 00:30:08.680
trophic levels.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:13.208
We're going to look at the
flow of energy through this

00:30:13.208 --> 00:30:16.362
component of this food web and
do a

00:30:16.362 --> 00:30:18.128
more thorough analysis.

00:30:18.128 --> 00:30:21.816
OK, so this gets kind of messy
but let's start

00:30:21.816 --> 00:30:22.235
here.

00:30:22.235 --> 00:30:24.753
I better use the powerful one.

00:30:24.753 --> 00:30:29.593
OK, so each one of these is
what we call a trophic level.

00:30:29.593 --> 00:30:32.635
And these are the primary
producers,

00:30:32.635 --> 00:30:34.917
the photosynthetic organisms.

00:30:34.917 --> 00:30:37.907
Here is our gross primary
production

00:30:37.907 --> 00:30:39.318
absorbing sunlight.

00:30:39.318 --> 00:30:41.472
Some of that is lost to heat.

00:30:41.472 --> 00:30:44.309
Some of that is lost
to respiration.

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:47.021
Here is our little R sub A,
remember?

00:30:47.021 --> 00:30:47.849
Right here.

00:30:47.849 --> 00:30:50.906
And
some of it, the net primary

00:30:50.906 --> 00:30:56.232
productivity is available for
ingestion at the next trophic

00:30:56.232 --> 00:30:59.000
level which are the herbivores.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.849
So all we're doing here is
ganging up a whole bunch of

00:31:02.849 --> 00:31:04.892
those individual
analyses.

00:31:04.892 --> 00:31:08.870
And then the next trophic
levels are the carnivores and

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.257
then
the second carnivores.

00:31:11.257 --> 00:31:14.690
And the number of links you
have here is

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:19.920
something that is obviously
determined by the efficiency of

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.194
transfer from one to another
and the total amount of energy

00:31:24.194 --> 00:31:26.383
that comes
into the system.

00:31:26.383 --> 00:31:30.384
So here in our ecosystem we
have carbon being lost

00:31:30.384 --> 00:31:32.445
at each step to detritus.

00:31:32.445 --> 00:31:35.250
And you have feces at each
link.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.163
This all goes down and becomes
part of the detritus food web.

00:31:39.163 --> 00:31:41.397
And in
that you have two forms of

00:31:41.397 --> 00:31:41.841
carbon.

00:31:41.841 --> 00:31:44.250
You have particulate organic
carbon

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.386
which is pieces of dead carbon
floating around,

00:31:47.386 --> 00:31:48.750
dead leaves,
dead

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.318
phytoplankton,
whatever.

00:31:50.318 --> 00:31:53.250
And then you also have
dissolved organic

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:53.812
carbon.

00:31:53.812 --> 00:31:57.750
When these plants die and the
phytoplankton die

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.125
they burst open.

00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:02.307
And the glucose and amino acids
and

00:32:02.307 --> 00:32:05.631
all of that dissolve into the
water in the system.

00:32:05.631 --> 00:32:08.957
And that becomes
dissolved organic carbon which

00:32:08.957 --> 00:32:11.536
is available for this microbial
food

00:32:11.536 --> 00:32:15.282
web, an entirely different food
web that's coupled to the

00:32:15.282 --> 00:32:15.750
system.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.849
So
you have the detritivore.

00:32:17.849 --> 00:32:19.953
This the grazing food web here.

00:32:19.953 --> 00:32:22.133
The waste
from that goes to the

00:32:22.133 --> 00:32:24.083
detritivores and the microbes.

00:32:24.083 --> 00:32:27.692
And then whatever
is left over after that is

00:32:27.692 --> 00:32:30.000
called refractory carbon.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.637
That means none of the
creatures are able to break it

00:32:34.637 --> 00:32:38.325
open and really get
energy out of it.

00:32:38.325 --> 00:32:41.878
And in the big picture what is
this?

00:32:41.878 --> 00:32:45.838
We talked
about it actually last time.

00:32:45.838 --> 00:32:47.724
Fossil fuel,
exactly.

00:32:47.724 --> 00:32:52.627
This is the carbon
that actually accumulates over

00:32:52.627 --> 00:32:56.398
time that when ecosystems are
finished

00:32:56.398 --> 00:33:03.000
processing all of the primary
production.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:11.642
OK, so I'm trying to time this
right so that we make sure we

00:33:11.642 --> 00:33:15.541
have time
for the movie.

00:33:15.541 --> 00:33:23.799
So let's look at a couple of
ways we can think about

00:33:23.799 --> 00:33:24.484
this.

00:33:24.484 --> 00:33:27.087
Let's just compare.

00:33:27.087 --> 00:33:34.990
If we look at the open ocean
ecosystem versus the tropical

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:36.000
forest.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:48.333
And the average,
oh, I forgot one

00:33:48.333 --> 00:33:49.666
thing.

00:33:49.666 --> 00:33:50.333
OK.

00:33:50.333 --> 00:34:01.000
If we take now the gross
primary productivity.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.925
And I'm going to circle all of
the respirations.

00:34:04.925 --> 00:34:06.846
See the purple here?

00:34:06.846 --> 00:34:10.685
So this is all the carbon
that's being fixed.

00:34:10.685 --> 00:34:13.893
This is that is lost
to respiration.

00:34:13.893 --> 00:34:18.538
And we can define a new
parameter which is net ecosystem

00:34:18.538 --> 00:34:19.627
production.

00:34:19.627 --> 00:34:24.384
And that is gross primary
production minus the

00:34:24.384 --> 00:34:28.149
respiration of all of the
autotrophies,

00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:33.095
R sub A, minus the
respiration of all of the

00:34:33.095 --> 00:34:38.037
heterotrophic components
of the system.

00:34:38.037 --> 00:34:42.800
So that would be the
herbivores,

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:48.133
carnivores, detritivores,
microorganisms.

00:34:48.133 --> 00:34:53.864
That's all the
carbon that's respired and lost

00:34:53.864 --> 00:34:54.647
to CO2.

00:34:54.647 --> 00:34:58.000
So you can add this to this.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.933
So we'd have net ecosystem
production.

00:35:02.933 --> 00:35:09.462
Production equals GPP
minus RA minus the sum of all

00:35:09.462 --> 00:35:11.492
the heterotrophs.

00:35:11.492 --> 00:35:17.625
Now, in very mature
ecosystems this net ecosystem

00:35:17.625 --> 00:35:22.000
production is essentially
nothing.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.599
All right?

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:30.000
Everything that's produced is
consumed.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.076
For example,
in a tropical rainforest you

00:35:33.076 --> 00:35:36.811
don't have a huge
buildup of organic carbon in a

00:35:36.811 --> 00:35:38.275
tropical rainforest.

00:35:38.275 --> 00:35:41.216
Everything
that's produced is basically

00:35:41.216 --> 00:35:43.062
consumed and this is zero.

00:35:43.062 --> 00:35:44.726
But in a
young forest,

00:35:44.726 --> 00:35:48.460
say a plantation at the extreme
where you plant trees

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.273
and they're increasing in
biomass, then obviously this net

00:35:52.273 --> 00:35:54.681
ecosystem
production is a positive

00:35:54.681 --> 00:35:55.149
number.

00:35:55.149 --> 00:35:57.692
What if net ecosystem
production is

00:35:57.692 --> 00:36:06.000
a negative number?

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.300
It won't be there for long,
right?

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:14.727
You've got to have things
photosynthesizing net at least

00:36:14.727 --> 00:36:17.636
enough to maintain the
ecosystem.

00:36:17.636 --> 00:36:20.228
I
mean you can have it for a

00:36:20.228 --> 00:36:23.142
transient for not any steady
state.

00:36:23.142 --> 00:36:23.400
OK.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.580
All
right.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:28.741
Talking about ecological
efficiencies again.

00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:39.000
If we talk
about the average --

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.336
The average ecological
efficiency of the open ocean is

00:36:44.336 --> 00:36:49.357
about 25% and of
the tropical rain forest is

00:36:49.357 --> 00:36:50.392
about 5%.

00:36:50.392 --> 00:36:55.010
So the average number of
trophic levels,

00:36:55.010 --> 00:37:00.750
that's basically the number of
links in the food web in

00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:08.000
these two systems is about 7.1
and 3.2.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.714
In other words,
when you have more efficiency

00:37:12.714 --> 00:37:19.036
of transfer from one link
to another you can have more

00:37:19.036 --> 00:37:20.935
links obviously.

00:37:20.935 --> 00:37:24.902
So getting back to
humans again,

00:37:24.902 --> 00:37:31.141
and this gets back to in terms
of what we might think

00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:36.020
about as a global human
society.

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:42.000
If you go from wheat to man you
lose

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.704
90% of the energy in that
transfer.

00:37:48.704 --> 00:37:56.000
If you go from wheat to cows to
man

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:10.000
you lose 90% here and you lose
90% here.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.120
So obviously in terms of
feeding the world it's much

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.510
better to go
directly from wheat to humans

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.664
than to go from wheat to cows to
humans.

00:38:20.664 --> 00:38:24.536
You all know this but it's
important to remember that.

00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:28.360
And unfortunately
the trend in the world is to go

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:31.331
more from here to here instead
of the

00:38:31.331 --> 00:38:32.973
other way around.

00:38:32.973 --> 00:38:36.545
Just something to remember in
terms

00:38:36.545 --> 00:38:39.876
of the application of this
knowledge.

00:38:39.876 --> 00:38:40.154
OK.

00:38:40.154 --> 00:38:43.848
Finally very
quickly I'm going to skip over

00:38:43.848 --> 00:38:46.724
this and go to another way to
look at

00:38:46.724 --> 00:38:48.938
what we've been talking about.

00:38:48.938 --> 00:38:51.815
It's just another diagram of
the same

00:38:51.815 --> 00:38:52.271
thing.

00:38:52.271 --> 00:38:56.907
You have the photosynthetic
organisms that the entire world

00:38:56.907 --> 00:39:02.000
depends on, this productivity
for food and fiber.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.713
And that most of that is lost
through respiration and the rest

00:39:06.713 --> 00:39:10.577
goes to the other organisms
including detritivores.

00:39:10.577 --> 00:39:13.313
So a big
question is how much of this

00:39:13.313 --> 00:39:16.141
global primary productivity,
this global

00:39:16.141 --> 00:39:18.784
photosynthesis have humans
taken over?

00:39:18.784 --> 00:39:21.855
It's really hard to answer
that question,

00:39:21.855 --> 00:39:25.570
OK, but a lot of ecologists
have been working very

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.507
hard at understanding the
fraction of global

00:39:28.507 --> 00:39:34.007
photosynthesis that has
been what's called co-opted by

00:39:34.007 --> 00:39:35.000
humans.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.791
And the estimates range from
10% to 55%.

00:39:38.791 --> 00:39:43.729
The amount that we use
directly as food or fuel or

00:39:43.729 --> 00:39:47.443
fiber or timber is not that
great, but

00:39:47.443 --> 00:39:52.472
there's a lot of productivity
that's diverted as crop waste,

00:39:52.472 --> 00:39:54.357
burning, et
cetera.

00:39:54.357 --> 00:39:59.887
And land conversion obviously
uses up a lot of habitat

00:39:59.887 --> 00:40:01.617
and productivity.

00:40:01.617 --> 00:40:05.076
So the significant point here
is

00:40:05.076 --> 00:40:08.300
that as we co-opt this primary
productivity we change

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:11.009
dramatically
all of the food webs that rely

00:40:11.009 --> 00:40:13.382
on it, and that is what is part
of the

00:40:13.382 --> 00:40:15.849
path to extinction of a lot of
species.

00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:18.942
And the big question is
how much can we co-opt?

00:40:18.942 --> 00:40:21.690
I mean we're on the road to
taking over the

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:24.989
primary productivity of the
earth, there's no question,

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:25.844
completely.

00:40:25.844 --> 00:40:29.296
Unless we set up reserves
that's it, that's where we're

00:40:29.296 --> 00:40:30.000
marching.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.480
Now, when we're in charge of
it, is it going to function the

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.294
way we need
it to function to maintain our

00:40:36.294 --> 00:40:38.614
atmosphere and to provide us
with

00:40:38.614 --> 00:40:40.577
the food and fiber that we
need?

00:40:40.577 --> 00:40:42.478
That's still an open question.

00:40:42.478 --> 00:40:44.806
OK,
so now I'm going to show you

00:40:44.806 --> 00:40:47.230
this really neat DVD because
these

00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:50.676
pictures of food webs are
deadly dull and don't represent

00:40:50.676 --> 00:40:53.072
anything at
all of what the reality is

00:40:53.072 --> 00:40:53.367
like.

00:40:53.367 --> 00:40:55.846
So I'm going to show you three
weeks in

00:40:55.846 --> 00:40:57.755
the life of a real food web.

00:40:57.755 --> 00:41:00.141
And I want you to think about
two

00:41:00.141 --> 00:41:02.124
things when you're watching it.

00:41:02.124 --> 00:41:04.427
Don't just think you're at home
in

00:41:04.427 --> 00:41:08.378
front of your TV watching a
nature show and going brain dead

00:41:08.378 --> 00:41:09.352
or
something.

00:41:09.352 --> 00:41:12.231
Think about what you've learned
in this class.

00:41:12.231 --> 00:41:14.789
So think
about the gigatons of carbon

00:41:14.789 --> 00:41:17.284
that are flowing through this
system.

00:41:17.284 --> 00:41:20.886
More importantly this entire
food web and everything that's

00:41:20.886 --> 00:41:23.537
going on
in it is orchestrated by the

00:41:23.537 --> 00:41:27.669
information in the genes of the
organisms in the food web.

00:41:27.669 --> 00:41:30.250
That's the information content
that

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.250
structures this whole thing.

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.750
And how it's all orchestrated
and

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:38.898
coordinated and happens the
same way more or less every year

00:41:38.898 --> 00:41:41.326
is
absolutely mind blowing as far

00:41:41.326 --> 00:41:43.750
as I'm concern and a major,
major

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.077
challenge for ecology and for
molecular ecology.

00:41:47.077 --> 00:41:48.077
OK.
