00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.100
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Welcome to Google.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.170
Teller, you're
holding a microphone.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.100
Will you speak today?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.882
TELLER: No.

00:00:14.882 --> 00:00:16.358
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:17.214 --> 00:00:18.630
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Teller, what are

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.909
the origins of being silent
on stage during your act?

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.950
TELLER: You're asking me
the exact same questions

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.350
that "The New York
Times" guy did,

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.433
just as if they were right
on that piece of paper.

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:31.470
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Now, you caught me.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.970
TELLER: When I was a
teenager, I rebelled

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.710
against the idea
of magic patter,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.880
because it always
seemed redundant.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.600
A guy would be standing up there
going, here I have a red ball.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.910
Well, yeah.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.360
Or it would be a kid
like me, when I was 12,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.130
I did a Chinese
magic act where I

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.000
had a long moustache,
and a little hat,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.180
and an orange velvet rope.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.287
And I claimed to be 200 years
old and live in ancient China,

00:00:58.287 --> 00:01:00.495
because I didn't know how
long ago China was ancient.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.560
As an audience member, I
would find that insulting.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.840
So when I started to get
a little more idea of what

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.211
was going on, I thought it would
be interesting to drop patter

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.460
so that people would have
to put together what they're

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.700
looking at on their own.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.460
Nothing fools you better than
the lie you tell yourself.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.980
So if I say, here is a perfectly
ordinary pack of cards,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.230
you're going to mistrust me.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.156
If I hand you the
cards and go like this,

00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:30.570
and you shuffle
them, then you'll

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.210
believe that that's a real pack
of cards, even if it's fake.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.855
So it was partly the idea of
not doing redundant patter,

00:01:37.855 --> 00:01:41.122
and it was partly the idea of
making magic more convincing.

00:01:41.122 --> 00:01:42.830
And eventually, I
discovered that there's

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.490
all sorts of cool
things that happen.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.750
For me, because I'm not an
overpowering personality,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.930
undercutting the
kinds of places--

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.560
I was working at frat
parties at college.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.130
If I had tried to overpower
those kids with their cups

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.200
of beer, groping
their girlfriends,

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.369
they would have paid
no attention to me.

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.410
I don't think they paid
that much attention to me

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.070
the way I did it, but it was
more than I would have had

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.820
otherwise.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.449
I just set up a
couple of lawn spots

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.870
and did things like
swallow razor blades

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.552
and let them put that
together, and let

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.260
them be a little bit
creeped out by that.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.740
That compelled attention.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.420
You feel like an idiot if
you're heckling a silent guy.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.395
And then eventually,
working with Penn

00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:31.390
all these years,
what I've discovered

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.610
is there's something
absolutely incredible that

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.710
happens when you don't talk.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.160
Everything becomes
very intimate,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.451
because you're looking at them.

00:02:42.451 --> 00:02:44.310
They're looking at
you, and that intimacy

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.825
is really thrilling to me.

00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:47.950
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Now, I
saw your show on Thursday,

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.324
and you mentioned
during the show

00:02:49.324 --> 00:02:54.200
that you met Teller during
his razor blade act.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.840
PENN: It was
needles by the time.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.739
He streamlined it.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.780
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: And that
was over 40 years ago?

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.900
PENN: Yeah.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.530
The origin stories have been
every retold so many times.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.680
I don't think there's really
any truth left in them.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.100
But yeah.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.320
It was 40 years ago.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.180
When I met Teller
for the first time,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.700
I was still in high school.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.070
So that gives you some sort
of criminology on that.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.240
Teller was a high
school teacher while I

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.392
was in high school, but
different high schools.

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:31.600
TELLER: You taught Latin
and English, if I'm correct?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.150
PENN: Latin and
Greek, Greek classics.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.995
TELLER: And study hall.

00:03:36.995 --> 00:03:38.370
PENN: So it was
around that time.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.906
And I think probably, it all
depends on what we're defining.

00:03:43.906 --> 00:03:45.280
But probably with
the first trick

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.570
I saw Teller do was
probably not, as I say,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.910
in the show of the needles.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.870
But probably, you do
a thing called glorpy,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.510
I think, with a
handkerchief, or maybe

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.966
out of this world, or something.

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:55.840
You might have been
doing something backstage

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.730
at the first [INAUDIBLE] shows.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.790
If we were actually to have a
court record and read it back,

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.860
I might have seen you do
something magical before that.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.520
But he was doing a
show, and I remember it

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.860
as being in a library
in New Jersey,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.930
one of these library
basement community shows.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.900
But that doesn't
mean that's true.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.170
Probably is not.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:18.089
Probably the fact that
I remember it makes

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:19.922
it less likely to be true.

00:04:19.922 --> 00:04:21.380
TELLER: And I think
the first thing

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.460
I saw Penn do was ride a
unicycle in a pair of shorts

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.000
and mismatched sneakers
wearing no shirt,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.420
but a table cloth tied around
his neck and juggling, right?

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.600
PENN: I don't think that
would have been right.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.213
TELLER: No?

00:04:35.213 --> 00:04:36.080
See, close.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.630
There we go.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.520
PENN: But it was
around that same time.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.000
It was a classical music
show at Amherst College.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.090
We both worked at that show.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.760
That we have some evidence of.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.420
But I still think the story that
we met in Nam is much better.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.270
Maybe it's time to
just do a clean break

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.790
and just keep that from then on.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.572
I was the youngest
fighter pilot.

00:05:01.572 --> 00:05:03.190
Sounds good.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.506
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Respectable.

00:05:05.506 --> 00:05:07.420
Now, you're magicians
who advocate reason.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.740
Do you--

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.239
PENN: Although, we
weren't captured,

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:11.194
because we were good soldiers.

00:05:11.194 --> 00:05:13.514
[LAUGHING]

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.416
None of those losers.

00:05:20.416 --> 00:05:23.692
[LAUGHING]

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.100
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Oh,
America's great again.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.890
As magicians who
advocate reason,

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.500
do you find that is
contradictory or complementary

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.430
to your work?

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.420
PENN: I think it's
exactly complementary.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.580
Magic is just a playful
way of exploring

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.230
how we ascertain truth.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.720
Tellers often fond of
calling it the unwilling

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.940
suspension of disbelief.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.110
But it is a form where you
don't invite the audience

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.540
to go along with your fantasy.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.600
But rather, you force
them to, and they should

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.290
have a chip on their shoulder.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.360
So every time you do a
trick that's successful,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.410
you have taught
everybody in the audience

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.930
that some way that they
ascertain truth is incorrect.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.420
And that leads me to the
skepticism and to proscience

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.480
and works hand in hand.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.880
Now, there have been two major
schools of thought in magic.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.080
The discovery of witchcraft,
the first magic book, 1500s?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.950
TELLER: 1584.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.830
PENN: 1584.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.730
The first magic book talks
about these being tricks,

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:41.820
as opposed to real magic.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.220
And then that thread of that
way of dealing with magic

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.810
as tricks, or the
magician is an actor

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.360
playing the part of a magician.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.640
That kind of thing
goes to Houdini,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.940
and then goes to
Amazing Randi, and is

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.880
a direct line, hand in hand, and
friendly with the scientists.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.570
Anybody that comes to you when
you're that kind of magician

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.350
and says, what you're doing is
bullshit, the answer to that

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.800
is yes.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.800
It's a simple yes, and there's
no argument whatsoever.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.080
If someone comes up to us
after the show and says,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:21.140
you didn't really-- and whatever
the rest of that sentence is,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.380
the answer is of course not.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.350
We were doing tricks.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:30.680
Then there's the other school
of thought that's followed by,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.380
of course, all the people who
claimed real powers from time

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.730
in memoriam; religious
figures, and so on, up

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.290
to the spiritualists
of the 19th century.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.780
Then we get into the 20th
century, and we get Uri Geller.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.770
We disagree with them
strongly, but they

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.800
are friends of ours, David
Blane and Criss Angel,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:58.340
who do stuff like, well, last
week I was doing card tricks,

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.080
but now, I've been
studying science.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.580
And now, I can do
something that was

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.897
physically impossible before.

00:08:02.897 --> 00:08:03.980
But I'm really doing this.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:05.460
It was just card
tricks last week.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.910
What the fuck are
you talking about?

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.930
How high are you?

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.480
But I really want be
careful about this,

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.100
because I don't want
to misrepresent,

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.630
especially David
Blane's position,

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.730
because he makes the
position very strongly.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.890
And he believes
it very strongly.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.342
And we disagree, but that
does not give me the right

00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:28.550
to misrepresent what he says.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.780
But in my understanding of
what he says, and please

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.500
don't take this as what
Blane says, but rather,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.520
find out on your own.

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.480
He believes that
the magician's job

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.309
is to have somebody leave
the show with misconceptions

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:43.909
about reality.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:47.930
He wants to have it actually
bleed into the real world

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.420
and so that you leave
and you think, well,

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.900
maybe this could be this,
and maybe this could be that.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.510
In other words,
you leave his shows

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.030
possibly believing things or
considering things that he

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.240
himself knows not to be true.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.150
Now, he's never said
that in those words.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:04.450
That's my understanding.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.630
The rule we try to
follow are ideal.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:08.760
And we fail at this.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.950
But our ideal is what I think
of as the sawing a person

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.390
in half principle, which is
when you go to a magic show,

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:23.390
and you see someone sawn into
halves, discounting people

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.690
way off the bell curve, young
children and people that

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.920
are seriously mentally ill--
I really have to say that.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.770
You can't ever say everyone.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:37.020
But the vast, vast
majority of the people,

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.730
just down to the noise
on that bell curve,

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:43.600
do not leave the
theater thinking

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.070
they've witnessed a murder.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.100
That's really
important, because that

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.610
means that they understand
at a very deep level

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:53.010
that there was a trick.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.780
And then you get
to what's called

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.790
mentalism, which is
the term that magicians

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.260
use for mind reading.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.630
And then it gets
sloppy, because even

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.930
the people who don't say,
I can read minds will say,

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.830
I'm using principles of
magic, and psychology,

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.420
and study of human nature
to be able to tell you

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.350
which card you're thinking
of, as opposed to I

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.110
forced a card on
you, and I knew what

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.190
it was before the show started,
which is the actual truth.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.450
And they do all of this stuff.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.470
And some people would
leave the theater thinking

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.640
after seeing a
mentalist act that they

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:36.370
had witnessed somebody who was
incredibly good at psychology,

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.910
or incredibly good of memory
tricks, or incredibly good

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:39.870
at any of that.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.450
And that is distorting
the real world.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.540
That means you're leaving
the theater thinking

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:50.020
someone on planet Earth is able
to do something that previously

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.969
you might not have
thought they could do,

00:10:51.969 --> 00:10:54.010
or that that person could
do something that maybe

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.570
someone else can really do.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:59.020
That's a very difficult rule to
follow right across the board,

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.510
and we work really hard on it.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:03.020
We're always rewriting
stuff, because people

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.770
say to us after
the show, oh, you

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.200
can really-- and as soon
as you say that to us, it

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.320
means we have to go rewrite.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:17.130
So we do a book test, which is
a jargony term where someone

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.544
selects one book out of many.

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:19.710
All the pages are different.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.804
You close all those doors.

00:11:21.804 --> 00:11:22.470
They open it up.

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:24.910
They pick up a moment
of it, and I know

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.940
what moment they've picked.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.910
Now, to sell that, if
you're a bad writer,

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:36.430
you sell that with I
can read your mind,

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:38.770
or I can ask you
questions, and the way

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.900
you answer and
the way you react,

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.380
I can tell what you picked.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.480
Or I can read your body language
and tell what you've picked.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.100
Or I've memorized
the whole book,

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.690
and I can tell by looking
over here what you've picked.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.540
All of those are
really good stories.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.810
But the way we do it
is we are doing a trick

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:59.364
and have no special powers,
which means the trick has

00:11:59.364 --> 00:12:01.280
to be a lot stronger,
because what you've done

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.890
is you've stripped away all
misdirection, all the stuff

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.380
you can think about.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.346
And especially smart
people, while you're

00:12:09.346 --> 00:12:10.970
saying to yourself,
well, certainly you

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:11.750
can memorize the book.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:12.833
People memorize the Koran.

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:13.920
They memorize The Bible.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:14.945
That's not a lot of
stuff to memorize.

00:12:14.945 --> 00:12:15.959
You can memorize that.

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:17.500
And certainly,
there's a lot of stuff

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.379
to shows you that people react
certain ways and they're lying.

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:22.170
You can tell by the
way they react to this.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.120
And while you're
thinking of all of that,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.110
I've just had a signal to me.

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:32.330
So that makes the tricks much
harder, much, much harder.

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:36.610
And also, the term in
magic is closing the doors.

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:43.650
You're leaving the path how
it's really done that way.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.330
But at the end of that, you end
up with something that's moral.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:50.390
And I believe that
giving people information

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.620
that you know to be incorrect
about the physical world

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.420
is morally wrong.

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.560
TELLER: It's
artistically, not very

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.340
satisfying to smart people.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.420
When I see a mentalist
present something

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.930
as though maybe I really
have powers, I really go,

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.570
well, yeah, right.

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.610
And I think that a
lot of people do that.

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:15.737
And we try to write our
show-- we can only write it

00:13:15.737 --> 00:13:17.320
for people who are
as smart as we are,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.315
because we can't be
smarter than we are.

00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:20.690
But we try to
write it for people

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.480
who are at least
as smart as we are,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.840
and they all are smarter anyway.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.540
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: We have
a lot of smart people

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.060
in the audience.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:27.400
Did you see there are
two microphones on both

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.470
of our aisles if
you'd like to ask

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.800
Penn and Teller any questions.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.758
PENN: That was a segue.

00:13:29.758 --> 00:13:30.970
You could do morning radio.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:31.860
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Thank you.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.818
PENN: Let's go to Lucy
in the sky with traffic.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.019
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
I appreciate that.

00:13:38.019 --> 00:13:39.060
But yes, so they're open.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.700
If you'd like to ask a
question, please come on up,

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.575
and I'll call on you.

00:13:41.575 --> 00:13:43.182
Thanks a lot.

00:13:43.182 --> 00:13:43.720
Oh, wow.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.640
That was an honor.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.696
We got a taker.

00:13:46.696 --> 00:13:48.674
Go ahead.

00:13:48.674 --> 00:13:49.340
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.060
Mr. Teller-- obviously,
when you're on stage,

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.230
you don't talk at all.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.750
But was there any time
when you were on stage

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.040
and you were really
tempted to say something?

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.550
TELLER: Penn tells me
that sometimes when

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:08.600
I'm on stage in the dark and
something has gone wrong,

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.660
or I've bumped into something,
I will say fuck a lot.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.272
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.272 --> 00:14:15.980
PENN: The first eight
rows know that too.

00:14:18.635 --> 00:14:20.852
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Thank you.

00:14:20.852 --> 00:14:22.116
Yes sir?

00:14:22.116 --> 00:14:24.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys so
much for coming out here today.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.500
I'm a big fan of
your show, "Fool Us."

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.630
I really love watching it.

00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:29.660
I think it's a lot of
fun, and I'm always

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.250
really interested after
a trait gets done,

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.277
you guys huddle in together
and start discussing

00:14:35.277 --> 00:14:36.360
how you think it was done.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.390
And we never hear that.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:40.170
I'm always really curious
what types of things

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.040
you discuss after
you've seen a trick,

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:46.286
and you're working on trying
to figure out how it was done?

00:14:46.286 --> 00:14:48.080
PENN: Well, the show
is called, "Fool Us,"

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:51.700
but far away, it should
be call "Fool Teller."

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:54.120
Teller's smarter than
me and knows a lot more

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.290
about this stuff than I do.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.780
Mostly, what I'm doing is trying
to take what Teller's saying

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:07.170
and find a way to say what
Teller's gleaned in a way that

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.200
is entertaining and also
operates-- the difficult part

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:17.270
of that show for me is
after we've seen the trick,

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.666
I want to give enough cold
phrases that especially

00:15:20.666 --> 00:15:22.540
young people or people
who are new to magic--

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.000
but that's often
young people-- I've

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.485
pictured a 13, 14, 15-year-old
person in my mind who

00:15:31.485 --> 00:15:33.850
was similar to what we would
have been who'd be sitting

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.220
there watching the show
probably two or three times

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.210
over in maybe a
YouTube clip, listening

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.420
to what I say carefully,

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:44.630
and doing keyword searches
on all of that using a search

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:52.270
engine and be able to pull up
the actual information that

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:56.140
would give them the details; be
able to do that while talking

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.760
in a way that keeps
it entertaining

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.980
and funny for the
families that are watching

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:01.940
and just want to
watch our magic show

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.940
and don't want to get
technical about it.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.650
So I'm trying to put
all that together.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.960
While we talk, we talk
very openly about how

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.380
the trick is done obviously.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.960
We're both mic-ed, and the
people in the control booth

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.620
are listening to we're saying.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.070
And Johnny Thompson,
who I would say Teller

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.580
is the second best
magic mind alive today,

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.590
and Johnny Thompson
is the first.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.390
Johnny's our mentor.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.160
Johnny's our friend.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.280
Johnny works with us
on everything we do.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.000
Johnny's listening
to what we say,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.580
and Johnny is just telling.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.370
From the first two
or three sentences,

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.120
he's looking the producers
and going, they've got it.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.190
They haven't got it.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:45.930
And then they watched us go down
whatever rope we're going down.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.340
So all those decisions are made.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:51.450
I try to speak up, because there
have been a couple of times

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:53.580
when I've seen something
that Teller hasn't seen,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.960
or I've known a little
something, a little nuance

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.070
that Teller didn't know.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.940
And I have made a
very big mistake

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.250
at assuming Teller knew
something, like the flipper,

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.369
that I knew and had
on my desk at home,

00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:05.410
and he didn't know about.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.910
And I didn't mention it, because
I thought, he must know it.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:11.929
And then that one fooled us
when it didn't fool me at all.

00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:14.470
I just thought, since it fooled
Teller, it must've fooled me,

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:19.030
so I fooled myself, because
I'm a fucking idiot.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:21.490
But we talk about
that and then try

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:26.970
to make it as entertaining
an expose as we can.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.160
The show is a lie,
and I hope it's a lie

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.370
that many people see through.

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:38.220
We are very troubled by all
these talent show shows where

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.960
somebody comes out and talks
about someone's showmanship,

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.670
and their pitch, and
pitch is tangible,

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.160
but all this intangible
stuff, their charisma,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.370
and all of that.

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:51.590
And all I can ever do when I see
even a moment of those shows,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.150
which is probably
the most I've seen,

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:58.030
is I picture my heroes like Sun
Ra, or Tiny Tim, or Bob Dylan,

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:00.030
or how well they'd
do on those shows,

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.770
and it fills me
with rage to think

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.329
of those five empty
headed assholes judging

00:18:05.329 --> 00:18:07.620
people who they aren't fit
to eat shit off their shoes.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.260
So our show is
very specifically--

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:21.290
I believe we have never had on
the show the best act fool us.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.660
The most successful
lack from the first run

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:25.950
that we did was Piff
the Magic Dragon, who

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.120
got a whole show in Vegas and
is now on "America's Got Talen,"

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.940
and has had a huge career
that I think he would say

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.730
was launched by "Fool Us."

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.960
And yet, by the
numbers, he was a loser.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.220
His trick didn't fool us.

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.210
We gave him a standing
ovation and loved him.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:43.110
So what we're
really trying to do

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.850
there is whenever
you see a magic show,

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:49.690
you think there must
be camera tricks.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.270
And whenever you see a
magic show, you are right.

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.320
There's never been
a magic show on TV

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.670
that didn't use camera tricks.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.560
And the camera trick
is very simply multiple

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:05.100
takes and putting the
camera where you want.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.610
One very famous magician,
his producer said to me,

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.580
we don't use camera tricks.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.770
Lots of editing tricks.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:13.790
No camera tricks.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.980
And for the street magic stuff,
just repetition gives you that.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.510
If I throw u a deck
of cards right now

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:28.440
and you take your video phone,
and you go out on the street,

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.440
and you, with no skills
whatsoever, have someone

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.800
pick a card then tell them
what card they picked.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:40.120
And you do that around 50
times, you might get lucky.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.990
And if all you show was
the time you got lucky,

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.700
that could be a miracle
that no one can figure out.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.440
So people, although they may
not have stated it that way,

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.610
everybody knows that in their
heart, that everything on TV

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:54.260
is jive.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.880
So on "Fool Us," because we're
doing this silly little game

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.520
show, you know in a
really visceral way

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.130
that they can't do it more
than once, because that

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.520
would give us a leg up.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:07.600
So you're not seeing
any edits there.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.160
And you also know that it's
being done right for us

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.190
right then, and there's
a sense that you feel,

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.440
and this is-- I hate to
break it down like this,

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.470
and we contradict this.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:19.730
But it's a shorthand.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:25.180
You feel that the camera people
are on the audience's side.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.350
They're not trying to help
the magician, because it's

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.480
Penn &amp; Teller's show.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.560
Of course, it's much more
complicated than that.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.990
But I think that's
what you feel.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:36.110
So what we're talking about
during then is usually,

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.280
we're talking about
how great the act was.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:43.220
And we are hoping against hope
to be fooled, because that's

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.205
when it's the most fun for us.

00:20:45.205 --> 00:20:47.330
And the other question that
someone is going to ask

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.300
and I might as well
answer because it's

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:50.440
right in the same
sentence is do we ever

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.020
find out how they did it?

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.960
The answer is the
second they fool us,

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.805
when we go to commercial,
they run to us,

00:20:56.805 --> 00:20:59.100
and roll up their
sleeves, and go see?

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:00.200
This is how I did it.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:02.750
Cool, huh?

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:04.500
I don't think there's
been one person who

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.490
stayed cool about that.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.935
Maybe the French guy in England.

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:11.435
TELLER: The French
guy who did that,

00:21:11.435 --> 00:21:15.170
and John Lovick, who fooled
us this season with a torn

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.380
and restored piece of paper.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:16.900
PENN: Has it been on yet?

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:17.441
TELLER: Yeah.

00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:19.471
PENN: Oh good.

00:21:19.471 --> 00:21:20.570
TELLER: Yeah, it was on.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.200
PENN: Handsome Jack?

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.116
TELLER: Handsome Jack.

00:21:22.116 --> 00:21:25.700
Handsome Jack fooled us with
this simple torn and restored

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.474
paper, and it just
drove me crazy.

00:21:28.474 --> 00:21:29.890
So I kept emailing
back and forth,

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.223
and he kept dropping me little
hints, little more hints,

00:21:32.223 --> 00:21:33.087
a little more hints.

00:21:33.087 --> 00:21:35.170
And it finally turned out--
he explained it to me,

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.810
and it was just plain old
normal sleight of hand of which

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:40.510
we knew every single move.

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.360
He had just engineered it so
that we couldn't perceive it.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:46.160
I have to say one
more thing, which

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.720
is the judges on those talent
shows have nothing at stake.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.670
And we have our
reputation at stake.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.710
The very first time we
did the very first show,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.350
the first guy came
out and fooled us.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.705
And we went, holy fuck.

00:22:02.132 --> 00:22:03.340
Everybody's going to fool us.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:05.840
We're going to look like idiots.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.240
And so we end up
getting the best

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.817
of both worlds, which is we
get that tension of we'll

00:22:12.817 --> 00:22:13.650
figure this one out.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:14.733
We'll figure this one out.

00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:15.840
Oh, we failed.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.540
We failed!

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.470
Oh, joy, we failed, because
we really are trying.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.960
And any magician who
comes out and says, just

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.045
let magic wash over you,
let it wash over you

00:22:26.045 --> 00:22:29.960
with a wave of mystery,
nobody does that.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.730
And this is maybe the first
show that really acknowledges

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:39.410
that at one level, magic is
a competitive, uncomfortable

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:40.600
thing to watch.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.400
You don't watch it sitting
back letting it wash over you.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.382
You go, there's something
that looks like it's

00:22:45.382 --> 00:22:46.590
totally wrong with the world.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.880
I've got to fix that.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:51.140
Our friend, Mike Close,
describes the magician.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.910
He says, magician
is a person who

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:57.450
gives you the gift of
a stone in your shoe.

00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:00.420
PENN: And yes, we did
notice that the trophy says

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:04.320
"FU" on it, and it
wasn't an accident.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.890
We have two major shows,
"Bullshit" and "FU."

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.117
That's the way we roll.

00:23:10.117 --> 00:23:10.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:11.630
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: And
you could, of course,

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:14.440
watch "Fool Us" every Monday
at 8 o'clock on the CW.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.936
There's your plug.

00:23:16.936 --> 00:23:18.060
TELLER: Why that's tonight.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.810
PENN: You're going to
go to morning radio.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:21.072
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.200
You'll be hosting
"Rocktober" in no time.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.160
AUDIENCE: In that movie
about The Amazing Randi

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.447
that's on Netflix right
now, all the charlatans

00:23:30.447 --> 00:23:32.030
make the claim at
the end of the movie

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:33.770
that despite all
the work he's done,

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:36.036
they're making more
money than ever.

00:23:36.036 --> 00:23:37.910
Is that true, or they're
just trying to-- how

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.070
do you feel about that?

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.910
PENN: I believe everyone
that we trashed on "Bullshit"

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.600
has done at least as well or
better after we trashed them.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.960
I don't think that
means anything.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.500
I think that information
and truth on its own

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.350
is worth something.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:55.980
And the fact that
some people disagreed

00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:01.870
with us, and the attention
that we give them, and then

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.220
go and follow someone
I consider a charlatan,

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.920
I believe that's simply
the marketplace of ideas.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.740
And to think different
would be insane,

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.960
because a lot of stuff we
did on "Bullshit" is wrong.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.550
And someday, although I've never
seen it, Randi may be wrong.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:22.590
So blind faith in Randi is
no better than blind faith

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.800
in anyone else.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.590
It is a little bit
sad when people

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:30.640
that I have no doubt at all
in my mind our charlatans

00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.200
and frauds are doing well,
and I see the people duped.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.640
That is a little heartbreaking.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.820
But that's the way the
marketplace of ideas works.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.410
It means I just
have to talk more.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:41.640
The answer to bad speech
is always more speech.

00:24:45.145 --> 00:24:46.270
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yes, sir?

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.644
AUDIENCE: So this
one's for Penn.

00:24:47.644 --> 00:24:49.520
One of my favorite
things of yours

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.580
is the monologue you
did on comedic timing,

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.344
watching the space
shuttle go up.

00:24:53.344 --> 00:24:54.010
PENN: Oh thanks.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.470
AUDIENCE: And I was
wondering first off

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:58.640
if you've seen the
latest pictures of Pluto

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.660
that the Voyager's probe put up.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.220
PENN: Well, when you say
latest, I don't know.

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.520
AUDIENCE: New Horizons, sorry.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.300
PENN: I saw a bunch of them.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.130
I know they're being
downloaded still.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:12.680
AUDIENCE: Well, the ones that
have come in a recent period.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.888
I wanted to know what your
reaction was to seeing it.

00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:17.722
PENN: I don't have anything
to say about comedy on that.

00:25:17.722 --> 00:25:18.930
AUDIENCE: A tangential point.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:21.100
Also Teller, if you're
into space at all,

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:23.183
since I figure a lot of
the people in the audience

00:25:23.183 --> 00:25:24.710
are also into it.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:29.930
PENN: I have no
special awe to claim.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:34.440
It makes my heart jump the same
way it does yours, I imagine.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.690
That's universal.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:41.270
I can't believe we've sent
something that far and for that

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.060
long and didn't fuck it up.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:49.356
If it were up to me, we wouldn't
get a probe to Brooklyn.

00:25:49.356 --> 00:25:50.230
AUDIENCE: Good stuff.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:51.576
Thanks.

00:25:51.576 --> 00:25:52.700
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yes, sir?

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:53.491
AUDIENCE: Hey guys.

00:25:53.491 --> 00:25:54.890
Thanks for being here.

00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:56.236
I'm a magician--

00:25:56.236 --> 00:25:57.360
PENN: Don't blame yourself.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:02.910
AUDIENCE: Teller, I love what
you're saying about patter

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:05.090
and hanging around
the castle, you

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:10.275
see a lot of guys falling
into that, the corny magic guy

00:26:10.275 --> 00:26:10.775
thing.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:17.950
Why do you think people
fall into that kind of trap?

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:22.620
And how do we, as a
community, expand beyond that,

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.060
and what's the rebrand strategy?

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.190
TELLER: Well, my
rebrand was hiring Penn.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:35.070
Magic is, I believe,
the strongest form

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.520
you can possibly
have in the theater,

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:40.520
because it is so intense.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.920
All the other arts aspire to
a sense of the miraculous,

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:47.810
and magic is the one that
when you're right in the room,

00:26:47.810 --> 00:26:51.440
seems to actually be
producing a miracle.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.920
So the dumbest dove act
automatically has power.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.540
That means that many
people get into magic

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.640
who really have nothing to
offer except doing tricks

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.020
successfully, because if they
show the handkerchief empty

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.400
and the dove pops out,
the audience will applaud.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.290
In standup comedy, there's
no such thing to lean on.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.726
People have to get
good at talking.

00:27:14.726 --> 00:27:16.600
So I think there are a
lot of people in magic

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.710
who are just there because it
was the only thing that they

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.455
could get applause for.

00:27:22.455 --> 00:27:23.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:23.697
Thank you.

00:27:23.697 --> 00:27:25.780
TELLER: I know that sounds
depressing, doesn't it?

00:27:28.392 --> 00:27:29.850
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Thank you, buddy.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:30.644
Yes, sir?

00:27:30.644 --> 00:27:32.060
AUDIENCE: So thank
you for coming,

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.330
and I wanted to thank you
for making "Bullshit."

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.320
I really appreciated
how the show

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.720
addressed controversial topics.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.720
And even when I
didn't agree with you,

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.850
it was still handled
in an honest way

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:46.180
that I still liked
you as people,

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:50.000
and felt that you were
approaching things fairly.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.694
So my question is
were there topics

00:27:52.694 --> 00:27:55.110
that you couldn't handle on
"Bullshit" that you wanted to,

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:58.150
or anything nowadays after
that show's done that you

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.870
wish you had a chance to cover?

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.830
PENN: Yes to all those.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:07.910
The way we came up with
the topics for each season,

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:11.140
you often forget that budget
played a big part in it.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.680
We have topics that
you always want

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.010
to go to some sort
of big censorship,

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:19.070
or we couldn't take
them on or something.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:23.150
But some things were just too
expensive or not photogenic.

00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.600
We always wanted to
do things on vitamins.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.130
But you can't do that same
shot of the vitamins being

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.190
scooped up that's
used from every--

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.070
and then we couldn't get crews
in to do the real shooting,

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:37.060
and who do you talk to?

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.430
That's one of the really dull
ones, reasons we can't do that.

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:43.230
The only one we were
stopped from doing

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.012
was Scientology, which
Showtime did not want us to do,

00:28:47.012 --> 00:28:48.220
because they were frightened.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.970
There are stories
of people having

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:57.440
trouble with Scientology, and
they were frightened by that.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.480
And I made the mistake, or
maybe, it wasn't a mistake.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:04.330
I made a mistake of saying
to Trey Parker, who's

00:29:04.330 --> 00:29:07.380
a friend of ours
from "South Park."

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.020
I said, they won't
let us do Scientology.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:17.510
And just as a fuck you to us,
what they did Scientology.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:20.080
And it is a fabulous
show, and better

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.800
than we would have ever done.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.970
And also, we know we
considered ourselves

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:29.060
to be the experts on mentalism,
and talking with the dead.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:34.170
And "South Park's" John Edward
show absolutely creams us.

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:37.030
It explains cold reading
better than we ever had.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:40.110
It explains those charlatans
better than we ever have.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:45.420
They just beat us at our
own game beautifully.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:51.970
A lot of stuff we look back
on now, we started in 2001.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.760
So it's been many, many years.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.370
A lot of the stuff
we were wrong on.

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.760
We always wanted to close
and do our final show,

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.560
"The Bullshit of Bullshit,"
which we would just

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:04.250
bust ourselves.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:06.330
Who the fuck cares what
two Vegas magicians

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:07.490
think about this shit?

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:11.100
They're not scientists, and
then there's these assholes,

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.730
and really do that and go
through the mistakes we made.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:15.120
We never got a
chance to do that.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.400
We're still talking about
it with other people.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.150
Maybe Netflix or
somebody will let us

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:22.300
do "The Bullshit of Bullshit."

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.192
There's topics we did
that were much less

00:30:24.192 --> 00:30:25.150
successful than others.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:31.950
We did 84 shows, and we had
a good, solid pitch for 10

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.700
when we went to sell the show.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.170
So there were 74 that we
pulled out of our ass.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.622
But I would love to
be doing it again.

00:30:40.622 --> 00:30:41.830
I thought it was a good form.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:44.430
And I liked what
you say about this.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:51.085
We tried very hard to be
fair and extremely biased.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.190
That's what I want out of news.

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.420
I long for the
days, and I'm liking

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.980
that they're coming back, when
there was the Great Plains

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.140
Republican.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.680
And the news organizations
said right in their name

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.930
what they did.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.150
I would like news to come
on and go, good evening.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.990
I hate Obama, and
here's the news.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:21.090
Once you know that,
you can dial it in.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.410
Once you said, we're
Penn and Teller.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:24.550
We're atheists.

00:31:24.550 --> 00:31:28.900
We're libertarians, and here's
the way we see this issue,

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:31.240
I think you've got a lot
of information there.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.090
I think somebody
with very different--

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:36.360
I think a Christian socialist
can then watch that show

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.450
and know what we're
talking about.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:40.580
That's the way we
deal with people.

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.640
When friends are telling you
something, you know their bias,

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.200
and you hope that they're fair.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.290
And I will brag
on how fair we are

00:31:47.290 --> 00:31:51.030
in that we didn't do any
of the Michael Moore stuff.

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.410
I don't think you
can find-- of course,

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:59.030
you can find-- but very
rare, and only because it

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:01.550
slipped by us, is
there ever a time

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.710
that someone who is speaking
is taken out of context.

00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:08.870
There were a few people we had
on that were so goofy looking,

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:13.360
and there's no other
way to say it, ugly,

00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.710
that we, using a shot of
them making their case,

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:21.450
just made it look like
their position made

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:24.240
no sense, because they
were so unattractive.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.610
That happened in one case.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.780
And we looked at that
and said, no, no, no.

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.757
We're going to do a shot
of this person walking

00:32:29.757 --> 00:32:31.340
that's more flattering,
and then we'll

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:32.964
do shots of what
they're talking about,

00:32:32.964 --> 00:32:35.550
so that's in VO so
we don't have that.

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:38.810
And once we were accused of
taking someone out of context,

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:41.920
we went back, and did the
show again, and gave people.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.100
We had a rambling 10
minute, 10 second passage

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:47.750
that was absolute nonsense.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.690
And someone said, you've
taken out of context.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:51.190
We went back on and
did another show

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.410
and let them do three minutes
of the rambling nonsense that

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:58.172
had the 10 seconds within it
and said, there's your context.

00:32:58.172 --> 00:32:59.630
Actually, we made
them look better.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:05.630
And I learned something
about my own cynicism

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.750
from doing that show, in that
we pitched it in a cynical way.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.340
We pitched it that even
people that hated us

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.180
would still watch, and
therefore, Showtime

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.520
would still make money.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.130
And we expected to get
a lot of hate mail,

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.030
and we expected to
brag on that hate mail.

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.710
And I'm very ashamed that
that's the way I felt,

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.030
because we first
put that show on,

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:29.210
and we did some
pretty heavy ones.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.100
We did the Bible.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.610
We did the Vatican, although
Showtime never showed it again.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:35.830
But we did the Vatican.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.170
We did creationism.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:41.430
We did stuff very near and
dear to people's hearts.

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.510
And the letters we
got that disagreed

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:48.780
with us were very strong
in their disagreement,

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:51.980
and very filled with
love, and very much

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:58.200
sounded like what you said which
was I'm a follower of Jesus.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.160
I believe I have eternal life.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.840
I pray for your hearts.

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.120
You are honest.

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.360
You do a good job.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.300
You are funny.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:09.340
I believe you are fair,
and I hope you find Jesus.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.130
Sincerely, in Christ.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.710
Man, it's hard to
argue with that.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:18.240
And one of the reasons we
did not do Islam is we've

00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.989
heard you get different
letters from them.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.179
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.920
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Yes, sir?

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.500
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming here.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.280
I watched your show yesterday.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.672
It was great.

00:34:31.672 --> 00:34:33.130
I want to change
track a little bit

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:39.630
and ask you about "Tim's
Vermeer," the documentary.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.270
It was a really
great documentary

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.199
with very intriguing
results, and I

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:46.030
believe it took about
five years in the making.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:51.000
So my question is what made you
invest so much time, energy,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.330
and money into making
such a documentary?

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.650
PENN: Well, very
simply, ignorance.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:01.230
We didn't expect it to take
five years and that much money.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:05.540
That's how you get
into every project.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.220
And I'm sure
everybody in this room

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:09.415
has started a project
that was easy.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:18.840
Tim Jenison, been a dear
friend of mine for 25 years.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:23.940
I'd been spending a lot of time
just working or with my family.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.790
I hadn't spent any
time talking to someone

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:30.070
that I wasn't getting paid for
or I wasn't genetically related

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:33.860
to, and I started to
go a little crazy.

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.600
So I called up Tim Jenison,
who's an old friend of mine

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.880
and said-- he said it
was a desperate call;

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:43.230
I remember it as just
being pleasant saying,

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.046
I haven't really
talked to anybody.

00:35:45.046 --> 00:35:46.420
Why don't we have
dinner tonight?

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.780
So he flew in from Texas.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.340
We went out to have dinner.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:53.532
And over supper I
said to him, well,

00:35:53.532 --> 00:35:55.990
tell me about something that
has nothing to do with my work

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:57.990
and I can't possibly work on.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.699
Tell me something that
we can just talk about.

00:36:00.699 --> 00:36:01.740
I can just listen to you.

00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:04.564
I just need to get my mind
on other stuff besides work.

00:36:04.564 --> 00:36:06.730
And Tim said, well, how
much you know about Vermeer?

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:09.630
And I said, well, probably
the first page on Wikipedia

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:11.570
is probably what
I've got in my head.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.470
And he said, well, I think
that he might have been using

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:16.170
an optical device,
and so I built

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.360
an exact copy of
Vermeer's studio

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.560
in a warehouse in
San Antonio, and I'm

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:24.640
going to paint a Vermeer.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:30.570
And I said, boy, did you fail,
because you need to film this.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:36.950
And then I tried to get
somebody else to just make

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.030
Tim's Vermeer.

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:41.930
I wanted to just turn it over to
somebody else and say, do this.

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:45.170
And I want to just produce it
and not really be part of it.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.910
I want to not
produce it all, but I

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:48.280
wanted to just produce it.

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.210
And then we tried to find
the best director for it.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:57.250
And after many tries, Teller
was not our first choice.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:58.940
But after many
conversations with people

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.810
who didn't understand
it, we knew

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.260
Teller would understand it.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.360
So all of a sudden, it became
a Penn and Teller project.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.570
And then all of a
sudden, it turns out

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:12.210
painting a Vermeer was a lot
harder than any of us thought.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:13.875
And that took five years.

00:37:13.875 --> 00:37:17.090
A little over actually,
and a lot of money.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:19.390
The movie lost a
tremendous amount of money,

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:21.570
even though it was
phenomenally successful.

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:24.410
But fortunately, Tim
has the time, and money,

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.490
and wanted to
spread this around.

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:30.260
What I find interesting
about "Tim's Vermeer,"

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:34.570
is that more than
"Avatar," it's a movie

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.630
that rests on technology.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:40.740
There was nobody in
the world rich enough

00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.320
to make that movie 10
years before we made it.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.910
We shot how many hours?

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.120
I've forgotten now.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.470
TELLER: We ended up with
2,400 hours of usable footage.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:56.370
That's quite a ratio to a
movie that's 70 minutes long.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:38:00.180
PENN: But we had every
brush stroke covered mostly

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.610
from multiple cameras.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:04.150
There's not a time
that the brush touches

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:06.270
the canvas that isn't recorded.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:09.410
So it's a whole different
kind of documentary.

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:13.220
Most documentaries are
made after the fact,

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.251
and there's reenactment
or talking about it.

00:38:16.251 --> 00:38:19.270
We had cameras there the
whole time he was painting,

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:25.930
and some of the people who
are skeptics of Tim's theory

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:28.420
have said, well, you
could have faked this.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.170
We tell them, watch
the 2,400 hours.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:32.470
You can watch everything.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:33.990
We have no secrets on this.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.070
It's all laid out.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:42.010
So I had no particular
interest in the subject

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:43.180
or making a movie.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.860
I certainly did not
want to make a movie.

00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:50.250
But I had a love
for Tim and thought

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.250
we could make a movie that would
make everybody else love Tim

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.160
too.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:58.610
And it just seemed
important and compelling.

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:02.632
I don't know why-- Teller can
speak to why he got on board.

00:39:02.632 --> 00:39:03.590
TELLER: You invited me.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.510
I'm not going to answer that
question exactly that way.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:17.650
But making that movie
made it clear to me

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:21.640
that life is
undifferentiated experience.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.230
It's not a story.

00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:26.220
And when we went
into it, I thought,

00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:28.340
and I think we all
thought that we were

00:39:28.340 --> 00:39:30.860
making a movie about Vermeer.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.489
And we really came in
from that point of view.

00:39:34.489 --> 00:39:36.530
This was going to be a
documentary about Vermeer,

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.830
and Tim's made some discoveries
that we're going to teach you.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:41.760
And when we looked at
the first cut, which

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:47.180
was four hours or so, we began
exploring what the movie might

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.410
actually be about.

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:51.250
The first direction
that I went on this

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:55.460
was thinking that it was
Penn's story about his friend.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.790
It's about Penn reflected
off of his friend,

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:00.390
because Penn had
told me that story.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.130
And I thought, that's a nice
starting point for the movie.

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:05.100
And then we kept
watching the footage,

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.910
and it became more
and more apparent

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:10.900
that the thing that you wanted
to watch in the movie was Tim

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:15.480
and his is amazing level
of care, intelligence,

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.520
determination.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:20.140
PENN: Humility.

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:23.090
TELLER: His ability
to turn completely

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:26.790
around when he's
wrong after being

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:29.610
very certain of something.

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.770
And once we had
that, then we just

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:36.050
needed one little starting
point to try to really turn that

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:37.730
into a story.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:41.020
And I remember the
fragment of interview

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.470
that I had done with Tim,
which had been thrown out

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.590
by the editor, by the way.

00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:47.450
I just remembered having
this conversation.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.317
I said, Tim, are
you going to succeed

00:40:50.317 --> 00:40:51.400
in painting this painting?

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.200
And there was this long pause.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.560
And Tim said, at night,
when I'm laying in bed,

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.670
all I can think about is this
goal of painting a Vermeer.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.100
Paint a Vermeer?

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.100
I'm not even an artist.

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:09.640
And when I remembered
that, suddenly, the story

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:12.720
of the movie began to fall
into place, because instead

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.760
of being about Vermeer
or about Tim in general,

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.200
it could now be hung
on this very simple act

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.650
of painting the Vermeer.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.850
There's so much
fascinating information

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:27.240
that we had to summarize
in little-- Penn

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.140
and I labored over little
bits of exposition.

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:34.740
How do you talk about the
center surround phenomenon

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:35.509
with a retina?

00:41:35.509 --> 00:41:37.050
How do you talk
about that in the way

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:39.610
that somebody who's
not a retinologist

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:43.120
is going to understand
and give the audience just

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.450
enough information?

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:47.230
How do you orient the
audience in such a way

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:50.480
that those people who know
next to nothing about Vermeer

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.690
remember who he was?

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:55.810
There was so much
information that

00:41:55.810 --> 00:41:58.040
had to go into
just understanding

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:00.600
what Tim was up to that
that was a big struggle too,

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.740
just compressing
all of that stuff

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:05.420
to try to get it
so that it would do

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.290
would be a nice arc of a story.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:11.550
And I remember, premiered
it at Telluride, was it?

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.380
Yeah, Telluride.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.050
We premiered it at Telluride.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.812
And sitting in that audience,
really for the first time

00:42:16.812 --> 00:42:18.020
with a large group of people.

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:21.420
We had done almost
weekly screenings

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.310
at Penn's house for
groups of friends.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:25.842
And we said, do you
understand this?

00:42:25.842 --> 00:42:26.800
Do you understand that?

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.758
Do you understand that?

00:42:27.758 --> 00:42:28.960
And we thought we had it.

00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.460
When we premiered it
at Telluride, suddenly,

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.470
there was this one,
big, simple story.

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:34.450
Oh, goodness.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.070
Tim painted a Vermeer.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:40.930
And there were a funny moments
in it, and it was all clear.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.350
And I just sat back
with this enormous sense

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:45.790
of joy and relief
to hear this movie

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:50.680
performing itself, and getting
its laughs for the audience.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.816
Incidentally, there's a
really long passage in it,

00:42:52.816 --> 00:42:54.440
which if you've seen
the movie, there's

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:57.540
an endlessly long
passage where Tim is just

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.880
painting tiny, tiny, tiny
little dots to represent

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.320
the fibers of a carpet.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:03.890
And it goes on forever and ever.

00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:06.080
And we had trimmed it down
so that it was all nice,

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.460
and moved nice, and
it was fun, and funny,

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.616
and all that sort of thing.

00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:11.490
And then we sat back
and said, you know what?

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.690
This is not boring enough.

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.770
It doesn't really convey
the feel of what he's doing.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:20.550
So we put boring shit back in
so that now and then, you'd

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:21.120
get a laugh.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.620
And it would be relief, and
it wouldn't feel too much fun,

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:28.810
because part of it is just
act out how much not fun is

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:31.430
part of getting something
that's wonderful.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:34.570
PENN: And when we first
went out to debut it,

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.660
it was really, really
funny, because when

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.660
we would book the
movie, Telluride

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:40.930
and so on, the
question everybody

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:45.080
would ask before the show
was will Penn and Teller be

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.220
at the screening?

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:49.280
Will they be available for
questions after the screening?

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.880
And then after every
screening the question

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.520
was why were Penn and
Teller at the screening?

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.240
Why were they sitting on stage?

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.160
Because after the movie, we
would sit on a stage like this

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.820
with people asking questions,
and not one question

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:03.330
would be directed
to either of us.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.060
It was all just Tim.

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:07.170
That's what we wanted
out of the movie.

00:44:07.170 --> 00:44:10.082
TELLER: We had crazy
ideas along the way.

00:44:10.082 --> 00:44:11.540
Initially, at one
point, we thought

00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:13.720
we were going to do it all
like a "Bullshit," episode,

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.720
with Tim will paint for a
while, and Penn and Teller

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.469
will come on and do a
cute little bit that

00:44:17.469 --> 00:44:18.730
has some commentary.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:23.480
That just fell away as Tim
just came out of that movie.

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.530
PENN: We also made a
very, very heavy decision

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.470
to not have bad guys.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:31.510
The real easy structure
on that, and the structure

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:34.500
we're very familiar with is
what we do in "Bullshit,"

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.470
and then there's this asshole.

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:40.960
And once you have bad
guys, you can have heroes.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.960
Every "Bullshit" episode
is structured that way.

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.632
As a matter of fact, we make
sure we have the bad guys

00:44:45.632 --> 00:44:46.840
before we have the good guys.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.310
You've got to have them.

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:49.910
It makes the
structure really easy.

00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:53.420
We're talking among ourselves,
but also, to Steve Martin.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.140
He had an important
voice in that.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.600
And we decided, and I'm
really proud of this,

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.670
the movie does
not have bad guys.

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:05.950
And there are bad guys around
this Vermeer thing like crazy.

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:08.320
There are people that
hated Tim doing this.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.300
There are people to
think that anybody

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.870
who talks about any artist
using optics in any way

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:16.020
is defeating the
whole idea of art,

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.160
that this was full
blown from his mind.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.150
There are raving lunatics,
and there are also

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:23.940
people with credentials
saying stuff against Tim.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.140
There's really hateful
stuff against Tim.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:30.270
We just decided that what Tim
was doing was so beautiful,

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.230
we didn't want to
show the other side.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:36.310
So you see it's shadow
boxing that you're watching.

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:38.029
You're not watching a contest.

00:45:38.029 --> 00:45:39.070
I'm really proud of that.

00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:42.660
Of the whole movie, that's
one of the decisions

00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.140
we made that I'm
really happy we made.

00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:47.907
TELLER: We also had
to decide-- for those

00:45:47.907 --> 00:45:50.240
of you who haven't seen the
movie, I'm talking nonsense.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.930
But we had to decide
where to end the story.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.430
A lot of people
said, well, you have

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:58.060
to show the footage
to people who disagree

00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.930
and let them comment on it.

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:01.990
Then we thought about Tim.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:05.000
Tim's idea was can I do this?

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.400
Can I satisfy myself?

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.580
Can I do this experiment
and be confident

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.610
that I have probably
the right explanation?

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:15.550
When we thought about
that we just said,

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:18.920
when Tim finishes the
action of the painting,

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:22.010
that's when the story ends.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:25.680
That gives it a conciseness
that was very satisfying to us,

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.950
because otherwise, it could
just have gone on forever,

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:30.037
which after five years,
you don't want it to do.

00:46:30.037 --> 00:46:31.620
CLIFF LUNGARETTI:
Speaking of the end,

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.590
we have time for one more
question, no pressure.

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:34.480
PENN: Make sure it's a good one.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.420
AUDIENCE: I hope it is.

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:36.520
So you got me really curious.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.980
What would you put on "The
Bullshit of Bullshit" episode?

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.940
What did you believe then that
you no longer believe now?

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:45.370
PENN: It's really
hard to do that,

00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:49.060
because when we weren't
sure of something,

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:54.750
we couched it, and hemmed,
and hawed to put things in.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:58.510
The second hand smoke
episode, we certainly

00:46:58.510 --> 00:47:03.700
say that the science on the
dangers of secondhand smoke

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.850
is not robust, which at
the time, it was not.

00:47:06.850 --> 00:47:08.660
We were accurate at the time.

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:13.180
Now, the studies have come out,
and they seem much more robust.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:17.760
But it was all couched
in should the government

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.000
have control over this?

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.950
In other words, do
you have a right

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:23.530
to do something to
yourself that's dangerous?

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:26.670
So the overall point,
people try to say,

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:31.350
would you take back the entire
secondhand smoke episode?

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:34.090
Now, I think secondhand
smoke is dangerous,

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.240
and I think people
have the right

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.290
to expose themselves to that.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:43.940
People say that our global
warming episode was incorrect,

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:47.260
except we never did a
global warming episode.

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:52.030
What they're talking about is
we had a certain kind of eye

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:58.130
rolling and scoffing, and we
were pretty upset at Al Gore

00:47:58.130 --> 00:48:05.480
selling the carbon credits
as though they were

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:07.350
indulgences from the church.

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:09.610
It didn't really do anything.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.150
It was just Al
Gore saying, you're

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:12.649
going to feel better
about yourself.

00:48:12.649 --> 00:48:15.140
So our attack was
against Al Gore.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:19.630
I think anyone attacking
Al Gore is fine any time

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.960
for the rest of forever.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:25.240
I think that is
bottom level truth.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.360
That is like pi that
you can attack Al Gore.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:34.470
But certainly, the
idea that there

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:40.300
may be anthropogenic
climate change

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:42.110
is much more robust
when we did it,

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:45.410
except we didn't do an
episode really attacking that.

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:48.840
So what people are attacking
us for, and they do

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.210
is our nuances and our
attitude toward that.

00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:54.750
Although, I don't believe
we said anything wrong

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:55.580
during that.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:57.930
But if we did a
"Bullshit of Bullshit,"

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:02.530
we would spin that to make
ourselves more wrong to then

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:07.064
be able to attack and do that
same dichotomy we did not do on

00:49:07.064 --> 00:49:09.230
"Tim's Vermeer," which is
what we do do on bullshit.

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:11.920
We would do everything we
could to make us the villains.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:15.150
Hypnotism, I think the
show was a cluster fuck.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:18.010
We didn't have any sense of
what we were trying to say

00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:19.950
or any sense of
what the truth was.

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:21.890
We just stumbled through that.

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:26.130
There was a couple episodes
on nostalgia and stuff

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:29.030
that were filler episodes that
we did because we had no money,

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:32.110
and Teller and I were
not behind that I

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:33.660
would like to rip
the fuck to pieces,

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.430
because there was a
few moments that I

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:38.190
felt that we tried hard not to.

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:41.030
But in the final end,
there was a sense

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:43.550
of showing disrespect
to people who

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:45.040
are obsessed with something.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.170
And anybody who shows disrespect
to people who are obsessed

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:54.070
is a pig, whether it's
Civil War reenactors,

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:56.020
whether it's
treckers, whether it's

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.640
Minecraft, whether
it's video games,

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.430
or whether it's classical music.

00:50:00.430 --> 00:50:02.760
If someone has a
love and obsession,

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.650
they are 12 feet
tall and bulletproof.

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:06.870
And there was a few
times we rolled our eyes

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.250
and made fun of them.

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:10.100
ashamed at that.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.600
TELLER: Can I answer
really quickly?

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:15.150
On that episode also, the
way these were generally

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:17.472
put together is that
we would discuss

00:50:17.472 --> 00:50:19.680
what we thought we were
going to do with the episode,

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.096
and then we would send our
producers and our research team

00:50:22.096 --> 00:50:22.820
out.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:28.970
They would come back with a
sequence of documentary scenes,

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:31.510
and then we would write
the interstitial stuff that

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:34.730
explained our positions, and
we would write to the VO.

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:38.020
There were a couple of times,
and the good old days one

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:41.720
is one of those episodes where
the producers were absolutely

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.300
at odds with us.

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.840
They really wanted to roll their
eyes over Civil War reenactors.

00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:49.500
So we had to take the
exact documentary footage

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.360
and turn the intention
of it upside down

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.930
to our point of view,
which was in that case,

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:58.280
not only challenging,
but a failure.

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.180
PENN: And the other case,
which was less of failure,

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.015
was they did a thing
on speed dating.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.350
The producers had
decided that people

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:12.680
who did speed dating, and
computer dating, and so on

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:13.275
were losers.

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.450
During the "Bullshit,"
I've never even more upset

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:23.570
at any first cut of one before,
because the villains were

00:51:23.570 --> 00:51:26.820
the heroes, and the
heroes were the villains.

00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:33.110
I believe that any way that
two people consensually

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:35.590
engage in sex is good.

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:37.910
However they decide
to do that is great.

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:40.700
Electronics, and
speed dating, any sort

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:44.890
of culture around that, it does
not matter how you find love.

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:47.180
It does not matter
how you fall in love.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.980
They were saying that
there's some good way

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.470
to do it, like you run down
the beach in slow emotion

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:55.190
and meet someone, and
there's some bad way

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.310
to do it, which is typing.

00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:01.790
I disagree.

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:04.600
I was seeing red
on that episode.

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.280
And we actually ended
up, if you happen

00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.980
to watch whatever it is,
it's the true love episode.

00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:12.030
If you ever happen to see that
episode coming up on Amazon

00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:14.960
or where it pops up, and
you watch the footage,

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:17.400
and listen to my VO
and our wraparounds,

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.625
you'll be able to imagine that
it was exactly the opposite.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.620
And we did that a few times.

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:28.200
So I think mostly,
if we're going

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.616
to do a "Bullshit
of Bullshit," we

00:52:29.616 --> 00:52:35.260
haven't got really egregious
mistakes that are as much fun

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.470
as we'd like them to be.

00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:40.730
But I would like it to be an
ad hominem attack against us,

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:43.260
because I finished high
school in a plea bargain.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.880
Teller's degree from
colleges in the classics.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.720
If there are two
people who are not

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:55.310
qualified to talk about science,
it's two jive ass, Las Vegas,

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:57.650
fucking empty headed magicians.

00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:59.550
That's what the show
would mostly be.

00:52:59.550 --> 00:53:02.110
The show would mostly
be embarrassing pictures

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:05.610
of us with Donnie and
Marie doing stupid tricks

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:08.210
and then say, who the
fuck are these assholes

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:10.410
to talk about science?

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:11.490
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Thanks.

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:14.073
PENN: I would like to end with
who the fuck are these assholes

00:53:14.073 --> 00:53:15.952
to talk about science?

00:53:15.952 --> 00:53:19.320
CLIFF LUNGARETTI: Ladies and
gentlemen, Penn and Teller.

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.520
Thank you guys.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:23.870
[APPLAUSE]
