00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.090
We're on problem 214.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.950
Of the 50 researchers in a
work group, 40% will be

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.070
assigned to team A.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.400
So let's call that team A.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.350
Of the 50 researchers working,
40% percent will be

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.120
assigned to team A.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:24.240
So 40% of 50, that's equal
to 20 go to team A.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.870
And the remaining 60%
go to team B.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.370
So B gets the remaining 60%,
which is 30 people, right?

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.020
60% percent of 50 is 30.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.690
However, 70% of the researchers
prefer team A, and

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.600
30% prefer team B.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:50.250
So 70%, which is what,
35, prefer A, and

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.750
30% prefer team B.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:01.210
So the remainder, which is 15,
right, or 30% of 50, prefer B.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.650
What is the lowest possible
number of researchers who will

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.740
not be assigned to the
team they prefer?

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.390
So there's a lot of
pseudo-double negatives here.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.350
What is the lowest possible
number of researchers who will

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.060
not be assigned to the team
that they prefer?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.620
So this is -- I have to read
that a couple of times.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.130
What is the lowest number of
researchers who will not be

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.050
assigned to the team
they prefer?

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.360
So essentially they're saying
this is the case where most

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.880
people get the team they
prefer, right?

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.210
Where as many people as possible
to get the team they

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.960
prefer, and then we want the
lowest number of people who

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.280
didn't get the team
they prefer.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.420
So what's the situation?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.190
Well, the best situation is --
let's see, 35 prefer A, so

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.125
let's say that 20
of them got A.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.590
And then 15 fall into
this upset category.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.380
And likewise, out of these 15
that prefer B, well, I don't

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.919
know, let's say that
all of them got B.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.310
All of these got B, but then we
have to put another 15 in

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.480
B, and that's these 15 people.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.320
So the best case scenario in
which all of these people get

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.300
B, and 20 of these people get
A, but then you've got to

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.330
stick 15 people of these in B,
so those 15 people are going

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.570
to be upset.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.000
And so that is the lowest
possible number of researchers

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.680
who will not be assigned to
the team they prefer, so

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.930
that's these 15.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.180
And that's choice A.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.240
Problem 215.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.780
If m is the average of the first
ten positive multiples

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.850
of 5, m is equal to average of,
I don't know, let's call

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.840
it multiples of 5, and M is the
median of the first ten --

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.390
and this is the first ten --
and M-- big M-- is equal to

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.430
the median of the same thing,
what is the value of big M

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.180
minus small m?

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.460
So let's just write them out.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.690
I think that's the simplest
way to do it.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.580
The first ten multiples of 5.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.130
5, 10 -- the first ten positive
multiples of 5.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.070
Right, so we won't count 0.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:45.760
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 --
actually, let me write it

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.620
another way, I know this
is a little confusing.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:04:02.930
So this is 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,
30, 35, 40, 45, and 50.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.920
And I just thought of writing
it that way for a reason.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.660
So, first of all, they want a
little m, which is the mean.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.390
Little m is equal to the
average of this.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.130
Let me ask you a question.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.740
If you average-- so I paired
these numbers from the lowest

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.230
to the highest, second lowest to
second highest. If you take

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.110
the sum of this one and
this one, you get 55.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.850
This one and this
one, you get 55.

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.000
This one and this
one, you get 55.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.250
So I think you get the point.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.960
The sum of any two
of them are 55.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.540
So if you take the average of
any of these, the average of 5

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.840
and 50 is 27.5.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.850
And that's going to actually be
the average for the whole

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.700
set, because you can
pair them up.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.950
The average of 25
and 30, 27.5.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.650
The average of 20
and 35 is 27.5.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.630
And if you don't believe me, I
mean, there's a bunch of ways

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.470
you can think about this.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.160
You could say, oh, this is
the same thing as 55.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.470
If you wanted to figure out the
sum of this, you can say

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.680
if I sum these, it would
be 55 times 5.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.990
So you'd have-- the sum of all
of them would be 55 times 5

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.140
divided by the total of all of
them, which is 10, which is 55

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.490
times 1/2, which is 27.5.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.300
Anyway, there's a bunch of ways
to think about it, but I

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.870
just wanted to show you a quick
way of figuring out the

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.940
average of the first
ten multiples of 5.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.790
And then they want to know
what is the median of the

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.650
first ten positive
multiples of 5?

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.660
So the middle numbers--
so there's two middle

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.860
numbers, these two.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.010
So when you have two middle
numbers, you take the average

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.250
of them to get the median.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.160
Well, guess what?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.410
The average of those
two is 27.5.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.440
So big M is equal to 27.5.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:45.930
So big m minus small m is
0, and that is choice B.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.040
Next question, 216.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:06:01.530
If m is greater than 0, and x is
m% of y-- so x is equal to

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.260
m/100 times y, right?

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.430
If m is 6%-- and this'll
turns into 0.06, right?

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:21.090
x is m% of y, then in terms of
m, y is what percent of x?

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.520
OK, so let's multiply both
sides of this by 100/m.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:31.230
So you get 100/m x, and 100/m
times m/100 is just 1 is equal

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.950
to y, right?

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.450
Let me switch the order to so it
makes a little more-- y is

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:44.080
equal to 100/m times x.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.880
So if I wanted to write this
as a percentage, this right

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.620
here is going to be some
type of decimal number.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.330
And so if I have a decimal and
I want to multiply, and if I

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:58.090
want to express it as a
percentage, I mean, if this

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.900
right here is 1, if I wanted
express it as a percentage, it

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.330
would be 100%.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.755
If this right here ends up being
0.2, I would multiply it

00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:07.690
by 100 and get 20%.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.730
So to express this as
a percentage, I'd

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.270
multiply it by 100.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:18.400
So 100/m times 100 is
equal to 10,000/m.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.380
And that is choice E.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.040
10,000 over m%, which
is the same thing

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.260
as 100/m as a decimal.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.870
Next question, 217.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.120
I'll use green.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.660
A certain junior class has 1,000
students, so the junior

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.550
class has 1,000 students,
and a certain senior

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.570
class has 800 students.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.820
So some people dropped out.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.350
Maybe they didn't.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.610
Maybe it started bigger
or smaller.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.250
Among these students there
60 sibling pairs.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.220
60 siblings-- I already sense
a Venn diagram coming-- each

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.080
consisting of 1 junior
and 1 senior.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.050
If one student is to be selected
at random from each

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.880
class, what is the probability
that the two students selected

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.330
will be a sibling pair?

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.980
If one student is to be selected
at random from each

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.340
class, what is the probability
that the two students will be

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:25.630
a sibling pair?

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:28.220
OK, so how many sibling
pair members are

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.090
there in each class?

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.460
Well, there have to be
30 in each class.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.990
So there's 30 sibling pair
members in that class and

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.400
there's 30 sibling pair
members in that class.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.610
OK, so if one student is to be
selected at random from each

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.320
class, what is the probability
that two students will be a

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.040
sibling pair?

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.690
OK, so let's say we pick a
student from the junior class

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.150
first, right?

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.570
So first of all, what's the
chances that they're even part

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.820
of a sibling pair?

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.710
Well, that's going to be--
there's 30 of them that are

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:03.910
part of a pair, and there's
1,000 in the class, so the

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:08.740
probability of that happening is
30/1,000, which is the same

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.250
thing as 3/100, right?

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.610
That's the probability that
we got a part of a pair.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:23.810
Now we're going to go and pick
someone from the senior class.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.390
If we want to find this guy's
sibling, we can't just find

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.630
another sibling pair, we've
got to find this

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.350
guy's actual sibling.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.070
So actually, only one person in
the entire senior class is

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:36.510
going to be-- whoever this
person we pick from the junior

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.300
class, if we did happen to pick
one, the only way that we

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.990
got an actual sibling pair is if
we pick that one person in

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.620
the senior class who is
this person's sibling.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.340
So there's actually only
a 1 in 800 chance

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.000
that we picked them.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.530
So if we multiply that out,
that is equal to 3 over--

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.050
let's see, what is it?

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.160
80,000?

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.570
3/80,000, which is not
one of the choices.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:02.820
So what did I do wrong?

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:06.580
Here.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:10.520
So I see 3/40,000, and for some
reason, I think maybe I'm

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.520
not counting two scenarios.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.310
There's probably two scenarios
in which is

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.360
this can occur, right?

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:24.150
I could have picked-- if I go to
the junior class first and

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.620
there's a 30 in 1,000 chance
that I pick the correct

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:34.020
sibling, so that's 3 in 100, and
then the odds that I take

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:40.120
his or her sibling from the
senior class is 1 in 800.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.960
But maybe then-- let me see if
I'm missing some logic here.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.470
Maybe I could have picked--
