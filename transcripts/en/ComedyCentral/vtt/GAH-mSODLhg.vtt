- Hell yeah, I'll tell you
a story about me drowning.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:21.147
Uh, yes, I drowned.
I literally drowned.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.449
And the audience is like,
"Wow, that's amazing,

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:26.419
"you being so large and buoyant.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:29.088
You--how would you drown?"

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.691
Well, it was--
it was when I was smaller,

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:32.925
if you can believe it.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:35.128
I was a little younger.
I was a kid.

00:01:35.128 --> 00:01:39.365
I was in this day camp
at this little day care

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:42.034
where, you know, they--
my mom, it was free,

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:43.936
so she put me in the day care.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:46.639
We up there with these little
stupid-ass kids,

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.641
and we was like 11 and 12,
so he was--

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.309
I used to beat them up

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:52.311
and take the peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches, you know,

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:54.313
and our counselor,
she was, you know,

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:55.948
she was--she smoked weed.

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:57.850
She was a--
she was a whore.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.451
You know what I'm saying?

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:02.288
She was nasty, and she didn't
know what to do with us.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.824
We didn't have no arts
and crafts or nothing.

00:02:04.824 --> 00:02:06.459
She didn't do shit with us.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.560
We just hung out, playing--

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.896
making up our own games, man--

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:12.365
"Kiss me, you can finger me."

00:02:12.365 --> 00:02:15.667
You know, them little--

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.636
And that got old after a while

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:19.839
and they ran out of hand soap,

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.340
so that--that--

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.878
that wasn't gonna be
a fun night, you know.

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:27.680
You know, but I--
when I--

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.849
And this--this day camp
was in a, uh,

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.185

predominantly, you know,

00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:34.720
suburb--may I say,
you know,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.023
like it is in here,
more whites than blacks,

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:39.525
you know, and--
and I used to live in the hood,

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.861
you know, and when I got
around white people,

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:44.163
there was a lot of things
that was different.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:47.333
White people have season passes
to Six Flags,

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:50.336
and they could go
a bunch of times.

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.172
But the main thing was
the white girls.

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:55.241
That threw me for a loop.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.677
I had never seen
a white girl before.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:01.947
I had never seen nobody named
Rebecca or Samantha

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:05.117
or Elizabeth, you know?

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:08.054
I--I was around Lakeeshas
and Sharondas.

00:03:08.054 --> 00:03:09.556
You know what I'm saying?

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:12.257
You know, Chiquita, you know,
that was my girls,

00:03:12.257 --> 00:03:15.895
and when I seen Elizabeth, man,
oh, my God.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:18.364
She was cute,
she had red hair,

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:21.099
and her cheeks were, like,
rosy like a cartoon,

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.202
like Charlie Brown, you know.

00:03:23.202 --> 00:03:26.072
Little Charlie Brown girl you
had a crush on back in the day.

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.806
Her cheeks was red.

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:29.775
And one thing
a white girl could do

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:31.777
that just blew my mind?

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:34.246
She could put her hair
behind her ear.

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:35.915
That just...

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:38.918
Oh, my God!

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:41.420
That was so sexy to me!

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.756
I was like, holy shit!

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.157
Do that again, Elizabeth.

00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:47.293
She's like, "What are you
talking about?"

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:48.894
Oh, man, I was--

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:51.230
I'd break out in a cold sweat.
I could--

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.298
I was in love with her from--

00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:54.600
from that day on.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.002
I followed her everywhere.

00:03:56.002 --> 00:03:59.338
"Please put your hair
behind your ears for me.

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:00.673
Just for the day."

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:03.109
"Lavell, I'm sick of
doing this for you."

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.276
Oh!

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.345
And--and this little--
little girl

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:08.780
that was from my neighborhood,
her name was Shakeesha.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.617
She couldn't stand me 'cause
she loved me.

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:13.085
She was--had a crush on me,

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:15.120
but she was mad
'cause I liked Elizabeth.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.455
She went to the day camp too.

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:17.957
"Why you like that little
ugly white girl?

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.425
Why you like
that ugly white girl?"

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:23.696
I said "First of all,
watch your damn mouth

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:26.098
"around my white woman,
all right?

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:29.035
"You're being highly
disrespectful.

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:31.103
"Second of all, Shakeesha,

00:04:31.103 --> 00:04:33.973
can you put your hair
behind your ear? Huh?"

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:35.807
She said, "Yeah, I can."

00:04:35.807 --> 00:04:37.209
She tried, and it popped out,

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:39.478
and she tried again,
it popped out.

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:40.980
I said, "I ain't got no more
fucking time for you,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.281
all right?"

00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:44.149
She said, "Let me get
some hair oil."

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:45.718
Fuck that,
I ain't got no time!

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.620
If you can't do it on your own,
you don't

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.157
need to do it at all.

00:04:53.026 --> 00:04:56.162
So, one--you know, one day,
we was at day camp,

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:57.529
and we was trying to--

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.299
we were supposed to go to a--
a--you know,

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:02.168
go do something
with the counselor,

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:04.303
and she couldn't find out
nothing to do,

00:05:04.303 --> 00:05:06.004
but she wanted to see
her boyfriend.

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:07.706
I heard her on the phone
talking to him.

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:09.042
"I'm gonna come over, Robert.

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:10.810
"I'm gonna see
if I can get away.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.012
I'm gonna bring the kids over
and let 'em go swimming."

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.680
I heard her say it,
and I was like,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.714
fuck it, I'll go swimming,

00:05:15.714 --> 00:05:17.016
if you gonna take us swimming.

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:19.251
You know, kids love to swim,
you know.

00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:21.153
I don't--I couldn't swim.
I'm black.

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:24.057
We don't swim.
You know, black kids don't swim.

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:26.826
We learned later after one of
our friends died,

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:28.393
we'd learn how to swim.

00:05:28.393 --> 00:05:30.363
You know? And we--

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:32.731
This is black swimming:
when we're at three feet,

00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:34.200
we walking on the water, like,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.404
whoa, look at me,
I'm swimming, player!

00:05:38.404 --> 00:05:40.106
We just go over and put
our foot on the deep--

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:44.177
ooh, shit,
I almost got in there!

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.012
And that's how--
that's how black--

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.212
that's how
black pool parties are.

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:49.581
We don't go in the deep shit.

00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:53.753
We jump off the diving board
close to the side and get out.

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:56.522
If somebody try to push you,
"Bitch, I'll fuck you up,

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.390
"if you push me again.

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.594
Stop playing.
I just got my hair done."

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:03.295
But we--we don't--
we don't swim.

00:06:03.295 --> 00:06:05.464
But I wanted to go,
and she said, "Hey, guys,

00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:07.533
"I'm gonna take you over
to my apartment complex,

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.569
but you can't tell anybody
where we're going."

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.103
'Cause she wasn't
supposed to take us

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:13.138
away from, you know,
the day care center.

00:06:13.138 --> 00:06:15.107
We wasn't supposed to leave
the premises,

00:06:15.107 --> 00:06:17.042
but she doing some foul shit.

00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:18.744
She said--we went over there.

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:20.813
She didn't even watch--
she watched us for five minutes.

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:22.247
We was unsupervised.

00:06:22.247 --> 00:06:24.950
All these 11, 12 years old,
all by ourself.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:26.585
And it was cool
'cause I was trying

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:28.053
to get up on Beth anyway,

00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:30.055
so, you know,
we jump in the water.

00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:33.259
I had on my little Aquaman,
uh, swim shorts.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.327
They tight up--
a little tight up in my crotch.

00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:36.928
You know,
I'm ready to get out there

00:06:36.928 --> 00:06:38.797
and follow Beth around the pool.

00:06:38.797 --> 00:06:42.001
She was cool as long was we was
in, you know, three feet,

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:43.836
but Beth was trying
to get away from me.

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:48.107
Apparently she wasn't as into me
as I thought she was.

00:06:48.107 --> 00:06:50.176
But I was like,
"What's wrong, Beth?

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:52.111
"Come on, baby. Slow down.

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:54.914
Put your hair behind your ear
and let's talk."

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:58.484
You know, and she kept going,
"Leave me alone,"

00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:00.953
and she just started floating,
and I'm following her,

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:04.323
you know, and I'm mesmermized
by her beauty, you know.

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:07.793
Her--the hair behind her ears
just have me hip--

00:07:07.793 --> 00:07:10.262
hypmatized, and I'm--
I'm following her

00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:12.931
all the way over there,
and then I noticed

00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:15.101
that I wasn't paying attention.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.203
I'm still walking
under the water,

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:19.838
but the water
over my damn nose.

00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:21.507
But I kept walking with her.

00:07:21.507 --> 00:07:25.511
Next thing you know,
she took off like a feather.

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:28.614
Just floating across the water,
'cause she white.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:29.815
They know how to swim.

00:07:29.815 --> 00:07:32.852
She swam real well,
like a damn mermaid.

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:35.354
And I went under
the damn water.

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:37.390
I didn't know what--
I'm under the water.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.626
Bloop!
I'm sitting around like...

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:46.998
This is weird.

00:07:46.998 --> 00:07:48.868
Why ain't I floating like Beth?

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:50.636
I don't know what I can do

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:53.005
to get up on the water
like Beth,

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:55.140
and man, this is weird,

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.144
because I don't know why

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.179
I can't breathe now.

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.547
And I'm under there,
"This is bullshit!"

00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:03.582
I'm gonna...
[sputtering].

00:08:03.582 --> 00:08:05.250
And I didn't know what to do.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.852
I was trying to get up,

00:08:06.852 --> 00:08:08.854
but I couldn't get up,
I couldn't get up.

00:08:08.854 --> 00:08:11.757
Next thing you know,
I've disappeared.

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:13.525
In my mind, I was gone,

00:08:13.525 --> 00:08:16.495
and all I dreamed about
is white women

00:08:16.495 --> 00:08:19.865
just leaving me
all over the place.

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:21.199
And when I woke up,

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:22.768
I'm laying on
the side of the pool.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:25.537
The camp counselor,
she freaking out, like,

00:08:25.537 --> 00:08:28.106
"Oh, shit, I'm gonna
lose my fucking job."

00:08:28.106 --> 00:08:30.375
Fuck me.
Hell with me.

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:32.678
She didn't care
if I was alive or not.

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:34.547
She worried about her job
'cause she wasn't even there.

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:37.783
She was over there, probably
doing some ungodly shit

00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:39.184
with her boyfriend,

00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:40.786
smelling like marijuana.

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.922
And the paramedic's trying
to give me mouth-to-mouth,

00:08:43.922 --> 00:08:46.358
which, that woke me up, 'cause

00:08:46.358 --> 00:08:47.526
you ain't gonna put
your lips on me

00:08:47.526 --> 00:08:49.228
and I don't know you.

00:08:49.228 --> 00:08:50.863
I came through,
and I threw up.

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:54.400
I had died--they said I was
unconscious for ten minutes.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.568
I was dead! I died!

00:08:56.568 --> 00:08:59.038
And I'm sitting there,
like, damn,

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.806
I--I died?

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.409
And Beth? Where is Beth?

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:06.445
Beth's stinking ass had
went home with her parents.

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:09.081
They had sent everybody home,
and she left me.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:12.584
That dirty bitch.

00:09:12.584 --> 00:09:14.420
And after that, I didn't like

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.823
white girls never again.

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.425
I went back to Shakeesha.

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.893
I said, "Shakeesha,

00:09:21.893 --> 00:09:26.766
"I don't care if you can't put
your hair behind your ears.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:28.801
"Can you swim?

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:29.935
"Fuck swimming.

00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:33.438
You gonna be my boo for life."

00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:37.276
That's my story.
