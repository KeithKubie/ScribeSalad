00:00:00.192 --> 00:00:04.130
- [Teacher] I have five
three-dimensional shapes over here.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.130
I also have five names for them.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.817
What I want you to do is pause this video

00:00:08.817 --> 00:00:11.731
and think about which of these
shapes is a square pyramid.

00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:13.365
Which of these is a rectangular prism?

00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.176
Which one is a triangular prism?

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:19.257
Which one is a sphere and
which one is a cylinder?

00:00:19.257 --> 00:00:20.812
Let's just work through this together.

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.978
Really, this is just something to know,

00:00:22.978 --> 00:00:25.869
because some people in various subjects

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.563
will sometimes throw out these words.

00:00:28.563 --> 00:00:32.698
First, let's think about which
one is the square pyramid.

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:36.477
This shape here on the right
clearly looks like a pyramid,

00:00:36.477 --> 00:00:38.995
and the thing that makes
it a square pyramid

00:00:38.995 --> 00:00:40.363
is the idea

00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:42.771
that its base is a square.

00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.307
Let me see if I can shade this in.

00:00:45.307 --> 00:00:48.224
So the base of this right over here

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:50.632
is a square.

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:54.906
That's where the square
pyramid comes from.

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:56.274
If it's a triangular pyramid,

00:00:56.274 --> 00:00:58.482
then the base would only have three sides,

00:00:58.482 --> 00:01:00.722
but this is a square pyramid.

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:01.722
So let me...

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:04.526
Move this over there.

00:01:05.852 --> 00:01:08.185
So that is a square pyramid.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.171
Alright, let's do the next one.

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:14.089
Which one is a rectangular prism?

00:01:14.089 --> 00:01:18.145
A prism you can view as a
three-dimensional object,

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:22.033
and since it's saying a rectangular prism,

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:24.967
well, the best one here
that is rectangular,

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:27.072
notice, this shape right
here is rectangular

00:01:27.072 --> 00:01:29.516
on every side, and it's three dimensions.

00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:33.630
It is a prism, and so this
is the rectangular prism.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.548
So let's move that over.

00:01:35.548 --> 00:01:36.911
So that

00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:37.744
is our

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:40.486
rectangular

00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:42.103
prism.

00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:43.936
Now, triangular prism.

00:01:45.476 --> 00:01:47.651
So this one is interesting.

00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:49.851
If you look at this shape right over here,

00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:52.422
it has sides that are triangles.

00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:55.934
You see this up here is a triangle

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:58.829
and you see this down here is a triangle,

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.596
although they're connected
by these rectangular sides.

00:02:01.596 --> 00:02:05.242
This is actually what's
called a triangular prism.

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:08.534
In a square pyramid, the
faces which are triangles

00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:10.047
all meet at a point.

00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:13.751
In a triangular prism, you
have two opposite-facing sides

00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:14.742
that are triangles.

00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:18.339
You'll see all of these
in different orientations.

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:20.343
Sometimes it'll be resting like this,

00:02:20.343 --> 00:02:21.939
sometimes it'll be on it's side,

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.228
but this is a triangular prism.

00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:25.061
Let me...

00:02:26.001 --> 00:02:26.834
So that is

00:02:28.088 --> 00:02:29.088
a triangular

00:02:30.042 --> 00:02:30.875
prism.

00:02:32.814 --> 00:02:34.578
And so we have two left.

00:02:34.578 --> 00:02:36.261
You might be able to figure these out.

00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:38.291
Which one is a sphere?

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:41.632
When I think sphere, I think of a globe.

00:02:41.632 --> 00:02:46.143
This choice right over
here is clearly a sphere.

00:02:46.143 --> 00:02:47.976
Let me move that over.

00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:54.682
Let me move it over, okay,
so that one is a sphere.

00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:57.742
Then last but not least, this
thing that looks like a can

00:02:57.742 --> 00:02:58.909
is a cylinder.

00:03:00.927 --> 00:03:03.263
So let me move that over.

00:03:03.263 --> 00:03:04.096
So that is

00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:06.826
a cylinder.

00:03:06.826 --> 00:03:07.919
And we're all done.

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.224
So these are just useful
names to know for shapes.

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:11.391
Cylinder is...

00:03:13.407 --> 00:03:15.599
You have these two faces that are circular

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.545
and then they are opposite each other.

00:03:17.545 --> 00:03:18.988
It's kind of like a triangular prism,

00:03:18.988 --> 00:03:20.591
but instead of having these hard edges

00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:23.607
because you have a
triangle, you have a base

00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:27.274
that is a circle and a
top that is a circle.
