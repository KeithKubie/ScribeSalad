00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.770
Another type of classic mistakes are process-related mistakes. And also

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.850
in this case, these kind of mistakes can be due

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.970
to many reasons. And they are of many types. One

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.310
typical example are scheduling issues, which are due to the fact

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.180
of being unable to come up with a realistic schedule.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.750
So to have an overly optimistic schedule. And this can be

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.230
because we underestimate the effort involved in different parts of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.010
the project. Because we overestimate the ability of the people involved.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.600
Because we overestimate the importance, for example, of the use

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.640
of tools. But no matter what the reason is, the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.840
result is typically that the projects end up being late,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.580
which is a very common situation. So this is somehow

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.020
related to planning. And in general, planning is a fundamental

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.720
factor in software processes and in software development. Mistakes in

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.120
planning, such as insufficient planning or abandoning planning due to

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.190
pressure, usually lead inexorably to failure. And speaking of failures,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.040
often there are unforeseen failures. Such as

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.410
failures on the constructor's end, for example,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.920
that might lead to low quality or

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.580
late deliverables, which ultimately affects the downstream activities.
