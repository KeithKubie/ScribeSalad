00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.400
JAMES GRIME: It's like
I'm pulling out beads

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.290
on a piece of string.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.910
And as they're pulling taut,
it's unraveling the knot,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.510
which is the story.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.120
If, like me, you're a child of
the '80s, then you'll probably

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.900
remember these books--

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.660
Fighting Fantasy Books, written
by Steve Jackson and

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.580
Ian Livingstone, where you get
to choose your own route

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.570
through the book.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.870
So this book isn't broken up
into pages, but rather, it's

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.740
broken up into paragraphs,
sections.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.970
And at the end of each section,
you get to choose, as

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.110
always, turn to section 282.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.620
Let's look at this section
for a moment, all right?

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.210
Section 267--

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.990
we're on our adventure, and
we find ourselves at a

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.540
crossroads.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.650
It's incredible how often, in
these books, you find yourself

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.720
at a crossroads.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.760
And not surprisingly,
we can go north,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.380
south, east, or west.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.160
And then we have to choose which
number we're going to.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.630
So it's not linear.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.370
It's not like I'm going from the
front of the book to the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:55.940
back of the book.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.290
I'm all over the place.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.650
Ultimately, what we end up with
are battles where we find

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.300
ourselves fighting monsters.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.690
As a player, I have skill and
stamina, and if my dice rolls

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.430
are high enough, then I defeat
the chieftain, and I win.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.350
And if my dice rolls are too
low, then I die in some grisly

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.220
and unfortunate way, which
is normally painful.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.330
I credit these with teaching
me to read, first of all.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.440
So for me, these are a really
pivotal moment in my life.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.310
And so I bought my nephews the
same books when they got to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.960
the same age.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.360
And now they're reading
them, and I'm really

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.325
proud of that, too.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:35.340
But the thing about this book is
we can treat it not just as

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.220
a book, but also as
a graph, right?

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.710
Now, I'm guessing to most
people, when I say graph,

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.240
people think of pie charts
and bar graphs.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.190
But what I mean by a graph in
this case is a set of nodes or

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.300
vertices connected by lines to
show you what decisions you

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.390
can make at each node.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.940
And we use graphs in maths
for everything.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.860
So we use graphs for showing
how data is connected.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.570
And so when you're writing
computer software, you end up

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.750
with, usually, special cases
of graphs like trees for

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.970
eliminating data very quickly
from searches.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.530
And so if you want to write a
search algorithm that's quick,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.860
you need a graph.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.440
Or if you're into road traffic
management, and you want to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.930
know how best to flow traffic
around a town, then you want

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.110
to make a graph of that
town to show where all

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.840
of the roads are.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.930
But what I want to do
is I want to make a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.490
graph of the book.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.370
This book is "The Warlock of
Firetop Mountain." Now,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.940
doesn't that just leap
off the page?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.830
That's fantastic.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.100
You have to start somewhere.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.380
So we'll start at number 1.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.280
That's where these books always
begin with a little

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.950
description of the adventure
you're about to have.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.840
And then, at the end,
after a few yards,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.410
you arrive at a junction.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.600
Will you turn west, in which
case turn to page 71, or east,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.140
in which case turn to 278.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.270
And we make a choice.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.780
And I'm going to show you that
choice on the graph.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.900
So I'm going to start down
here, just because it's

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.780
closest to me, with a node.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.670
And it's number 1.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.190
We either get to go out
to another node at 71,

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.920
or a node at 278.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.380
So now, we immediately
begin to see that the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.420
book branches out.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.460
At 71, we get two choices.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.230
Turn to page 301 or
turn to page 248.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.400
Obviously, with these books, you
spend more times turning

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.140
the page than you do actually
reading the page.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.960
33--

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.750
and suddenly, we're being
attacked by an orc.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.250
There's a very real
possibility that

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.140
we might die here.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.800
So this could be the end of the
story, right, which would

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.480
be pretty sad, because we've
only made five decisions to

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.280
get to this point.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.940
In that case, you've got to go
back to number 1 and start

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.930
again and probably make
different choices.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.420
So it's clear that if I keep
doing this, first of all, I'm

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.780
very quickly going to run out
of paper, but it's going to

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.970
take a really long time.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.910
And I'm guessing that
you probably don't

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.560
want to watch that.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.830
So what I've done is I've
written a little program which

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.270
contains every link lifted
from this book.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.570
So every time you get to
make a choice, I've

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.375
noted down that choice.

00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:09.890
And I'm going to get the program
to draw out the graph.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.470
And the way it's going to do
that is I'm going to start

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.080
with each node of the
book distributed

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.000
uniformly on the page.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.149
And the ones that are linked
together, they're going to

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.420
feel an attractive force, like
a gravitational force between

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.370
them pulling them together.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.712
And the ones which aren't linked
together, they're going

00:04:27.712 --> 00:04:31.040
to feel a repulsive force, and
so the anti-gravity, right.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.230
So we're going to
have to invent

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.620
anti-gravity at this point.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.430
That's going to let the computer
form up the graph

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.270
almost organically for us.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.720
Here we go.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.370
There's my big, repulsive force
coming in and showing us

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.960
the choices that we've made.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.120
So I'm just going to zoom
in on this start point.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.600
There it is.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.190
Immediately, we make
two choices.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.260
That's what we saw.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.620
And then we follow through on
those choices, and we see the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.550
whole maze just starting
to unravel before us.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.020
By the time we get to this
node right here--

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.590
let's just zoom in on that--

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.060
every choice that we make
brings us to here.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.730
Now, if I display the numbers,
we find that whatever we do in

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.620
this story, if we want to
progress, we have to get to

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.040
number 214.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.950
And eventually, we get here to
this enormous maze-- let me

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.310
just turn off the numbers so
we can see it more clearly.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.380
As a child, I spent a lot of
time lost in this maze--

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.420
the Maze of Zagor.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.560
I always used to find myself
back at the same crossroads

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.330
again and again and again.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.380
You might think that this book's
about going and killing

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.450
the warlock and stealing
his treasure.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.600
But actually, the point of all
of these Fighting Fantasy

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.230
books is to turn
to section 400.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.940
And that's the end.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.640
You know when you see "turn to
section 400," you know you're

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.380
finished, because that's always
the last section.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.000
It gives you a warm
feeling inside--

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.350
yay, I did it.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.790
And we can see that
right here.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.920
We can see that we make it
through the Maze of Zagor, and

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.270
then we're back onto--

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.460
just like the start-- a
fairly linear path.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.070
But eventually, we get to
this gold piece, which

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.950
is the magic number.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:04.770
That's 400.

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:05.040
OK?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.960
So I love that.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.040
That's brilliant.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.940
What you will have noticed if
you've been paying attention

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.950
is that some of these
spots are red.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.180
I've gone through the book--

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.020
with Brady's help.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.150
Thank you, Brady.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.240
I've gone through the book, and
I've made a note of every

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.350
place you can die.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:22.340
And there's a couple of other
points in this book which I

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.890
think are quite interesting,
too, and that's that this

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:27.520
node, for example, is black.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.440
Now, a black node is a situation
that you find

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.080
yourself in, which, for me,
was always the most

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.355
depressing.

00:06:34.355 --> 00:06:35.150
Now, let's have a look.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.760
This black node is 118.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.730
So I'm going to look at section
118 in the book.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.210
Now, the first thing we notice
about this section--

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.190
and believe me, I got very good
at noticing this when I

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.260
was reading these books.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.500
There's no "turn to." We're
not going anywhere.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.460
We've turned to this section,
and we've looked at the

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.180
vampire, and he's killed us.

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.630
That's why, when I start turning
my way through this

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:59.930
book, my instinct was to leave
my fingers in the decisions

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.630
that I made previously, because
then when I get to

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:07.910
section 118, and I'm killed by
the vampire, you can know that

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.060
my first instinct is, right,
where was I then?

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.610
And straight back to the
previous section to make any

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.360
other choice that I could
possibly make.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.670
BRADY HARAN: I can't help but
noticing a few little--

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.290
you might have to zoom in on
them for me-- what are those

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.310
bad boys down there?

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.020
JAMES GRIME: Down here, we
find little clusters like

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.520
this, which appear to be wholly
unconnected to the rest

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.790
of the story.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.360
And if you don't know Firetop
Mountain intimately, like I

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.880
do, then this isn't going to
make any sense to you.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.830
So look away now if you
don't want to know

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.150
the answer, all right?

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.960
Turn off.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.090
No, don't turn off.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:41.810
BRADY HARAN: Oh, I know
what we're doing.

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.990
If you want to see what happens
there, click on 400.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.366
We'll have a little
"Click on 400."

00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:50.160
JAMES GRIME: That's great.

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.860
BRADY HARAN: And we'll have a
separate, hidden video where

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.451
James explains what that is.

00:07:54.451 --> 00:07:55.250
Hi there, everyone.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.390
Just a quick message to let
you know the idea for this

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.170
film on Numberphile came from
a conversation with a friend

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.940
of mine named Sean, who's
making a feature length

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.510
documentary about the guys
who wrote these books.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:09.890
You can see some of the footage
on the screen there,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.560
on the other side of me.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.380
And in fact, you can see there
one of the actual maps used by

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.800
the writers to design their
book, rather than the

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.250
retrospective ones that
we showed you.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.820
Now, Sean's film is to be called
"Turn to 400." But to

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.950
make it happen, he's trying
to raise money through

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.960
Kickstarter.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.540
So if this is a topic that
interests you, and you'd like

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.440
to see this other film get off
the ground, please go and

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.130
support it.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.740
And I'll put a link underneath
the video.
