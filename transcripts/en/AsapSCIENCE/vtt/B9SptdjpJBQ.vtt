00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.620
Whether you're headed back to school

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.300
or just wanting to pick up a new skill

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.980
like a language or an instrument learning new things is

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.480
AMAZING!

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.620
But, is their a better way to learn something quickly and retain that knowledge?

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.800
First step is:

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.760
Skip the laptop

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.120
Although you might be quicker at typing

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.120
Writing with pen and paper is the way to go when taking notes

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.060
Not only are their oodles of distractions online

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.240
But researchers have found that those who type process the information at a shallower level

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.660
As opposed to simply train scribing verbatim

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.340
re-framing the information into your own words while writing out physically

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.040
leads to better performance on tests.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.440
And to retain those notes

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.080
STUDY, SLEEP, STUDY!

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.920
In a French experiment 2 groups were taught the Swahili translation for 16 French words

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.240
Over 2 sessions

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.500
Group 1 studied in the morning then took a break and studied again in the evening.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.420
But group 2 studied in the evening slept for the night and then resumed studying in the morning

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.340
Though their was the same amount of time between the 2 study sessions,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.060
The sleep group could recall 10 of 16 words while the no sleep group could only get 7.5

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.500
Learning a new motor skill?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.680
Try modifying your practice slightly

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.080
A study of 86 happy volunteers were asked to learn a computer based motor skill over 2 training sessions

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.400
One groups second training session had them learn the task in a slightly altered way

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.680
While the other repeated the task with the exact same practice

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.820
Those who used two different strategies nearly doubled the speed of accuracy of the task compared to the control group

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.800
What does this look like in the real world?

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.300
Say you're perfecting your tennis game, try switching between rackets with slightly different weights between sessions.
