1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,090
Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:09,770
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast at Ah, ah,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,150
just chicken in on you.

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,010
I'm checking in on you this cause I care.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,420
Okay.

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,190
And this time when everybody else is
just thinking about themselves in their

7
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,024
issues,

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,320
I'm the person that cares about everybody
else and now I'm going to tell you

9
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:30,050
about it because that's what
the world is about. Now,

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,130
the world is not about
trying to go out and go.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,650
You don't do a good thing unless
everybody knows you did a good thing.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,990
Here's me helping an old lady
across the street. Hang on, granny.

13
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,520
Look into the look under my phone while
I take a selfie of what a good fucking

14
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:51,020
person I am. Um, and then I,

15
00:00:51,021 --> 00:00:54,200
then I hashtag it humble.
Um,

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,120
just had the most amazing experience
helping an old person across the street,

17
00:00:59,121 --> 00:01:01,610
which I documented on my smartphone.

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,030
Hashtag humbled hashtag
learn from your elders.

19
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,800
Oh, I am in an extra cunty mood
today. I'm not gonna lie to you.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,960
It has nothing to do with the hipsters.

21
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:19,160
It's got nothing to do with the
Manchurian candidate. Hey, by the way,

22
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,220
you know, I want to apologize
to everybody in England, the UK,

23
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:30,620
the, what else do you call it? The
fucking, uh, there's something empire.

24
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,230
Great Britain,
right?

25
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:34,680
Yeah.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,190
Specifically or pacifically
depending on your education.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,590
I would like to apologize to the
football fans of the premier league.

28
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:48,390
I've been making fun of it saying
it's fucking stupid. They, you know,

29
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:50,900
and, and, and Man City,

30
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,850
they'd played a bunch of shit pump teams
and they're just going to keep winning.

31
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:56,580
And this is going to be like
no excitement whatsoever.

32
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:01,910
And just when you thought this
pasty freckled Yak was right,

33
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,140
what happened?
Man,

34
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:09,141
city loses to the powerhouse
that is Tottenham.

35
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,860
Oh No, wait, Tottenham,

36
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:15,780
I could've told you fucking three years
ago they were going to lose that game.

37
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,890
Nothing sends shivers down the fucking
spine of football fans as they shove

38
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,550
fucking newspaper Rep
fish into their faces.

39
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,280
Yeah.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,170
Like the phrase we have Tottenham next.
It's amazing.

41
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:34,840
Okay.

42
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,460
They fucking lost. So I don't know
what's going on. So now, you know,

43
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,810
I think Liverpool could actually tie.

44
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,980
Yeah.

45
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,250
And that that would be amazing.

46
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:52,460
Right after all of this running around
and grabbing your legs and screaming in

47
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:56,430
agony, the end of the
year, you got two champions

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,540
putting a whole new fucking meaning to.
We are the champions.

49
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:06,010
We are the champions, the
premier league, Booboo,

50
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:09,370
booboo.
Uh,

51
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:13,430
no one is fucking better except
for that other team do, do, do,

52
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:15,560
do we,
uh,

53
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,760
the chair and so is the other city.

54
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,280
I for the life of me don't understand
how you have a fucking league that the

55
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:27,590
entire world is watching and you don't,
you're not,

56
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:29,300
you're not going to have these
two teams play each other.

57
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,070
We are the champions done of the world,

58
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,410
but so was man city.

59
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,130
We tied as champions.

60
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,110
Yeah.

61
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,040
So then what's going to happen,

62
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,840
you guys are both going to
walk around in your cities,

63
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,390
which your championship hats for 2019,

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,140
and then you run into each other on the
fucking tube or the train or wherever

65
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,360
the fuck you are.
And then it's,

66
00:03:57,361 --> 00:04:00,940
it's like literally like one of those
stupid fucking feel good stories on

67
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,774
Facebook.

68
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,070
So-And-So had a twin
that he was unaware of.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He's now 63 and he went to a mall on Long
Island and ran into this fucking jerk

70
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:17,540
off. That was his brother
that he didn't know. Right.

71
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,960
I always think that's hilarious when
siblings meet each other in their sixties

72
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:24,500
that they didn't know existed.
And now what are you going
to talk about? You know,

73
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:28,970
I had my gallbladder removed too.
You really are my brother.

74
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,970
You want to go play fucking catch.
Um,

75
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:35,920
I don't have shoulders that work anymore.

76
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay.

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,900
You also dodged the draft.
Oh my God.

78
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,970
How could you not be related? So that's
what's going on right now. And I,

79
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:47,340
I tried looking up to
figure out, uh, you know,

80
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:50,640
the standings and all of that
shit in the premier league.

81
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,280
Every one will be champion this year.
Alright.

82
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,410
Standings

83
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,350
the same way. It can end in
a zero zero tie. You can have
two champions. Do, do, do,

84
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:08,200
do. All right, so right now
Liverpool has two more points,

85
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,900
but I've learned that that doesn't
mean shit unless, you know,

86
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:15,820
like how many games are left and I
gotta be honest. I don't give a fuck.

87
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,560
I don't, okay. I'm still rooting for
Liverpool. I'm still paying attention.

88
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,200
But if the end of all
of this fucking shit,

89
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,230
these fucking two assholes aren't going
to play each other and Man City could,

90
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:29,234
could,

91
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,643
I dunno,

92
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,300
could not win it because
they lost that totter ham.

93
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,770
Right. Could I get bit pip a ham
on a sandwich, please? Um, I dunno.

94
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,200
Whatever. You know what
I'm doing? I'm doing,

95
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:46,140
what I fucking hate people do when they
come to this country is they just come

96
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:47,700
here and they tell me how fucked up it is.

97
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:51,030
Like I as an American don't realize it.
It's like, dude, I fucking live here.

98
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,710
Can you stop country splaining to me while
you man spread across to me. You toxic

99
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,210
foreign male Caucasian.

100
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,850
Whenever the fuck these fucking
broads a bitching about this week.

101
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,670
Um,
yeah.

102
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,340
Anyways, there's a big strike that's
supposed to be happening out here.

103
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,210
I'm hoping they're gonna win
the writer's guild. You know,

104
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
these fucking piece of shit agents did.

105
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,290
They actually fucking started packaging
deals with them making more money than

106
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,680
the fucking person were allegedly
working for. It's just classic them.

107
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:26,240
And you know what they do? They go to
bed, they fucking sleep fine. You know?

108
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,510
You know what's funny is none of my
agents have brought this up. Like, yeah,

109
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,850
I mean,
I wasn't a part of it and it's despicable.

110
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,673
MMM.

111
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,230
Hey Nia, we would just say no, you haven't
been on the podcast and forever. I know.

112
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,543
Oh Wow.

113
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,170
You could not sound less. Uh, I dunno.

114
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,180
Missing of the podcast.

115
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,660
What's going on with your gorgeous,
you look in great. Thank you.

116
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,340
Oh,
thank you.

117
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,200
You know, I'm a Zombie. That's
something I know. Nia woke up,

118
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,740
I woke up this morning and the first
thing is says it was just like, oh my God.

119
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,960
Oh the sleep until midnight. And then
I couldn't go to sleep until 4:00 AM.

120
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,370
And you know, and you want as a husband
to be like, well that sucks for you.

121
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,800
But you know what that means. You got
to go get the little rug rat. I did.

122
00:07:23,801 --> 00:07:27,640
I made a Waf. I came in here this morning.
She goes, I go, I go, hey buddy should go,

123
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,850
I want waffles. Now, the first
thing right out of the gate,

124
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,440
she came in with a breakfast or I want
waffles. All right? But I'm a strict dad,

125
00:07:35,441 --> 00:07:38,800
so you know what I did? I went right
downstairs and I made her waffles.

126
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,670
That's right. Yeah. You're
eating a healthy breakfast.
What'd you say, sweetheart?

127
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,010
You want waffles? Okay.
Absolutely. Anything for you.

128
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,430
But then I did make waffles for you,
Nia.

129
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,080
I did not because you've been crushing
it on your diet and there's all kinds of

130
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:55,240
sugar and shit in that.
You don't need it.

131
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:00,280
And I didn't want to be the guy
that handed you the crack pipe. Nia,

132
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,970
this off Mike thing that you're doing
on the podcast is about as exciting as

133
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:07,780
watching Liverpool and man city not
play each other for the championship.

134
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:13,690
Everyone is champion in soccer.

135
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,750
If you fall down, we'll fucking stop
the game for 20 minutes, Booboo,

136
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:23,860
booboo. Um, the more you watch
soccer though, you're more,

137
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:27,040
you can see how much it hurts, you
know, and they get the spikes going.

138
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,030
Like most salad was on that breakaway
and that guy just basically peel the skin

139
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:32,230
off the back of his calf.

140
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,870
But I love that he was on a
breakaway and he kept going.

141
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,090
Most salad actually looks like he's like,

142
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,380
it looks like the Judd Apatow
of premiere league soccer.

143
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,010
Nothing. You just gonna walk out. No,

144
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:49,600
I was about to be like you said what
they look, they look like each other.

145
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:53,560
He's the best player in the,
in the soccer league. Yes.

146
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,340
Um, Nia always looking out for
me. Always looking out for me.

147
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:03,960
Did you just say
something about Tara Reid?

148
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,620
Um, anyways, uh,

149
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,790
Stanley Cup playoffs started now for
all you English people over there.

150
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,870
You probably Roy.
What's that?

151
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:18,070
Is that like everybody sorta just mills
around playing each other and then the

152
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:22,450
end they, you know, like whoever
has the most points wins right now.

153
00:09:22,451 --> 00:09:24,960
Everybody English just like,
that's a fucking terrible,

154
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,700
I'm going to compound it with a
bad accent. Right way. He'll fall.

155
00:09:30,701 --> 00:09:35,110
Could talk like that Mike. Um, yeah.

156
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,740
Started last night.
The islanders,

157
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,170
big win and over time over
your Pittsburgh Penguins,

158
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,870
OT loss, OT loss. Uh, San
Jose Sharks. I fell asleep.

159
00:09:46,871 --> 00:09:51,220
I think they were handling the nights
it pretty well. It's four to one. Um,

160
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,950
and I didn't see what happened with
Nashville. No, wait. Yeah, that was, yeah.

161
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,300
Okay. Sorry. I watch. I got a kid now. I
don't know what the fuck's going on. Um,

162
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,640
but I'll tell you what,
as much as I have a child,

163
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,280
as much as I'm a dedicated father,

164
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,020
I still had time to go onto my little
fucking garage with my wonderful,

165
00:10:11,021 --> 00:10:15,580
beautiful Gretsch broadcast to set. And
I was there. I was working on that, uh,

166
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,870
that Soundgarden song,

167
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,203
uh,

168
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,770
never the machine again.

169
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,103
MMM.

170
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,360
Which is a nine. I saw a site, I
figured out that it was in nine,

171
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,140
and then I figured out the main groove
and then that second groove where he goes

172
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:36,730
on the toms,
I can never fucking here where he's at.

173
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:40,840
So I had to watch some kid on
Youtube, play it. Um, but I,

174
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:45,060
I'm able to the whole song though, what
I love about the whole songs, it's,

175
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,370
it's in nine and then it feels like
it's switches, but it never does.

176
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:49,870
He's just fucking with the time.

177
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,900
It was almost like he was either playing
double time at first and then regular

178
00:10:56,021 --> 00:10:58,600
time or he was playing regular
time and then half time,

179
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:03,601
which I think is what he's doing and
just the way he comes up with the drum

180
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:08,080
parts. Matt Cameron, the overrated
underrated for this week. Matt Cameron,

181
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,740
Drummer for sound garden,
Pearl Jam and a,

182
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,520
whoever's next band is going to be
whoever they are going to be. Um,

183
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,880
I don't know,

184
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,330
I always thought he was like wasted and
Pearl Jam that he could play all these

185
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:24,440
different time signatures. And as far
as I know pearl jam just plays in for,

186
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,210
you know, so that's like you got like
some fucking amazing like I dunno,

187
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,710
wide receiver and you just have them on
special teams. Is that what it is? Bill?

188
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:34,950
You non-musician Khan?

189
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,730
Who the fuck are you to tell one of the
biggest bands ever that they're wasting

190
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,130
one of the great drummers of all time.
You know,

191
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,960
I've got a lot of fucking balls first.

192
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,380
First he attacked the Premiere League
and now you're giving shit to fucking

193
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,270
whoever puts together. Pearl
Jam. Um, will they fishermen

194
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,000
is that they came up with Pearl,

195
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,790
you know what a pearls
come on and visit oysters.

196
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,460
I can never remember.

197
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,960
It is pretty amazing that we
somehow found those fucking things.

198
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,560
Crustaceans buried in the fucking sand
and the goddamn ocean and our stupid nosy

199
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,790
ass as we like the broad set of species.
You know, your fucking wife just sticks.

200
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,390
They're fucking nose in everything.
Everything is curious to them.

201
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,200
They say they're curious. It's like,
no, you're nosy. You're snooping around.

202
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,930
It's fucking nuts. All right. Uh,

203
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,850
where do pearls come from?

204
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,530
[inaudible] that's where he is,
right?

205
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,390
Why is my internet this fucking slow?

206
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:42,390
Have they just decided that
I have to buy a new fucking,

207
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,310
although clams and mussels can
also produce pearls. They do.

208
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:52,350
So they don't do so very often.
Everything has to be inclusive.

209
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:57,351
We're not staying more nuts in clans
and muscles aren't as good as oysters.

210
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,413
MMM.

211
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:06,440
As oysters grow and internal organ called
the mantle use is minerals from the

212
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:09,770
oysters food to produce a substance
called now who gives a shit?

213
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,200
Somebody sat and figured that out.

214
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:16,100
Somebody opened that up and found
it and was like, you know what,

215
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm going to give this to the
fucking woman in the tribe.

216
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:23,180
I want to bang and it was shiny and the
other women didn't have it and she liked

217
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:28,181
him and the dude got his
fucking prehistoric dick
sucked and the trajectory of

218
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:29,450
that,

219
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:34,450
those butterfly wings flapping turned
into all that bullshit you see on TV with

220
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:36,620
Tiffany's.

221
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,093
You know

222
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,690
as a man,
if you ever produce one of those,

223
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:44,750
when are you going to get her the
ring commercials like you really dish

224
00:13:44,751 --> 00:13:47,750
something should happen to you.
You should lose something.

225
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,160
I'm not saying physically,
but you should depth some.

226
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:54,380
We should take your flat screen away
for like six months. No sports packages.

227
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:57,620
But then again, what kind of
man who is in Dysport? Well,

228
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,990
a lot of them because they're
all about the fucking money.

229
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:01,940
Like these fucking
Goddamn agents out here.

230
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,730
What a bunch of cunts I gee, you
know, it's not the AEAs steel.

231
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,330
It's that you'd go to bed at night
with a smile on your face. [inaudible].

232
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,800
That's what kills me about
the fucking agencies out here.

233
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:15,260
They don't even have any guilt
of what the fuck they do.

234
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,180
Just like every other
fucking corporations. It's
just fucking unbelievable.

235
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:21,620
Okay.

236
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,220
I'm fucking believable. And they know
they got everybody by the fucking balls.

237
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:27,980
February's going to fire their fucking
age. Do they know? They know they did it.

238
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,360
You did it. Congratulations.
Congratulations. Go get
your fucking infinity pool.

239
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,450
You're fucking greedy.
Cons. I'll tell you,

240
00:14:36,451 --> 00:14:41,190
that's not just this business at any
time. You come up with an idea, all right,

241
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:42,840
and you get in business
with somebody else.

242
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,350
You think that they're working with
you. I swear to God, I swear to God,

243
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,020
but at the end of the day, you're
going to end up fucking work for them.

244
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,270
Every time you think you're not the
whore walking the block and you think you

245
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,000
finally got in the car and now
you're the pimp, you're not,

246
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,570
you're fucking walk in the block for
somebody. It's fucking ridiculous.

247
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:04,850
May they all die of fucking a fucking
heart attack today when they go out and

248
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:09,410
eat their fucking surf and
turf lunches, gree cons. Um,

249
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,190
oh no, I can only get so fucking mad
about it. But what do you expect?

250
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,130
What do you expect? You know, that's,
that's what they do. It's what they do.

251
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:20,940
It's what they do.

252
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,890
They're all about

253
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,670
the fucking money.
Um,

254
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,950
maybe that's what artists can do to
fight back because we're not organized

255
00:15:31,951 --> 00:15:34,930
enough. Maybe we should just fucking,
you know, and they still would kid.

256
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,070
It's not that you can say to him, Hey,
what's up? You're greedy. Current.

257
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,100
They'd be like, hey, how are
you just riding my may back.

258
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,670
Um, anyway, uh, moving on.

259
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:55,080
So the Bruins play the
Toronto Maple leafs, uh,

260
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,270
once again, this and you gotta think at
some point Toronto has to push through.

261
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,160
Will this be the year? Um,
I am rooting for those guys,

262
00:16:05,161 --> 00:16:08,760
but not this series. Um, and if
they beat my Bruins and I will,

263
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,510
I will root for them because
it's getting ridiculous.

264
00:16:12,511 --> 00:16:13,890
You know what is amazing though,

265
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,160
and it really just goes to show you how
nice people are in Canada on the surface,

266
00:16:20,161 --> 00:16:24,300
even though it's probably arguably more
racist up there than it is down here.

267
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,710
And I know that that's a big statement,
but somebody has to offset Michael.

268
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:32,130
What's his face there?
Is it Michael Moore?

269
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,360
I remember his fucking ridiculous
cartoon version of what Canada was like.

270
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,480
Everybody leaves their doors
unlocked in your urine. GC phase,

271
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,150
gingerbread houses up there.
Jeez, I understand that.

272
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,940
He's too fat to actually go
and do some fucking research,

273
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:52,520
which is why all his documentaries
or just op ed pieces. But the,

274
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:55,430
that whole didn't that fucking moron.

275
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,470
He should go fucking interview one guy
of color who tried to make it in the Nhl

276
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,440
and just have him tell some fucking
stories to play in minor league hockey up

277
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:09,300
there and what people said fucking
last week to I'm on the ice. Um,

278
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,560
anyway. Oh Jesus. Going after
England now going after Canada,

279
00:17:13,561 --> 00:17:16,920
talking about fucking broads bitch
and then us bill, what's less?

280
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,130
Let's let out Salvador,
the look,

281
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:25,630
if you fucking people going to be down
there, so in a close together, goddammit,

282
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,930
you do it rack. Um, all right,

283
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:33,940
here is another question I have.
No, so here's the thing. Um,

284
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,460
this goes to show how nice they are.
Surface on the surface level of, um,

285
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,500
in Canada is,

286
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,560
I remember when the rangers have been
wanting since 1940 everyone used in the

287
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,510
80s. Everyone was chanting 19, 1940.

288
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:56,511
So they were 40 something years in
nobody chance 1967 maybe cause it's 67.

289
00:17:58,471 --> 00:17:59,640
It's just too long.

290
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,020
Now I'm paying 40 doesn't
have a good rhythm here.

291
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,700
1967.

292
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:07,820
Okay.

293
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,581
That's like when,

294
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:13,581
when the red sox finally won and
Yankee fans couldn't chat 1918 anymore.

295
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:18,920
So then now they just go pause. They went,
they used to be 1918 and now they go,

296
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,260
Boston sucks.

297
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:26,900
They turn a one syllable word to a two
syllable because they're too fucking dumb.

298
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,290
You can't think of a fucking
insult with two syllables.

299
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:38,210
I don't know. Maybe I, I don't
know. I don't understand.

300
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,450
Why isn't anybody cheating? It was
always fucking shit. Now a year,

301
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,680
nobody chanted 1906 and 1907 at the cubs.

302
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,050
But everybody chanted 1918 I got, I
gotta tip my cap, the Yankee fence.

303
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,980
We're actually ESPN the way they
fucking overhyped all of that,

304
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,440
and of course them, they didn't get to the
real, you know the real story about it.

305
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,040
You know what I mean? Where
it was just like, yeah,

306
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:09,900
we would just say horribly
inept franchise, and the
Yankees were not good owners.

307
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:11,850
They didn't know what the
fuck they were doing. Right.

308
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,650
They didn't do that and that the Yankees
were just this amazing organization

309
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,760
that picked Michael Jordan for
decades in a row, bottom one time,

310
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,443
and

311
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,410
no one's ever going to fucking
do that again. All right.

312
00:19:26,411 --> 00:19:29,320
You got the Green Bay packers.
Green Bay packers are on their way.

313
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,620
They went from Brett
[inaudible]. All right. To

314
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,700
Aaron Rodgers.
Now an errands done.

315
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,080
I asked you this.
When Aaron Rodgers has done,

316
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,110
if they have another hall
of fame quarterback that
wins one or two super bowls

317
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,840
three times in a row,
I don't think anybody's ever done that,

318
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,433
right?

319
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,080
I don't think so. No, they haven't.
Nobody's ever fucking done that.

320
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,003
MMM.

321
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,780
What is amazing too is
they have three that did.

322
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,350
They have the greatest quarterbacks
of all time. Collectively, Bart Starr,

323
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:15,330
Brett Farve, Aaron Rodgers, who can
do better than that. Terry Bradshaw.

324
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:18,420
Ben Roethlisberger.
Then you got nothing.

325
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:24,950
We got Tom Brady in my heart.
Also says Steve Drogan drew Bledsoe.

326
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,810
But you know the stat
people won't allow that. Um,

327
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,020
Bob Greasy Dan Marino to have three.
Three is hard.

328
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:44,130
Well, let's see here. Roger Starbuck.

329
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,250
Nope.
Nobody else

330
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,910
there.
Wait a fucking minute.

331
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:56,080
God knows the bears and fucking browns.
You don't have to think about them.

332
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:02,140
The lions Bobby Lane.
That's it.

333
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,410
Hi.
Come on in buddy.

334
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,493
Yeah.

335
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,150
Hey. Hey. Did you like the waffles?

336
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeah. Um, yeah. What are you doing today?

337
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,480
Come on up on the bed.

338
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:26,040
Yeah,

339
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,890
that's okay. Come on. You
want to hold that? All right.

340
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:31,910
I'm,

341
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:36,910
I'm talking about is anybody other than
the packers have three hall of Fame

342
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,740
Quarterbacks, Huh? Hell, you
want to say hello? Say Hello.

343
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,960
Hello? Say Hello. Say hello everybody

344
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,450
as she's getting shy. Um, yeah,

345
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:57,410
I gotta I gotta give it up to the Green
Bay packers in which makes sense because

346
00:21:57,411 --> 00:22:00,440
they've won the most NFL titles
and super bowls. But you guys,

347
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,350
you guys have heard this
argument enough times. Um,

348
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,660
it's time for me to read some advertising.
I only got one this week.

349
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:11,930
Oh hey buddy,
it's dollar shave club.

350
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,380
Dollar Shave Club.
Can she not be looking at this thing?

351
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:19,040
I'm trying to avoid the screen time.
She's looking at herself, not in her bed.

352
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,090
Say Bye bye. Bye Bye. Yeah,
it's all done. All done.

353
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,570
I know you want it, but you
can't. You can't. You can't
have it. The WHO? The WHO.

354
00:22:29,571 --> 00:22:33,980
What is she doing today?
You're going to music class

355
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,860
now.
She said remote.

356
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,900
Yeah, she's not happy. All right.
She's saying I want remote.

357
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,270
I want remote. All
right. Dollar Shave Club.

358
00:22:48,271 --> 00:22:50,580
Dollar Shave Club has
everything you need to look,

359
00:22:50,581 --> 00:22:55,560
feel and smell your best and you
never have to go to the Stila.

360
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,400
That's because they deliver everything
you need right to your door and they keep

361
00:22:59,401 --> 00:23:04,050
you fully stocked on what you use so
you don't run out. Here's how it works.

362
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,490
Dollar Shave Club has everything

364
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,820
They have you covered head to toe for your
hair, your skin, your face, you name it,

366
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,260
Somebody's going to commit a murder one
day and then just use all the dollar

367
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:18,840
shave club products.
And you know,

368
00:23:18,841 --> 00:23:22,050
what if they actually get
away with it is awful.

369
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:24,120
Is that is it will be
great for this company.

370
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,270
Not saying you need to be that clean,

371
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:30,780
not saying we advocate murdering
somebody and getting away with it.

372
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,950
We're just saying that's how you will be
clean enough to get away with a murder

373
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,690
if this wrong. That dollar shave
club has doubled down and embraced.

374
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,060
Um, and you have this new program where
they automatically keep you stocked up on

375
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,770
products you use. You determine
what you want and when you want it.

once a month to once every six months

377
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:58,970
plus what they're handsome discount.
The more you buy, the more you save.

378
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:00,540

You know what those sons of bitches did?

384
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:27,080
They actually gave me a little
old gym bag. Green and white,

385
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,050
like the money they're making,
right? It has my initials on it.

386
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,670
It's great old school Guy Shit.

387
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,730
And I opened it up and there was a
bunch of ping pong balls in there.

388
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,110
I think that's, I dunno. So you'd
stuff doesn't smell. I have no idea.

389
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,200
But I was looking for my favorite
product that they have is the one wipe

390
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:46,190
Charlies. You know what I mean?
That's like the poor man's but a,

391
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,540
it's like toilet paper.
Two Point Oh so you know,

392
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,990
you don't fucking leave let with a
ticket tape parade still on your fucking

393
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,530
asshole. I'm sorry people, I didn't
mean, I didn't mean to be this.

394
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:06,440
So Mr and Mrs Shave Club is listening.
Why don't you help all freckles stock up?

395
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,590
Maybe I can get a fucking membership
and stop being such a fucking cheap

396
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,960
pastored here.
Um,

397
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,180
[inaudible] boom, boom, boom. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

398
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:21,830
nine by guy digging, digging, digging,
digging, digging. Um, anyways, uh,

399
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,250
Paul Versey, I love poverty
and you know, something.

400
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:28,580
He had one of the most inadvertently
hilarious tweets last night,

401
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:32,450
which I am going to give him shit about,
uh, Paul versus on the road right now.

402
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,670
And I'm so proud of this guy. He's,
he's doing his first like serious,

403
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,660
like headlining tour across the
country. Right. And you know,

404
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,730
if you got somebody opening for you,

405
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,470
okay,

406
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,880
okay.
And you're like,

407
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:51,470
yeah,

408
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,260
bringing them around the country
and you're not a fucking asshole.

409
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:57,200
You want to see that person
grow into a headliner,

410
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,950
which sucks for you because eventually
you won't work together as much,

411
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:04,970
but you know, you're not going to
sit there and root against, you know,

412
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,150
I'm sorry this isn't coming off as
sincere as I wanted to to cause a muscle

413
00:26:08,151 --> 00:26:11,240
clicking on his fucking website,
loading tour dates. All right,

414
00:26:11,241 --> 00:26:15,230
so this is why he's going to be, he's
got the punchline in Philly. April 11th,

415
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,980
12th the 13th.

416
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,660
He's at Raleigh Improv on the 18th,
the 19th

417
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,530
and uh,

418
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:30,760
and the 20th all you people down south
don't sleep on him just because he's

419
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:31,870
fucking a New Yorker.

420
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:37,290
Then he's at the New York Comedy Club
on the 26th and the 27th of April.

421
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:43,270
All right. Uh, I got to
tell you, I saw him at, um,

422
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,250
Gotham comedy club and he was stretching
because they're waiting for Seinfeld to

423
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:53,190
get there. And I just watched, I
watched him and it was just, I was like,

424
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:55,350
there it is.
That man is ready.

425
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,550
He is now officially a
headliner and all you got,

426
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,450
it's just people have to discover
that. So he's learning, uh,

427
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,690
it's Kinda cool to actually talk to him
cause I remember being where he's at,

428
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,230
where he's like, you know, certain areas,
they know who he is and he does great.

429
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,930
And then you go down south
and nobody knows who you are.

430
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,880
Same way for the southern
comic comes up north.

431
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:16,740
It's like you went to a
different country at first tell,

432
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:18,240
everybody starts to know who you are.

433
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,220
Imagine Ron White probably had that issue
at some point during his career before

434
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:26,970
he, uh, became the
superstar that he is. Um,

435
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:29,130
so catch Paul Versey now and you can say,

436
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:33,540
I saw him when I saw him
when, uh, but anyways,

437
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:36,720
he had this hilarious tweet. He's
always talking shit. He goes,

438
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:41,130
I haven't smoked a cigar for 17 days,
which I'm very proud of him. And then he,

439
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,110
then he writes, tell me I can't
do 30, which is fucking hilarious.

440
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,500
Not only because there's people out
there trying to get off phentenol and

441
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,700
there's people evidently getting sold
into slavery in Libya and all he's trying

442
00:27:53,701 --> 00:27:57,030
to do is not smoke a fucking
cigar and a Jacuzzi for a month

443
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,720
that stay strong, Paul. But what I
love is he goes, tell me I can't do 30.

444
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,220
Almost like he was trolling people on the
Internet and everything that I saw for

445
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:09,540
the most part was negative.

446
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:14,040
People were sending him pictures
of cigars or they just write gay.

447
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,330
And it just, I don't
know. It's just like you,

448
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:20,090
it's like you walked into a boxing
ring with your chin out. God,

449
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,320
I date and punched me in the fucking Chin.

450
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,140
They just mean the internet is just mean.

451
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:29,610
You don't go to the Internet for support.
Um,

452
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,670
but he hasn't smoked a cigar and 17 days.

453
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:36,170
And evidently he now thinks I know
him in his head. He thinks he's doing,

454
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,990
he's like what Reggie Miller used to do.
The Knicks,

455
00:28:38,991 --> 00:28:43,310
like he's just buried in threes stealing
the inbound pass running past the three

456
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,910
d other side of the three point
line and hitting another one. Um,

457
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,120
but I am proud of him too,
cause that's what, you know,

458
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,990
I'll be honest with you to all the
cigars. Paul is not smoking. I'm smoking.

459
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:59,630
So I got to kind of lay off. Um, but
I'm just not feeling like I want to,

460
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,240
cause that's like my only advice
I really have right now. Oh,

461
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:06,110
freckles is coming up on 140
days and no fucking booze.

462
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,180
Um, 20 goddamn weeks.
And I got to be honest,

463
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:13,790
in much as I bring it up to you guys,
I always bring it up to you guys.

464
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:17,450
I know you're sick of it. I just bring
it up to you cause I want, I want to,

465
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:20,600
I want to be held accountable.
No, I seriously, I just want this,

466
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,890
I want to keep going with this thing.

467
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:24,290
So I said I'm doing a
fucking calendar year,

468
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,320
January 1st to December 31st and I'm
actually thinking of going to my birthday

469
00:29:29,721 --> 00:29:30,554
next year.

470
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,183
MMM.

471
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,250
I Dunno. I get weird with this shit.
Like now it's like, all right. You know,

472
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,100
I don't want to like,
I don't want to end the streak.

473
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,553
Yeah.

474
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,580
Tell me. I can't fucking make
it to 140 days people. Um,

475
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,700
anyways. All right. I think that's going
to be the podcast here for this week.

476
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,810
Congratulations to all the football
fans in Europe of the premier league.

477
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,460
You must be going absolutely crazy right
now knowing that there's an incredible

478
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:05,230
chance is that,
uh,

479
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,300
there could be two champions
this year or maybe there isn't.

480
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,471
I'm trying to look at.

481
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:15,280
My F is for family script that I have
to read here in an hour. The table read.

482
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:20,281
I'm just going to get there early I
think cause I can can read this shit.

483
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,620
Yeah,

484
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,100
it won't open for me. Um, anyways,

485
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,540
episode nine everybody this time next
week we're going to be reading episode 10

486
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:34,110
and then seasoned number four has been
written and we still have to do all the

487
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:37,320
punch ups in the editing and all that.
That takes another fucking nine months.

488
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,050
But you know the big stuff,

489
00:30:40,051 --> 00:30:43,380
the big heavy lifting is out of the way.
All right,

490
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,860
well that's it and podcast.
All right, it's done.

491
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,730
But there's going to be a
little musical interlude here.

492
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,560
Um, and then we're going
to play your greatest hits.

493
00:30:52,561 --> 00:30:56,310
Another half hour bonus of a
greatest hits Thursday afternoon,

494
00:30:56,311 --> 00:31:00,180
just before Friday, Monday morning
podcast from, uh, earlier this year,

495
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:02,610
10 years ago. I don't know when I
started doing this things. All right,

496
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:07,030
have a great weekend. Your cuts go

497
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:16,963
[inaudible]

498
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,570
[inaudible]
call for Z

499
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,680
of course was saying Babe Ruth was the
greatest baseball player of all time.

500
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,880
And then he said all the usual shit.

501
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:49,040
He basically repeated shift
that he heard on TV, the,

502
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,970
he played at the dead ball era.
Right.

503
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,630
And a law head was also trying
to tell me, you know, yeah, he,

504
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,800
and I was just saying,
listen,

505
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,140
I'm not saying he's not one of
the great players of all time,

506
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:02,530
but he's not the greatest of all
fucking time for the simple fact.

507
00:32:02,531 --> 00:32:04,930
He didn't play against the greatest.
All right?

508
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:08,410
He played in a segregated
league with the Pedro Martinez,

509
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,000
the Mariano Rivera's.
Okay. The Josh Gibson's,

510
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,720
they weren't allowed
in the fucking league.

511
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,850
He didn't have to compete against Reggie
Jackson even to have to compete against

512
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:19,710
these guys.
They weren't allowed in the league.

513
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:23,880
He was playing and basically
a softball league. Okay.

514
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,900
We're the top third. What I
would say would make, you know,

515
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,980
would make the major league baseball
nowadays. Okay. But I get it.

516
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,260
You've got to think like two thirds
of them won't even fucking been there.

517
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:37,800
Then they tried to do that shit.
Well, Bill, it was only 10 teams.

518
00:32:37,801 --> 00:32:40,340
There's three teams now. Yeah.
And there was all solely fucking

519
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:45,200
2 billion people on the
planet. Now there's 7 billion.
All right, so I'll, I'll,

520
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,650
I'll knock off like I'll give him an
extra 10% on his fucking numbers then

521
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,900
like, give me a fucking
break. All you gotta do,

522
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:58,330
do he play baseball when
people died of tuberculosis,

523
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,360
he played baseball. Like there
was a hit song, but at the time

524
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:07,840
[inaudible] [inaudible]

525
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,870
and that song was written in the 1890s
and everybody thought it was too fucking

526
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,760
crazy. What, what is this
devil music? God dammit. She,

527
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,850
what happens when you add them off
the plantation? They get up here.

528
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:23,430
They couldn't even handle it. Bad
APP APP. App. APP, APP, App yet

529
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,360
[inaudible] he played baseball.
That was a hit. Baba Du, Du, Du,

530
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,540
Du, Zara de de de, de Beauvoir.
Dabu Ba boop, boop, boop, boop,

531
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,970
boop, boop, boop, boop. You know,

532
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,020
people would just hear it and then sit
around wondering when they were ever

533
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,520
going to hear it again because they had
no device to play it on. Yeah. That idea.

534
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,683
Dabu Babu,
right.

535
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,980
That guy came to town and everybody
stood around him and I played,

536
00:33:49,981 --> 00:33:50,980
played a fucking piano.

537
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,820
You see how they worked out back
then? Head, shoulders, knees and toes.

538
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:02,470
Knees and toes. Head, shoulders, knees and
toes. Knees and toes. And only white guys.

539
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,250
No blacks are Puerto Rican, head,
shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes.

540
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,600
Those big,
dumb fucking gloves.

541
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:15,740
They looked like little people hands.
Give me a fucking break.

542
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:20,740
Not to mention Babe Ruth's. I mean they
built a stadium towards his strength.

543
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:25,630
That right field fence. Okay, you can,

544
00:34:25,631 --> 00:34:27,070
you can make a cop show.

545
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,340
Yeah,

546
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:33,340
with two toddlers and they could do
the classic scene where the fucking cop

547
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:36,800
chases the perp down the alley and he
gets to the chain link fence and fucking

548
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:37,640
jumps over it.
You could,

549
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:40,970
you could fill net with two toddlers
with the right field fence in Yankee

550
00:34:40,971 --> 00:34:43,560
stadium. The House that
Ruth built. Alright,

551
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:48,080
you backed up to catch a fly ball and
hit you like mid thigh and you fell into

552
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:52,040
some guy's lap. Right? So anyway,

553
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,480
give me a fucking break. All right, from
1930 [inaudible] I'll give it to you.

554
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,750
All right? But if you played in
the teams, he played in the arts,

555
00:34:59,751 --> 00:35:03,800
she played in the 18 hundreds and even
into the twenties go fuck yourself.

556
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,400
All right. And I feel like
every look, every like, um,

557
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,940
major sport has their three stooges error.

558
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,900
We're one team won a bunch of
fucking championships. All right.

559
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:20,680
I love the Boston Celtics, but give me
a break. You look at them in the 1960s.

560
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,600
I mean, it looks like it looks like a
game being played at the y, you know,

561
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:29,160
some Christian rec league.
All right.

562
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,280
The fucking Canadians want a bunch
of Stanley cups when you know,

563
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:37,281
you had first dibs on any guy within a
300 mile fucking radius in a 16 league.

564
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,330
They had first dibs on anybody
in French speaking Quebec.

565
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:47,940
And we, we had, you know, we had first
pick, like the best guy from Vermont. Gee,

566
00:35:47,941 --> 00:35:51,840
did you go on a run? It's
fucking ridiculous. Okay.

567
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,710
And then the Green Bay packers who were
actually the fucking Yankees of football,

568
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,450
you know, they, you know, they were
winning titles when the Canton bulldogs,

569
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,880
we're still in the fucking legal
right. Okay. Wait, am give me, come on.

570
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,133
Right.

571
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,720
Football was like a genie. I think they
play with a pumpkin back then. I mean,

572
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:13,860
give me a fucking break. All those genes,
the whole store, the history, the blah,

573
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:16,110
blah.
The only ones that I will then I will,

574
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,430
I will recognize their championships
without a grain of salt.

575
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,440
I would say,
uh,

576
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:26,010
any of the New York Yankees from like
the 1930 [inaudible] for the simple fact

577
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,570
they went babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig,
Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle.

578
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,480
That's just, nobody's, nobody's
ever going to do that again.

579
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:37,010
You're not going to get the Jordan of
your error four times in a fucking roll.

580
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,860
All right? You're just not going
to do it. So without a doubt,

581
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,080
I respect all of that type of shit.
But you know,

582
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,580
at the inceptions of these
fucking leaks when crazy legs,

583
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:51,840
Johnson runs around googly eyes fucking
Ulysses and could give me a fucking

584
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:55,920
break. Okay. He played in the deadbolt
ever. Do you don't understand.

585
00:36:55,921 --> 00:37:00,720
This guy had more devils
who was on the mound?

586
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,670
My great grandfather

587
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,890
coming out of the bullpen and all freckles

588
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:14,250
[inaudible] was that the song they played
when he came in said or Inter Sandman?

589
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,880
They weren't facing cut
fast balls back then.

590
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,210
I'm sure there was guys
throwing 90 a hundred miles
a fucking hour, but just the,

591
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:23,970
the amount of bombs that were in
that fucking league back then.

592
00:37:23,971 --> 00:37:27,560
I don't really want anyone to
hear it. There was, there's a,

593
00:37:27,561 --> 00:37:29,920
there's a guy in the hall of fame.
Ooh,

594
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,690
good luck in baseball.

595
00:37:32,691 --> 00:37:36,230
He kept a section of rope that
was used in an actual lynching.

596
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:37,791
Okay.

597
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:40,760
This is how long ago these fucking people
played and you're going to sit there

598
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:45,690
and act like in the inception of
these fucking leagues. You know,

599
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,950
I, I look at it obviously in every
era there was a Jordan. All right,

600
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:51,630
but just like the
techniques and everything,

601
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:53,400
some of the records
that were set back then,

602
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,000
they didn't have a fucking heavyweight
fight. It would go on for like a day.

603
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,650
They'd have like a fucking,
you know, a 90 round fight.

604
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:07,010
Okay. Now listen, you're getting
punched in the fucking head.

605
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,880
Well what kind of technique are you using?

606
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,680
Phil did bare knuckle fucking the people.
I want to hear it.

607
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,570
I didn't want to hear all right.

608
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:23,060
The competition now is so
much more insane that I,

609
00:38:23,061 --> 00:38:24,770
I just think it would immediately,

610
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,180
but I guess they would compete at the
same level but like just the fact that

611
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,480
it's now everybody gets to
compete and not to mention like,

612
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,190
I mean you could get
fucking fathers out there.

613
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,070
I try and they try to
teach their kid how to

614
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,150
throw a curve ball to get, you know,

615
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:43,650
get the family out of the trailer park
when the kids like six years old stunting

616
00:38:43,651 --> 00:38:46,350
the growth of one of his fucking arms,
you know,

617
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,990
cause they live in a fucking trailer and
somebody's got a growth on their face

618
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:50,460
that they want to have again.
They want it removed.

619
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,210
Then are those kids going out there?
You know,

620
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,570
back in the day you went out and you
played catch with your little kid.

621
00:38:57,571 --> 00:39:00,750
Now you go out there and from day one
you try to teach them how to switch it.

622
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:07,370
It's insane. All right, so whatever
I'm just saying, so whatever.

623
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,210
If you do, you guys think Babe Ruth is
the greatest baseball player, right?

624
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,270
It's so hard to say because all you
can go by is this guy's fucking stats.

625
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,090
Who you play back.
You know,

626
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,350
it was probably a guy better than
fucking babe Ruth, but he got polio.

627
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:28,220
You know what I mean? Having just a,
it's all right. I'm done. I'm done.

628
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:03,810
[inaudible]

629
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,120
wow.

630
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,870
Hey, what's going on? It's
built burn. It's the Monday
morning podcast from Monday,

631
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:19,090
April 11th,
2011 2011 2011,

632
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:22,960
whatever the fuck I got to
say all this goddamn year. Um,

633
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:27,400
how the hell are you Joe Nye some
bright eyed and bushy tailed.

634
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,390
I'll tell you why.
I'm going to tell you why right now.

635
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,700
Cause I tried to do the
podcast last night. I just,

636
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:36,790
I just can't do it on the days I travel,
you know,

637
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:41,080
flew across this country once again
from Philly all the way out here.

638
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:44,260
And I'm like, all right, it took an early
flight, seven 30 in the fucking morning,

639
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:50,510
I'll land 10 30 la time somehow I'll take
a little old man nap in the afternoon.

640
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,830
You know the old man take a nap.
You know what I mean?

641
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,630
Will you lie in the fetal position with
your hands in the prayer prayer pose

642
00:40:58,631 --> 00:41:01,000
between your fucking milk white thighs.

643
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:06,001
If you me sitting there and you bbds and
a tee shirt and black dress socks on,

644
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,940
faced in towards the cushion.
That's an old man nap.

645
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:13,750
Okay.

646
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,570
And then somewhere through what
you roll over on your back,

647
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,600
start breathing out your
fucking mouth and, and I just,

648
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:22,960
you know,

649
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,960
that's what old people do and they all
guys do you need do it right in the

650
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:29,740
fucking living room. So no one could
watch TV, just dominate in the house.

651
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,910
Yo man balls just hanging out
this side yet. Tighty whities

652
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,850
um, that was the plan.
That's what I was gonna do.

653
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,300
Then you always end up getting cold too.
I never understood that.

654
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,430
If I lie on the couch awake and
I'm not moving, I never get cold.

655
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,760
But the second you fall asleep, you
get, you get it. You don't Chile.

656
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:58,850
Why did you go Julie? We
just leaving. Um, AH, Jesus.

657
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,540
I hate myself this week.
I'm not even it.

658
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,860
I'm not even going to
fucking get into this shit.

659
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:06,320
How fucking on funny I was
last night on the podcast.

660
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,560
I try to record this in for
like 20 goddamn minutes.

661
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,530
I to the point I have to put up one
of the outtakes at the end of this.

662
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:13,430
I've never done that.

663
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,110
I want to put up an outtake of
me just quitting on a story.

664
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:23,120
Um, I'll put that up at the
end, but before I, before,

665
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:27,320
before I get into the rest of the
podcast, ladies and gentleman, um,

666
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,430
I've got a couple of
things I have to hype. Um,

667
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,420
like tonight for all you
people in Los Angeles,

668
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:37,160
I'm going to be doing a benefit for a
all the victims of the earthquake slash

669
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:40,460
tsunami. Um, over there in Japan.

670
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:44,870
I'm going to be doing it at the
Catalina jazz club. Um, tonight.

671
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,860
[inaudible] it's at six, seven,
two, five sunset boulevard.

672
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,400
Just east of Highland.
All right,

673
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:55,460
I'm going to have the Lincoln everything
up on the [inaudible] podcast.com.

674
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:00,500
The show starts at 8:00 PM, uh, it's
called cabaret cares songs for Japan.

675
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:04,720
So it's actually comedy and a,

676
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:08,800
and some music. So there'll be
some Broadway stars down there. Uh,

677
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,350
daisy Egan's the one who actually put it
together for those of you who are into

678
00:43:12,351 --> 00:43:16,820
Broadway. Uh, she won a
Tony Award when she was 11.

679
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:22,970
Alright.
Sang at Carnegie Hall and killed it at 11.

680
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,880
All right, got got the fucking award
from a, who's that? That checked there?

681
00:43:28,881 --> 00:43:33,410
That I said that women should still
be dressed in like a breakfast,

682
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,560
a breakfast at Tiffany's. What
the Hell's her name there? Uh,

683
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,460
the one that looks like a
little fucking a, not a rat.

684
00:43:41,890 --> 00:43:46,520
Not a hamster. What's a cute little
fucking big brown? I'd wrote it.

685
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,810
That's what she looks like to
me. She looks like, Oh God.

686
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,520
I wish I could have gone on a date with
her and said that to her, you know. Ready?

687
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,710
She's starting to like me and,
and just look across.

688
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:06,700
Are trying to say some pepe le Pew like
Romantic Shit, you know, come here,

689
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:08,860
my little brown,
I'd wrote it.

690
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,440
I fuck you ever notice how
fucking racist at is Pepe Le Pew?

691
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,900
I never noticed I talk
about that on the podcast.

692
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:20,410
Well I don't care if I did
get a wing an hour every week.

693
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,170
You're not going to fucking repeat
yourself sitting in your Goddamn cubicle.

694
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:28,270
How many times you told that fucking joke?
Two guys will be doing a book.

695
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:29,140
You know,

696
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:32,760
just waiting for a new employee so you
can hit him with the same old fucking

697
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:37,440
stories. How dare you?
How dare you question me.

698
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:42,010
You motherfucker in your Goddamn
cubicle, Huh? What are you doing? Ah,

699
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,700
you hate yourself right now
because she ate the whole Cinnabon.

700
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:46,380
Cause you lie to yourself.

701
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:48,810
I'm going to cut it in half and I'm
not going to do it. And what happened?

702
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:52,200
You cut it in half and you
saw that sugary goodness. Huh?

703
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,060
Just fucking come and down in the
fucking Baker. TJ's that's on top.

704
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:00,150
Just dripping down the side.
And what you went down on it,

705
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:04,650
you went down on it like some core,
just got off a bus in a strange city.

706
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:08,220
That's what you did. Now you had
your sugar rush, you like, yeah,

707
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:12,420
I'm going to fucking, I'm gonna make
it through the whole day. Cinnabon,

708
00:45:12,421 --> 00:45:16,380
the poor man's 12 hour energy.
Hey,

709
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:20,100
can somebody please explain to that
commercial to me when those guys take that

710
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:25,020
25 hour energy, whatever the fuck it
is, they take it and the guy goes, yeah,

711
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,930
all right, I'm ready.
And then he sits down,

712
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,040
puts his feet up on the
table and reads a newspaper.

713
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:34,470
I thought it's supposed to make
you go work once the deal. Oh God.

714
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:37,560
Am I going to suck on this one toe?
You know what?

715
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:40,200
Fuck you guys every once
in a while have a bad set.

716
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,450
I think I'm going to bond this week.
So anyways,

717
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,970
getting back to what I was talking about.

718
00:45:44,971 --> 00:45:49,830
So I had planned on taking a nap
and old man fucking nap by the way,

719
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,990
strip it right down to my underwears
and sleeping on the couch like a fucking

720
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:58,680
the old man than I am.
But uh, the masters,

721
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:03,770
the masters was on and I had to watch
it because Rory Macintyre from Ireland

722
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,540
look like he was gonna win the damn thing.
You know?

723
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:14,280
Plus I'm always rooting for tiger, you
know, because I have issues with women.

724
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:19,910
I have such issues with
women that I actually think
that at their women meetings

725
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,300
where they trash guys,

726
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,960
they actually have like a little counter
on how many tournaments it's been since

727
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:31,290
tiger actually won in. They're
trying to sit there, you know,

728
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,400
it's a fucking braid.
Their Harry muffs just sitting there

729
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,430
is the braid their
hair, Harry must. Right.

730
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,760
And they're just sitting there and
going, you know why? You know why he,

731
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,120
I think when, because in every good
work, every good man [inaudible] woman,

732
00:46:48,121 --> 00:46:52,800
I know this saying that shit.
So I'm fucking ruining for tiger.

733
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:57,180
Even though I had a bet
with Keith Robinson,

734
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:03,470
every year we bet the masters and every
year he picks tiger and then I pick a

735
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:05,340
white guy,
you know,

736
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:10,430
it's sort of fun with racism and I send
them Texas like white power and this is

737
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:15,240
a white man's game and you're not
taking over this one. We'll give you,

738
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:19,050
we'll give you football,
we'll give you basketball.

739
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,290
Your black people actually took
over baseball there for a minute.

740
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:25,110
Then they just stopped giving a
shit. You know? It's too boring.

741
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:29,070
I don't know what it was. I liked
that. When they do those things on, on,

742
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:32,920
on sports shows,
we have to get more African Americans.

743
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:36,790
End of the day of a baseball,
they don't like it.

744
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,073
You know

745
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:40,790
what the fuck?

746
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,020
Why are you going to force a fucking
sport that you know what it is,

747
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,730
is because baseball sucks as they
left. Actually, no, the Latinos saved.

748
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:53,920
What am I a def jam comic? What's with
all the race shit this week, Bill? Yeah,

749
00:47:53,921 --> 00:47:58,100
but see a white person
played baseball about, Fuck

750
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:05,120
God, His jersey. I'll snug
up on his nuts and shit. Um,

751
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:09,600
do you guys see a, what's his face? Uh,

752
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,840
Manny Ramirez tested
positive again. Ah, sucks.

753
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,620
Then he just steady fucking
skid. Addled I'm retired.

754
00:48:18,621 --> 00:48:19,970
I'm going to go to Spain with my dad.

755
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,880
I didn't like how palpate
barn was giving him shit.

756
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:25,880
I thought that was a conti move.
I get it.

757
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,880
You're obviously didn't like the guy
when he fucking played and your team,

758
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,440
but you don't have to be a content.

759
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:34,400
Throw the guy under the bus saying all
this shit that these guys are already

760
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,660
going to say. It's kind of like
this, this asshole here in the uh,

761
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,650
one of the, of those guys in the New York
Post. You know those guys, they a hours.

762
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:46,640
You are as you one of those
guys on around the horn.

763
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:51,830
That show that just makes absolutely
no sense. I don't understand that show.

764
00:48:51,831 --> 00:48:53,660
I don't understand how the points work.

765
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:59,890
I don't understand why that guy who
sounds like somebody imitating somebody

766
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:03,690
stupid, you know, hosts the show is,

767
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,580
is always clicking. Why he's in charge
of the scoring. I don't understand it.

768
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:13,670
I don't, I don't get it. And it's always
like four guys talking at once. And uh, I,

769
00:49:13,671 --> 00:49:17,870
like Wally says his name, I add, I've
got, I don't get that fucking show.

770
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:21,290
I think this guy's one of those guys
on that shelf. So anyways, if you,

771
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:25,880
if you watch the, uh, the masters, which
I've watched for the last three years,

772
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:30,200
I went to it last year, two
years ago, I watched Kenny Perry.

773
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,840
I'm watching this guy just, you know,
it looks like a regular guy. I'm like,

774
00:49:32,841 --> 00:49:34,370
oh great,
he's going to win the masters.

775
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,230
And then I watched just the fucking wheels
come off the entire last day and the

776
00:49:39,231 --> 00:49:42,110
guy completely chokes and I
got to tell you something.

777
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,770
Golf is the worst game to choke him.
You know,

778
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,460
if you're a goaltender in the NHL
and you let up a bad goal, I mean,

779
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:53,150
how long does that take? You know
what? Fuck, in a split second,

780
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:57,530
you let up another bad one. People bull.
Yeah, I mean what we have a bad period.

781
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:01,820
They take you out of fucking gay.
It's maybe a half hour of a life.

782
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,210
That's a long fucking time.
You missed the big shot.

783
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,480
You call the fucking time out like
Chris Weber or whatever. Right.

784
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:13,210
It's fucking over done. You
walk off the court. That's it.

785
00:50:13,211 --> 00:50:14,260
I guess he gets shit for,

786
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,790
it's still bill Buckner ball rolls
through his fucking legs in the fan that

787
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:23,530
match wet. All right. How long did
that take dude? You choke in golf?

788
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,300
I guess I'm talking about the game itself.

789
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:28,310
I'm not talking about the amount of shit
that you get afterwards cause that's

790
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:32,350
usually lifelong cause I heard that bill
Buckner had to move to like Idaho was

791
00:50:32,351 --> 00:50:33,184
some shit.

792
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,440
But what I'm saying is going through the
agony of the choke is anywhere from a

793
00:50:39,261 --> 00:50:42,080
split second up to a button,
I don't know, 2025 minutes,

794
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,430
but in golf it's hours,
hours and hours.

795
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:51,110
It's three hours watching this kid just
all over the fucking course and you know

796
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:55,220
what is 21 years old?
I thought he handled it tremendously.

797
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,500
He handled it tremendously.

798
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,950
One point he kind of laughed and shook
his head that one hole when he was

799
00:51:00,951 --> 00:51:02,900
standing in between a couple of houses.

800
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:06,710
I've never seen houses on a
golf course before my life.

801
00:51:06,711 --> 00:51:08,990
That's how bad his shot was.
It ricocheted off.

802
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:16,460
His ball landed in like a kitty pool.
I'm telling you folks,

803
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:20,210
it was off the golf course. Ah,
Jesus, I suck this week. Um,

804
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,670
so this dish fucking rights,
uh,

805
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:30,650
his shirt was stained in the front.
Everybody shirt was stained.

806
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:35,180
You playing fucking golf in
the sun. Fucking fat. Fuck you.

807
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,130
Goddamn show was probably
staying when you typed this.

808
00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:40,880
Listen to what this guy
said. It was staying in the
front, untucked in the back.

809
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:46,030
A little boy lost Rory mcilroy trudged
up the final holes at Augusta national

810
00:51:47,931 --> 00:51:51,320
and Sunday afternoon as if
looking for somewhere to cry.

811
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:57,020
His swagger had shriveled up into, or
stoop is boyish. Smile became nod lips.

812
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,690
And I want to ask some anybody
else watch it to anybody.

813
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:03,590
See at any point where he was going to
cry, I thought he held his composure.

814
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:08,330
Granted, he played fucking horrific.
He definitely maybe, you know,

815
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,870
started to panic or whatever. I'm not a
golfer. I Dunno what the fuck happens,

816
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:16,610
but he didn't look like he was
going to cry. I hate these.

817
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:20,120
I hate these fucking sports writers.
You know what I mean?

818
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,870
You already have a word
count, so you gotta throw in
another adjectives in there.

819
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,630
He's 21 fucking years old.

820
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:30,200
And then what happens is when
something like this happens in sports,

821
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:35,180
then these fat fucks sport writers who
sucked in gym class, you know they did.

822
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:39,950
You know they were the kids who got like
the bloody nose and playing dodge ball.

823
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,850
Then they just start turning up
the fucking pressure. You know?

824
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,570
That's what sucks about choking those
because now everyone's going to be sitting

825
00:52:47,571 --> 00:52:50,510
there going like,
you know,

826
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:55,330
you had that collapse at the master's,
barely had time to reflect that.

827
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,830
Even at the end, I thought he'd said
it. Well, he says, what's going to,

828
00:52:57,831 --> 00:53:00,770
what are you, what are you thinking about
right now? And he just said, listen,

829
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:03,650
it's too early. It's too early to
reflect. I want to just happen.

830
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:07,730
Talk to me in a couple of days. I thought
it was really fucking mature, whatever.

831
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,800
So I support the guy. I hope he fucking,
when's his God damn thing again? But fuck,

832
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:17,480
I lost 50 bucks cause tiger ended
up having a higher score than Rory.

833
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:21,200
I just picked the top white guy.
I started watching the second day.

834
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:25,040
So then I bet with Keith and now I owe
that son of a bitch. 50 Bucks, you know,

835
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,220
kills me is he's just going to blow it
on another itchy sweater. All right,

836
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:32,340
let's get into the podcast
here for this week. Uh,

837
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:37,410
where the hell am I here? But by hype to
thing. Oh, another thing I have to hype.

838
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:42,600
The other thing I have to hike this
week as people have been asking me, um,

839
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:46,590
I have a date at the punchline in
San Francisco on Monday, May 9th.

840
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,320
And people are asking me
when the tickets go on sale.

841
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:54,150
They go on sale this Friday, April
15th. All right. That's the deal.

842
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:57,210
Go to the, uh, the punchline,
San Francisco website,

843
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,210
which of course I don't have that fucking
information, but you could Google it,

844
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:05,670
right? Anyways, let's talk about my
weekend. I had two awesome shows.

845
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,930
Had to have some shows. I did one at the
records theater and Towson, Maryland. And,

846
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:15,880
uh, then the next one I did was at
the tower, the tower theater in, uh,

847
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,710
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Legendary venue I might add.

848
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,830
Okay. And you know, I'm all about
the history. David Bowlby, uh,

849
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,740
recorded a live album,
their first tie,

850
00:54:27,741 --> 00:54:32,620
Bruce Springsteen got a check for five
grand was standing up or after you stood

851
00:54:32,621 --> 00:54:37,150
on that stage and performed,
um, average white band record,

852
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:42,070
their live album. Uh, the fuck is it
called cut the cake, pick up the pieces.

853
00:54:42,730 --> 00:54:44,770
I can see your Pussy, lips,
whatever the fuck it's called.

854
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,570
Dad All was all recorded there.

855
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:50,710
So I got to go down there and become
part of that fucking history. And uh,

856
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:52,481
it was awesome,
man.

857
00:54:52,481 --> 00:54:56,350
I want to thank everybody who showed
up both to the Maryland Gig and two,

858
00:54:56,351 --> 00:54:58,290
the one out in Philly,
um,

859
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:03,100
Maryland Gig was amazing and then Philly
just completely took it to a whole

860
00:55:03,101 --> 00:55:08,020
nother level. Um, it was just
an awesome, awesome crowd.

861
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:11,800
And uh,
actually had some lady,

862
00:55:11,801 --> 00:55:16,750
some lady came up to me at the end of
the show and I had run out of DVDs.

863
00:55:16,751 --> 00:55:21,250
I didn't bring enough. And uh, she was
all bummed out. She goes, you know,

864
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:25,360
my son was supposed to come
tonight but he's on house arrest.

865
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:35,390
Saigon. It's too bad. I ran out of
DVD. She's like, that's all he wanted.

866
00:55:35,391 --> 00:55:39,380
He just wanted to meet you and get a DVD.
So now my liberal side,

867
00:55:39,381 --> 00:55:43,160
I'm starting to feel bed and I go,
all right, why don't you know, uh,

868
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:46,340
maybe you send me an email, maybe I can
send one out to Oma, whatever. Right.

869
00:55:46,341 --> 00:55:48,870
And she goes, oh my God, I would
really appreciate that. And I'm like,

870
00:55:48,871 --> 00:55:52,400
wait a minute, wait a minute.
What did he do? You know,

871
00:55:52,401 --> 00:55:57,050
I don't want to send it out to some
fucking pedophile. Some attempted racist,

872
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:01,720
some guy who's a steel and music online.
I'm fucking with you.

873
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,490
So I guess it turned out some 18 year
old kid punched his 11 year old brother.

874
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:10,930
So her son Fuck head that he is not kid.
Her son,

875
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:15,610
18 years old went over and beat the shit
out of the 18 year old cause he beat up

876
00:56:15,611 --> 00:56:19,870
his fucking 11 year old brother.
And because we live in such a pussy time,

877
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,920
because that kid basically got his
ass kicked for doing what he did.

878
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,580
This kid ends up on house arrest.
Can you,

879
00:56:30,581 --> 00:56:33,790
can you believe that kind of a
fucking country. Who Do we live in

880
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:40,360
where the 18 year old older brother of
an 11 year old who got beat up by an 18

881
00:56:40,361 --> 00:56:45,361
year old can't then go over and kick
the shit out of that 18 year old without

882
00:56:45,551 --> 00:56:49,420
sitting in his own fucking house,
missing a comedy show. You know?

883
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,600
So now I have to mail them a fucking DVD.

884
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,790
That's another goddamn branch off
a tree in the rainforest. And well,

885
00:56:57,791 --> 00:57:01,930
what did that fucking kid learned? The
other kid, what did he learn that is,

886
00:57:02,130 --> 00:57:05,020
because he's probably gonna have a
lawsuit, right? That is profitable.

887
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,610
His way of earning income is to walk
around and beat up 11 year olds who have

888
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:10,444
older brothers.

889
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:11,990
Yeah.

890
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:16,670
Oh, I tell you the hypocrisy. Um, so
anyways, I was sitting out there in, uh,

891
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:20,930
I did this gig out there and uh,
upper Darby,

892
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:26,300
Philadelphia, doesn't that sound
nice? Upper Darby, upper class, upper,

893
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,870
we're up on a hill. We're looking
down on the poor people. Um,

894
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,540
that's not what Philly
is like in Upper Darby.

895
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:34,940
It was one of the most horrific
neighborhoods I've ever driven through.

896
00:57:35,590 --> 00:57:36,650
I'd never been like,
you know,

897
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:41,990
I don't mind driving through the projects
during the day because the people I

898
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:44,330
see out, I'm like, all right,
these are just fucking hard work.

899
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:47,720
And people coming off from their jobs.
It's when the sun goes down,

900
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,590
you know, basically any way
you're at, when the sun goes down,

901
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,600
that's when the fucking assholes come up.

902
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:58,400
Both in the inner city and
out in the suburbs. You know,

903
00:57:58,401 --> 00:58:01,670
there's no serial killer walking around
the suburbs out in the broad daylight.

904
00:58:01,671 --> 00:58:02,750
He comes out at night.

905
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:08,370
This is one of the few neighborhoods
during the fucking day. You can see,

906
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,010
I can't even explain it. Like, I
dunno, go Google some pictures.

907
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,130
Upper Darby in Philly,
it's,

908
00:58:13,131 --> 00:58:16,080
it's unbelievable that Americans
have to fucking live this way.

909
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:20,900
I actually will do. My opening joke was
after driving through that neighborhood,

910
00:58:20,901 --> 00:58:25,430
I was like, what the fuck is New
Orleans bitch? And above, you know,

911
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,140
in order to look like these,
these fucking houses they look like,

912
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:29,820
yeah.

913
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:33,630
You know the end of all in the family
when they go and down that horrific street

914
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,960
of houses in Queens,
that's what it looked like.

915
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:38,970
It looked like a,

916
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:43,260
except they were all rusted out and I
swear to God I thought they had like 10

917
00:58:43,261 --> 00:58:44,094
roofs or something.

918
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,193
Yeah.

919
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,890
So anyways, long story short, I have
a 7:30 AM flight the next fucking day.

920
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:54,751
Oh by the way,

921
00:58:54,751 --> 00:58:59,070
the reason why I got lost going over there
is because I was using my smart phone

922
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,970
and I'm using the little map thing and
I swear to God, that fucking thing.

923
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:04,670
Yeah.

924
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,980
I'm going back to maps.
The rand McNally,

925
00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:10,520
you know what I liked about the rand
McNally at no point when I was looking at

926
00:59:10,521 --> 00:59:14,150
it, did it shut off? Did it go black?

927
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:18,140
The screen went black and then I had
to scroll my thumb down at while.

928
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:22,670
I'm still trying to continue to drive.
The whole fucking was horrific. I'm just,

929
00:59:22,671 --> 00:59:23,810
I'm,
I'm completely,

930
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:28,420
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say we have enough technology.

931
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,880
What do you guys think?
Am I crazy?

932
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:35,690
Like that three d TV,
let me ask you guys,

933
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,960
are you re you guys really going to go
out and buy those fucking things and then

934
00:59:39,961 --> 00:59:43,380
there's going to be the tipping point
where more people have them than don't

935
00:59:43,381 --> 00:59:44,010
have them.

936
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:48,480
So then eventually I'm not going to be
able to see shit on my regular fucking TV.

937
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:53,760
Three d TV is to be, is it, is it not
fucking clear enough with the HDTV?

938
00:59:53,761 --> 00:59:58,410
Is it not clear enough that I can see
the fucking Cartlidge inside the nose of

939
00:59:58,411 --> 00:59:59,720
the fucking newscaster mean?

940
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,660
They kept saying that when I was
watching the masters with layers,

941
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,420
they go the masters then three league
like I really need to be sitting there

942
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:08,171
Bendon back.

943
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:11,830
Like I'm watching the matrix is the golf
ball goes flying over my fucking head.

944
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:17,490
You know your living room outside life
is in three d go for a fucking walk.

945
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:21,810
It's a total scam.
Think about how much you want it.

946
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,090
I want to tell you guys this,
right? Just think about this shit.

947
01:00:24,390 --> 01:00:27,870
Think about all the shit on three d.
All right. Do you want to watch this?

948
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,290
Dt need to watch two and a
half men in three d like, wow.

949
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:33,540
I feel like I'm sitting
on the couch with them.

950
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:40,090
Do you need to watch the news in three d?
I'm going to tell you right now,

951
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:43,240
sports in three d is going to suck.

952
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:47,140
It's going to suck. I'm gonna tell
you right now it's, it's, it's gonna.

953
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,110
I already think what the
Hd TV, it's all, it's,

954
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,630
it's getting to the point
where it's so clear.

955
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:57,850
It's like HD is like clearer
than real life. I don't know.

956
01:00:57,851 --> 01:00:59,590
It's like,
it's like a fucking acid trip.

957
01:01:00,070 --> 01:01:04,090
I remember one time I was watching this
baseball game with this other comedian.

958
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,210
Yeah.

959
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:08,180
And we were sitting there watching
the game when HD TV first came out,

960
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:09,470
we weren't even watching the game.

961
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:13,250
He was pointing at somebody
and like the third row,

962
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,740
go and look at that guy shirt. Look how
fucking orange has shirtless. And it was,

963
01:01:17,790 --> 01:01:21,140
it was literally an orange that
did not exist in real life.

964
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,240
So what happened? Everybody
bought those fucking three d, uh,

965
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:29,110
bought the flatscreen TVs.
You know,

966
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:33,340
now old people with their little
square TV from the greatest generation.

967
01:01:33,341 --> 01:01:34,001
They got to go out,

968
01:01:34,001 --> 01:01:38,890
buy a flat screen TV that break in there
fucking hip as they try to put it up on

969
01:01:38,891 --> 01:01:43,891
top of their old fashioned radio where
they used to listen to FDA and his

970
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:47,140
fireside chats,
right?

971
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,200
They finally get the
fucking thing up there.

972
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,660
The bankers took them their entire
retirement and now you can't.

973
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,740
You're going to go out
and buy three d TVs.

974
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:01,850
It's going to fall down on their fucking
old heads and that's going to be yet,

975
01:02:04,370 --> 01:02:07,580
please people, please don't buy those
three d TVs. It's a fucking scam.

976
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,770
What's going to happen with
your old flat screen TV?

977
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,250
What are you going to do with that?
Just going to throw it out.

978
01:02:13,310 --> 01:02:16,010
It's going to end up in the ocean
is talking about this this weekend.

979
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:20,010
We're going to be able to walk to
Europe on, on old flat fucking TVs.

980
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:24,030
You don't need it is what I'm
trying to tell you. I've never,

981
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:28,900
I can't remember the last time
I fucking prayed that a, uh,

982
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:33,270
that uh, technology was going to
bomb the way I have with those,

983
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:35,520
those d fucking TVs.
All right.

984
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:39,180
And I don't want to hear
any of you fucking can send
me emails talking about the

985
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:44,181
discovery channel and how the fucking
do from the God damn rainforest frog is

986
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:48,840
going to drip off right into your fucking
lap. And if you smoke some weed, man,

987
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:52,600
how fucking cool that's going to be. And
then all the Frat Boys, who would've,

988
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:57,300
well, porno porno with three d.
What about fucking a real girl?

989
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:01,860
What about that? You know, all right,

990
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,590
I'm going to give you pour enough.
I will give you porno cause you know,

991
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:07,740
it's going to be great. I can't wait
for that fucking sex suit to come up.

992
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:08,851
You know,

993
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:12,270
they're working on that like a full body
sex suit is actually scientists working

994
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:16,380
on that, having mature
conversations, uh, you know,

995
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:21,900
like not snickering at all talking
about these, these fucking,

996
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,710
as they're developing like dissections
and basically what it's going to be.

997
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:26,860
Do you remember that,

998
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:30,090
that little onesies that Arthur funds
are rarely used to wear when he be in his

999
01:03:30,091 --> 01:03:35,070
garage working on some fucking 1940s
rusted out hunk of Shit. Remember that,

1000
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,570
that thing that he would wear it kind
of dirty version of like those jumpsuits

1001
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:43,680
that the caddies were at the masters.
You know,

1002
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:46,350
of course Brittany would wear one,

1003
01:03:46,351 --> 01:03:50,610
roll it up and have her titties hanging
out of it and talk, you know, saying like,

1004
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,330
oops, did I just touch your Dick again?
Whatever the fuck she used to sing about.

1005
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,000
Right. Hey, do you know
when rolling stone,

1006
01:03:57,001 --> 01:04:01,530
they had the top one hardest 100 artists
of all time and Madonna was like 50

1007
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:04,710
something and I was going to get upset,
but I was just like, you know what,

1008
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:06,990
how many pop stars can
last fucking 30 years?

1009
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:12,180
But then I thought there was justice
because they had like other famous artists

1010
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,250
writing,
like you know,

1011
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:20,460
like Questlove would write the one for
prince you two would write the one for

1012
01:04:20,461 --> 01:04:23,130
like a, you know, fucking
rolling stones or whatever.

1013
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:27,650
But I thought it was really fitting
that Brittany Spears wrote the one from

1014
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:32,850
Madonna,
although it should have been lady Gaga.

1015
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:37,410
She's doing a fucking songs,
right? Like fucking word for word.

1016
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:41,880
She's doing a mash up without,
without Mcdonald's lyrics over at the top.

1017
01:04:41,881 --> 01:04:43,230
Is that what the fuck she's doing?
Anyways?

1018
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:45,450
Let me get back to what the
fuck I was talking about here,

1019
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,300
which I can't even remember.

1020
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:50,080
Okay.

1021
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,120
The fuck is wrong with my brain this week.

1022
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,190
What the fuck was I just talking about?

1023
01:04:59,040 --> 01:04:59,360
Yeah.

1024
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:04,160
Oh Jesus Christ. You know, so
you know what? I'm fucking Rory.

1025
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:07,700
Whatever the fuck his name is,
right McElroy right now. Okay.

1026
01:05:07,701 --> 01:05:10,790
I had this whole fucking thing when it's
the final days of the masters and I'm

1027
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:14,060
just limping my way through 18
holes of this fucking podcast.

1028
01:05:14,061 --> 01:05:16,850
This podcast right now is
in between those two little,

1029
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,120
just like Rory was on the fucking
13th or the 15th fucking Hole,

1030
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:26,230
whatever the hell it was. What
happened to all fat, tits,

1031
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:31,070
Phil Mickelson, I wanted him to
win another one. I'll tell you,

1032
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,770
it killed me that I wasn't
there at the masters.

1033
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,410
If you ever get a fucking chance,
you got to go. I went last year,

1034
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:38,980
I've been to a super bowl and it's never
really bugged me that I didn't go to

1035
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:42,310
another one. It bugged me for
the first couple of years,

1036
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:45,520
but once the game was over and I still
had two grand in my pocket and I didn't

1037
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:46,540
have to go to a,
uh,

1038
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:51,210
an airport and stand in line and do
that horse shit again and fly home.

1039
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,790
It's never bugged me. But this one's
seriously bugged me that I wasn't there.

1040
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:58,450
You got to go once in your life.
You've got to go down to Augusta,

1041
01:05:58,451 --> 01:06:01,450
but I've got to tell you to say it's
one in one of the shittiest fucking, uh,

1042
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:06,690
it's not even in a shitty neighborhood.
It's just like, you know you don't,

1043
01:06:06,691 --> 01:06:10,530
when they show that when you drive
up and you look at the Georgia Pines,

1044
01:06:10,531 --> 01:06:14,010
whatever the fuck they are, when you
drive up to the clubhouse, first of all,

1045
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:17,430
as a spectator, you're not allowed to
drive up there and you never see it.

1046
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,440
You're not allowed to walk
around that side of it.

1047
01:06:19,441 --> 01:06:21,090
That's just for the
players in the members,

1048
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,460
but right outside of that like a half a
mile away is like a fucking waffle house

1049
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:29,280
at Denny's at JC Penney's,

1050
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:33,510
just like just that shit.
Mcdonald's

1051
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,530
ace hardware store,

1052
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:41,390
the way they shoot that thing is they
shoot the masters the same way they shoot

1053
01:06:41,391 --> 01:06:44,210
like Elvis's house.
Like when you look at Elvis's house,

1054
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:47,330
it looks like it's just
like it's in Savannah,

1055
01:06:47,331 --> 01:06:51,830
Georgia or something and then you go to
Elvis's house and I swear to God there's

1056
01:06:51,831 --> 01:06:56,240
like an, I hop like right next
door and I was like, yeah,

1057
01:06:56,241 --> 01:06:57,950
that makes sense.
That's why he was so fat.

1058
01:06:58,580 --> 01:07:02,480
He could just walk down his driveway
and go get some pigs and blankets and he

1059
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:03,680
just go over there.
You know.

1060
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:12,210
Was Elvis the first fat coke head.
You know, they talk about that.

1061
01:07:12,211 --> 01:07:14,490
Like most people do coke,
the they're not, uh,

1062
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:19,770
they fucking lose weight or some shit,
you know, I dunno. You know something,

1063
01:07:19,771 --> 01:07:22,830
he got fat too. Before we really
had all the preservatives in there.

1064
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:26,670
He was just fat on some,
what the fuck was he eating?

1065
01:07:26,671 --> 01:07:30,660
Peanut butter and fucking banana
fried sandwiches on his fucking jet.

1066
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:36,030
Splitting his jumpsuits. Oh, another
jumpsuit bringing it back around again.

1067
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:40,500
That's exactly what those, those,
those caddies got those jumpsuits a,

1068
01:07:40,501 --> 01:07:43,410
they all had a mission is the cake.
And they could come down on one knee.

1069
01:07:43,411 --> 01:07:46,440
That's what they should do. Come down
on one knee holding out the Cape.

1070
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:49,530
Is Somebody fucking Putz for the master's?

1071
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,610
That would add some excitement, wouldn't
it? All right, let's get back to Philly.

1072
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,350
So anyways, so I got up, I got a 7:30
AM flight. All right. So I'm thinking,

1073
01:07:58,351 --> 01:07:59,184
all right,

1074
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:03,480
that means I gotta get up at fucking five
30 return the rental car and all that

1075
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:07,320
horse shit. Why don't I stay at a
hotel right next to the airport.

1076
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,750
So my travel agent gives
me the whole list of, uh,

1077
01:08:12,751 --> 01:08:15,980
of options of where I can stay. So I'm
like, yeah, fine, fuck it. All right.

1078
01:08:15,981 --> 01:08:20,450
I checked them out and one of them is
the Sheridan Sheridan, respected name,

1079
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:25,430
a very quality hotel.
I say I'm going to stay there.

1080
01:08:25,431 --> 01:08:28,970
And the price reflected that
it was a quality hotel. It
cost me like, oh, you know,

1081
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:31,460
180 bucks or something like
that was a lot of fucking money.

1082
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:36,680
So a one 99 something like
that, you know, fulfill, he,

1083
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:40,880
that's a lot of fucking money considering
I was right outside upper Darby.

1084
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,860
So anyways,
here's my travel tip for you.

1085
01:08:44,861 --> 01:08:49,861
Do not ever stay at the fucking Sheridan
at the Philadelphia International

1086
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:54,040
Airport. It is a beyond
ghetto, Sheridan and I,

1087
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:55,900
and it's so fucking ghetto that I,

1088
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:59,890
I knew it was a fucked up Sharon
before I even went into it.

1089
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,130
I pulled up and it looked fine. I
got out of my car, it looked fine.

1090
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:07,840
And as I walked into the place,
as I was walking in,

1091
01:09:07,841 --> 01:09:11,860
these four chicks were coming out and
they just look like horse from a reality

1092
01:09:11,861 --> 01:09:15,250
show.
Awful tattoos on their feet.

1093
01:09:15,490 --> 01:09:19,750
Tidies up and pushed together these
cheap ass look stripper shoes.

1094
01:09:19,751 --> 01:09:24,130
And I went out though. Oh No, not,
not, not, not a bad hotel. Please God,

1095
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,710
please. I start praying to
the travel guides. Please,

1096
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:30,370
please don't let this be a bad hotel.
You know how Mike Way,

1097
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,670
but you know at first I was
like, all right, what, what
are these like call girls?

1098
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:37,930
So they just get done servicing some
fucking married business guy on the road.

1099
01:09:38,570 --> 01:09:42,220
Is that what they did? But it was
like 12 noon. It's like, no, no, no.

1100
01:09:42,221 --> 01:09:47,200
Call Girls are up at 12 noon. All right.
They already wiped fucking washed off.

1101
01:09:47,201 --> 01:09:51,820
The vaginas hosed them down at like eight
in the morning and now they just fell

1102
01:09:51,821 --> 01:09:55,510
asleep face down in a fucking pile of
glitter and they're not going to wake up

1103
01:09:55,511 --> 01:09:59,530
again to like five in the afternoon.
That's how it works. And they wake up,

1104
01:09:59,531 --> 01:10:03,560
they fucking, you know, I
dunno what they do. You know,

1105
01:10:03,561 --> 01:10:05,330
they put some fucking vitamin E on the,

1106
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:09,140
on the ligature marks around
their neck from the night before.

1107
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,193
Yeah.

1108
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,510
Do you know,
you know what's fucked up about ligature?

1109
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:22,790
Nobody ever uses that statement unless
somebody's got choked to death. You know?

1110
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,910
Linkature my know what does never any
ligature marks, because you know why?

1111
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:29,120
Because these girls who
are into that type of shit,

1112
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:33,890
if they survive the encounter, they
fucking, they were that little, uh,

1113
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:37,340
that little ass got the next day around
their neck. You know, the hoary one,

1114
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:40,160
a choker.
That's what they were to cover it up.

1115
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:44,360
You have to have a girl wants you
to do that once you to choke her.

1116
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:48,090
I remember one time I was with
this girl, right, and she a shoe,

1117
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:51,770
all this type of shit. Do you want me
to slap her in the face and all this,

1118
01:10:51,771 --> 01:10:54,540
all this crazy shit that,
uh,

1119
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:58,260
there are all these fucking
women's shows they never address.

1120
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:03,140
They never addressed the amount
of fucking women that liked that.

1121
01:11:03,141 --> 01:11:05,780
They like it rough.
It's fucking insane,

1122
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:08,960
unless I just keep picking the
same kinds of fucking women,

1123
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:13,260
but it's ridiculous the amount of
fucking broads that I've gone out with,

1124
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,220
you know,

1125
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:18,150
fucking women's Lib, fucking Blah,
blah, blah. My career comes first.

1126
01:11:18,151 --> 01:11:23,130
If we get married, I'm not taking your
last name, Yadda Yadda, fucking Yada,

1127
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:29,080
right? Then you get them in, you
know, the fucking all pro women.

1128
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:33,930
There's pro women that, and I'm making
my own money and fucking, you know,

1129
01:11:34,030 --> 01:11:37,750
in a couple of other fucking lyrics
from some stupid Beyonce song, right?

1130
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,890
All at fucking horse shit. You're
going to respect me eyeball to eyeball,

1131
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:45,850
the images of women on TV,
all that fucking horse shit.

1132
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,150
And then you get them back to
your place and lo and behold,

1133
01:11:49,151 --> 01:11:53,770
they have a rape fantasy, you know, am
I the only guy by the only fucking guy.

1134
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,480
So anyways, so I was seeing
this fucking broad, right?

1135
01:11:56,481 --> 01:11:58,090
And she's going to fucking college.

1136
01:11:58,091 --> 01:12:00,340
She's getting her Mba and
all that type of shit.

1137
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:03,490
So this is the first
girl she ever asked me.

1138
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,510
She told me that she wanted,
uh,

1139
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:10,720
me to choker and I was like,
no, I'm not doing that.

1140
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:11,820
Yeah.

1141
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,390
And she's like, why not? And I said, well,

1142
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:18,690
cause I'm not fucking gonna call the cops.

1143
01:12:19,390 --> 01:12:22,590
Like how am I going to talk my way out
of that if you fucking pass out and I got

1144
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:27,180
my fingerprints around you,
God damn neck and your naked body.

1145
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:29,430
I mean that just sounds like one
of those fucking things from,

1146
01:12:29,431 --> 01:12:30,720
even if you come around,

1147
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,210
I'm going to have some sort of fucking
assault charge and then you're going to

1148
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:36,600
feel guilty because everybody's going
to know because the cops are there.

1149
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:39,480
So then you just going to be like,
yeah, I didn't want him to do it.

1150
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:43,860
So you can somehow skip away with your
fucking integrity. I'm not doing it.

1151
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,560
Of course I did. Of course
they did. Eventually.

1152
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,440
But there's a technique I can't actually,
you gotta you gotta be,

1153
01:12:51,441 --> 01:12:54,200
you gotta make sure you're up a little
higher and underneath and you gotta you

1154
01:12:54,201 --> 01:12:57,040
gotta do it and then not be doing
it, do it. And then not doing it.

1155
01:12:57,041 --> 01:12:58,520
Don't just fucking grab it.

1156
01:12:59,030 --> 01:13:02,900
Like you don't grab their
next like fucking David Tyree
in the helmet. Catch you.

1157
01:13:02,901 --> 01:13:06,170
Don't, you don't want to
do that cause you're going,

1158
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:11,280
you're going to choke him out. Uh, you
know, unless you're really good at CPI,

1159
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:16,070
how the fuck fucked it ended up talking
about that shit. That's it really.

1160
01:13:16,071 --> 01:13:17,990
You know something?
I'm going to talk about that in my act.

1161
01:13:19,190 --> 01:13:22,520
Jesus said I'll bring this psychos out.
Um,

1162
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:26,300
I'm going to talk about that. My Ex, you
just heard a fucking preview of a joke.

1163
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:27,470
I really want to bring that up.

1164
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,370
The amount of fucking women
they got that thing right.

1165
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:31,820
They're all independent
and that type of thing.

1166
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,280
And then you get him in the
bedroom like you want it.

1167
01:13:33,281 --> 01:13:36,340
They want you to get kicked the shit out
of him. But they got that, does that,

1168
01:13:36,341 --> 01:13:37,450
that fucking line.

1169
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,620
They want to feel the man's
power but still feel like safe.

1170
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:43,800
Yeah.

1171
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,450
Overpower me.
But like do it in like a nice way,

1172
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:53,250
but not nice, but nice. Do you know what
I made? I know exactly what you mean.

1173
01:13:53,251 --> 01:13:54,930
You filthy fucking whore.

1174
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,850
Uh, all right, I have to get up.
I gotta get off this subject.

1175
01:13:59,851 --> 01:14:03,000
This is just going to get too freaky
to be talking about this by myself.

1176
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:07,830
Uh, this is the choke 'em
out podcast, everybody. So
anyway, so I see these fucking,

1177
01:14:07,831 --> 01:14:12,490
just these, these whores
father didn't stick, you know,

1178
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,760
George Foreman Grill,
Eaton fucking just,

1179
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:21,160
just never had a chance
for girls just coming out.

1180
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:24,220
Just never had a fucking chance.
And you know,

1181
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,630
just dressed like fucking trucks,
doc fucking whores.

1182
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:30,180
And the sad thing is,

1183
01:14:30,181 --> 01:14:34,450
is they think they look good and they
don't even realize the vibe that they're

1184
01:14:34,451 --> 01:14:39,280
putting out. They don't know any better.
They don't fucking know any better.

1185
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:42,550
All right? There was a rusted out
car in their front yard that day.

1186
01:14:42,551 --> 01:14:46,870
They were born and they never
had a fucking chance. You know,

1187
01:14:49,150 --> 01:14:54,150
the only fucking male voice that was in
their household when they was growing up

1188
01:14:54,221 --> 01:14:57,580
was the Billy Best that the deaf,
they're fucking dad left behind.

1189
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,770
You know what I mean? Just, they
just never had a fucking chance.

1190
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:02,980
So that was my first red flag
and I was gone out. God, maybe,

1191
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:06,730
maybe they use some sky miles.
Is that how they got in here?

1192
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:08,770
And I just walked in the
second I walked in, I, I just,

1193
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:13,860
I can just tell the caliber of human being
that was in there straight across the

1194
01:15:14,111 --> 01:15:18,550
board here. Alright. The
caliber a white person,

1195
01:15:18,670 --> 01:15:22,420
the caliber of black person,
the caliber of fucking male,

1196
01:15:22,421 --> 01:15:25,510
female gps can tell.
You know what I mean?

1197
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:27,460
Yeah.

1198
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:28,480
Saw some black dude,
you know,

1199
01:15:28,481 --> 01:15:32,020
when they get their hair braided but they
don't have enough money to fucking get

1200
01:15:32,021 --> 01:15:34,990
it braided enough so they got all
those little hairs sticking out of it,

1201
01:15:34,991 --> 01:15:38,290
you know, cause you can't see the
scalp in between the braids, you know,

1202
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:41,020
it's not looking fucking right.
It's just not looking right.

1203
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,830
The fucking white dude with
the chief Anderson little suit,

1204
01:15:44,831 --> 01:15:49,831
the fucking creased up Brown loafers with
this gold lamay horseshit on the front

1205
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:54,460
of it. You know, shoes look like they
cost 11 bucks and I'm just going on now.

1206
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,880
Ah, God least let the fucking
room be cleaned, you know?

1207
01:15:57,881 --> 01:16:02,110
So I check in the lady behind the
counter. She was nice enough, you know,

1208
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:05,260
I don't know how she ended up at this
fucking Sharon and maybe she has stepped

1209
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:09,430
out of line at the big a
stockholders meeting. This is,

1210
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:12,010
this is there still Sheridan side barrier.

1211
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:17,530
So then I go up to my room and uh,
it's weird. It had like one of the,

1212
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:19,850
it almost looks like a little house.
She come walking in,

1213
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:23,440
there's a door and right next to it
there's this big window for some stupid

1214
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:24,274
fucking reason.

1215
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:29,770
If I want to overlook half the elevators
in the fucking poor excuse for a pool

1216
01:16:29,771 --> 01:16:34,420
that they had. So the blinds were down,
right. So I open it up and it's a sweet,

1217
01:16:34,421 --> 01:16:37,360
I'm like Nice. It was a nice
room. It wasn't bad at all.

1218
01:16:37,361 --> 01:16:42,100
So I'm in there for like five fucking
minutes and I hear this knock on the door,

1219
01:16:42,101 --> 01:16:46,300
right guy fucking knocks on the door.
He was covered in foam.

1220
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:47,590
So that's what it sounded like.

1221
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:52,540
And I opened the door and there's a guy
standing there with his giant coffee

1222
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:56,530
table and he goes, and he's trying to walk
in with this giant cocktail. I'm like,

1223
01:16:56,531 --> 01:16:59,650
Whoa, whoa. I go, you got the wrong room.
I didn't order a table. He goes, not, oh,

1224
01:16:59,651 --> 01:17:02,380
this, this tables is your, your,

1225
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:05,800
your room's missing a table
like it is. They go, yeah, yeah.

1226
01:17:05,801 --> 01:17:10,250
The last people who are here
broke the other table. I was like,

1227
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:13,340
Jesus Christ. What? Did they have? Like
a party or something? Anyway, yeah.

1228
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:16,490
I thought he was going to say no.
He went like, yeah, and I go, well,

1229
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:21,170
they fucking fumigate the place now. I
think everything's been just on. I'm,

1230
01:17:21,171 --> 01:17:25,250
you know, I'm laying in fucking angel
dust and cocaine and Shit, you know?

1231
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:27,680
Yeah,

1232
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:28,670
yeah.
It keeps getting worse.

1233
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:31,580
Then I'm sitting there for another couple
minutes and then I just hear this lady

1234
01:17:31,581 --> 01:17:33,820
telling this story, right? Yeah.

1235
01:17:33,970 --> 01:17:37,670
They did this mother fucker fucking track.

1236
01:17:37,990 --> 01:17:41,540
Tell me that mother fucker can't
come off it. I said, mother Fucker,

1237
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:46,110
mother fucker with a motherfucker,
and I'm like, is that it leads?

1238
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:47,690
Is it at least a guest?

1239
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:52,910
Is it at least the guests and I fucking
open the blinds to my window and she's

1240
01:17:52,911 --> 01:17:54,620
one of the people cleaning the rooms.

1241
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,080
Yeah.

1242
01:17:56,080 --> 01:18:00,280
Just cursing up a fucking
storm loud as fucking hell.

1243
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,020
Like all broke Pete,
Bro.

1244
01:18:03,021 --> 01:18:06,710
People are the loudest fucking people
because they live near the freeways.

1245
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:11,110
They live near the subway. They used to
shouting over shits and she's out there.

1246
01:18:11,111 --> 01:18:14,980
This mother fucker trying to tell
me what time it is baby. Right.

1247
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:19,680
And just screaming
and you know how much I curse.

1248
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:25,060
Okay. I was offended and you know
how much I curse? I was just like,

1249
01:18:25,061 --> 01:18:28,420
Jesus Christ, can you please,
I might have kids someday.

1250
01:18:28,421 --> 01:18:32,140
Can you please stop cursing like that?
But I didn't say shit cause I,

1251
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:36,330
I mean at that point I knew what was
gonna happen. I would've been like, oh,

1252
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:39,160
I just would've been like,
excuse me, could you do me
a favor? Could you use now?

1253
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,670
Might've, well, why don't
you Maggio business? Ain't
nobody talking to you baby.

1254
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:45,311
Right.

1255
01:18:45,311 --> 01:18:47,860
I didn't want to go through that whole
fucking thing at her screaming at me.

1256
01:18:47,861 --> 01:18:50,710
Plus she was so fucking big,
she probably could've just choke,

1257
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,650
slammed me and we would have had to
have a new fucking table in my room,

1258
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,330
third fucking table that week.

1259
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:59,420
And I'm a conservationalist is that
the right word? So I'm like, all right,

1260
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:01,210
fuck it. Whatever. So I don't say ship.

1261
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:06,610
So then I go out to go do my show and of
course I'm using my stupid smart phone.

1262
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:11,580
I get lost. I'm driving through
upper Darby and it's just like, well,

1263
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:12,421
you know,
a fucking,

1264
01:19:12,421 --> 01:19:15,580
the white guy driving through there
looking down at his phone and yeah,

1265
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:18,510
I can't see it. Can't stay
the same where I am. You know,

1266
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:22,410
I did everything but roll down
the window. Excuse me, hustlers.

1267
01:19:22,411 --> 01:19:24,570
Could you just stop hustling for a second?

1268
01:19:24,571 --> 01:19:28,200
I could just wondering if you could
directly and the direction of this theater

1269
01:19:28,201 --> 01:19:32,880
that I'm performing in tonight.
You know, horrific. So, uh,

1270
01:19:34,020 --> 01:19:36,840
I was so fucking mad.
I really got to get my temper together.

1271
01:19:36,841 --> 01:19:40,410
I was so fucking mad.
I could feel myself when my screen,

1272
01:19:40,411 --> 01:19:41,850
every time I had to go to make a turn,

1273
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,570
I'm looking down at my map and the
fucking phone would go black, you know,

1274
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:48,870
to save the battery. And it was always
what I needed to make a decision.

1275
01:19:48,871 --> 01:19:53,640
Then I would miss a turn and it got to
the point I was squeezing my phone and I

1276
01:19:53,641 --> 01:19:54,111
knew what I was,

1277
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:58,860
I was going to take it and I was just
going to smash it down on the uh,

1278
01:19:58,890 --> 01:20:02,170
whatever you call that, the, the,
the fucking thing that you're

1279
01:20:03,690 --> 01:20:06,220
not a gear shift or I guess it is
geared, the thing, you put it in gear,

1280
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,670
it's not a stick.
You know what the Fuck I'm saying?

1281
01:20:08,671 --> 01:20:11,400
I was just going to smash the screen
on that and I knew that, that I,

1282
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:15,810
I had my temporary control enough
that I knew I couldn't do that shit.

1283
01:20:16,410 --> 01:20:20,040
So what I did was I just started
screaming over and over again,

1284
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:24,750
fuck you at my phone. I was yelling,
fuck you at my, in my car yelling, fuck.

1285
01:20:24,751 --> 01:20:27,930
You would've found blow. That's what
my voice is all scratchy right now.

1286
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:30,040
Not because I had,

1287
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:35,300
I screamed for two shows is because
I was screaming at my cell phone.

1288
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:40,210
So anyways, I finally ended up getting
there. I ended up doing the show.

1289
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,900
It's fucking phenomenal.
And whenever, whenever I,

1290
01:20:43,970 --> 01:20:47,020
I do a show at a place like that.

1291
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:49,683
MMM.

1292
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:50,281
You know,

1293
01:20:50,281 --> 01:20:53,310
there's always some guy's been working
the theater for like 2030 years and I

1294
01:20:53,311 --> 01:20:55,800
always walk up to the guy, go,
you don't have to say any names,

1295
01:20:56,100 --> 01:21:00,100
just tell me some stories. And this guy
was telling stories about, you know,

1296
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:04,830
hanging out with motley Crue back during
the hair metal days and going out to

1297
01:21:04,831 --> 01:21:05,664
strip clubs.

1298
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:09,330
And he said he was there when guns and
roses came through on the appetite for

1299
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:10,290
destruction tour.

1300
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,730
He said afterwards he was standing in
their tour bus and they're looking out

1301
01:21:14,731 --> 01:21:16,890
their windshield at a sea of groupies.

1302
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:22,260
And at 1.1 member, I'm not gonna
name names, looked out and said,

1303
01:21:22,261 --> 01:21:26,280
what's up with those two? And the
guy said, oh, that, that's actually,

1304
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,830
believe it or not, those aren't
sisters. That's a mother.

1305
01:21:28,831 --> 01:21:33,510
And a daughter and I guess they were
really hot and the dude was like, oh yeah,

1306
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:35,483
bring them on the bus.

1307
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,000
Do it in my next life.
I want to be a fucking musician.

1308
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:45,960
Just to have the opportunity to
have that level of groupie. Ugh,

1309
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:49,090
just fucking unreal. So anyways,
so I drove to upper Darby.

1310
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:53,250
He was just unbelievably depressing
that people have to live that way.

1311
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:57,090
Fellow Americans have to live that
way and that we're always sitting here

1312
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:01,140
fucking acting like we give a shit about
other countries and we need to help out.

1313
01:22:01,141 --> 01:22:03,870
We don't. All right, well we,

1314
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:07,780
I mean you give a shit or I give a shit,
but our government doesn't.

1315
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:10,660
We're working our way in
there to help them out.

1316
01:22:10,661 --> 01:22:15,250
Air quotes so we can take their natural
resources. All right. That's how it is.

1317
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:20,230
That's what the fuck is really going
on. If you ever wondered why, all right,

1318
01:22:20,231 --> 01:22:24,670
they don't give a fuck about upper Darby,
new New Orleans or whatever. Fuck it.

1319
01:22:24,671 --> 01:22:28,720
All those blue collar towns that
are failing out there in Ohio,

1320
01:22:28,721 --> 01:22:30,760
they don't give a shit about
him cause they already own them.

1321
01:22:30,910 --> 01:22:32,380
So if there's any oil to be had,

1322
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:36,350
they can just go in and suck
it out of the ground. Yeah.

1323
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:37,810
Did that make any fucking sense?
So anyway,

1324
01:22:37,811 --> 01:22:42,530
so I go back to my ghetto ass
fucking Sheridan. All right.

1325
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:47,600
I come walking in there and uh,
and at this point,

1326
01:22:47,601 --> 01:22:49,520
it's one in the morning.
Now,

1327
01:22:49,521 --> 01:22:52,040
if it was one in the morning
and I was at a nice hotel,

1328
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:56,120
that'd be the usual thing. There would
be some people hanging down at the bar,

1329
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:59,420
you know, drinking, getting
ready to cheat on their spouses.

1330
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:04,460
Dress nicely though.
All right.

1331
01:23:04,461 --> 01:23:08,890
But because was a ghetto fucking Sharon
and I went down there and most of the

1332
01:23:08,891 --> 01:23:10,210
people in the lobby,

1333
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:14,260
we're children running around
screaming like one in the morning,

1334
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:19,060
kids just running around. I felt like I
was in fucking Atlantic city. You know,

1335
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:22,390
those gamblers degenerate gamblers, they
don't fucking handle their kids. Right.

1336
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:26,860
Right. So just as see a fucking children.
I mean, I was waiting for fucking,

1337
01:23:26,861 --> 01:23:27,694
you know,

1338
01:23:28,830 --> 01:23:29,370
yeah.

1339
01:23:29,370 --> 01:23:32,200
Yoga was missing with somebody there,
you know, gathering them like you could,

1340
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:34,810
you could have had a children's choir.
That's how many fucking kids were there.

1341
01:23:35,290 --> 01:23:39,580
So I could go up the elevator and I,
and I get out,

1342
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:42,670
get out of the elevator and I walked
back up to my little, you know,

1343
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:45,250
I told you the front of the room looked
like a house and there was a door.

1344
01:23:45,460 --> 01:23:48,970
And then there's the window. And
as I'm looking, I'm at the doors.

1345
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,820
I'm looking down to take out my hotel key.

1346
01:23:51,821 --> 01:23:56,821
I looked down and on the window sill
is a three quarter eaten chicken wings

1347
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:04,240
sitting on the fucking window sill.
I got pictures to prove it.

1348
01:24:04,810 --> 01:24:08,590
They're all going to be up
on the m m m m podcast.com.

1349
01:24:09,340 --> 01:24:11,890
Whatever the fuck it is.
Is that the name of the website?

1350
01:24:11,891 --> 01:24:15,280
I know the name of the fucking website.
The Hell's wrong with me? Yeah, the MM.

1351
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:20,230
The MM podcast.com. Uh, if you go up
there, I'll have all these pictures,

1352
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:23,080
the pictures of, uh, the
tower theater and all that.

1353
01:24:23,081 --> 01:24:25,750
I didn't take any pictures when I was
driving through upper Darby could for

1354
01:24:25,751 --> 01:24:28,840
obvious fucking reasons. I didn't
want to be, you know, I just,

1355
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:31,780
I would not want to be taking pictures
down there cause people either think

1356
01:24:31,781 --> 01:24:36,550
you're a cop or you're just
documenting their level of poverty,

1357
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:40,270
which would be Fuckin and knowing to me
if I was in that situation. So anyways,

1358
01:24:40,630 --> 01:24:45,550
with that, that was my, Oh and then
the next morning I woke up and uh,

1359
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:48,700
I dropped my car off at budget.
It was fucking hilarious.

1360
01:24:48,701 --> 01:24:52,270
One of these hilarious racial moments
here is I go to get on the bus,

1361
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:56,680
the bus drivers, black five white guys
get on it. He asked us where we're going,

1362
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:59,240
I go USA or this guy says
this, so blah, blah blah.

1363
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:04,290
So we're driving in that
and he's listening to this
preacher because it's Sunday

1364
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:07,150
morning and the guy, you know,
he's talking about, you know,

1365
01:25:07,151 --> 01:25:09,760
people need to be into Jesus and
blah, blah, blah, all this, you know,

1366
01:25:09,761 --> 01:25:11,080
regular Jesus Shit.
Right?

1367
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:15,640
But then all of a sudden he starts
talking about Obama and around he's just

1368
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:20,630
starts kind of trashing white people
just go, oh, we should be given thanks.

1369
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:24,770
Did Jesus,
that a strong black man is president.

1370
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:28,240
It's not afraid to stand
up to the white supremacy.

1371
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:32,090
We run it in this country
and he's got it cranked

1372
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:38,370
and I'm sitting there fucking and all
I did just cause I wanted to have the

1373
01:25:38,371 --> 01:25:41,580
laugh. I just turned around and looked at
all the other four white guys and there

1374
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:44,700
everybody's just sort of sitting down
and looking at that wingtips like rally.

1375
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:49,650
What exactly is the call here? What
can we say something, you know,

1376
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:53,460
excuse me, we're not all
white supremacy. You know,

1377
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:57,510
like what exactly is the proper response
to that? Because I thought it was,

1378
01:25:57,511 --> 01:25:59,790
I dunno, I, I actually thought
it was fucking hilarious.

1379
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:03,440
I wish I could remember what the guy's
saying. Ah, Jesus. Now I'm fucking bomb.

1380
01:26:03,441 --> 01:26:05,990
And again on this fucking
podcast. All right, let's,

1381
01:26:05,991 --> 01:26:10,820
let's get through the rest
of the, uh, what am I going
to do? And I gotta do some,

1382
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:14,840
Oh, hey, wait a minute. Fucking NHL
playoffs are coming up. Everybody.

1383
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:19,850
Are you excited? Are you like me? Do you
like watching hockey Bruins? Canadians?

1384
01:26:19,851 --> 01:26:20,684
Once again,

1385
01:26:21,230 --> 01:26:25,400
we're playing those fucking cops up
there with all their championships.

1386
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:28,490
Do you know the more I read
about the history of the NHL,

1387
01:26:28,491 --> 01:26:31,100
the less impressed with the
Montreal Canadiens? I am.

1388
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:34,490
I mean I used to kind of give
him shit cause I'm like, dude,

1389
01:26:34,491 --> 01:26:38,210
you dominated a 16 league and they
didn't even dominate the 16 league.

1390
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:39,680
It's like them and Toronto.

1391
01:26:40,310 --> 01:26:45,310
Montreal and Toronto basically had the
same amount of cups right through the

1392
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:50,360
early sixties. I, Montreal
was ahead but not by much. Um,

1393
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:55,370
and then I found out later
that the Canadian teams had,

1394
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:59,150
but we know I couldn't give them shakers.
A Bruins were there too. So it's like,

1395
01:26:59,151 --> 01:27:00,320
well why didn't you guys do it?

1396
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:03,530
And I found out one of the
main fucking reasons is,

1397
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:07,580
is the way the league was set up,
any French born Canadian player,

1398
01:27:08,210 --> 01:27:11,780
the Canadian teams had
first dibs on those guys.

1399
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:14,210
That's why they got all
the fucking great guys.

1400
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,890
So it's like Toronto and Montreal
would just like the Yankees and red sox

1401
01:27:18,891 --> 01:27:21,770
fucking buying up everything.
I don't respect them.

1402
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:27,500
I don't respect those championships. What
do you think about that? Montreal? Um,

1403
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:31,310
and then what happened? All of a sudden
you didn't have first fucking a choice,

1404
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:35,990
right? And now, look, now you
don't go on a run anymore.

1405
01:27:35,991 --> 01:27:38,030
You want it 93 one in 86 and that's it.

1406
01:27:38,270 --> 01:27:40,340
And don't even talk to me
about the seventies. Okay.

1407
01:27:40,341 --> 01:27:43,970
I don't want even fucking hear it because
that was still the fallout of the old,

1408
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:46,730
the old system.
You had to give those,

1409
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,750
those expansion six teams a chance to
get on their feet. And once they did,

1410
01:27:50,751 --> 01:27:53,180
that was the end of you guys.
So I'm not fucking impressed.

1411
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:57,740
So fuck you and all your fucking cops
here come the Bruins and you know what?

1412
01:27:57,890 --> 01:28:01,040
Keep your fucking head up or
we're going to slam you into that.

1413
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:05,330
Turnbuckle whatever the fuck they
call it again, that son of a bitch up,

1414
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:09,560
they're fake. And his father cause the
worst concussion ever. Three days later,

1415
01:28:09,561 --> 01:28:12,560
he's at the movies.
He's at the movies.

1416
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,280
All right, I'm just
fucking with you. Okay. Uh,

1417
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:19,820
Bruins Canadians going to be an awesome
series and a carry prices playing great.

1418
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:22,190
So it should be, uh, should be phenomenal.

1419
01:28:22,460 --> 01:28:24,380
I don't think the Bruins are
gonna win the Stanley Cup.

1420
01:28:24,381 --> 01:28:25,970
I just don't think we have enough guys.

1421
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:29,930
And I just think that despite the fact
that we have two great goaltenders,

1422
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:32,570
I just think that there's a lot
of goaltenders playing great.

1423
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:37,850
Kerry prices playing great.
A Henrik Lundqvist is playing tremendous.

1424
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:43,910
Uh, who else? Who else is playing
good out there? Oh, you got,

1425
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:45,370
you've got what's his
face up there and buy?

1426
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:47,450
Can't ever remember the fucking name.
Who plays,

1427
01:28:47,451 --> 01:28:51,740
who plays goalie up there in Buffalo?
Bill Murray. Is that what it is now?

1428
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:53,390
We call him Bill Murray.
Bill Murray.

1429
01:28:53,391 --> 01:28:57,670
And then you got fucking Roberta
Lou Longo and his cousin, uh,

1430
01:28:57,710 --> 01:29:01,220
Theo flurries third cousin who plays
out there and fucking Pittsburgh.

1431
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:04,940
I'm the worst. I can when I,
whenever I have to remember a name,

1432
01:29:04,941 --> 01:29:07,280
I can't remember her fucking name.
So whatever. I think it's good.

1433
01:29:07,281 --> 01:29:11,560
I think it's going to be a think it's
going to be great. I just don't see it.

1434
01:29:11,561 --> 01:29:14,750
I think I will be really happy if we
can actually make it to the eastern

1435
01:29:14,751 --> 01:29:15,620
conference finals.

1436
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:17,413
You know,

1437
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:23,190
that's my thing. This is,
you know what, Hey, I'm, I'm,
I'm, I'm beaten down as a fan.

1438
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:26,340
As long as we don't go up three games to
none and then lose four in a row. Again,

1439
01:29:26,341 --> 01:29:27,900
I'm going to consider
this year of victory,

1440
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:32,010
but I do not on any level want to
lose to the hated fucking habs.

1441
01:29:33,690 --> 01:29:37,500
Um, and I'm fucking with you a
bunch of cups, but not really. Okay.

1442
01:29:37,501 --> 01:29:40,080
Let's get onto advice this week.
Everybody. All right. Hey Bill,

1443
01:29:40,081 --> 01:29:42,900
I always feel like you give
great advice. Well, thank you.

1444
01:29:43,230 --> 01:29:45,720
So I thought maybe you could
give me some on this situation.

1445
01:29:45,930 --> 01:29:50,390
I was in a local shop a few weeks ago
and there was a little hottie work in

1446
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,110
there.
Um,

1447
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:55,290
I had seen her there once before and both
times she really caught my attention.

1448
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:59,190
I had the urge to ask her out while I
was there, but I was too busy be enough.

1449
01:30:01,350 --> 01:30:05,040
And I did. And I did not say anything to
her other than some idle nonsense about

1450
01:30:05,041 --> 01:30:08,640
sunglasses. I was looking
at, oh, that's the worst. Uh,

1451
01:30:08,641 --> 01:30:11,880
the little bit we did talk though,
she seemed really cool and really nice.

1452
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:12,840
My advices.

1453
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:17,100
How can slash should I ask
her out without looking like,

1454
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:19,953
mmm.

1455
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:24,050
Coming off like a creeper, a
douchebag. I'm a good looking guy,

1456
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:28,160
have a great career as an attorney. But
when it comes to ladies, I can be shy.

1457
01:30:28,161 --> 01:30:30,000
Sometimes seeing is that,
you know,

1458
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,420
that's a very strong thing
that you're able to admit that.

1459
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,980
But every guy just went,
ah,

1460
01:30:33,981 --> 01:30:37,480
I wasn't mad at you fucking fag go
up and say something to her. That's,

1461
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:41,750
that's how guys handle. We just beat it
out of each other. Okay. We said, watch,

1462
01:30:41,751 --> 01:30:42,860
I'm trying to work on,

1463
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:44,170
yeah.

1464
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:47,260
Leah says, every once in a while you
see a girl that blows you away. And uh,

1465
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:49,000
this time I wanted to
do something about it.

1466
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:52,300
Uh,
all right.

1467
01:30:53,490 --> 01:30:55,520
All right, dude. This is what you
gotta do. You gotta, you gotta get,

1468
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:59,000
you've gotta work on your
self esteem. Okay? You know,

1469
01:30:59,001 --> 01:31:02,540
you're a good looking guy and you have
a great career. Believe it or not,

1470
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:04,490
that's game set and match.

1471
01:31:05,210 --> 01:31:09,710
Do you know the amount of fucking not
even good looking guys who have a shit job

1472
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,450
and they are just scumbags,

1473
01:31:11,451 --> 01:31:14,720
but they're assholes who are out there
fucking crushing it every God damn

1474
01:31:14,721 --> 01:31:18,320
weekend cause you just had the balls
to walk up and talk to these women.

1475
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:23,160
You know, this is what you gotta do.
You actually know what you gotta do.

1476
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:26,100
He said you can be shy sometimes,
but you're saying you're working on it.

1477
01:31:26,101 --> 01:31:30,950
So there you go. Just keep working.
It looked dude, she probably light.

1478
01:31:30,951 --> 01:31:33,180
If you're a good looking guy
and your fucking attorney,

1479
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:36,540
he actually said something here.
I'm hoping to see you.

1480
01:31:36,541 --> 01:31:41,320
What Caroline's in May if I have my dick
had friends can get this shit together

1481
01:31:41,321 --> 01:31:43,480
if they can't.
Maybe with your stellar advice,

1482
01:31:43,481 --> 01:31:46,840
I can even bring this hardy to the show.
Why don't you just do that?

1483
01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:51,750
Go in there and make her laugh.
Joke around with her on anything and just,

1484
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,600
just fucking lay it on the line.
Listen, I'm really attracted to you.

1485
01:31:54,601 --> 01:31:58,380
I think you beautiful. I ever the fuck
you want to say it and just say, you know,

1486
01:31:58,690 --> 01:32:02,710
I think it's always good if you have
somewhere that you're going, just say,

1487
01:32:02,711 --> 01:32:04,810
I'm going to this comedy show I love,
you know,

1488
01:32:04,811 --> 01:32:06,070
I'm really into this standup comedian.

1489
01:32:06,071 --> 01:32:09,100
I have an extra ticket which you'd like
to go to. Women like going to stuff,

1490
01:32:10,240 --> 01:32:12,340
you know,
gives him an excuse to get dressed up.

1491
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:16,630
It gives them an excuse to not feel
fucking guilty when they're blowing you

1492
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:20,110
later cause they actually went to some
sort of ball or some shit, you know?

1493
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:24,820
Oh God. Yeah. Even with
advice them off for this week,

1494
01:32:24,821 --> 01:32:29,020
but the essence of it is there. All
right. You already talked to her.

1495
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:32,290
Just go in there again.
You're not going to come off like a creep.

1496
01:32:33,130 --> 01:32:36,940
I actually think that it's easier to
pick somebody up and get that number.

1497
01:32:36,941 --> 01:32:37,810
At least back in the day.

1498
01:32:37,811 --> 01:32:40,600
I have no game left anymore cause
I've been in a relationship too long.

1499
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:45,060
But I always found that it was easier for
me to get a girl's phone number on the

1500
01:32:45,070 --> 01:32:49,540
a at the fucking Jim.
Jim's a little bit harder,

1501
01:32:49,541 --> 01:32:52,330
but like I do it on the ice
to get it on the subway.

1502
01:32:54,060 --> 01:32:54,900
Oddly enough,

1503
01:32:54,901 --> 01:32:59,030
I had a better chance there than I
did in some meat market bar because I,

1504
01:32:59,031 --> 01:33:04,031
I was never good when females had their
guards up when they knew what play I was

1505
01:33:04,561 --> 01:33:07,730
running. Some guys can do that.
They like the old packers.

1506
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:10,080
Like everybody knew the packer
sweep was coming and they,

1507
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:14,130
Forrest Gregg still fucking ran over here.
And some guys are like that.

1508
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,900
Even when women know they got there,

1509
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:19,620
they're fucking guard up and they
know what the fuck they're doing.

1510
01:33:19,621 --> 01:33:21,300
They could still plow through it.
They run over,

1511
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:24,570
the guys just run right over those girls
like Forrest Gregg and next thing you

1512
01:33:24,571 --> 01:33:24,691
know,

1513
01:33:24,691 --> 01:33:27,150
they're laying on their backs with their
legs up in the air and they get the

1514
01:33:27,151 --> 01:33:31,590
Dick. I was never that guy.
I was, I snuck up on you.

1515
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:35,160
I waited for something stupid to
happen that I could comment on.

1516
01:33:35,161 --> 01:33:38,580
And then I get the girl laughing. And
then when her fuck her defenses were down,

1517
01:33:38,940 --> 01:33:43,530
I'd uh, I'd wrestle her cell phone up
from per fingers. No, I would have,

1518
01:33:43,670 --> 01:33:46,760
I'd somehow get her number. So what I
would do is I would just go in there and,

1519
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:50,790
uh, I'll just keep reexplaining this 20
fucking times, do get tickets to my show.

1520
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:55,230
Right. Look at me, I'll make
a little money out of this
advice. So now you've got,

1521
01:33:55,231 --> 01:33:57,960
you've got somewhere that you got
to take her, take her rod, you know,

1522
01:33:57,961 --> 01:33:59,790
a little thinner.
The skit comedy shows,

1523
01:33:59,791 --> 01:34:03,470
she's already fucking laughing
halfway through my Aqi do the old,

1524
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:06,600
you're laughing your ass off. Don't try
to put your arm around his shoulder.

1525
01:34:06,601 --> 01:34:10,880
That's old school right. You put it
right on a fucking thigh, you know,

1526
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:13,710
then you sorta start creeping up
there with your fingers, you know,

1527
01:34:13,711 --> 01:34:17,160
like just sorta thinking about something
going pinky ring, Middle Index.

1528
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:20,820
He just sort of work your way up like
an inch worm. And next thing you know,

1529
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:24,330
if you're, if you're, if your
fingers are Nimble enough, you know,

1530
01:34:24,331 --> 01:34:26,850
you stretch out your picky, it's
Kinda rubbing right on her clit there.

1531
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:28,463
Okay.

1532
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:31,980
And then you get made fun of me cause you
guys are fucking walking out during my

1533
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:35,400
closing bit to go bang at the fucking w
around the corner to it's right there.

1534
01:34:35,401 --> 01:34:39,480
It's a lay up to fucking lay up.
All right, next one. Hey Bill,

1535
01:34:39,481 --> 01:34:43,440
huge fan of the podcast and all your
stand up and have made all my friends big

1536
01:34:43,441 --> 01:34:46,520
fans of yours as well. I really enjoy the
relationship. Advice for Blah, blah, blah,

1537
01:34:46,521 --> 01:34:47,910
blah, blah. All right.

1538
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,220
People ask me is starting to address
the fact that I've never been married.

1539
01:34:52,221 --> 01:34:55,820
Why am I taking your fucking ex
advice? Right? Here's my situation.

1540
01:34:55,821 --> 01:35:00,050
I'm 29 recently from medical
school after a good number of years

1541
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:04,040
honing my boning skills
in the free market,

1542
01:35:04,041 --> 01:35:08,180
I'm ready to calm down and have a
serious girlfriend. Ironically. Um,

1543
01:35:08,181 --> 01:35:12,080
the girl that I'm dating and wanting to
get serious with was actually my college

1544
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:13,970
girlfriend and first love.

1545
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:17,780
We dated throughout college but broke
up before attending different medical

1546
01:35:17,781 --> 01:35:21,110
schools. During our years
together. I cheated a lot,

1547
01:35:21,140 --> 01:35:23,000
but to my knowledge never got caught.

1548
01:35:23,270 --> 01:35:25,190
A big part of the reason
I was so promiscuous,

1549
01:35:25,191 --> 01:35:26,960
besides being your typical piece of shit,

1550
01:35:26,961 --> 01:35:31,961
cocky asshole guy full
of tests testosterone was
because she was very sexually

1551
01:35:32,391 --> 01:35:33,224
inhibited,

1552
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:38,820
no blowjobs the routine conventional
positions sex about once every other day

1553
01:35:39,610 --> 01:35:41,750
and that just wasn't cutting it for me.
Now,

1554
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:43,750
when every other key now
in every other category,

1555
01:35:43,751 --> 01:35:48,220
she was amazing fun to hang out with,
but still lady like carrying respectable,

1556
01:35:48,221 --> 01:35:52,060
educated, fashionable and extremely
beautiful. So like I said before,

1557
01:35:52,061 --> 01:35:56,680
we broke up for about five years and
our back dating again and the sex is

1558
01:35:56,681 --> 01:35:59,500
exactly the same now,

1559
01:35:59,501 --> 01:36:02,830
while I'm grateful that some guy didn't
completely smarter out during our

1560
01:36:02,831 --> 01:36:07,630
breakup, I did explain it did expect
some sort of sexual maturation,

1561
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:13,900
um, blow jobs remain few and
far between and pretty subpar.

1562
01:36:14,170 --> 01:36:17,320
Even for a black chick. This
guy's black, by the way,

1563
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:20,070
before you think this is
something fucked up. Um,

1564
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:24,040
what makes it even more difficult this
time around is after banging my fair

1565
01:36:24,041 --> 01:36:27,310
share of broads in our off season,
uh,

1566
01:36:27,311 --> 01:36:30,250
my sexual prowess has grown significantly.

1567
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:33,490
It's hard because I really want to be
faithful this time around and take the

1568
01:36:33,491 --> 01:36:36,700
relationship more seriously, but I fear
I'm not going to be sexually satisfied.

1569
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:40,420
My grace fear is ending up like one of
my father's friends who I always hear

1570
01:36:40,421 --> 01:36:44,980
complaining about how shitty their sex
lives have become after marriage. Um,

1571
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:50,050
how I should have had all my fun now and
Blah, blah, blah, stereotypical castrated,

1572
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:54,620
Merryman background noise.
Uh, fuck that extra sad shit.

1573
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:58,340
I'm not getting married unless I know
my wife is going to be a lady in the

1574
01:36:58,341 --> 01:37:00,170
streets in a freak in the sheets.

1575
01:37:02,120 --> 01:37:05,340
How do you like that old
African American mantra? Uh,

1576
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:08,120
my question is how serious
should I take this problem?

1577
01:37:08,121 --> 01:37:11,930
Should I be patient and hope that I can
liberate her sexually or should I bail

1578
01:37:11,931 --> 01:37:14,390
and keep searching for
a god-fearing dinner?

1579
01:37:14,391 --> 01:37:18,650
Cooking super freak if
you don't mind asking. Uh

1580
01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:23,440
Oh,
if you don't mind asking Nia as well.

1581
01:37:23,441 --> 01:37:27,160
I'd like to hear what the
sister has to say. Oh Shit.

1582
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:30,460
I should have read that to her by the way.
I'm also black.

1583
01:37:30,461 --> 01:37:34,780
So when you get to, is it
racist, racist, racist? No,

1584
01:37:34,781 --> 01:37:38,650
I'm allowed to say sisters. Uh,
all right. Um, you know what?

1585
01:37:38,651 --> 01:37:40,510
I really wish I read that part
of what I had her in here,

1586
01:37:40,511 --> 01:37:44,530
but she's not around today.
Um, what should you do?

1587
01:37:46,030 --> 01:37:50,180
All right. Number one, don't cheat on
her. Uh, well you should do is you should,

1588
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:54,900
you should communicate this tour. Uh,
obviously not the way you just said it to,

1589
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:01,290
um, oh Jesus. This is, this is tough.

1590
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:05,740
I, I'd have to ask you some
questions. Let me ask you this.

1591
01:38:05,741 --> 01:38:09,990
Do you feel she has the potential?
That's,

1592
01:38:10,030 --> 01:38:13,600
that's what that would be.
My number one thing

1593
01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:18,830
is, ah, this is how I would do it.
All right. Fuck this. All right.

1594
01:38:18,831 --> 01:38:20,600
Now and now I'm back on track.
This is what I would do.

1595
01:38:20,601 --> 01:38:24,590
First thing I would do is I would,
I would see if she has the potential.

1596
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:28,130
All right. If she's a good
kisser, if she has a good touch,

1597
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:31,790
if when you're banging her, you don't
feel like you're fucking riding in a,

1598
01:38:31,791 --> 01:38:33,500
God did the back of a delivery truck.

1599
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:40,160
The rhythms there.
She has is she has the basic tools.

1600
01:38:41,820 --> 01:38:44,390
Alright. Cause some people,
they just don't, they,

1601
01:38:44,391 --> 01:38:48,170
they're not blessed with the touch
then. Not Good. Kissers you know,

1602
01:38:48,200 --> 01:38:50,640
and a lot of females, not a
lot, but you know enough are,

1603
01:38:50,641 --> 01:38:51,830
that's another thing they never bring up.

1604
01:38:51,831 --> 01:38:54,590
They always talk about how guys don't
know shit in bed and you just blah blah

1605
01:38:54,591 --> 01:38:58,670
blah blah. But there's a lot of women out
there who they don't know shit either.

1606
01:38:59,750 --> 01:39:02,060
Not saying that bad or whatever,
but in some of them just,

1607
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:07,130
I just never going to be good.
So if you feel she has the potential then,

1608
01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:08,240
then there's hope.

1609
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:13,900
So what you have to do is you have to
basically what I used to tell my friends,

1610
01:39:14,481 --> 01:39:19,100
we used to joke around, just say you got
to tap into her inner whore. All right?

1611
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:23,840
And the, there's a couple of
ways to do it. One of them.

1612
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:25,700
And it's very delicate dude.

1613
01:39:25,701 --> 01:39:28,700
It's like one of those fucking action
movies where you'd sit in there trying to

1614
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:34,220
clip the right fucking wire is, it's,
you know, eight seconds left. Um,

1615
01:39:36,110 --> 01:39:39,370
there's a couple ways you go about it.
Uh,

1616
01:39:39,371 --> 01:39:44,110
one of the ways is, well first of
all, this does a couple of rules. One,

1617
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:49,330
as she's trying to open up
with you sexually or whatever,

1618
01:39:49,570 --> 01:39:53,890
don't ever judge anything
that she wants to, to uh,

1619
01:39:53,891 --> 01:39:57,790
try and don't ever make fun
of anything that she said.

1620
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:02,260
It bet if she says some dumb shit,
which she's probably going to say,

1621
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:05,800
cause you sound like you're way more
experienced if she's trying to talk dirty

1622
01:40:05,801 --> 01:40:10,630
for the first fucking time and she
says some dumb shit, do not laugh.

1623
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:15,550
Simply turn her around and doggy
style and then you get your laugh up.

1624
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:16,713
All right,

1625
01:40:19,170 --> 01:40:20,940
you got to do the quote.
But don't ever do that.

1626
01:40:20,941 --> 01:40:25,941
That is like someone is
never more vulnerable than
in that specialty of female.

1627
01:40:26,790 --> 01:40:28,980
You can't, you can't do that.
And then what she I would,

1628
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:32,880
I would do is I would just basically
figure out what she's into,

1629
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:37,410
try to figure out what, what some
of her fantasies are. All right.

1630
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:40,980
So that that's how I would start at,
find out what some of her fantasies are.

1631
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,840
And you start getting her down that road.

1632
01:40:42,841 --> 01:40:47,160
And then as you're going down that road
and you're not judging her and you're

1633
01:40:47,161 --> 01:40:51,120
not making fun of any, you just supportive
as she goes down that fucking road.

1634
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:57,580
Um, then she'll gain confidence and
then Dan, hopefully that'll happen.

1635
01:40:57,581 --> 01:41:00,580
And one of the ways to kind of lead her
down the road is try to tell her some of

1636
01:41:00,581 --> 01:41:02,650
the shit that you're into that
you've never done with her.

1637
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,780
Then I'll go all the way down to the road.
You know,

1638
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:06,880
your five years of fucking horrific shit.

1639
01:41:06,881 --> 01:41:11,881
You did just always be a couple of paces
out in front of whatever sexual shit

1640
01:41:12,461 --> 01:41:14,020
that she admitted that she wanted to do.

1641
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:18,250
So that way her shit doesn't seem as
freaky because it's a couple of steps

1642
01:41:18,251 --> 01:41:22,840
behind you, but you don't completely
freak or the fuck out by, you know,

1643
01:41:22,870 --> 01:41:27,700
talking about some German porn shit.
All right, so that, that's what,

1644
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:30,430
uh, that's what I would do. All right.

1645
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:34,000
And that's what I have been
doing throughout the years. Nia.

1646
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:37,090
Look who just walked in.
Somebody actually asked your advice

1647
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:44,830
because he will working out.
Do you want to do this? Okay.

1648
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:47,840
All right. You know, what do I have?
I don't have my other microphone,

1649
01:41:47,841 --> 01:41:50,470
so we actually have to be over here and
let me ask you this shit real quickly.

1650
01:41:50,620 --> 01:41:53,470
I'll give you the basic overview.
All right. There was a guy, right?

1651
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:57,250
He sees this girl, they like each other.
The heisted, the college sweethearts,

1652
01:41:57,790 --> 01:42:01,750
everything about her. Um, was, was great.

1653
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:05,340
They have fun too. She's needs a little
under the weather here. All right.

1654
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:09,550
Are fucking allergies are kicking up.
Let me hear your voice. Say Hello. Hello.

1655
01:42:09,880 --> 01:42:14,830
Okay. And you worked out what? A
fucking trooper. All right. Real quick.

1656
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:19,810
So everything hanging out, they'd
laugh at each, at each other's jokes.

1657
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:23,140
The whole shit was perfect, but then
they went to different medical schools.

1658
01:42:23,550 --> 01:42:26,710
All right? So they broke up for a while.
And during the, you know, the five years,

1659
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:28,720
I guess this guy cheated a
lot when he was with her.

1660
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:33,040
And now five years have gone
by, he got his free cow. Uh,

1661
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:37,510
if you saw the look of disgust on
her face, he did all this shit.

1662
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,760
So now he's back together with her.
All right.

1663
01:42:39,761 --> 01:42:42,160
And he was kind of hoping like
it's a sex was kind of lame,

1664
01:42:42,220 --> 01:42:46,300
like when he was with her missionary
position. Very like if you like,

1665
01:42:46,301 --> 01:42:50,020
if you're gonna make like a, like a
high school video on how to have sex,

1666
01:42:50,021 --> 01:42:52,210
the mail takes out his penis.
What aroused?

1667
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:55,120
Like they were having that kind of
sex and no blow jobs whatsoever.

1668
01:42:55,840 --> 01:43:00,460
So now he's gotten back together
with there. He wants to be serious.

1669
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:01,833
He's gotten all these,

1670
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:05,560
hopefully all his bullshit out and
now he's back with their in the sex is

1671
01:43:05,561 --> 01:43:08,680
basically the same.
Now there's a couple of blow jobs.

1672
01:43:08,681 --> 01:43:13,681
So he's wondering how does he get
her to tap into her inner whore?

1673
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:20,700
Should we pursue said he
pursue this relationship?

1674
01:43:21,461 --> 01:43:25,600
Like how, okay. How does
a guy do that? Like how,

1675
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:29,650
like I said, basically how I do it. Oh,
she's already saying, give me the mic.

1676
01:43:29,651 --> 01:43:32,980
All right, go ahead.
Uh, well first of all,

1677
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:35,770
it just because you enjoy
sex in different ways.

1678
01:43:35,771 --> 01:43:38,640
Does it make you a horse so she doesn't
have to tap into our inner whore?

1679
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:42,510
Just more, uh, freedom sexually?
Has he tried to talk to you?

1680
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:45,010
You don't need to clarify it. Okay.
I'm not saying she's a horror.

1681
01:43:45,011 --> 01:43:48,250
We understand this. Okay.
I felt the need to clarify.

1682
01:43:49,330 --> 01:43:52,070
Did he try to want to put your fists
in the air for women right now?

1683
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:56,450
Okay. Uh, did he try to talk to her about
this before and she just ignored it?

1684
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:58,630
I don't think he's talked to her
about it yet. So it's, you know,

1685
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:01,540
it's the first step is that he's got
to talk to her. That's what I said.

1686
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:02,121
Look at that.

1687
01:44:02,121 --> 01:44:06,500
Why don't we switch it up a little bit
and I wonder why she didn't give him blow

1688
01:44:06,501 --> 01:44:09,860
jobs. Maybe she just doesn't like giving
blood. Maybe she doesn't know how,

1689
01:44:10,400 --> 01:44:14,240
but it can be fun to explore
together. So he should, yeah,

1690
01:44:14,241 --> 01:44:17,180
you should ask her about
it. Just say, you know,

1691
01:44:17,181 --> 01:44:20,240
what's the worst is when women say
they can't do it cause they have TMJ.

1692
01:44:21,490 --> 01:44:24,920
And it's like, what? They don't like to
do it. Some people don't like to do it,

1693
01:44:24,950 --> 01:44:28,820
you know, it's not, it's not that great
for the other person, but it's like,

1694
01:44:28,821 --> 01:44:31,310
some people don't like it.
Some guys don't like to go down and girls,

1695
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:34,880
some girls don't like to go down and
guys, it's just a preference thing. Okay.

1696
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:37,550
All right. So you basically
said what? I said,

1697
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:42,200
I thought you would've come in here with
some shorter that make you feel bad. No,

1698
01:44:42,201 --> 01:44:45,950
but I just see, I thought
I would be coming at it in
a different, more rational,

1699
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:50,050
sensitive way. But she said the same
thing, Huh? Yeah. But not as sensitively.

1700
01:44:50,360 --> 01:44:54,930
I said all the Horse Shit.
Yeah. You know. All right. Yeah,

1701
01:44:55,790 --> 01:44:58,290
that's, I don't know what I
thought it was going to continue.

1702
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:00,330
I don't mean it like that.
I just said in a mean way.

1703
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:04,280
Can we come over here and get a hug? Get
a hug. I'm coming towards the end of the,

1704
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:07,680
uh, the podcast. All right. All right.
There you go. Now get outta here.

1705
01:45:07,800 --> 01:45:11,430
Cause you've been, you've been, you've
been more than helpful. All right.

1706
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:14,250
She just gave me the finger.
Now you know what it is,

1707
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:18,570
and yet whenever you're on the podcast
and then the podcast segment ends.

1708
01:45:18,571 --> 01:45:21,630
I don't know how to smoothly transition
you out of here because we don't go to

1709
01:45:21,631 --> 01:45:26,400
commercial. Why don't I just go ladies
and gentlemen, Nia, Nia, everybody.

1710
01:45:28,050 --> 01:45:32,640
Thank you so much, Nia. See you
next time. See you next time.

1711
01:45:32,641 --> 01:45:36,570
You were great. And now what
the fuck just happened to Mike?

1712
01:45:37,770 --> 01:45:38,820
I hate computers.

1713
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:42,480
It just signed me off and I was
on a nice little fucking roll here

1714
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:46,920
and now I can't. I can't get
back into my, my, my fucking,

1715
01:45:48,310 --> 01:45:48,440
okay.

1716
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:50,790
How is this easier? People
I want, I want people to,

1717
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:56,030
now I have to go into my fucking, my
stupid apple works. All right. Here I am.

1718
01:45:56,630 --> 01:45:58,040
Fucking all right.

1719
01:45:58,520 --> 01:46:01,040
I'm going to read one more of these and
that's going to be the podcast for this

1720
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,910
week. All right. Uh, hey bill,
I need an outside perspective.

1721
01:46:05,240 --> 01:46:09,320
My wife left me a year and a half ago
to go blow college guys and spend her

1722
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:14,250
newly raised salary on clothes and purses.
Not Kidding.

1723
01:46:14,251 --> 01:46:17,160
That's what she did.
After nine years and two kids,

1724
01:46:17,161 --> 01:46:21,300
I found out that she had two short
affairs after each kid was born,

1725
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:26,840
then left me with our five month old
baby and two year old I had been raising

1726
01:46:28,111 --> 01:46:31,450
without her. Anyways, Jesus, Oh gee,

1727
01:46:32,610 --> 01:46:37,290
I'm a year later, she finally
started trying to share custody.

1728
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:41,100
She didn't have her hit her
half of daycare. I'm sorry.

1729
01:46:41,101 --> 01:46:43,650
People every once in a while I
go back to my bed reading habits.

1730
01:46:43,650 --> 01:46:47,700
Let me just take a breath here and step
back, focus. All right. A year later,

1731
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:51,240
she finally started trying to
custody. Okay. So after she's gone up,

1732
01:46:51,241 --> 01:46:55,070
she left him with two kids to
go blow college guys and uh,

1733
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:58,950
spend all her money.
She just got on our newly higher salary.

1734
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:02,730
I'm a year later, she finally
started trying to share custody.

1735
01:47:03,630 --> 01:47:07,860
She didn't have her half of
daycare, um, bill for a few months,

1736
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:11,730
even though she doubles my income.
So I told her she could pay me back.

1737
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:16,440
Now the conch gets or tax return, it tells
me to fuck off. She's not repaying me.

1738
01:47:16,590 --> 01:47:21,000
She's going to get a car to replace
the one she totaled in a Dui.

1739
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:23,190
Jesus,
where did you meet this winter?

1740
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:27,510
I'm pissed off and can't blast
or in the job. So what do I do?

1741
01:47:27,960 --> 01:47:32,280
I'm thinking of hiring a crackhead to
spray paint deadbeat on her fucking car

1742
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:34,470
from one asshole to another.
Thanks bill.

1743
01:47:34,471 --> 01:47:38,190
The podcast and all three cds of helped
me through a lot of tough shit by

1744
01:47:38,191 --> 01:47:40,950
laughing off the retarded
shit that this court does.

1745
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:43,503
MMM.

1746
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:48,620
All right dude. Uh, yeah. You, you
picked a winner here. This is like,

1747
01:47:48,621 --> 01:47:53,420
this is one of these ones that
you should ask Dr drew about. Um,

1748
01:47:54,490 --> 01:47:57,290
who's amazing and he would hit his half
court shot and tell you exactly what's

1749
01:47:57,291 --> 01:47:58,124
going on.
This,

1750
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:02,060
there's something going on with her
where she has affairs right after she has

1751
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:06,260
kids. I don't know what that is, but
that's triggering something inside of our,

1752
01:48:07,790 --> 01:48:08,620
um,

1753
01:48:08,620 --> 01:48:13,270
I dunno if she gets freaked out with the
level of responsibility and she wants

1754
01:48:13,271 --> 01:48:16,630
to, I dunno. Do a bunch get, get, go.

1755
01:48:16,631 --> 01:48:21,580
So her oats in a female fucking
way. Phil Might, I dunno. You know,

1756
01:48:21,581 --> 01:48:24,760
some, sometimes women have babies and
then they had that postpartum depression.

1757
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:29,980
She has some sort of
postpartum like you know,

1758
01:48:30,130 --> 01:48:35,130
hedonism that she just goes out and she
just turns into the fuck fest 2011 so

1759
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:39,720
what you have there,
do you have damaged goods?

1760
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:43,110
There's no way you can ever fucking
trust her again. You got two kids. So,

1761
01:48:45,470 --> 01:48:48,080
um, don't do anything to her. All right.

1762
01:48:49,010 --> 01:48:53,030
This is like in sports when when
somebody comes up and slashes, Yah,

1763
01:48:54,490 --> 01:48:56,800
the ref never sees it,
but when you retaliate,

1764
01:48:56,801 --> 01:48:59,110
you always end up getting the
fucking five minute major.

1765
01:48:59,380 --> 01:49:01,720
This is what's going to happen.
She's going to do all this dumb shit.

1766
01:49:01,721 --> 01:49:04,420
You're going to hire people to do stuff
or I know you're not going to literally

1767
01:49:04,421 --> 01:49:04,721
do that,

1768
01:49:04,721 --> 01:49:09,550
but you can try to exact some sort of
revenge and I dunno if the decent person

1769
01:49:09,551 --> 01:49:11,940
always seems to get caught.
So I would avoid doing that.

1770
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:13,510
Yeah.

1771
01:49:13,510 --> 01:49:18,430
This is how you get your revenge is I,

1772
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:21,850
I would just focus on being a great
dad for those two kids. In all honesty.

1773
01:49:21,910 --> 01:49:23,050
I know that's a ton of work.

1774
01:49:23,051 --> 01:49:28,051
And it's easy for me to say when I
don't have any kids and I never ever bad

1775
01:49:28,481 --> 01:49:33,410
mouth their mother to them.
Never do that. You know,

1776
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:37,810
have a buddy of yours where you can just
vent and just talk about what a crunchy

1777
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:41,900
is as you're punching the bar,
but never do it in front of your kids.

1778
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:43,130
Cause that's still their mother.

1779
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:49,210
Eventually they'll figure out what an
irresponsible horse she is and there's

1780
01:49:50,110 --> 01:49:50,501
going to be,

1781
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:55,501
that's going to be your great
payback is in that moment.

1782
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:59,470
Not only are they going to realize what
an irresponsible whore their mother is,

1783
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:03,440
is they're going to realize what
a great dad they have and a,

1784
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:07,150
which is obviously going to be priceless.
Um,

1785
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:12,460
and in the meantime I would
ask myself is if this, this,

1786
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:15,020
this lady,
if this is the kind of person,

1787
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:19,840
have you met a girl like this a number
of times is it's just bad luck or do like

1788
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:22,750
every woman, every woman that
you've dated is like this.

1789
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:24,490
Because if that is the case,

1790
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:27,430
there's something about these kinds
of women that you're attracted to.

1791
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:31,450
And as I've use that analogy, you keep
fishing in the same poisoned pond.

1792
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:33,580
Uh,

1793
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:36,610
I think because you got two kids that
you want to go out and go meet a winner,

1794
01:50:36,611 --> 01:50:41,200
I go out to that debt shit where you're
going to meet a decent girl, go out,

1795
01:50:41,201 --> 01:50:42,550
go take a cooking class.

1796
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:47,380
I just gave are near for birthday a
fucking almost a goddamn year ago.

1797
01:50:47,381 --> 01:50:48,400
She finally got around to it,

1798
01:50:48,401 --> 01:50:51,730
a couple of gourmet cooking classes and
she went there and it's kind of like a

1799
01:50:51,731 --> 01:50:55,210
little scene, you know, people
bring wine in your cooking,

1800
01:50:55,211 --> 01:50:57,550
there's all that fucking people,
a taste and shit.

1801
01:50:57,580 --> 01:51:02,380
All the senses of go in that pussy
getting wet in the room. You go in there,

1802
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:05,740
you fucking knock a couple out or
whatever. Join a softball league.

1803
01:51:05,741 --> 01:51:10,300
I don't know what all those, a lot
of boozing was softball, you know,

1804
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:12,430
probably going to get
some bloated whore there.

1805
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:13,630
You might want to stay away from that.

1806
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:16,900
Maybe that's where you go to vent about
what a fucking whore you're wife is.

1807
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:20,490
But Dude, you know what? You're a great
fucking guy. You're doing the right thing.

1808
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:23,830
Is sticking with your kids and your even
supporting her even though she's making

1809
01:51:23,831 --> 01:51:26,710
more fucking money.
She's a loser. All right.

1810
01:51:26,711 --> 01:51:31,210
She's a fucking loser and she's out of
your life and your kids will be 18 one

1811
01:51:31,211 --> 01:51:35,470
day and then this bitch will be out of
your life. So who gives a fuck? All right.

1812
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:39,130
In the meantime, yeah,
focus on being a good dad.

1813
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:42,390
Get yourself in great shape.
I don't know.

1814
01:51:42,400 --> 01:51:46,090
Find some fucking way to do something
social. Go meet a great woman.

1815
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:49,420
I can see there's plenty of great
women out there. It's just like guys,

1816
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:55,300
they're out there. Go find one
and just ask them during the day.

1817
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:59,970
Just be like, by the way, are you a, are
you an irresponsible whore? Because I,

1818
01:51:59,971 --> 01:52:03,160
I really just got out of a relationship
with an irresponsible whore and I'm not

1819
01:52:03,161 --> 01:52:06,070
trying to trying to do that
and talk about cheating.

1820
01:52:06,130 --> 01:52:09,430
Ask if they've ever cheated on somebody.
Here's another great question to ask.

1821
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:12,190
Ask if their parents are still together.
That's a great one to ask.

1822
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:14,800
The parents are still together.
If they get along with their parents,

1823
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:18,740
they come from a strong background.
That's a good one to ask. Um,

1824
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:21,160
that's a good place to
start off and that's it.

1825
01:52:21,161 --> 01:52:24,640
I'm done trying to be doctor
bill here for the week. Um,

1826
01:52:25,810 --> 01:52:28,680
our and six minute podcast, once
again, I'm going to be down at the the

1827
01:52:28,680 --> 01:52:31,140
Catalina jazz club.
Um,

1828
01:52:31,410 --> 01:52:34,830
doing a benefit for all those
people out there in Japan,

1829
01:52:35,730 --> 01:52:40,350
fellow human beings who also live
on a fault line just like I do. Um,

1830
01:52:40,351 --> 01:52:42,510
so, uh, hopefully somebody out there,

1831
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:45,650
we'll do a fucking comedy show
for when La falls into the ocean,

1832
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:49,550
so I'm paying it forward.
All right, so come on down.

1833
01:52:49,551 --> 01:52:51,800
All the proceeds will go out
to help the victims of that.

1834
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:56,870
This Catalina Jazz club down on Sunset
Boulevard, um, I just tweeted about it,

1835
01:52:57,760 --> 01:53:02,190
uh, at Bill bird.com. I think that's
it. Uh, we got all the youtube videos.

1836
01:53:02,240 --> 01:53:04,220
They didn't get a chance to describe
the youtube videos this week,

1837
01:53:04,221 --> 01:53:07,280
but they're fucking hilarious.
Um,

1838
01:53:07,730 --> 01:53:12,110
some guy has a potato gun that he shoots
a bunch of pubes onto a passed out guy.

1839
01:53:12,170 --> 01:53:16,340
That's one of them and it just goes
from there. It just goes from there.

1840
01:53:16,341 --> 01:53:18,500
So I'll go to the man
podcast to watch all that.

1841
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:22,980
If you want to see the pictures of the
tower theater and me working with uh,

1842
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:27,200
Joe to Rosa, the teen idols sensation
from the opiate Anthony Program.

1843
01:53:27,201 --> 01:53:30,200
I have all of those and I have a picture
of that fucking chicken wings sitting

1844
01:53:30,201 --> 01:53:33,940
on my window sill just in case you
think I was making it up. Mafucka ah,

1845
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:35,200
that's it.
Everybody have a great week.

1846
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:38,990
I'll fuck yourselves and I'll talk to
you next week. Oh wait, I don't hang up.

1847
01:53:38,991 --> 01:53:40,580
Don't hang up.
I almost forgot.

1848
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,600
I almost forgot I told you that
I was going to bring in the, uh,

1849
01:53:45,050 --> 01:53:49,610
the outtake from my failed
attempt at the podcast last week.

1850
01:53:49,790 --> 01:53:51,010
This is like a special track.

1851
01:53:51,020 --> 01:53:55,940
Remember that back in the day when you'd
buy like a CD and they'd say they'd be

1852
01:53:55,941 --> 01:53:57,020
like 15 songs,

1853
01:53:57,021 --> 01:54:01,040
but it would say 16 tracks and they would
just let the tape run and run and run

1854
01:54:01,041 --> 01:54:04,550
and run. And then you'd, you'd find
the A, that little gym at the end.

1855
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:09,170
I think this is, this is the podcast
version cause I already signed off. Um,

1856
01:54:09,190 --> 01:54:10,490
all right,
just to set this up,

1857
01:54:10,491 --> 01:54:15,491
this was me last night after getting
like four hours sleep flying across this

1858
01:54:15,621 --> 01:54:18,200
country and then watching the math is,

1859
01:54:18,470 --> 01:54:23,150
and I'm trying to tell that Sheridan
story. And up until this point,

1860
01:54:23,510 --> 01:54:25,220
it just had not been funny.

1861
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:28,760
And I think I'm at the part of
the story where the guy, uh,

1862
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:32,780
was bringing the new table to,
to replace the broken table in.

1863
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:37,700
And a, I was trying to explain it in a
funny way. It wasn't funny and I just,

1864
01:54:38,150 --> 01:54:42,950
I just fucking tapped out. Uh, and
this is the clip. Hope you enjoy it.

1865
01:54:42,951 --> 01:54:43,850
I'll talk to you next week.

1866
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:48,340
I was like, Jesus Christ.
Then I heard an argument

1867
01:54:49,980 --> 01:54:52,920
between a man and a woman.
As I was walking back downstairs,

1868
01:54:53,130 --> 01:54:55,500
and later on that night when
I came back from my Gig,

1869
01:54:55,890 --> 01:55:00,720
there was a fucking half eaten chicken
wing sitting on the window sill on my

1870
01:55:00,721 --> 01:55:02,130
room.
I got a picture of it,

1871
01:55:04,450 --> 01:55:05,283
you know,

1872
01:55:06,790 --> 01:55:09,280
I actually, you know something, when
I knew she, I knew something was up.

1873
01:55:09,281 --> 01:55:13,750
When I went to check into my room,
uh,

1874
01:55:13,751 --> 01:55:17,350
there was a knock at my door five
seconds later, and the guy goes, oh, hey,

1875
01:55:17,710 --> 01:55:20,260
and he's got this big table. I'm
like, dude, you got the wrong room.

1876
01:55:20,261 --> 01:55:23,260
I didn't order a table. He
said, no, no, no. He said this,

1877
01:55:23,261 --> 01:55:27,430
this table belongs in your room. He
goes, somebody broke it here last night.

1878
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:31,030
And I was like, Jesus, what
was their party here? Or
something? He was like, yeah.

1879
01:55:32,140 --> 01:55:32,591
I go,
well,

1880
01:55:32,591 --> 01:55:37,460
did you fumigate the place or is it
just all Jizan coke residue in here?

1881
01:55:37,560 --> 01:55:40,450
And he just left,
shook his head and left.

1882
01:55:41,110 --> 01:55:44,370
And that's when my ass
knew was in a ghetto

1883
01:55:44,890 --> 01:55:47,130
as brothers shared and baby

1884
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:49,793
[inaudible]

1885
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:03,940
[inaudible].
