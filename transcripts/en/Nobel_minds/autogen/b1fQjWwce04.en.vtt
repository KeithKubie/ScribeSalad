Austria and I have a question for you do
you<00:00:05.339><c> think</c><00:00:05.700><c> that</c><00:00:06.000><c> on</c><00:00:06.629><c> the</c><00:00:06.839><c> LHC</c><00:00:07.620><c> start</c><00:00:08.280><c> there</c><00:00:08.970><c> is</c>

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 align:start position:0%
you think that on the LHC start there is

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
black pole hi Oliver so you'd like to
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.620 align:start position:0%
black pole hi Oliver so you'd like to
know<00:00:17.250><c> if</c><00:00:17.430><c> there</c><00:00:17.640><c> is</c><00:00:17.670><c> a</c><00:00:17.820><c> possibility</c><00:00:18.270><c> of</c><00:00:18.539><c> a</c>

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 align:start position:0%
know if there is a possibility of a
 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
know if there is a possibility of a
black<00:00:18.840><c> hole</c><00:00:18.869><c> being</c><00:00:19.320><c> created</c><00:00:19.800><c> from</c><00:00:19.830><c> the</c><00:00:20.010><c> Large</c>

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 align:start position:0%
Hadron Collider the LHC so far we think
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.150 align:start position:0%
Hadron Collider the LHC so far we think
not<00:00:23.760><c> the</c><00:00:24.720><c> reason</c><00:00:24.869><c> we</c><00:00:25.140><c> think</c><00:00:25.350><c> not</c><00:00:25.529><c> is</c><00:00:25.890><c> that</c>

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
not the reason we think not is that
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
not the reason we think not is that
nature<00:00:26.550><c> has</c><00:00:26.699><c> already</c><00:00:26.880><c> done</c><00:00:27.210><c> this</c><00:00:27.420><c> experiment</c>

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 align:start position:0%
nature has already done this experiment
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.620 align:start position:0%
nature has already done this experiment
there<00:00:28.800><c> are</c><00:00:29.039><c> natural</c><00:00:29.340><c> accelerators</c><00:00:30.179><c> out</c><00:00:30.359><c> there</c>

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 align:start position:0%
there are natural accelerators out there
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.510 align:start position:0%
there are natural accelerators out there
in<00:00:30.810><c> space</c><00:00:30.960><c> that</c><00:00:31.109><c> are</c><00:00:31.470><c> far</c><00:00:31.710><c> more</c><00:00:31.740><c> powerful</c><00:00:32.130><c> than</c>

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
in space that are far more powerful than
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.250 align:start position:0%
in space that are far more powerful than
anything<00:00:32.790><c> we</c><00:00:33.059><c> can</c><00:00:33.180><c> build</c><00:00:33.360><c> here</c><00:00:33.630><c> on</c><00:00:33.750><c> earth</c><00:00:33.870><c> or</c>

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
anything we can build here on earth or
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
anything we can build here on earth or
even<00:00:34.500><c> imagine</c><00:00:34.920><c> every</c><00:00:35.160><c> building</c><00:00:35.460><c> here</c><00:00:35.700><c> on</c>

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 align:start position:0%
even imagine every building here on
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 align:start position:0%
even imagine every building here on
earth<00:00:36.030><c> and</c><00:00:36.300><c> so</c><00:00:37.260><c> the</c><00:00:37.649><c> experiment</c><00:00:38.309><c> has</c><00:00:38.399><c> been</c>

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 align:start position:0%
earth and so the experiment has been
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.819 align:start position:0%
earth and so the experiment has been
done<00:00:38.820><c> already</c><00:00:38.969><c> by</c><00:00:39.329><c> nature</c><00:00:39.690><c> and</c><00:00:39.899><c> so</c><00:00:40.440><c> if</c><00:00:40.620><c> there</c>

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 align:start position:0%
done already by nature and so if there
 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.470 align:start position:0%
done already by nature and so if there
are<00:00:40.980><c> black</c><00:00:41.250><c> holes</c><00:00:41.280><c> being</c><00:00:41.730><c> made</c><00:00:42.000><c> and</c><00:00:42.270><c> they're</c>

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
are black holes being made and they're
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.260 align:start position:0%
are black holes being made and they're

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 align:start position:0%
small and they don't bother anyone but
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.910 align:start position:0%
small and they don't bother anyone but
more<00:00:45.450><c> likely</c><00:00:45.690><c> there</c><00:00:46.140><c> are</c><00:00:46.170><c> no</c><00:00:46.440><c> such</c><00:00:46.680><c> black</c>

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
more likely there are no such black
