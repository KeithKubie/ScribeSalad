And finally, great news.

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:06.606
ESPN ass hat Skip Bayless
is no longer with us.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:09.442
Ugh, he was the best
at being

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:11.811
on the wrong side
of every issue.

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:15.648 line:8%
- One day, I am predicting,
Johnny Manziel

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.719 line:8%
will become even bigger
in the city of Cleveland

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.587 line:8%
than his buddy
and business partner

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.589 line:7%
LeBron James ever was.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.960 line:7%
Give me Josh Freeman,

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:29.996 line:8%
who was the 17th pick
in the first round,

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.064 line:7%
over Cam Newton.

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:34.434 line:0%
Why shouldn't I,
as a white person,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:39.105 line:0%
be able to take some pride
in Blake Griffin's rise?

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:42.241 line:0%
Because he did come
from a white mom.

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:45.011 align:end position:100% line:0%
It is a huge mistake
on the part of Peyton Manning.

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:48.615 align:end position:100% line:0%
He chose the worst
situation to win now.

Tim Tebow is
virtually unstoppable

00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.820 line:8%
and maybe even
a starting quarterback

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.254 line:7%
for Bill Belichick.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.525
- All right,
he's not really dead dead;

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.360
he's just moving
to Fox Sports.

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:02.862
So to honor his memory,

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:05.932
I thought we should read some
of his most egregious tweets,

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.733
which have since been deleted.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.803
These are the lost tweets
of Skip Bayless.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:14.307
Here's the first tweet
he ever sent out in 1989

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.375
when Twitter
was still in beta phase:

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:18.177
"Michael Jordan is a ball hog.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.513
"He will never win
an NBA Championship

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:21.914
with his style of play."

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:23.183
<i> 2006:</i>

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.888
"Bin Laden is dead.

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.692
That's a wrap
on #IslamicExtremism!"

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:37.864
Well, okay.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.999
Well, when did he send
that tweet out?

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.432
Yesterday, all right.
