MALE SPEAKER 1: Good morning,
Welcome to Google I/O 2015.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.610
As always we live-stream
IO to over 460 locations

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.570
across six continents.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.630
When we say, be
together, not the same,

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.730
that is precisely what we mean.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.375
We want to provide
Android for users the way

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:37.010
they like it so that
it works for them.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.460

There are hundreds

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.793

experience peppered

making it easier

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.550

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.480
and earn with Google.

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:53.890

giving you the biggest

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.740
update to the
material guidelines

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.570
since we launched them.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.240
MALE SPEAKER 1: Android
is not only for mobile,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.134

working on a new capability

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.330

wherever you are on the phone.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.520
We're calling it Now on tap.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.590
MALE SPEAKER 5:
Google Photos-- a home

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.240
for all your photos and videos,
so that you can share and save

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.950
what matters.

00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:33.180
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: We're
launching a new family

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.100
discovery experience that makes
it much easier for parents

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.687
to find high-quality
family friendly content.

00:01:38.687 --> 00:01:40.270
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Behind me you're going

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.875

efforts in VR.

00:01:57.732 --> 00:02:00.470
FEMALE SPEAKER 4: Together
we have the ability

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.570
to solve hard problems, problems
you can't solve by yourself.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.280
MALE SPEAKER 7: Getting out
and getting into contact

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.660
with the real world is
the most valuable thing

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.375
you can do for your project.

00:02:15.375 --> 00:02:18.010
MALE SPEAKER 1: This is why
I/O is so exciting for us.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.460
We get to share what we have
been up to in the last year.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.750
And all you developers get to
go out and build amazing things

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.500
on top of what we do.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.200
