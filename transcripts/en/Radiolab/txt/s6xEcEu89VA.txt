Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W. N y. S. E. N. N. P. E. R. So if we said where we are, I'm untape yet, uh, starting us off today are our producers, Lynn Levy and Sean Cole, very pretty day to be on an abandoned island were victims of contagious disease recording team. And one in particular who, uh, lived here, died here, never believing that she was in fact sick and dangerous.

Speaker 2:          00:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:39          so this is the story that she begins with it. Well it's actually, it starts in 1906 and it doesn't start on the island. It starts in Oyster Bay who, nice neighbor, very nice. There was this one rich family on vacation there and their daughter gets sick. She gets sick first. This is Judy Levitt. I am a professor Emerita at the University of Wisconsin and she wrote a book about this story. So basically the girl, the daughter has a fever than her sister comes down with it. And then her mom and Umaid about six out of 11 in the family get sick. And with this disease, the fever is just the first part of it. Both diarrhea or constipation are reported. So it can go either way. I guess. What is it? Typhoid and they couldn't figure out what had caused the disease. So they called in the sanitary engineer named [inaudible] George Soper with the public health department.

Speaker 1:          01:32          He was the go to guy for outbreaks like this back then the department of public health was thinking, you know when you get sick because of something dirty near you in in the well or in the pipes. Yeah. So he looks into all of that, did a whole test on the house and the water and everything. Couldn't find anything. And so he starts talking to the family and he started quizzing them all and they remember eventually in summer he builds up this whole picture of, of several outbreaks going back year 1900 Mamaroneck a New York family had a house for the sun. 1902 dark harbor, 1904 seven cases, sands point, New York, Autumn 1906 or 1907 New York City. All these cases. And they all had one thing in common. What each of these families had employed. Same Cook, which is funny because when you cook food, you kill the bacteria in the food. Yeah. So couldn't be the cook then. But this cook, her most famous dish was peach, Melba, which is ice cream and fresh peaches, fresh peaches, raw fruit as a perfect medium. And the Cook's name

Speaker 3:          02:47          was Mary Mallon, Mary Mary, Matt.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Wait a second. Shannon Cole, typhoid, typhoid Mary. So we're talking about, oh, so we know this store. No, you don't know this story. What do you mean? Everybody thinks they know this story? I, I knew the story and then when I looked into it I realized I didn't know the first thing about it. And when you look into the details, they tell us some very difficult things about who we were and who we still are. In a lot of ways. It's all in the details. All of the juice and probably, yeah, like in like the, it's like the PG juice. Yeah, just like the peach juice still dealing with it. I'm Robert Krulwich. Go ahead. Go ahead. Right. Yeah. Boom. Rod, this is Radiolab and in this hour, a series of stories that all hew to that delicious story archetype we call patient zero. The first clock we'll try to trace ideas and trends and massive social traumas like pandemics back to that one person or one critter or the other week close called the, but for if you didn't have this thing, but for this thing you wouldn't have the rest of this.

Speaker 1:          03:52          I like the button but, but meanwhile, back to the peaches. So you George Soper is like, I've got to find this woman. And when he finds her, she's in New York City working for another family. The laundry's had recently been taken to the Presbyterian hospital with typhoid fever. This is from an article super road called the curious case of typhoid Mary and the only child of the family, a lovely daughter, was dying of it. So he goes to the house, walks into the kitchen, sees this woman, five foot six blonde hair, blue eyes, had a good figure and might've been called athletic had she not been a little too heavy. Irish immigrant, 36 years old, not particularly clean. And he says, Mary Mallon, I think you are causing disease in people and I want, uh, samples of your urine, feces and blood. Good afternoon. And she says, what are you accusing me of being sick, playing the role of Mary is Columbia Public Health Professor David Rosner. Oh dear you, I'm not a sick person. What does she do? She traces them out of the building with that fork in her hand. A serving fork. A surfing for it. Yeah. I felt rather lucky to escape.

Speaker 1:          05:09          Did she have typhoid? Um, I mean, did she outwardly have typhoid? Well, that's the thing. She never had any symptoms. She felt perfectly healthy. She was actually the first documented case in North America of a healthy carrier, which is to say someone who has the disease and is contagious but never actually feels the symptoms, the symptoms. So in one weird way, sobers thrilled, like he's only read about this and then here she is in front of him. But think of how all of this must've sounded. The Mary, I mean, some guy from outer space comes into your kitchen and says, you're diseased and you're hurting people. When you, she must've thought what? I feel fine. I'm living a moral life. I'm not a vagrant. I'm employed. I'm a good solid citizen. You know, you would be crazy to what you're, even today, you'd probably grab your knife.

Speaker 1:          06:01          Yeah, you grabbed your knife. Well, does he have any evidence of that? She is spreading the disease. Not yet. That's why he needs her poop. So he goes back and finds her at a rooming house. She kicks him out, swears at him. She apparently had quite a temper. And then the health department, uh, sends in this female doctor by the name of s Josephine Baker. Maybe she could ask for blood feces in urine. A little more gentle. Please don't know how you asked for that gently. But she tries and when it doesn't work, she comes back a little bit later with cops and they come to the house and Mary Mallon, when she realized is what's happening, disappears. May mean disappears, completely vanishes. They end up searching the entire place and they can't find her. Finally, I think they're about to leave. When one of them spots her skirt coming outside of a door.

Speaker 1:          06:58          It's a little piece of Calico high. It kind of stuck in a doorway. It opened the door and there she is and so they drag her out and she comes out kicking and screaming and screaming and kicking. It takes all of them to drag her out protesting. They get her in the ambulance at Josephine Bakers sits on her as according to her, sits on her. And Baker later said something like, it was like being in a cage with an angry lion. So they take her down to the hospital. They tested her pcs in urine and they found that yes, she was in fact a carrier of live typhoid Bacilli

Speaker 2:          07:41          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          07:43          So we're weird island man. I spent a while on him. So they isolate her and they ultimately move her. Okay, look for Manhattan too. North brother island. Let's have a bit of a haunted bag. Yeah, and there she is. Thanks man. We went there to just to try to get our heads around what she must have thought. Let me think. What was the Allan Light and everything is completely overgrown. It was really creepy. Creepy because it was in such dissolution. Yeah. Yeah. Be careful where you step on one end. There are all of these medical, former medical buildings, including a giant hospital where they isolated tuberculosis patients. So big brick, stately building. And then on the other side of the island, there's smaller wooden buildings that are crushed. Maybe where her cottages were, her cottage would be if it was still standing, but it's not standing anymore. Well, it was one room, one room. Uh, I had a kitchen. It had a, I guess, asleep sleeping area and a sitting area. It probably so bad if you didn't have to stay there. You know, any places that you're not free to leave of becomes like a prison.

Speaker 1:          09:06          So we're marching around and then Lynn says to me, hey, look at the view and holy Moly, it's right there. That's when it really hit me. If this is where her cabin was, then one window of it looked exactly on to Manhattan. She could've seen where she used to live. You can see the traffic on the streets. This was like the most horrible seaside vacation almost the whole time they had her incarcerated, they took feces three times a week, which is, you know, it's not pleasant to have to do that. Um, and sometimes she was negative and sometimes she was positive. Wait, what? So that's, that's another thing that they were figuring out at the time. So she was probably an intermittent carrier. What does that mean? The disease is always in her, but sometimes she excretes it and sometimes she doesn't. Oh, that must've been confusing for her.

Speaker 1:          10:08          When I first came here, I was so nervous, an almost prostrated with grief and trouble. My eyes began to twitch. This is from a letter that Mary wrote from the island. I have in fact been a peep show for everybody. But if you keep reading it, and in fact it's addressed to a lawyer, it's clear that she was fighting this and she had been sending her own feces, samples herself to a private lab in Manhattan. And each one of those was negative. Really. The tuberculosis men would say there she is the kidnapped woman. Yeah. That is poison ivy. She sees the city and loses still. There are all these questions as to whether any of this is legal. I mean, even George Soper, the guy who hunted her down said it was contrary to the constitution of the United States to hold her under the circumstance. And how long was she on the silent?

Speaker 1:          10:59          For? Three years. Wow. And then what changed was a new health commissioner took over. And so he says it's just not right that we keep a healthy woman locked up like this. She was not dangerous to anybody. If she didn't cook, he lets her go. He lets you go back to Manhattan. But he makes her promise. She did promise. She signed an affidavit saying she'll never cook again. And she was released. They gave, they've set her up with a job as a laundress and they rent, here you go Mary. And then, uh, you know, they kept track of her for awhile. Uh, and then at a certain point they kind of stopped keeping track over. So how many years will go by? Five. Five. What happens next? A, there's an outbreak of typhoid where we're at a maternity hospital. Oh, you're Josephine Baker, who sat on her in the ambulance before. She says that she goes and pays a visit and walks into the kitchen and she says the first person that she encountered was typhoid Mary Mallon

Speaker 2:          12:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          12:08          George Soper did some leg work on where Mary had been and it turned out she had worked at a restaurant, two hotels and in and a sanatorium as well as the hospital. And at least according to his account, two of the people that she made sick during those couple of years were children.

Speaker 1:          12:29          She was now a woman who could not claim innocence. She was known willfully and deliberately to have taken desperate chances with human life. She had abused her privilege, she had broken her parole. So then they put her back on north brother island back in her bungalow. Um, and there she sit. She was a dangerous character and must be treated accordingly. Absolutely broke her problem. I totally agree. She made a deal and she didn't keep the deal. But the thing is, is that at the time she was sent back to the island, there were hundreds of other healthy carriers identified all over New York, and some of them were cooks. What most really? Mostly men, by the way. And they were cooking while they were barred from cooking, but not all of them always listened. Huh. And yet, Mary was the only one who they isolated in this way.

Speaker 1:          13:18          Why? Why only her? I think it was more about making people feel safe than actually making them say, oh, look out for the stare. Saul crumbled. She was what we needed at the time were in the hospital where the tuberculosis patients were quarantined. This was towards the end of linen. My visit to the island. Yeah. These must be the words. Yeah. So when was she here? This is where they brought her after she had a stroke. And this is where she was for the last six years of her life. Did she die in here? Yeah.
