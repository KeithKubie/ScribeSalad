00:00:00.252 --> 00:00:01.782
Now, if you're like me,

00:00:01.782 --> 00:00:04.688
you don't like being bothered when
you're clearly doing something.

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:05.897
Hey Anna..

00:00:05.897 --> 00:00:08.508
Do you..do you think you can take
me to the hospital now?

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.068
Dude, I just started a new game..

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:14.070
So, I was in Hollywood at a
coffee shop the other day.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.584
And I had like, half an hour to kill,

00:00:15.584 --> 00:00:16.916
so I was reading.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:17.809
And personally,

00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:19.599
when I see that someone is reading,

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:20.809
listening to music,

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:22.598
or in an argument with someone,

00:00:22.598 --> 00:00:24.038
I get the hint that it's probably

00:00:24.038 --> 00:00:25.976
not a good time to bother them.

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:27.129
But apparently,

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:29.416
some people don't.

00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:29.916
Hi.

00:00:31.008 --> 00:00:31.586
Hi..

00:00:32.568 --> 00:00:33.317
I'm Jake.

00:00:34.373 --> 00:00:35.870
Hi...

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.777
Jake...

00:00:36.777 --> 00:00:38.116
What are you doing?

00:00:38.116 --> 00:00:40.656
Can't you see that
I am reading?

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:42.655
I mean, I don't want to be
a bitch or anything,

00:00:42.655 --> 00:00:43.947
but this ain't the club!

00:00:43.947 --> 00:00:45.813
I ain't here to socialize!

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:47.283
Can't you read my body language

00:00:47.283 --> 00:00:48.283
which is clearly stating that

00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:50.616
I don't want to talk to you?

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:53.629
And of course, I can't just be honest and direct and say,

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.342
"I can see that you want to talk,
and you seem like you're a really nice person,

00:00:58.342 --> 00:01:03.946
but I'm kind of engrossed in this book,
and I'd like to finish some of it before I have to leave."

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:04.977
No, of course I can't do that,

00:01:04.977 --> 00:01:06.130
because I'm a fucking coward,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.752
and then there'd be no video.

00:01:07.752 --> 00:01:10.129
So instead, I smile and I nod

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:12.130
and I discreetly try to let the guy know

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.915
that I don't want to talk to him.

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:16.038
And if you live in LA,

00:01:16.038 --> 00:01:19.279
This "stranger" is bound to ask you something like,

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:23.415
"Will you read my screenplay and
tell me what you think?"

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.569
Ohoho..my friend.

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.192
This is the one place where
my honesty will have no compromise.

00:01:29.192 --> 00:01:31.278
Well, first of all, the grammatical errors.

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:33.462
Oh, well it's just a first draft.

00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:36.724
Even for a first draft,
there should never be grammatical errors.

00:01:36.724 --> 00:01:39.038
And some of the character's names

00:01:39.038 --> 00:01:40.340
aren't even capitalized.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.023
Well--

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:41.978
And don't direct from the inside.

00:01:41.978 --> 00:01:45.372
I see a lot of "The camera sweeps down"
"The camera pans left"

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.477
That's the director's job.

00:01:47.477 --> 00:01:48.162
Not yours.

00:01:48.162 --> 00:01:48.748
Well I uh--

00:01:48.748 --> 00:01:51.601
I would...I would not show this to anyone.

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:53.947
I mean, the grammatical errors alone
are enough to tell me that you're

00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:54.995
not a serious writer,

00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:58.372
and the fact that you direct from the inside
kind of proves that you're an amateur,

00:01:58.372 --> 00:02:02.311
I would buy some books on proper
screenplay format, and then

00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:07.119
rewrite the shit out of this
before ever showing it to anyone ever again.

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.376
In...your life.

00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:09.777
Now you may think that's harsh,

00:02:09.777 --> 00:02:12.869
but this guy was not looking for constructive criticism.

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:14.783
He was looking for praise.

00:02:14.783 --> 00:02:16.370
Earlier on in the conversation,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.477
he asked me for some advice about LA,

00:02:18.477 --> 00:02:20.131
and as I was telling him things

00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:22.717
that had taken me YEARS to learn,

00:02:22.717 --> 00:02:24.613
his eyes glazed over.

00:02:24.613 --> 00:02:25.372
Yeah.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.810
His eyes had the fucking indecency

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.247
to glaze over.

00:02:29.247 --> 00:02:31.098
Now you may be wondering what's the point.

00:02:31.098 --> 00:02:32.401
Well, your time..

00:02:32.401 --> 00:02:33.279
is valuable.

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:35.099
Because it's a limited resource.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.037
You only have a set number of breaths.

00:02:37.037 --> 00:02:38.447
Why waste them on some guy

00:02:38.447 --> 00:02:40.406
who's gonna interrupt your amazing book,

00:02:40.406 --> 00:02:42.447
ask for advice he's not gonna listen to,

00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:45.039
and want praise on something that's honestly..

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.570
half-assed bullshit.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.463
Look, no matter how nice you are
or want to be,

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:50.809
you have limits.

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.131
You have boundaries.

00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:54.130
And that's okay.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.056
If I had just been honest and upfront
in the beginning and said,

00:02:57.056 --> 00:03:01.416
"Hey, I'm sorry man, I don't want to be rude
or anything, but I'm kind of reading."

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:05.131
then I wouldn't have wasted
20 minutes of my life.

00:03:05.131 --> 00:03:06.845
And if you hadn't clicked on this video,

00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:09.100
you wouldn't have wasted 3 minutes of yours.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.624
(clicks)

00:03:09.947 --> 00:03:11.997
I'll see you next Monday.
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:12.626
