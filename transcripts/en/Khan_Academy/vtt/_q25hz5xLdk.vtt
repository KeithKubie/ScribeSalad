00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.720
Let's think about how
put options can give us

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.790
leverage on a downside,
or I should say, on a bet

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.712
that the stock will go
down relative to shorting.

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:10.420
This one's a little
bit more complicated,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.100
because shorting is a
little bit less intuitive.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.577
But if you were to short
a stock, in order to short

00:00:16.577 --> 00:00:19.160
it, you might say hey, I don't
have to put any money up front,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.040
because I essentially just
borrowed the stock immediately.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.370
And then I would
sell it for $50.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.210
But the reality is that you
do have to put some capital

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.650
upfront, because the short
can move against you.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.890
And usually you have
to put at least 50%

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.150
of the value of the short.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.720
So in our short scenario, you
would have to put at least $25

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.810
up front.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.020
And then you would borrow
the stock, sell it for $50,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.557
and so you'd
essentially have $75

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:47.140
to play with that
you would eventually

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.110
have to use to buy
back the stock.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.980
But the upfront capital is $25.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.261
Now, in our scenario
where the stock went down,

00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:56.010
which was a good thing
if you're shorting,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.593
you want the stock,
that was your bet,

00:00:57.593 --> 00:00:59.050
you want it to go down.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.280
In the scenario where the
stock went down to $20,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.970
you made a profit of $30.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.230
You were able to buy
that stock for $20,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.180
and then give it back
to the original person.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.070
So you were able to keep that
$50, although net for that $20,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.320
so you made $30.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.630
So you made $30 on
a $25 investment.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.600
So your gain, you
make, what is that?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.920
You make $25 and then another
$5, so that's 120% gain.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.030
So let me write that down.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.960
You had made 120% gain.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.000
Of course, in this
scenario, you gained

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.850
when the stock went down.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.220
In terms of loss here,
when the stock went up,

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.240
the stock went up to $80,
we lost $30 by shorting.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.195
So we had 120% loss.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.464
And it's important to realize,
in a short situation, the best

00:01:58.464 --> 00:02:00.380
thing that could happen
for you, is your stock

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.350
go to zero, in which
case you can buy it back

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.039
for nothing, which means
you could keep your $50.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.770
So in the best
possible scenario,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.990
you have to put $25 up front.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.680
You can keep the $50 that you
got from borrowing and selling

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.060
the stock.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.060
So you could make a
200% percent return.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.710
In the worst case scenario,
so the best scenario is

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.752
this is 200%, in the worst
case, this would be infinite.

00:02:26.752 --> 00:02:28.960
So you have to be very
careful while you're shorting.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.010
But let's think
about the put option.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.650
In the put option, we only
have to put $5 upfront

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.400
to actually buy the put.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.300
And when the stock went
down to $20, we made $15.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.554
So this was a 300% gain.

00:02:46.554 --> 00:02:48.970
And on the other side of the
equation, when the stock went

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.450
up, the worst we could do is
just lose all of our money.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.240
So the worst thing we
could do is just lose 100%.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.460
So once again, we were
able to multiply our gains

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.480
relative to shorting, although
it's a little bit more mixed

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.580
on the downside, because
the put gives you

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.410
a little bit of
protection there.
