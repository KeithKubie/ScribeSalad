00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.690
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.530
is talk about what is often referred to as

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.860
the Bully Pulpit of the
United States President.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.400
It's making reference to the idea

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.430
that the President has a platform

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.190
from which they can convince people,

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.860
that they can convey their own message.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.920
There are explicit powers in
the United States Constitution

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.290
about what the President
can and cannot do,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.990
but just as being that singular executive

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.320
at the top of the Executive Branch,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.140
people are gonna pay
attention to what they say.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.240
This term, bully pulpit, probably isn't

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.510
exactly what you imagine it to mean.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.490
It actually comes to us
from Theodore Roosevelt,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.710
that's a picture of Theodore
Roosevelt giving a speech.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.510
He was president from 1901 to 1909.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.430
He was actually the youngest person to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.680
hold the office of President.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.560
He took office when President
McKinley was assassinated,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.990
and this is a quote from 1909,

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.450
from Lyman Abbott, who
wrote for "The Outlook".

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.710
"Half a dozen of us
were with the President,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.110
Theodore Roosevelt, in his library.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.970
He was sitting at his desk reading to us

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.790
his forthcoming message.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.720
He had just finished reading a paragraph

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.810
of a distinctly ethical character
when he suddenly stopped,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.180
swung round in his swivel chair and said,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.680
'I suppose my critics
will call that preaching,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.250
but I have got such a bully pulpit!'"

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.900
Theodore Roosevelt was famous for

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.950
using the term "bully" a lot,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.510
and it doesn't mean to pick on people

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.530
in Theodore Roosevelt's context.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.720
He used it as great, wonderful.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.740
Bully for you, good for you.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.390
When he said "a bully pulpit",

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.290
he's saying, "I have such a great platform

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.500
from which to speak."

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.620
He's not saying I have a platform

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.380
from which to pick on people.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.070
And this was before mass media

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.710
became a significant
influence in politics.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.180
At this time, recorded audio was

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.770
just starting to become a thing.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.120
Television was not an
influence in politics.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.870
But you can imagine,
once you have mass media,

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.860
especially radio, television,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.360
and now social media
becoming a major factor,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.510
this bully pulpit has only gotten

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.610
more and more and more significant.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.940
One of the strongest
examples of Presidents

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.790
using their bully pulpit is
the State of the Union address.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.350
State

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.390
of

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.620
the Union.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.180
The Constitution does
call for the President

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.520
to make reports to Congress
on the state of the union,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.930
but early Presidents,
like Thomas Jefferson,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.730
just sent a written report.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.620
But, eventually, over time, the President

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.230
started giving live reports to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.810
the joint houses of Congress
in the form of a speech,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.070
and then in 1947,

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.570
you have Truman's State
of the Union is televised.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.110
Truman

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.943
televised.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.400
Today, the State of the
Union is given every January,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.590
this is a major event.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.380
All the major networks show
it, the nation pays attention.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.100
What Theodore Roosevelt was talking about

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.960
becomes even more powerful
for modern presidents

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.080
that have mass media at their disposal.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.030
To get a good, tangible
sense of this power

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.950
that a President has, I'm gonna
show you a video from 1981.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.360
This actually will not be a
State of the Union address.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.880
This is an address that
President Reagan gives

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.810
to the nation on federal tax reduction.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.990
Just so that you have context
on what the world was like,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.600
or what the United
States was like, in 1981,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.560
they had stagflation, a stagnant economy

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.280
with a lot of inflation
and high interest rates.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.080
I remember, at the time, my mom had,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.700
I think it was a 17% interest
rate on her mortgage,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.980
which was incredibly, incredibly high.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.730
What you're going to
see is President Reagan

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.010
making a direct plea
to the American people

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.860
to convince their representatives
to support his tax plan,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.880
and think about what President
Reagan was able to do

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.170
that Thomas Jefferson, or
even Theodore Roosevelt,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.520
could have only dreamed of.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.980
- The best way to have a
strong foreign policy abroad

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.060
is to have a strong economy at home.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.420
Now, the day after tomorrow, Wednesday,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.610
the House of Representatives
will begin debate

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.480
on two tax bills, and once again,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.830
they need to hear from you.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.710
I know that doesn't give you much time,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.160
but a great deal is at stake.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.910
Let me add, those representatives

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.150
honestly and sincerely
want to know your feelings.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.250
They get plenty of input from
the special interest groups.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.350
They'd like to hear from their home folks.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.320
Let me explain what the
situation is and what's at issue.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.160
With our budget cuts, we
presented a complete program

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.240
of reduction in tax rates.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.670
Again, our purpose was
to provide incentive

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.490
for the individual,
incentives for business

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.750
to encourage production and
hiring of the unemployed,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.970
and to free up money for investment.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.680
Our bill calls for a 5% reduction in

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.700
the income tax rates by October 1st,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.760
a 10% reduction beginning July 1st, 1982,

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.790
and another 10% cut a year later.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.790
A 25% total reduction over three years.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.920
But then, to insure the
tax cut is permanent,

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.040
we call for indexing
the tax rates in 1985,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.260
which means adjusting them for inflation.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.230
As it is now, if you get
a cost of living raise

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.290
that's intended to keep
you even with inflation,

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.150
you find that the increase in

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.490
the number of dollars
you get may very likely

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.030
move you into a higher tax bracket,

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.100
and you wind up poorer than you were.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.950
This is called bracket creep.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.300
Bracket creep is an insidious tax.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.900
Let me give an example.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.710
If you earned $10,000 a year in 1972,

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.780
by 1980,

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.632
you had to earn $19,700

00:05:35.632 --> 00:05:38.040
just to stay even with inflation,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.140
but that's before taxes.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.820
Come April 15th, you find your
tax rates have increased 30%.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.750
Have you been wondering why you don't seem

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.260
as well off as you were a few years back?

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.960
It's because government
makes a profit on inflation.
