00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.400
In the previous quiz, we saw that some of the requirements

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.920
that they put in the list were not pertinent. They were

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.590
irrelevant. So let me ask you. Why can irrelevant requirements be

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.170
harmful? Why is that a problem to have irrelevant requirements? So

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.060
here, I'm giving you four possible answers. And I'd like for

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.150
you to mark all that apply. Can irrelevant requirements be harmful

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.210
because they may lead to missing functionality in the final product.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.390
Because they can introduce inconsistency. Because

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.410
they can waste the project resources.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.170
Or because they may introduce bugs in the software system. And

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.680
as I said, more than one can be a valid reason.
