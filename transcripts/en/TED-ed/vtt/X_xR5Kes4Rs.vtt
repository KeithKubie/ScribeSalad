00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:15.730
Would mathematics exist if people didn't?

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.057
Since ancient times, 
mankind has hotly debated

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:22.712
whether mathematics 
was discovered or invented.

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:27.374
Did we create mathematical concepts to
help us understand the universe around us,

00:00:27.374 --> 00:00:31.521
or is math the native language of
the universe itself,

00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:34.734
existing whether we find 
its truths or not?

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:38.102
Are numbers, polygons 
and equations truly real,

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:42.676
or merely ethereal representations
of some theoretical ideal?

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:46.235
The independent reality of math has
some ancient advocates.

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:49.796
The Pythagoreans of 5th Century Greece
believed numbers were both

00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:53.261
living entities and universal principles.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:57.568
They called the number one, "the monad,"
the generator of all other numbers

00:00:57.568 --> 00:00:59.829
and source of all creation.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.644
Numbers were active agents in nature.

00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:05.499
Plato argued mathematical 
concepts were concrete

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:10.444
and as real as the universe itself,
regardless of our knowledge of them.

00:01:10.444 --> 00:01:13.897
Euclid, the father of geometry, believed
nature itself

00:01:13.897 --> 00:01:17.702
was the physical manifestation
of mathematical laws.

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:21.926
Others argue that while numbers may
or may not exist physically,

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:25.047
mathematical statements definitely don't.

00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:29.586
Their truth values are based on rules
that humans created.

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:32.613
Mathematics is thus an invented
logic exercise,

00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:36.356
with no existence outside mankind's
conscious thought,

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:40.997
a language of abstract relationships
based on patterns discerned by brains,

00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:46.694
built to use those patterns to invent
useful but artificial order from chaos.

00:01:46.694 --> 00:01:50.373
One proponent of this sort of idea
was Leopold Kronecker,

00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:53.997
a professor of mathematics in 
19th century Germany.

00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:56.451
His belief is summed up in 
his famous statement:

00:01:56.451 --> 00:02:00.960
"God created the natural numbers,
all else is the work of man."

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.533
During mathematician
David Hilbert's lifetime,

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:07.131
there was a push to establish mathematics
as a logical construct.

00:02:07.131 --> 00:02:10.501
Hilbert attempted to axiomatize all
of mathematics,

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.969
as Euclid had done with geometry.

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.525
He and others who attempted this saw
mathematics as a deeply philosophical game

00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:19.700
but a game nonetheless.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.231
Henri PoincarÃ©, one of the father's of
non-Euclidean geometry,

00:02:23.231 --> 00:02:26.238
believed that the existence of 
non-Euclidean geometry,

00:02:26.238 --> 00:02:30.535
dealing with the non-flat surfaces of 
hyperbolic and elliptical curvatures,

00:02:30.535 --> 00:02:35.001
proved that Euclidean geometry, the
long standing geometry of flat surfaces,

00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.363
was not a universal truth,

00:02:37.363 --> 00:02:42.051
but rather one outcome of using one
particular set of game rules.

00:02:42.051 --> 00:02:45.865
But in 1960, Nobel Physics laureate
Eugene Wigner

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:50.173
coined the phrase, "the unreasonable 
effectiveness of mathematics,"

00:02:50.173 --> 00:02:53.283
pushing strongly for the idea that
mathematics is real

00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:55.482
and discovered by people.

00:02:55.482 --> 00:02:58.388
Wigner pointed out that many purely
mathematical theories

00:02:58.388 --> 00:03:03.379
developed in a vacuum, often with no view
towards describing any physical phenomena,

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.873
have proven decades 
or even centuries later,

00:03:05.873 --> 00:03:08.337
to be the framework necessary to explain

00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:11.440
how the universe
has been working all along.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.688
For instance, the number theory of British
mathematician Gottfried Hardy,

00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:19.377
who had boasted that none of his work
would ever be found useful

00:03:19.377 --> 00:03:21.918
in describing any phenomena
in the real world,

00:03:21.918 --> 00:03:24.660
helped establish cryptography.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.938
Another piece of his purely
theoretical work

00:03:26.938 --> 00:03:30.095
became known as the Hardy-Weinberg
law in genetics,

00:03:30.095 --> 00:03:31.834
and won a Nobel prize.

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:34.426
And Fibonacci stumbled 
upon his famous sequence

00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:38.040
while looking at the growth of an 
idealized rabbit population.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.548
Mankind later found the sequence
everywhere in nature,

00:03:41.548 --> 00:03:44.036
from sunflower seeds
and flower petal arrangements,

00:03:44.036 --> 00:03:45.857
to the structure of a pineapple,

00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:48.497
even the branching of bronchi
in the lungs.

00:03:48.497 --> 00:03:52.704
Or there's the non-Euclidean work of
Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s,

00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:57.291
which Einstein used in the model for
general relativity a century later.

00:03:57.291 --> 00:03:58.707
Here's an even bigger jump:

00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:02.933
mathematical knot theory, first developed
around 1771

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:05.185
to describe the geometry of position,

00:04:05.185 --> 00:04:10.033
was used in the late 20th century
to explain how DNA unravels itself

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.212
during the replication process.

00:04:12.212 --> 00:04:16.161
It may even provide key explanations
for string theory.

00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:18.791
Some of the most influential 
mathematicians and scientists

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:22.472
of all of human history
have chimed in on the issue as well,

00:04:22.472 --> 00:04:24.093
often in surprising ways.

00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:26.904
So, is mathematics an 
invention or a discovery?

00:04:26.904 --> 00:04:29.851
Artificial construct or
universal truth?

00:04:29.851 --> 00:04:34.017
Human product or
natural, possibly divine, creation?

00:04:34.017 --> 00:04:38.458
These questions are so deep the debate
often becomes spiritual in nature.

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:41.550
The answer might depend on the specific
concept being looked at,

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.177
but it can all feel like a
distorted zen koan.

00:04:45.177 --> 00:04:48.806
If there's a number of trees in a forest,
but no one's there to count them,

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:50.726
does that number exist?
