00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:16.859
Hello, my name is Paul Bloom and I’m a Professor
of Psychology at Yale University.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.990
And what I want to do today is present a brief
introduction to psychology, which is the science

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.720
of the human mind.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:31.050
Now, I’m admittedly biased, but I think
psychology is the most interesting of all

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.050
scientific fields.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.030
It’s the most interesting because it’s
about us.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.340
It’s about the most important and intimate
aspects of our lives.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.699
So psychologists study everything from language,
perception, memory, motivation, dreams, love,

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:44.699
hate.

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.600
We study the development of a child.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.719
We study mental illnesses like schizophrenia
and psychopathy, we study morality, we study

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.719
happiness.

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:03.440
Now, psychology is such a huge field that
it breaks up into different subfields.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:11.940
Some psychologists study neuroscience, which
is the study how the brain gives rise to mental

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.049
life.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.680
Others, like me, are Developmental Psychologists.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.580
We study what happens to make a baby turn
into a child and a child turn into adults.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.210
We study what makes a baby turn into a child
and a child turn into an adult.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.600
We ask questions like, how does a baby think
about the world?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.600
What do we start off knowing?

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.810
What do we have to learn?

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.530
Other psychologists are Social Psychologists.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.010
They study human interaction.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.780
What’s the nature of prejudice?

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.380
How do we persuade one another?

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.090
Some Psychologists are Cognitive Psychologists.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.520
What that means is they study the mind as
a computational device looking particularly

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.840
at capacities like language, perception, memory,
and decision-making.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.630
Some Psychologists are Evolutionary Psychologists,
which means they’re particularly interested

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.750
in biological origin of the human mind.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.750
There are Evolutionary Psychologists.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.900
Evolutionary Psychologists are particularly
interested in the evolutionary origin of our

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.900
psychologies.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.750
So they study the mind with an eye towards
how it has evolved.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.590
What adaptive problems it’s been constructed
to solve.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.930
Finally, there’s clinical psychology.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.640
For many people, this is what psychology means.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.750
Many people associate psychology with clinical
psychology, and in fact, it’s a very important

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.750
aspect of psychology.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:28.050
Clinical psychologists are interested in the
diagnosis that the causes and the treatment

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.060
of mental disorders, disorders like schizophrenia,
depression and anxiety disorders.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.590
It would be impossible for me to provide a
full spectrum introduction to all of these

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.590
sub fields of psychology in the time I have.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.700
So what I’m going to do instead is I’m
going to focus on three case studies.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.700
I’m gong to focus on compassion, racism,
and sex.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.120
I’ve chosen these case studies for two reasons.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.780
First, each of them is particularly interesting
in its own light.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.160
These are questions we’re interested in
as people, as scientists, but also in our

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.160
every day lives.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.160
And I want to try to persuade you that psychologists
have some interesting things to say about

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160
them.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.160
Second, together they illustrate the range
of approaches that psychologists use.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.160
The sort of theories that we construct, the
sorts of methods we use when approaching a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.160
domain.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.160
I want to try to give you a feeling for what
psychology looks like when we actually carry

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160
it out.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.160
The first case study is compassion.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.060
Compassion… by what I mean by compassion
is concern for other people.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.019
This is particularly interesting to me.

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.909
This is my own research program and my own
laboratory at Yale; we look at the emergence

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.470
of morality in babies and young children.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.050
And we particularly focus on the emergence
of compassion.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.430
At what point in development do babies care
about others?

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.810
At what point in development does feelings
of empathy and sympathy, sometimes anger,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.920
guilt, other moral emotions.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.980
How do they arise?

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.030
To what extent are they built in?

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.110
To what extent do they have to be learned?

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.950
As a starting point, I have here a picture
of a baby and inside the baby’s head is

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.660
the baby’s brain.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.290
The baby’s brain is an extraordinary computing
machine.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.290
The baby’s brain is composed of neurons.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.290
Now neurons are basic cells that process and
transmit information.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.290
They receive input from other neurons and
then if the sum of the input is sufficiently

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.290
high, they fire.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.290
The brain does its work through collections
of neurons, through what you would call neuro

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.290
networks on neuro circuits.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.290
Now looked at in that way, the baby’s brain
is extraordinarily impressive.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.290
It contains roughly 100 billion neurons.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.290
Since all of the thinking is done through
connections between the neurons, what happens

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.629
as the baby grows if more and more connections
are made.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:56.150
And by one estimate, there’s about 1.8 million
connections between neurons that are created

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.060
per second.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.500
To give you a feeling of the complexity of
the baby’s brain, I use an analogy from

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:04.500
Jeff Hawkins.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.959
Imagine a football stadium.

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.629
Fill it up with cooked spaghetti, then shrink
it to the size of a soccer ball.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.500
Then make it much, much, much denser.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.540
And then you’ll have some understanding
of how much is going on inside a brain, inside

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.210
even a baby’s brain.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.770
Now, that much we know for sure, but where
the real debate goes on concerns the nature

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.320
of that computational structure.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.470
The nature of what’s going on with all of
those neuro networks and neuro circuits.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:43.160
There’s one of view that is held by many
philosophers and many psychologists that the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.830
brain starts off as a blank slate, what the
philosopher, John Locke, called “a Tabula

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.830
Rasa.”

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.931
And what goes on in development, the point
of all those connections per second is learning,

00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:56.620
is sucking up information from the environment.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.670
The baby starts off knowing nothing and turns
into an adult, by virtue of absorbing information

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.660
at a tremendously powerful rate.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.660
That’s one view.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.850
Many philosophers and many psychologists,
including me and my colleagues are more enamored

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.460
of another view.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.490
We don’t deny that learning takes place,
but we would argue that in addition to that,

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.680
there is an extraordinary early understanding,
early specialization.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.240
The brain could better be understood in terms
of what the psychologists, Leda Cosmides and

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.330
John Tooby, described as a Swiss Army knife,
has many different parts.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.440
And each part is specialized for a different
function.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.320
Now, so much of the action in psychology has
been a running debate over which view is right.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.320
So for instance, in the domain of language,
many people have argued that there’s nothing

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.320
special with the language.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320
We come to know, we come to use language because
we’re just very powerful learners.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.320
Other people, most notably the linguists,
Noam Chomsky, and people have followed from

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.320
his work; have argued that there is a specialized
mechanism for language; language organ or

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320
language module or language instinct.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.320
Learning needs to be done, but it’s done
through this specialized system.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.320
Now, I’m not going to talk about language
today, but there’s another debate, which

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.320
I am going to talk about.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.320
And this concerns morality, both moral judgments
of right and wrong, but also moral feelings

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.870
including compassion.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.050
Many people would argue that in that regard,
the baby starts off with nothing.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.050
Many people would agree with the classic Onion
headline, a satirical newspaper, which says:

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.050
“New study reveals most children unrepentant
sociopaths.”

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.280
The idea is that children start off immoral,
monsters or if not monsters, at least they

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.800
know not from good and evil.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.720
This is not the view which I think is supported
by the data.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.920
I think there is now more and more data in
support of a different view of compassion.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.920
One that was nicely summarized by Thomas Jefferson.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.920
So Thomas Jefferson wrote: “The moral sense
or conscious is as much a part of man as his

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.920
leg or arm.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.920
It is given to all human beings in stronger
or weaker degree as **** of members has given

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.920
them in a greater or lesser degree.”

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.920
This claim, the idea that we grow morality,
morality is part of our nature, was supported

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.920
by Thomas Jefferson’s contemporary, Adam
Smith, in Europe at the same time.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.920
Sorry… was supported by Thomas Jefferson’s
contemporary, Adam Smith.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.920
And Adam gives an example of this.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:19.920
He points out that it is a part of our nature
to feel pain at the pain of others.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.920
As he writes: “When we see a stroke aimed
and just ready to fall upon the leg or arm

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.920
of another person, we naturally shrink and
draw back our own leg or arm.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.920
And when it does fall, we feel it in some
measure and are hurt by it as well as the

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920
sufferer.”

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:24.920
And here is an illustration of this act of
empathy taking place.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.920
Now we know this is true for children.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.920
In fact, we know this is true for babies.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920
One way to make a baby cry is to expose it
to cries of other babies.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.920
There’s sort of contagiousness to the crying.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920
It’s not just crying.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.920
We also know that if a baby sees another human
in silent pain, it will distress the baby.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.920
It seems part of our very nature is to suffer
at the suffering of others.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.770
We know that young babies, as they become
capable of moving voluntarily will share.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.020
They will share food, for instance, with their
siblings and with kids that are around.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.410
They will sooth.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.310
If they see somebody else in pain, even the
youngest of toddlers will try to reach out

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.750
and pat the person.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.370
Maybe hand over a toy.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.550
There’s some lovely studies finding that
slightly older children are able to help others

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.760
when they see somebody who is unable to fulfill
a goal, they’ll seek out to come to their

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760
aid.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.200
So one elegant demonstration of this comes
from a recent set of experiments by the psychologist,

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.150
Felix Warneken and Michael Tomasello, where
they take a toddler, put him or her in a situation

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:16.280
where an adult is in some sort of mild distress
and see if the toddler will voluntarily help,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.830
even without any prompting.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.290
And they find that toddlers typically do.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:26.300
There seems to be some sort of impulse in
us that’s altruistic, that’s kind, that’s

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.300
compassionate.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:34.360
Now, in all of these cases; however, the kindness
that we see seems to apply to people who are

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:39.710
close to us, who are either physically in
our proximity or who are our siblings or our

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.870
parents or our friends.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.020
So the question arises, how broad does this
compassion extend?

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:50.300
Now some people would argue that we start
off with a very broad compassion, we would

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.580
extend it to all individuals, to all people.

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.580
But there’s evidence support a somewhat
different view, which is, there’s a moral

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:01.500
instinct in us, there’s a moral sense in
us, but it’s initially very narrow.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.600
It’s only created by those close to us.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.680
And our feelings towards others are in fact,
not positive at all, they aren’t compassionate

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680
at all.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.310
In fact, our natural default feelings towards
a stranger, far from being compassionate,

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:20.000
is actually some sort of mixture of fear and
hatred.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.310
We see this in all sorts of different ways.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.080
So in young children, we see it in what’s
called, “stranger anxiety.”

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:31.500
At around nine months of age, babies start
becoming panicked at the presence of strangers.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.500
They fear strangers.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.500
And developmental psychologists have helpfully
called it “stranger anxiety” and it seems

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.240
to capture a universal part of development
where the other is thought of as dangerous.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.080
This sort of stranger anxiety fades in some
cultures.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.160
If you were to find yourself in an airport
in a new city, you’re not likely to have

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.280
a panic attack because you’re surrounded
by people you don’t know, but in small scale

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.270
human societies, it might never go away.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:59.590
In a situation when an individual is raised
with a few hundred other individuals around

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.070
them, that is their circle of compassion.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.310
And their response to others is not positive.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:10.650
This is an observation that’s been made
by many anthropologists who study small scale

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.010
societies.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:17.800
So for instance, anthropologist, Jared Diamond,
talking about small scale societies in **** New

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.930
Guinea writes, “To venture out of one’s
territory to meet other humans, even if they

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:27.370
lived only a few miles away, was equivalent
to suicide.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:34.590
Many years before, Margaret Meade was talking
about the lifestyles of what were called at

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.640
the time, “primitive cultures.”

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.700
And she is famously a supporter of these lifestyles.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.620
She argues that the Western world would be
much better if we were to adopt the customs

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.940
and thoughts and ideas, particularly in regard
to sexuality of these other societies.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:55.690
But she was very honest and very blunt about
how members of these societies treat strangers.

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:59.990
She writes: “Most primitive tribes feel
that if you run across one of those sub humans

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.950
from a rival group in the forest, the most
appropriate thing to do is bludgeon them to

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:04.950
death.”

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:11.390
I’ve talked about fear and hatred, but there’s
a third sort of response that we often give

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:12.560
to strangers.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.930
This is disgust.

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:20.550
Disgust is what Paul Rozin described as the
“body/soul emotion,” is a human universal.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.720
Humans everywhere are disgusted by certain
things.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:32.190
We are disgusted by feces, urine, blood, vomit,
rotten flesh, and most meat.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:38.380
Disgust has a characteristic facial response
and its easy part of our natures.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:45.450
Now, if it was limited to food and cockroaches
and that sort of thing, it wouldn’t have

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.020
anything to do with my talk on compassion.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.705
But what’s most interesting is that we’re
often disgusted by other people.

00:10:49.705 --> 00:10:51.800
But what’s most interesting is that we are
often disgusted by other people.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.790
Particularly, we’re often disgusted by strange
people.

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.500
And this is an observation that Charles Darwin,
who is a wonderful observer of human nature,

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.500
made.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.960
Darwin wrote: “In Tierra del Fuego, a native
touched with his fingers some cold preserved

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.690
meat and plainly showed disgust at the softness.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.360
Whilst I felt utter disgust of my food being
touched by a naked savage, thought his hands

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.360
did not appear dirty.”

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.840
We have laboratory research that explores
the relationship between feelings of disgust

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.690
and feelings towards out groups.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:18.990
So we know for instance that people differ
in how easily disgusted they are.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.990
You do a survey of people.

00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:23.960
You ask them questions like, how badly would
this bother you.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.570
So one of the questions might be, you have
to pick up a dead cat with your hands.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.400
And there’s some people who say, “uh,
whatever.”

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.400
Some people, “Oh my god!

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.920
I’d rather die” or, you sit on a city
bus seat and it’s warm from the last person

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.430
who was on it.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.670
And some people crack up, well why would that
bother me?

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.530
Other people say, “That’s very disturbing.”

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.530
People differ in how sensitive they are to
disgust.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:52.280
It turns out that where you stand with regard
to disgust correlates with your feelings about

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.280
out groups.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:57.930
It correlates with your feelings about immigrants;
it correlates with your feelings about sexual

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.730
minorities, in particular male homosexuals.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:08.279
The more easily disgusted you are, the more
aversion you find to these others.

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.860
We also know this experimentally.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:17.300
We know that by making people be disgusted,
we can make them meaner.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.841
I’ll give you an example of this.

00:12:18.841 --> 00:12:23.250
This is from a study I was involved with,
with David Pizarro at Cornell University as

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.820
the lead investigator.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.690
What we did was we brought people into the
lab… into a lab at Cornell.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.860
And we asked him all sorts of questions regarding
their feelings towards different groups and

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:33.860
different policies.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:35.510
What do you think of African-Americans?

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.070
What do you think of gay men?

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.290
What do you think of welfare?

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.290
What do you think of immigration?

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.440
And so on and so forth.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.590
Half the people just filled it out and went
home.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.740
The other half of the subjects went into the
room, got the same survey.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:50.600
But the difference was, before they entered
the room, we sprayed the room with a fart

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.600
spray.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:56.120
That’s the first experiment I’ve ever
been involved with that used a fart spray.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.570
People would be kind of grossed out.

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.320
And it would make them meaner.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.780
Not towards everything, but it would make
them particularly meaner towards out groups,

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.840
like male homosexuals.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.450
And this supports the idea that there’s
a connection in our minds between a visceral

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:16.730
emotion of disgust and our feelings towards
others.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:21.680
So what I’ve argued is, we do have a natural
compassion, but it’s limited.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.340
It does not naturally extend to strangers.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.340
It does not naturally extend to others.

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.340
For them our reaction might be hatred, fear,
and disgust.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:32.170
But that raises a puzzle because you and me
and everyone else we know can extend our compassion

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:36.460
to strangers, to put it in the language that
the philosopher Peter Singer has used, “Our

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.170
moral circle has expanded.”

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.320
It might be that our ancestors, it might be
the people in small scale societies only cared

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:48.910
about their family and friends, but we have
a broader circle of compassion.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.350
We think about we care about people in other
countries.

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.620
We care about people from other races.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.990
We care about people we’ve never seen before
and we never will see.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.991
When some sort of disaster strikes like a
tsunami or a hurricane or earthquake, many

00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:08.480
of us give our resources, even our blood,
to help out people we’ve never met before.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.000
And that poses a neat psychological puzzle.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.992
What forces take our narrow moral circle,
our narrow scope of compassion and make it

00:14:17.992 --> 00:14:20.400
bigger and expand it to care for these others?

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.920
Now I think that there are a lot of different
answers to that question.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.870
Robert Wright, for instance, has argued that
one force in expanding the moral circle has

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.730
been human interconnections in commerce, in
international travel and so on.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:37.589
The more people you know, the more people
you have contact with, the more we are interconnected

00:14:37.589 --> 00:14:44.350
in the world, the more you might care about
them in a sort of self-interested altruism

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:48.650
where you care about them because they’re
fates are intertwined with yours.

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.580
And I think that there’s a lot of value
in that insight.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.980
But I want to focus on a different, maybe
more psychological mechanism.

00:14:54.980 --> 00:15:02.901
A mechanism that happens to individuals as
they get older, a part of development, which

00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:12.510
is, their sympathies expand because of a certain
sort of persuasion.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.339
I want to suggest that there is psychological
evidence that supports the idea that we can

00:15:17.339 --> 00:15:23.680
expand our compassion, our moral circle to
far away strangers by being made to think

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.230
of them as if they are individual people.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.470
In particular, we think of them as if they’re
our friends and family.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:30.784
We think of them as if they are right in front
of us.

00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:31.784
Now, the importance of thinking about concrete
individuals when it comes to kindness is not

00:15:31.784 --> 00:15:32.784
an idea psychologists were forced to come
out with, it’s very well-known, thought

00:15:32.784 --> 00:15:33.784
of by monsters and by saints.

00:15:33.784 --> 00:15:38.880
Joseph Stalin famously said, “A single death
is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic.”

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.820
And Mother Theresa presented a similar sentiment
when she said, “If I look at the mass, I

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.820
will never act.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.470
If I look at the one, I will.”

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.560
Psychologists like Paul Slovic has explored
this in the lab.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.339
So for instance, they would do a study where
they would have an appeal for a charity.

00:15:55.339 --> 00:15:58.950
And in fact, they would take the money they
got and send it to the charity.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:05.870
And they would, for one group of subjects,
describe the problem in terms of statistics,

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:09.630
in terms of numbers, in terms of the millions
of people suffering, a sort of suffering a

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:13.310
proportion of the population who is in desperate
need.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.250
And they found that people would give say,
roughly a dollar.

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.010
For the other group, they didn’t bother
with statistics at all.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:24.400
They didn’t bother trying to impress them
with the huge number of people suffering.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.400
Rather, they told them a story.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.899
They told them a story about a single individual.

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:31.630
They had a picture of that individual, they
gave her a name.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.800
And when you do that, you find that people
are far more generous.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.830
It’s a far more powerful effect on their
compassion.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.339
They will give, roughly, twice as much.

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:40.820
Now, this is not a secret.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:41.820
It is not something only psychologists know.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.390
Charities, when they try to appeal for people’s
help, won’t throw numbers at you.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.720
They typically won’t because they know that
doesn’t work.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.490
The way to extend people’s compassion, the
way to motivate altruistic action is to appeal

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:58.670
to some very natural, very hardwired systems
within us that respond to individual people.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:59.670
And so charities will draw your attention,
will appeal to you by focusing on the individual.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.670
I know this from a personal story.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:01.670
When I was a graduate student, I was having
an argument with a philosopher friend of mine.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:02.670
And I was telling him, I was very persuaded
by some stuff I read that rich Westerners

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:03.670
don’t give anywhere near enough money to
the starving millions around the world.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:04.670
And I was giving him such a hard time about
that.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.670
And at some point, totally sick of me, he
says, “How much do you give to charity?”

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:06.670
And I’m thinking, well, I’m making a theoretical
point here.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.670
**** I don’t give anything to charity.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:08.670
So I figured, I felt so bad about this, I
contacted one of the… a major charity, actually

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:09.670
Plan U.S.A. and asked them for information
about how to give to them.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:10.670
And they sent me a packet.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:11.670
And I remember opening up the packet and I
remember expecting to see graphs and numbers

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:12.670
and all sorts of information.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.670
And they were so much smarter than that ‘cause
I opened up the package and what they had

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.670
sent me was a child.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:15.670
They had a photograph of the child, they had
a letter he wrote, and they said to me, “Look,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:16.670
we know that you’re not promising to give
to us, you just want information, but if you

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:17.670
were to give, it would go to that individual.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:18.670
That would be the life you would save.”

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:19.670
It worked for me; I think it’s a tremendously
persuasive way for a charity to work.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:20.670
And I think more generally, as part of the
story for how our compassion can get bigger

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:21.670
and bigger.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.670
This really matters.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:23.670
People talk about moral progress.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:24.670
People like Peter Singer, Robert Wright, Steven
Pinker, have argued that through our history,

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.670
the circle of… our moral circles have been
expanding.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:26.670
It’s not just through individuals as they
get older; rather societies have broader and

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.670
broader moral circles.

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.670
We now live in a world where people believe
we have moral obligations to other races,

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:29.670
other nationalities that sexism and racism
are immoral.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.670
Some of us believe we have obligations toward
non-human animals.

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.670
And this has been happening because of stories,
because of persuasion and because people come

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:32.670
to moral insights and use the power of stories
to convey them.

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:33.670
Martha Nussbaum gives a historical example
with regard to Greek tragedies.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:34.670
She writes…

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.670
I have to go **** this.

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.670
“Although all of the future citizens who
saw ancient tragedies were male, they were

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:37.670
asked to have empathy with the suffering of
many whose lot could never be theirs, such

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.670
as Trojans and Persians and Africans, such
as wives and daughters and mothers.”

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:39.670
And if you were to doubt the importance of
this, consider the end of slavery in the United

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.670
States.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:41.670
There are a lot of different factors that
led to the end of slavery, but many historians

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.750
would argue that one of the forces that led
many white Americans to believe slavery was

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:48.213
wrong was persuasion, in particular, it was
the work of the author Harriett Beecher Stowe

00:17:48.213 --> 00:17:49.213
in her book, Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

00:17:49.213 --> 00:17:52.340
In particular, it was the work of Harriet
Beecher Stowe in her book, Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:58.400
In this book, she didn’t make logical arguments;
she didn’t make theological points or philosophical

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.400
proposals.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.210
Rather, she got her readers to extend their
sympathies.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.660
And this had a profound effect.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:25.809
It had a profound effect persuading them that
slavery was wrong 

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:41.160
and changing the fate of the world.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.970
The second case study I want to talk about
is racism.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.059
And I want to begin by making a connection
to a branch of cognitive psychology.

00:18:49.059 --> 00:18:54.740
In particular the brand of cognitive psychology
that deals with how we make sense of the world.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:19:00.960
How we naturally form categories of the things
we see and the things we interact with.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:06.100
Cognitive psychologists have pointed out that
we… that in order to survive in the world,

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.980
we have to make generalizations.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:13.440
You probably have never seen those three pictures
I have up here, but you immediately know that

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.809
one is a dog and one is an apple and one is
a chair.

00:19:17.809 --> 00:19:21.370
You will also have intuitions about these
things… you’ll make generalizations.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:27.310
You’ll believe the dog can bark, the apple
is something you can eat, a chair is something

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.790
you can sit on.

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.700
Now, you probably also realize that there
are exceptions to this.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:38.100
Some dogs are silent, some apples are poisonous,
some chairs will collapse if you sit on them,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:45.750
but still if you couldn’t make those generalizations,
if you didn’t recognize that some properties

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:49.620
tend to co-occur with some objects, you would
be helpless in the world.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:55.250
You wouldn’t know what to eat, you wouldn’t
know how anything would react; you wouldn’t

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.700
survive.

00:19:56.700 --> 00:20:01.430
Part of being a successful human, in fact,
part of being any successful animal is being

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:02.490
able to learn.

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:07.640
And a good part of what learning is is to
make statistical generalizations on the basis

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.480
of limited experience.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.640
You eat a thousand apples, they all taste
pretty good, you conclude, I can eat apples,

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.640
apples taste good.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.620
And when you’re hungry, you reach for the
apple.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:21.820
This is adaptive, it is rational, it is reasonable.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:24.679
But now there’s a twist.

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:29.850
The twist is that some of the categories that
we form are categories of people.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:37.540
We form categories on the basis of… we form
categories on the basis of sex, of age, of

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:48.890
race, profession, religion, sexual orientation,
nationality, and where the person lives.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:51.570
When you form a category of a person, we have
a specific word for that, we often call it

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.570
a stereotype.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:56.730
Now, stereotype may sound like a bad word,
but there’s nothing bad about it.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.350
For one thing, stereotypes are often accurate.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.350
Lee Judson finds that when you ask people
about their stereotypes of different groups

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:00.350
and political groups and ethnicities and genders,
people get it pretty much right.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.670
That we’re reasonably good statistical learners,
and so we tend to be reasonably accurate.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:09.760
Also, stereotypes are often positive, particularly
of groups that we ourselves belong to.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.910
Some of the statistical generalizations may
be correct and may be positive as some groups

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:21.250
have reputations for being smart, for being
loyal, for being brave, for all sorts of things

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.640
that are not at all negative.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.390
And so there’s nothing inherently wrong
about stereotypes.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:31.179
But there are problems with stereotypes.

00:21:31.179 --> 00:21:37.200
For one thing, they’re reliable insofar
as they’re based on a sample, an unbiased

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.590
sample, of the population.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:43.730
But a lot of the information we get about
human groups is through biased sources like

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:46.059
how they’re represented in the media.

00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:52.460
And if these sources don’t give you an accurate
rendition, you’re a stereotype won’t be

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.460
accurate.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.930
For example, many Italian-Americans were upset
at the depiction of Italian-Americans in a

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.299
television show, “The Sopranos.”

00:22:00.299 --> 00:22:04.500
This is because, if you are in an area where
the only Italian-Americans you meet are those

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.050
you see on TV and those you see on “The
Sopranos,” you’re going to think they’re

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.350
all mobsters.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:13.480
Many Jews historically have been troubled
by Shakespeare’s depiction of Shylock.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.460
If the only Jew you know is Shakespeare’s
Shylock, again, it’s going to be a very

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.950
bad impression.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:26.290
And so one problem with stereotypes is while
we have accurate statistical mechanisms for

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:31.049
taking in information and drawing conclusions
from them, often our information isn’t reliable

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:35.080
and often this can lead to the formation of
stereotypes that aren’t right.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:40.450
A second problem is that stereotypes regardless
of whether or not they’re accurate can have

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:44.080
a negative effect on the people that they
apply to.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.740
And this is what the psychologist, Claude
Steele, described as stereotype threat.

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:51.140
So he has a vivid example of this.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:55.940
Here’s how to make African-Americans do
worse on a math test.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:01.040
You have the test and you put on the test
that they have to identify their race.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:07.540
The very act of acknowledging that their African-American
when given a test ignites in them thoughts

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:12.040
of their own stereotype, which isn’t positive,
which is negative regarding academics and

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.110
that makes them do worse.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.820
Want to know how to make a woman do worse
on a math test?

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.809
Same thing, get her to write down her sex.

00:23:19.809 --> 00:23:22.940
One recent study found a sort of clever twist
on this.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.280
The study involved testing Asian-American
women.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.740
Turns out, when Asian-American women are given
a test and they’re asked to mark down their

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.280
race, they do better than they would otherwise
do.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.040
They’re reminded of the stereotype, but
as a positive stereotype and it bumps them

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.120
up.

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.490
You ask them, on the other hand, to mark down
their sex, they do worse because they’re

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:45.080
women and that’s a negative stereotype towards
women.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:50.580
That’s an example of how stereotypes have
a potentially damaging effect on people.

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:57.169
A third problem with stereotypes is, in some
way, our stereotypes of human groups are like

00:23:57.169 --> 00:24:01.880
our categories of dogs and apples and chairs.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.220
But there’s a way in which they aren’t.

00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.180
We’re not dogs and apples and chairs.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.510
But we are members of human groups.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.510
And by definition, any category of human individuals
is something you either belong to or you don’t.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.510
It’s either what psychologists call an in
group or an out group.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:16.490
And this fact of how you connect with the
category has an effect on how you think of

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:17.630
the category.

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:21.750
There’s a lot of evidence suggesting that
when you’re a member of the category, you

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:22.750
boost it.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.250
You give it higher qualities.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:28.081
People in your group are smarter or nicer,
they’re more deserving and so on.

00:24:28.081 --> 00:24:35.060
On the other hand, if it’s an out group,
if it’s another category, particularly if

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:40.080
it’s a category that you’re in some way
competing against, the category gets denigrated.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.640
We see some vivid historical example of this.

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:51.020
In one study in 1942, Americans were asked
to describe the top two features of Russians.

00:24:51.020 --> 00:24:53.350
And they described them as brave and hard-working.

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:57.100
In 1948, they were asked the same question.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.300
They described them as cruel and conceited.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:05.660
The Russians didn’t change, what changed
was our relationship to them over the intervening

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.841
years; they went from being part of a group
that we were a part of to the out group.

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:10.841
More generally, we seem to react in a certain
way to out groups where we seem to think of

00:25:10.841 --> 00:25:11.841
them in general as being less rich, less complicated
than we are.

00:25:11.841 --> 00:25:12.841
Several studies find that we are less likely
to attribute to an out group complicated emotions.

00:25:12.841 --> 00:25:13.841
If the out group is somebody we don’t like,
that we’re afraid of, we’ll often view

00:25:13.841 --> 00:25:14.841
them as savages.

00:25:14.841 --> 00:25:15.841
If the out group is somebody we kind of like,
but we aren’t afraid of, we don’t see

00:25:15.841 --> 00:25:16.841
them as adversaries, we might view them a
children.

00:25:16.841 --> 00:25:17.841
None of this is accurate and none of this
is moral.

00:25:17.841 --> 00:25:18.841
And that’s a third problem with stereotypes.

00:25:18.841 --> 00:25:19.841
The final problem with stereotypes is a moral
one.

00:25:19.841 --> 00:25:22.840
Even if stereotypes are perfectly accurate,
even if they’re accurate summaries of the

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.870
statistics of a group, there are many cases
where we believe that it’s morally wrong

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.690
to judge somebody based on their group membership.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:42.400
We should judge them as individuals.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.340
For all of these reasons, and maybe mostly
for the last one, there’s an interesting

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:50.760
tension in how we think about other groups.

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:56.780
On the one hand, we want to be consciously
egalitarian, consciously non-racist, consciously

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:02.010
thinking of individuals as individuals and
not letting stereotypes, particularly ugly

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.930
stereotypes affect our judgments.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:07.960
And there’s some evidence that we succeed
at this.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.600
You look at the statistics, for instance,
what you see in this graph, is there are a

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:17.240
portion of Americans who say they would vote
for a qualified African-American to be President.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.420
And what you could see is, at a certain point
by the mid-nineties, just about everybody

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.660
says, that they would.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.620
And the election of Barrack Obama shows that
this wasn’t just people lying when asked

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:33.910
questions, it really reflects an honest to
god consciously egalitarian viewpoint.

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:37.510
On the other hand, we also have an unconscious
system.

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:44.530
And an unconscious system is more statistics
driven, more biased and less sensitive to

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.170
moral concerns.

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:52.730
So you get a tension between the conscious
egalitarian system and the unconscious system,

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.500
which is often driven by bias.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:05.419
So we think the right thing to do is to judge
individuals, not on the basis of the groups

00:27:05.419 --> 00:27:11.600
that they belong to, but as individuals, as
individuals in their own right.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.110
And is this something that we consciously
endorse?

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:19.679
Most people today or many people today in
our culture are consciously egalitarian.

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:22.850
We want to avoid stereotypes, particularly
ugly pernicious stereotypes.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:30.500
We want to judge people based on their own
traits, not the groups that they belong to

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.970
and this shows up when you ask people.

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:40.510
So for instance, what you see in this graph
is a portion of Americans who say they would

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.781
vote for a qualified African-American to be
President.

00:27:43.781 --> 00:27:44.781
And what you see is, by the mid-90’s is
just about everybody.

00:27:44.781 --> 00:27:45.781
An election of a Barrack Obama as President
suggests that this really does capture an

00:27:45.781 --> 00:27:46.781
honestly egalitarian perspective on the part
of people.

00:27:46.781 --> 00:27:47.781
They’re not just lying when asked questions.

00:27:47.781 --> 00:27:48.781
Or consider these data; this is the proportion
of Americans, white Americans who would endorse

00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:49.781
some ugly stereotypes about blacks.

00:27:49.781 --> 00:27:50.781
And what you can see is, by the year 2000,
they are approaching zero.

00:27:50.781 --> 00:27:51.781
And so, this paints a picture of the conscious
mind as non-prejudice, as egalitarian.

00:27:51.781 --> 00:27:52.781
But what’s interesting, and perhaps troubling,
is that there’s more to our minds than the

00:27:52.781 --> 00:27:53.781
conscious mind.

00:27:53.781 --> 00:27:54.781
We also have an unconscious system that also
thinks in terms of categories, that also thinks

00:27:54.781 --> 00:27:55.781
in terms of stereotypes.

00:27:55.781 --> 00:27:56.781
This conscious, this unconscious system is
data-driven, is however prone to tremendous

00:27:56.781 --> 00:27:57.781
bias and it is a lot less sensitive to our
moral concerns than the conscious system.

00:27:57.781 --> 00:27:58.781
So how do we know this sort of unconscious
system exists?

00:27:58.781 --> 00:27:59.781
Here we draw upon some very clever studies
by social psychologists.

00:27:59.781 --> 00:28:00.781
So for instance, in one study, subjects will
be in front of a computer screen and they’d

00:28:00.781 --> 00:28:01.781
be doing some unrelated task and what they
wouldn’t know is that faster than they could

00:28:01.781 --> 00:28:02.781
consciously process, faces were being flashed
on the screen.

00:28:02.781 --> 00:28:03.781
These were either white male faces or black
male faces.

00:28:03.781 --> 00:28:04.781
Again, they had no conscious awareness that
they were seeing these faces.

00:28:04.781 --> 00:28:05.781
Then they were asked to complete words.

00:28:05.781 --> 00:28:06.781
So they might a word, H-O-S, and have to complete
it.

00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:07.781
It turns out if they’re seeing white faces;
these subjects who were consciously unbiased

00:28:07.781 --> 00:28:08.781
would tend to fill it out with a word like
“hospital.”

00:28:08.781 --> 00:28:09.781
If they were seeing black faces, they would
tend to fill it out with a word like, “hostile.”

00:28:09.781 --> 00:28:10.781
When they were seeing white faces, they would
tend to complete it as a word like “hospital.”

00:28:10.781 --> 00:28:11.781
When they were seeing black faces, they would
tend to complete it as a word like “hostile.”

00:28:11.781 --> 00:28:12.781
They would tend to associate these black faces
at an unconscious level with malevolent intent;

00:28:12.781 --> 00:28:13.781
with bad things.

00:28:13.781 --> 00:28:14.781
One striking example of unconscious bias involves
being shown these two faces.

00:28:14.781 --> 00:28:15.781
And asked who’s more American?

00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:16.781
Well, at some level, this is a ridiculous
question.

00:28:16.781 --> 00:28:17.781
People would laugh when they hear it.

00:28:17.781 --> 00:28:18.781
Barrack Obama’s more American because he’s
like American.

00:28:18.781 --> 00:28:19.781
Tony Blair is British.

00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:20.781
But unconsciously, you can ask the same question,
you could see how quickly it takes to associate

00:28:20.781 --> 00:28:21.781
these faces with words like, “American”
or “not American.”

00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:22.781
And it turns out, based on this sort of implicate
unconscious test, people are often more willing

00:28:22.781 --> 00:28:23.781
and quicker to associate the face of Tony
Blair as American than the face of Barrack

00:28:23.781 --> 00:28:24.781
Obama, of course, because Tony Blair has a
white face and Barrack Obama has a dark face.

00:28:24.781 --> 00:28:25.781
Now, one response to these sorts of studies,
one perfectly legitimate response I think

00:28:25.781 --> 00:28:26.781
is say, who cares.

00:28:26.781 --> 00:28:27.781
Consciously, we’re egalitarian, consciously
we’re non-prejudice, we have these weird,

00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:28.781
quirky unconscious biases that drive our behavior
when pressing buttons and responding very

00:28:28.781 --> 00:28:29.781
fast.

00:28:29.781 --> 00:28:30.781
What difference does it make?

00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:31.781
But there’s evidence it does make a difference.

00:28:31.781 --> 00:28:32.781
There’s evidence that these unconscious
biases play a role in things that matter very

00:28:32.781 --> 00:28:33.781
much in the real world.

00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:34.781
So consider some studies by Jack Dovidio and
his colleagues.

00:28:34.781 --> 00:28:35.781
They first did this study in 1989, and what
it involved is, you give people resumes of

00:28:35.781 --> 00:28:36.781
candidates and these resumes have pictures.

00:28:36.781 --> 00:28:39.870
And what the subjects and experiment don’t
know is they were always given the same resume,

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:43.610
but half of them got it with a white person,
half of them a black person.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.620
And then they were asked, how strongly would
you recommend this person for a job?

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:53.150
Now, if these candidates had strong qualifications,
they both would be recommended.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:58.710
In fact, perhaps the black is a bit more likely
to be recommended than the white one.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:04.510
But when they had moderate qualifications,
when it’s a judgment call, the white candidate

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:08.980
was statistically more like to be recommended
for a job than the black candidate.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.120
Not because these people said, I’m a racist,
I’m going to do it this way, but rather

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.620
they are swayed by this factor that they might
not have been conscious of.

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.049
As I said, this was done in 1989.

00:29:19.049 --> 00:29:20.360
But they did the same study in 1999 and got
the same result.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:22.090
And they did the same study in 2005, and got
the same result.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.090
Here’s a second sort of study suggesting
these racial attitudes really matter.

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:24.090
It was a shooting simulation where subjects
are given a gun and they have to decide when

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.090
to shoot when they see somebody reaching for
something.

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:26.090
Half the time they’re seeing a black person,
half the time they’re seeing a white person.

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:27.090
Sometimes a person has a gun in their hand,
sometimes a wallet or their keys.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.090
Turns out, these subjects again, non-racist,
non-biased, at least consciously, were quicker

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.090
to shoot the black person than the white person.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:30.090
And there’s some evidence using law enforcement
officers that they’re prone to the same

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.090
bias.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:32.090
Not… again, not because they’re consciously
racist, but because a split second decision

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:33.090
exploits parts of the mind that are unconscious,
that are not under your volition or control.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:34.090
The final example I’ll give you for why
these unconscious racial biases might really

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:35.090
matter is a study by Jennifer Eberhart and
her colleagues.

00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:36.090
They find that once you factor all other considerations,
and this is for death penalty cases, considerations

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.090
like prior records of crimes, the brutality
of the crime and so on, you are far more likely

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:38.090
to be executed if you look like the man on
the right than the man on the left.

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:39.090
The darker your skin, the more likely a jury
is to recommend that you get the death penalty.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.090
And this is a case where one’s unconscious
biases obviously make a big difference.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:41.090
So, we’re at war with ourselves.

00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:42.090
We have on the one hand these conscious beliefs
about how we think we should think, how we

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.090
think we should behave.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.090
On the other hand, we have this unconscious
system that makes all these sorts of decisions

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:45.090
and affects us in ways that we might not know
about, we might not be aware of.

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:46.520
The good news is we’re also smart.

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:54.100
And part of being smart means that we can
structure our world so that we can make it

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.550
that unconscious biases matter less.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:58.282
If we want them to matter less, we can organize
things so that they do matter less.

00:29:58.282 --> 00:30:02.870
One example of this, to give you an example
of this, I’ll turn not to race, but to gender.

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:08.720
Not too long ago, women were deeply underrepresented
in symphony orchestras.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.950
And the reason for this, it was argued is
because they don’t play as well.

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:17.309
They simply, in a fair and biased fashion
they’d been judged and they just don’t

00:30:17.309 --> 00:30:19.380
sound as good.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:25.010
But in part, based on these sorts of discoveries,
symphony orchestras began to hold blind auditions.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:29.201
What they would do is they would have the
person play behind a screen so that the person

00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:34.210
listen… so that the judges won’t know
if they are listening to a man or to a woman.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:39.920
Once this was put into place, the representation
of women in symphony orchestras shot up.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.360
It wasn’t that originally these were just
sexist, to say, I don’t like women; I’m

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.960
going to count against them.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:51.660
Rather, these were perhaps good, non-sexist
people, who couldn’t help hearing the woman

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.820
differently from the man.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:54.820
And so when you adjust environment, it allows
their… them to apply a fair standard, a

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.820
sort of standard that they would want to apply.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:00.000
And I like this example because it shows how
first, social psychology and psychology in

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.390
general can shape policy in a good way.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:07.510
But second, it shows how we’re smart enough
to manipulate the world so that our better

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.390
selves get to make the decisions.

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.820
So that if we think of parts of ourselves
as irrational or biased or irresponsible,

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.090
we can orchestrate things, so to speak, so
that our better selves win out.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:17.680
The third case study I want to talk about
is sex.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:24.360
And when it comes to sex, considerations of
evolution become incredibly relevant.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:30.200
I think the question of how we evolve and
the question of how our minds are now shaped

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.169
in response to evolution pressure is something
that pertains to all of psychology.

00:31:34.169 --> 00:31:38.080
It pertains to, certainly, for how we think
about human groups, certainly for compassion

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.100
and morality, and all sorts of other topics
I haven’t discussed, like perception and

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.970
language and memory.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:48.970
But it’s screamingly obvious in the domain
of sex.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:59.049
In fact, as soon as you start thinking about
our bodies and our brains, you’re faced

00:31:59.049 --> 00:32:00.049
with a puzzle.

00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:04.270
And it’s the sort of a puzzle that can only
be resolved in terms of evolution.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.590
And here’s what the puzzle is.

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:08.890
What’s the difference between males and
females?

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:13.510
Well, there’s a general answer to this that
doesn’t pertain to any particular species

00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:16.100
that goes across every creature on earth.

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.360
The males are the ones with the small sex
cells.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:25.450
To be a male is to have a sperm, which contains
genetic material, and that’s basically it.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:28.180
The females have the large sex cells.

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:35.270
The female sex cell, the egg, also contains
genetic material but it contains a cover,

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:41.560
it contains food, it contains all the apparatus
needed to get an organism growing.

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.900
So here’s the puzzle.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:48.490
You look around most animals, not all animals,
but most animals.

00:32:48.490 --> 00:32:53.230
And the male is bigger and more aggressive.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:59.669
So why would the animal with the smaller sex
cell tend to grow up to be the bigger animal.

00:32:59.669 --> 00:33:05.770
And this has been a mystery for a very long
time until an evolutionary biologist named

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:07.510
Robert Trivers, solved it.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:13.890
And he solved it by making reference to the
idea of parental investment.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:18.230
For Trivers…

00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:23.299
Trivers defines parental investment as any
investment by the parent in an individual

00:33:23.299 --> 00:33:28.530
offspring that increases the offspring’s
chances of surviving at the cost of the parent’s

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.789
ability to invest in other offspring.

00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:44.630
So given that the organism typically, though
not always, grows inside the female, this

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.540
leads to a difference in parental investment.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:57.400
A male can ejaculate and then some short periods
of time ejaculate again and again and again,

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.440
each time, theory at least producing a new
offspring.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:03.720
For a female, once she’s pregnant, that’s
it.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.000
That’s it for months, is it for years.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.289
She can’t have another child while she’s
pregnant.

00:34:10.289 --> 00:34:13.219
Often when she’s breastfeeding, lactating,
she can’t have another child.

00:34:13.219 --> 00:34:16.780
So what this means in practical terms is that
children are more valuable for females than

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:23.159
for males in the sense of children are…
in the sense that females can have fewer children

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:24.159
than males.

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:30.499
What this means is, typically males have less
of a parental investment than females.

00:34:30.499 --> 00:34:35.659
What follows from this, from an economic point
of view, is that males compete with one another

00:34:35.659 --> 00:34:37.779
for access to females.

00:34:37.779 --> 00:34:44.129
Both males and females want offspring, that’s
the genetic imperative, but males can be more

00:34:44.129 --> 00:34:48.109
into number while females can be more into
quality.

00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:50.029
This leads to competition between males.

00:34:50.029 --> 00:34:53.299
And the competition is of two different sorts.

00:34:53.299 --> 00:35:00.270
There’s competition male against male, which
leads to the evolution of aggressive trades.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:04.930
It even leads to the evolution of some species
with special organs, like the giant horns

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:10.710
of some animals that exist for males and not
females because they’ve evolved according

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:20.779
to this reproductive logic based on the lower
parental investment.

00:35:20.779 --> 00:35:26.140
It also leads males to evolve certain traits
to attract the attention of females.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:34.029
Females are the scarce resource here.

00:35:34.029 --> 00:35:38.299
And so males compete with one another to attract
females.

00:35:38.299 --> 00:35:45.079
The most striking biological example of this
is the elaborate, glorious plumage of the

00:35:45.079 --> 00:35:46.079
peacock.

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:49.859
There’s a carton I enjoy here because the
peahens are saying to the peacock, “Cut

00:35:49.859 --> 00:35:51.920
the crap and show us your willy.”

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.130
Which I like because it sounds sort of British,
but I also like because it nicely captures

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.721
the evolutionary logic behind what all of
this is for.

00:35:58.721 --> 00:35:59.721
So that’s the sort of evolutionary biology
101 when it comes to sex.

00:35:59.721 --> 00:36:00.721
What does this have to do with humans?

00:36:00.721 --> 00:36:01.721
Well, we see the same sort of differences,
the same sort of psychological consequences

00:36:01.721 --> 00:36:02.721
of this asymmetry in parental investment in
human males and human females.

00:36:02.721 --> 00:36:03.721
Human males are larger than human females.

00:36:03.721 --> 00:36:04.721
Not every human male is larger than every
human female, but on an average, human males

00:36:04.721 --> 00:36:05.721
are quite a bit larger.

00:36:05.721 --> 00:36:06.721
Or, many humans, for instance, human males
are over six feet tall.

00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:07.721
There are very few human females over six
feet tall.

00:36:07.721 --> 00:36:08.721
Human males are far more violent than human
females.

00:36:08.721 --> 00:36:09.721
A lot of this has to do with testosterone,
but in just about every way you measure physical

00:36:09.721 --> 00:36:10.721
violence; assault, homicide, rape, and so
on, males are by far the major perpetrators.

00:36:10.721 --> 00:36:11.721
Finally, you get to relative choosiness.

00:36:11.721 --> 00:36:12.721
Females are, as a rule, more choosy when it
comes to short-term sexual partners than males.

00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:13.721
And this shows up in a couple of ways, it
shows up in prostitution.

00:36:13.721 --> 00:36:17.029
So, prostitution is a huge industry in the
world.

00:36:17.029 --> 00:36:20.681
And with very few exceptions, prostitutes
cater to male customers.

00:36:20.681 --> 00:36:23.109
Female prostitutes cater to male customers
and male prostitutes cater to gay male customers.

00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:24.109
Then there’s pornography.

00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:28.190
Now, pornography may appeal to different sexes,
some people have argued that romance novels

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:31.700
are sort of the equivalent to pornography
for women.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:37.549
But what appeals to men is often sort of images
of sexually receptive women.

00:36:37.549 --> 00:36:42.039
This isn’t the same as sort of a one-night
stand, but is a psychologically vicarious

00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:46.880
one-night stand, where this image is enough
to lead to arousal.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:50.420
The only thing interesting I have to say about
this is a recent study that suggests this

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.869
is not exclusively a human vice.

00:36:53.869 --> 00:36:58.250
So recent study involved showing pornography
to Rhesus Macaques, these are a type of monkey.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:02.950
What they did was… the question was, would
these monkeys pay to see porn?

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:06.710
And so you didn’t have a financial system
for these monkeys, so they set up a nice apparatus

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:10.029
where the monkey… at a certain point, the
monkey had a choice, he could either stare

00:37:10.029 --> 00:37:15.720
at a picture or turn and sip sweet orange
juice; monkeys love orange juice.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:19.719
So the question is, what sort of pictures
would they pay, would they give up on this

00:37:19.719 --> 00:37:21.880
orange juice in order to see?

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.250
And there were two sorts of pictures that
they would pay to see.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:30.490
They would pay to see the behinds of female
Rhesus monkeys and they would pay to see the

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:34.210
faces of high status male Rhesus monkeys.

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:39.750
Sort of like the equivalent of a Playboy Magazine
and People Magazine, suggesting that two of

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:48.549
the major human vices, pornography and celebrity
worship are in fact not uniquely human.

00:37:48.549 --> 00:37:56.950
Now, you can go on about the differences between
males and females in terms of sexual interest

00:37:56.950 --> 00:38:02.460
and sexual hues and so on, but I want to focus
for the rest of this case study on certain

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.200
things we have in common, which I think are
quite interesting.

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:08.930
And one thing that we have in common is an
attraction to what we would call beauty.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:14.019
Certain things are beautiful, certain things
appeal to us universally.

00:38:14.019 --> 00:38:18.940
Some studies find in the first tenth of a
second after looking at a face, you have computed

00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:19.940
how beautiful it is.

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:20.940
Your judgment as to how beautiful it is.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:21.940
Now, one immediate response is, well beauty
is in the eye of the beholder.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.940
We different tremendously in what we find
beautiful.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.970
Cultures differ tremendously, different times,
different places in what counts as beautiful,

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:26.680
what counts as sexually attractive.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:32.349
And that is entirely true; there are interesting
and powerful differences.

00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:34.660
But at the same time, there are also universals.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:39.290
There are certain things that people everywhere
find attractive.

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:44.289
And we can use evolutionary theory to makes
sense of the sort of things people find as

00:38:44.289 --> 00:38:45.289
beautiful.

00:38:45.289 --> 00:38:50.420
So to some extent, beauty equates to youth.

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:54.320
Hues like round eyes, full lips, smooth tight
skin.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.829
Hues like round eyes, full lips, tight skin
are considered beautiful most likely because

00:38:56.829 --> 00:39:01.800
they’re **** that the person is young, is
able to have kids, has many years ahead of

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.890
them and so on.

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:13.180
We are drawn to features like absence of deformities,
clear eyes, unblemished skin, intact teeth,

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.750
and average faces.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.029
And you might think, average faces?

00:39:17.029 --> 00:39:20.239
That’s strange thing to put in beautiful,
as a category of beautiful.

00:39:20.239 --> 00:39:22.720
But it turns out average faces actually look
really good.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.720
And there’s different hues as to why that’s
so, but one plausible explanation is, if you’re

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.720
face differs from everybody else’s face;
it’s most likely due to something which

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.720
isn’t good.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.720
There’s more bad things that can happen
to your face than good things.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:27.720
And so something that deviates from the average
is often something which isn’t normally

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:28.720
viewed as attractive.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.319
So what an average face does is it gets rid
of all of the things that are unusual and

00:39:31.319 --> 00:39:32.950
people tend to find it quite attractive.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:33.950
Now, an immediate response to all of this,
to say well, typically psychologists get blamed

00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:34.950
for studying… do all their research based
on university freshman, in fact, freshmen

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:35.950
taking intro psych courses.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:36.950
How general is this?

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:37.950
How much does it apply?

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:38.950
But there’s a lot of evidence that these
attractiveness features are human universals,

00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:39.950
there are studies that are done across cultures.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:40.950
And most interesting to me at least, is studies
done with babies.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:41.950
So it turns out, it’s not just you and me
that can tell one face from another, it’s

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:42.950
actually babies.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:43.950
Now one accusation that always comes up in
these situations is, who did you get this

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:44.950
data from?

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:45.950
And in fact, psychologists are often guilty
of collecting data from 24 university freshmen

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.390
and then saying that these conclusions apply
to all of humanity, but not in this case.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:54.229
In this case, studies of human attractiveness
have been done cross-culturally and you get

00:39:54.229 --> 00:39:56.849
pretty much the same findings wherever you
go.

00:39:56.849 --> 00:40:03.059
Again, there’s some interesting differences,
but these universals seem to always be attractive.

00:40:03.059 --> 00:40:08.640
The work that’s most exciting to me along
these lines is actually done with babies.

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:13.369
So adults can rank faces as attractive or
unattractive, but you can also see what babies

00:40:13.369 --> 00:40:15.470
think about faces.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:22.019
And it turns out, using babies looking time
as a measure for what they like to see.

00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:24.319
So how long will they look at a face?

00:40:24.319 --> 00:40:30.140
It turns out that babies preference for attractive
faces match pretty well adults preferences

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.700
for attractive faces.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:35.930
So for instance, in some wonderful work by
Languar[ph] and her colleagues, she would

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:40.921
show different degrees of averageness across
faces, composites of more and more people.

00:40:40.921 --> 00:40:41.921
And when a face was very average, a composite
of as many people as she can get, babies prefer

00:40:41.921 --> 00:40:42.921
to look at it over less average faces.

00:40:42.921 --> 00:40:43.921
Matching how adults judge faces and suggesting
that some gut feeling about what makes an

00:40:43.921 --> 00:40:44.921
attractive face or an unattractive face isn’t
just due to culture, it’s not just due to

00:40:44.921 --> 00:40:45.921
learning, but it’s part of our hardwiring.

00:40:45.921 --> 00:40:46.921
It’s part of an evolved system, part perhaps
of the sort of Swiss Army knife we start off

00:40:46.921 --> 00:40:47.921
with for dealing with people and making judgments
as we go through the world.

00:40:47.921 --> 00:40:48.921
So average faces are attractive.

00:40:48.921 --> 00:40:49.921
You can see this in these faces are not the
faces of real people, these faces are computer

00:40:49.921 --> 00:40:51.289
composites of multiple people and they are
not bad looking, but you can get better than

00:40:51.289 --> 00:40:54.269
average for both males and females.

00:40:54.269 --> 00:40:59.499
For females, many people will judge a face
better than average if it’s feminized.

00:40:59.499 --> 00:41:05.039
If you take the features that define a face
as female and you exaggerate them, as in the

00:41:05.039 --> 00:41:10.440
picture on the right, it tends to look a little
bit better than your average female face.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:12.259
For men, you could do the same thing.

00:41:12.259 --> 00:41:15.369
And this is the wonderful work of Victor Johnston,
where he found that you could take faces and

00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:19.940
take your average male face and turn it into
testosterone man, which is the face that you’re

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.469
looking at on the left.

00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:27.660
It turns out that women’s responses to testosterone
man differ according to whether or not they’re

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.660
ovulating.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:34.890
So if a woman is ovulating, she is more likely
to find this manliest of man face attractive,

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:41.430
while if not, she tends to go back to just
find average man more attractive.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:47.049
It does suggest that our sexual psychologies
connect with our reproductive preferences

00:41:47.049 --> 00:41:49.400
in all sorts of interesting ways.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:58.460
Now, I’ve talked so far about attractiveness
from a very narrow evolutionary perspective.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:06.739
Looking just at those features, we can see
in how that affects your judgment of how attractive

00:42:06.739 --> 00:42:12.109
somebody is, but there’s a lot more to looking
good than how you look.

00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:20.670
There’s a lot of really nice demonstrations
that what you think of a person, what you

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:26.729
believe about a person affects how attractive
you think he or she is.

00:42:26.729 --> 00:42:34.170
So, these are two faces we’ve used in our
experiments, these are judged by people in

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:40.130
the absence of other information as a pretty
attractive man or a pretty attractive woman,

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:43.769
but it turns out, how attractive you find
them, depends on your beliefs.

00:42:43.769 --> 00:42:49.780
You probably think the person on the left
is male and on the right is female.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:59.039
If you find that this belief is mistaken,
that the one on the left could be female or

00:42:59.039 --> 00:43:07.309
the one on the right is female, it will change
how attractive you find them, it will change

00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:10.019
your sexual response to them.

00:43:10.019 --> 00:43:18.119
It’ll change your sexual and romantic response
if you discovered that they’re much younger

00:43:18.119 --> 00:43:20.559
or much older than they look.

00:43:20.559 --> 00:43:26.849
It will change your response to them if you
were to discover that you were actually looking

00:43:26.849 --> 00:43:31.119
at a disguised version of your brother or
your sister or your child.

00:43:31.119 --> 00:43:34.550
That’ll switch your sexual desire right
off if you believe that this is kin because

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:39.990
we have a hardwired system that says, you
could think of you kin as extremely attractive,

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:41.519
but you won’t tend to be sexually aroused
by them.

00:43:41.519 --> 00:43:44.440
More generally, we’re strongly affected
in our judgment of how attractive a face is

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.489
by who we think that face belongs to.

00:43:46.489 --> 00:43:51.059
This points to a general fact about the psychology
of sex and love, which was pointed out by

00:43:51.059 --> 00:43:54.170
George Bernard Shaw, who defined love as a
gross exaggeration of the difference between

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.170
one person and everybody else.

00:43:55.170 --> 00:44:04.760
And I want to give as an illustration to this
a somewhat unusual case, but I think it makes…

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.999
I find it persuasive.

00:44:05.999 --> 00:44:09.589
It’s a story of a woman with Capgras Syndrome.

00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:11.959
Capgras Syndrome is a very rare neurological
disorder where you develop a very specific

00:44:11.959 --> 00:44:12.959
delusion.

00:44:12.959 --> 00:44:16.210
You develop the delusion that the people you
love most in the world have been replaced

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:17.210
by exact duplicates.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.210
Now, often the results of Capgras Syndrome
are horrible.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:19.549
People have murdered their husbands, their
wives, their children, their parents believing

00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:22.529
that they were imposters, they were robots
or they were spies or they were aliens.

00:44:22.529 --> 00:44:26.670
But in at least one case, the result of Capgras
Syndrome turned out to be quite nice.

00:44:26.670 --> 00:44:30.390
This was a case reported in 1931.

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:32.107
And according to the description of the case
report, in 1931, researches described a woman

00:44:32.107 --> 00:44:34.979
of Capgras Syndrome who complained about her
poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover.

00:44:34.979 --> 00:44:42.979
She was happy to report that she had discovered
that he possessed a double who was rich, virile,

00:44:42.979 --> 00:44:43.979
handsome and aristocratic.

00:44:43.979 --> 00:44:46.739
Of course, it was the same guy, but she was
seeing him through different eyes.

00:44:46.739 --> 00:44:51.480
It’s reminiscent of a story by Isaac Busheve[ph]
Singer about a man who lives in a small town

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:56.279
and he is bored of everybody in the town,
he’s particularly bored of his wife, who

00:44:56.279 --> 00:44:58.700
he’s seen for so long.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:05.959
He’s so sick of her, he decided he’s going
to leave and never come back.

00:45:05.959 --> 00:45:07.910
Find new and exciting people.

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:09.779
So he leaves the town.

00:45:09.779 --> 00:45:13.299
But this being an Isaac Busheve Singer story,
something incredible happens.

00:45:13.299 --> 00:45:17.049
He gets turned around and ends up marching
back into his old town, but he’s confused.

00:45:17.049 --> 00:45:19.089
He thinks he’s going to an entirely different
place with all these different people who

00:45:19.089 --> 00:45:22.770
just so happen to look and behave just like
the people he had left.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:28.539
He sees his wife, he thinks it’s a woman
who looks so much like his wife he had left

00:45:28.539 --> 00:45:32.499
and falls passionately in love with this new
person.

00:45:32.499 --> 00:45:36.489
I’ll say one last thing about our responses
to people’s faces.

00:45:36.489 --> 00:45:39.559
It turns out that how attractive you find
a face is critically dependent on how much

00:45:39.559 --> 00:45:40.559
you like the person.

00:45:40.559 --> 00:45:41.700
The more you like somebody, they better they
look to you.

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.079
This is why spouses in happy marriages will
honestly find their husband or wife far more

00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:45.079
attractive than anyone else finds them.

00:45:45.079 --> 00:45:46.079
And this is true more generally.

00:45:46.079 --> 00:45:47.079
In a classic study, David Bus tested people
from 37 different cultures around the world

00:45:47.079 --> 00:45:48.079
and asked who is your perfect mate?

00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:49.230
He was largely looking for sex differences
in these studies, and he found them.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:52.273
He found all sorts of differences in what
men were looking and what women were looking

00:45:52.273 --> 00:45:53.273
for.

00:45:53.273 --> 00:45:57.430
But he also found one similarity, one thing…
on way in which men and women were alike.

00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:59.931
And this is that, for both, the number one
quality people were looking for in a mate

00:45:59.931 --> 00:46:00.931
was kindness.

00:46:00.931 --> 00:46:01.931
All of this in the domain of sex supports
a moral from Shakespeare, which is that love…

00:46:01.931 --> 00:46:02.931
which is, as Shakespeare put it, “Love looks
not with the eyes, but with the mind.”

00:46:02.931 --> 00:46:04.490
What I’ve done is I’ve very briefly talked
about three case studies in the domain of

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.490
psychology.

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:06.490
I talked about compassion.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.640
I talked about racism and I’ve talked about
sex.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.390
In the course of this, I tried to illustrate
certain themes in the study of psychology

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:13.390
in general.

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:14.390
And in fact, I started by listing six domains
of psychology.

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:17.010
And I want to go back and just very briefly
point out how these domains connect to what

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:18.010
we just talked about.

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:19.010
Neuroscience, I started by talking about the
baby’s brain and gave that as a starting

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:20.210
point for the question of the development
of compassion, the development of these other

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:21.210
traits.

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:22.210
But every domain of psychology, every aspect
of mental life is caused by our physical brains.

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:23.210
And in fact, in all of these domains I’ve
talked about, compassion and moral psychology

00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:24.210
and more general, race and stereotyping and
thinking about groups, and sex and sexuality,

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:26.849
people have used the methods of neuroscience,
including brain imaging methods like FMRI

00:46:26.849 --> 00:46:31.170
to better understand the processes going on.

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:35.880
To better understand how the mind works in
these domains.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.660
I’ve talked about development and I focused
mostly in development on the first case study

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:39.750
on compassion, but of course there’s a huge
amount of very interesting research on the

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:40.750
development of our understanding of groups
asking the question, for instance, are young

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:41.750
children racist?

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:42.750
Do young children have complicit biases?

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:43.750
And of course in the development of romance
and sexuality, how does the mind of a child

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:47.420
before puberty differ and how much is it like
the mind of an adult after puberty and how

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:48.779
did these differs take place?

00:46:48.779 --> 00:46:49.900
These are extraordinarily interesting developmental
questions.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.769
All three domains connect to social psychology
and cognitive psychology in clear ways.

00:46:51.769 --> 00:46:58.880
They are all questions about social psychology,
they are all questions about dealing with

00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:04.099
other people; how we deal with and make sense
out of other people.

00:47:04.099 --> 00:47:05.420
And they all connect to questions of cognitive
psychology, like the perception of faces,

00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:06.420
the formation of categories, the comprehension
of stories; those are all central parts of

00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:10.420
cognitive psychology and central to understanding
the domains we’ve talked about here.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.920
We’ve talked about evolution, particularly
again, in the case of sexuality.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.019
But of course, the evolutionary psychology
of morality and compassion is a fascinating

00:47:16.019 --> 00:47:18.329
issues connecting it with research done with
other primates, our evolutionary relatives

00:47:18.329 --> 00:47:19.329
like chimpanzees and monkeys.

00:47:19.329 --> 00:47:22.680
Similarly, there’s a lot of exciting work
on extent to which other primates make sense

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.680
of other groups.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.060
There’s work, for instance, done by my colleague,
Rory Santos at Yale, on the extent to which

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:27.960
other non-human primates have races in the
sense that they think of this group as different

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:33.459
than that group and that have implicit biases
that extend to one group and not to the other.

00:47:33.459 --> 00:47:34.459
I’ve said the least about clinical psychology.

00:47:34.459 --> 00:47:35.459
I brought up on case of Capgras Syndrome as
an exotic case of clinical psychology, but

00:47:35.459 --> 00:47:36.459
I haven’t talked about it, and this is a
shame because there is so much that could

00:47:36.459 --> 00:47:37.459
be said.

00:47:37.459 --> 00:47:38.459
Clinical psychology is extraordinarily interesting
and also connects to each of the domains that

00:47:38.459 --> 00:47:39.459
I’ve talked about.

00:47:39.459 --> 00:47:40.459
People are interested in the psychopathology
related to sexuality.

00:47:40.459 --> 00:47:41.459
They’re particularly interested in the psychopathology
in mental illness in the domain of morality

00:47:41.459 --> 00:47:42.459
because this connects to one of the most troubling
and one of the most interesting questions

00:47:42.459 --> 00:47:43.459
in clinical psychology, which concerns the
psychopath.

00:47:43.459 --> 00:47:44.459
There are some of us, apparently, who don’t
have consciences, who don’t feel compassion,

00:47:44.459 --> 00:47:45.459
who will destroy other people’s lives out
of malice or self-interest or simple boredom.

00:47:45.459 --> 00:47:46.459
And the question of where psychopaths come
from, what’s the precise nature of what’s

00:47:46.459 --> 00:47:47.459
going wrong with them.

00:47:47.459 --> 00:47:48.459
Most of all, what can be done about them are
issues of extraordinary interest.

00:47:48.459 --> 00:47:49.459
I want to end on two notes.

00:47:49.459 --> 00:47:50.459
The first is a note of humility.

00:47:50.459 --> 00:47:51.459
I think psychologists and more generally,
neuroscientists and cognitive scientists have

00:47:51.459 --> 00:47:52.459
learned a lot about the mind.

00:47:52.459 --> 00:47:53.459
But we have a huge way to go.

00:47:53.459 --> 00:47:54.459
The most clear thing that we don’t understand
is the problem with consciousness, the problem

00:47:54.459 --> 00:47:55.459
with experience.

00:47:55.459 --> 00:47:56.459
We understand… we have some glimmering of
how physical brain can process information,

00:47:56.459 --> 00:47:57.459
can recognize faces, can make judgments, can
form categories.

00:47:57.459 --> 00:47:58.459
And in fact, we build machines, computers
that are physical machines that can do these

00:47:58.459 --> 00:47:59.459
things.

00:47:59.459 --> 00:48:00.459
There’s no great mystery here.

00:48:00.459 --> 00:48:01.459
But we’re left with what the philosopher,
David Chalmers, has called “the hard problem

00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:02.459
with consciousness.”

00:48:02.459 --> 00:48:03.459
The hard problem of consciousness is how a
physical brain, and it looks like a lump of

00:48:03.459 --> 00:48:04.459
meatloaf, can give rise to pain and pleasure,
give rise to humiliation and lust and meaning

00:48:04.459 --> 00:48:05.459
and purpose.

00:48:05.459 --> 00:48:06.459
How these things can come from a mere physical
objects.

00:48:06.459 --> 00:48:07.459
And we struggle to explain it.

00:48:07.459 --> 00:48:08.459
This is a problem that goes through every
aspect of psychology.

00:48:08.459 --> 00:48:09.459
I’ve said before that I’m a developmental
psychologist.

00:48:09.459 --> 00:48:10.459
I’m fascinated by the minds of children.

00:48:10.459 --> 00:48:11.459
This is my son, Zachary, when he was two-years-old.

00:48:11.459 --> 00:48:12.459
And I think as a developmental psychologist
there’s some things I understand about Zachary.

00:48:12.459 --> 00:48:13.459
I understand his developing knowledge of the
world, his growing grasp of language.

00:48:13.459 --> 00:48:14.459
How he makes sense of objects and people.

00:48:14.459 --> 00:48:15.459
But I don’t understand what it’s like
to be a two-year-old.

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:16.459
I don’t understand his experience, his phenomenal
sense of himself.

00:48:16.459 --> 00:48:17.459
And I don’t think any psychologist understands
that.

00:48:17.459 --> 00:48:18.459
I think we’re at a loss when it comes to
this very, very hard problem.

00:48:18.459 --> 00:48:19.459
But the second theme is optimism.

00:48:19.459 --> 00:48:20.459
I think we’ve made huge progress in understanding
the mind.

00:48:20.459 --> 00:48:21.459
I think over the last many years, psychologists
along with neuroscientists and cognitive scientists

00:48:21.459 --> 00:48:22.459
and philosophers have learned a huge amount
about how the mind works and I think there

00:48:22.459 --> 00:48:23.459
is no reason to expect this progress to stop.

00:48:23.459 --> 00:48:24.459
I think that in the end, the most important
and intimate aspects of ourselves, our understanding

00:48:24.459 --> 00:48:25.459
of other people, our conception of human groups,
our conception of ourselves, the decision

00:48:25.459 --> 00:48:26.459
we make, the emotions we feel, our sense of
right and wrong, how we know what’s right

00:48:26.459 --> 00:48:27.459
and know what’s wrong.

00:48:27.459 --> 00:48:28.459
And the forces that make us act upon is the
most interesting and intimate aspects of ourselves

00:48:28.459 --> 00:48:29.459
will be explained through the program of scientific
psychology.

00:48:29.459 --> 00:48:30.459
They will be explained through constructing
scientific hypotheses and testing them.

00:48:30.459 --> 00:48:31.459
They will be understood through neuroscience.

00:48:31.459 --> 00:48:32.459
They’ll be understood through computation.

00:48:32.459 --> 00:48:33.459
They’ll be understood through evolution.

00:48:33.459 --> 00:48:34.459
And together, we will come to some real insights
about how the mind works.

00:48:34.459 --> 00:48:35.459
Now, some people might find this a scary prospect.

00:48:35.459 --> 00:48:36.459
I know that there are some people that worry
that a scientific perspective of the mind

00:48:36.459 --> 00:48:37.459
takes away from us somehow.

00:48:37.459 --> 00:48:38.459
It diminishes us.

00:48:38.459 --> 00:48:39.459
It makes us less than what we are.

00:48:39.459 --> 00:48:40.459
I don’t agree.

00:48:40.459 --> 00:48:41.459
I have the opposite reaction, which is that
as the more you understand the mind from a

00:48:41.459 --> 00:48:42.459
serious scientific point of view; the more
you come to appreciate its complexity, its

00:48:42.459 --> 00:48:43.459
uniqueness and its beauty.

00:48:43.459 --> 00:48:43.461
Thank you.
