00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:08.940
SPEAKER: So today,
Dr. Chris Brown-- I

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.840
think, as you all know, he's
one of Australia's best-known

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.700
veterinarians.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.560
You have seen him, possibly,
as a co-host on the project,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.820
or perhaps co-hosting
on "The Living Room,"

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.130
or "I'm a Celebrity...

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.754
Get Me Out of Here!" as well as
the recent show he was part of,

00:00:23.754 --> 00:00:24.770
which is good fun.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.790
And "Bondi Vet," I
think, is the one

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.810
that we all know him mostly for.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.210
And today, he's
gonna be chatting

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.740
about some work he's been
doing across Australia,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.574
as part of a Keep Australia
Pet Friendly campaign.

00:00:35.574 --> 00:00:37.490
It's an important topic
for us here at Google.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.850
Just last week, we had our own
Bring Your Dog to Work Day.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.760
And we had something
about 40 or 50 dogs

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.370
in the office,
which was good fun.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.970
And a nice class photo--
bit of a selfie as well,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.860
with one of the dogs,
which was good fun.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.570
But actually, what
people might not know

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.020
is that in Google's
code of conduct,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.320
we actually list Google
as a dog company.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.730
It actually says,
Google's affection

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.310
for our canine friends
is an integral facet

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.580
of our corporate culture.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.226
We like cats, but
we're a dog company.

00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:11.060
So as a general rule, we feel
cats visiting our offices

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.180
will be fairly stressed out.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.760
So yes.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.870
Unfortunately, no cats
in the office just yet.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.730
Dogs, we're working on.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:20.480
But Dr. Chris Brown
is here to share

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.730
a bit of what he's been doing
to try to make Australia

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.830
a place where pets can roam
free and be part of what we're

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.250
doing, and the benefits of,
you know, why having pets

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.030
is so great, and how the
government, workplaces,

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.790
and all of us can help make
Australia more pet-friendly.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.440
There's some Q&amp;A at the end, so
feel free to raise your hand.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.773
We'll bring a microphone around.

00:01:37.773 --> 00:01:39.850
There's a [INAUDIBLE]
as well, which people

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.250
have submitted questions to.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.200
Without further ado, we'll play
a quick video to introduce him.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.540
And then, please welcome to
the stage Dr. Chris Brown.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.040
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.000
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.560
-All research
suggests that our pets

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.640
are good to both our physical
and also our emotional health.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.100
So the news that our pet
populations are declining

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.629
is obviously a concern.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.045
The big surprise here is that
despite our human population

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:25.990
in Australia really increasing
over the last few decades,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.460
our pets have done the opposite.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.370
See, it's 2001.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.101
Our cat numbers have
declined by 15.5%,

00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:33.740
whereas dog numbers
peaked in 2009,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.430
and since then,
have also dropped.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.809
So I'm here in Bondi
today to release

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:43.600
the result of the pet
positive score, which

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.870
is all about getting a
snapshot into our pet society,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.380
seeing exactly how
people perceive

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.910
our pet ownership
in the country,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.200
and how friendly our cities are.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.639
So the score as to how
pet-friendly a city is,

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.680
is worked out through a
number of different ways.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.110
We've surveyed over 3,000
people to see their attitudes

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.540
towards the city they live in.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.370
And we're really looking at how
inclusive the society they live

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.314
in is, actually, towards pets--
so how many pet-friendly parks

00:03:08.314 --> 00:03:10.230
there are, pet-friendly
beaches, and, I guess,

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.030
how easy it is to own a pet
in an apartment, and also,

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.620
looking at the
regulations around pets

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.030
from the local council.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:23.100
-Lulu is everything.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.430
Lulu is my life.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.280
She is the best thing to come
home to, because she's always

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.802
happy to see us.

00:03:29.802 --> 00:03:31.260
I think everyone
should have a dog.

00:03:34.022 --> 00:03:36.230
-So there are, at least,
two to three decades or more

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.090
of accumulated
research and evidence

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.810
to show us that pets provide
a whole host of benefits,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.610
whether they're physical,
social, mental, or other types.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.730
For example, we know
that physical activity is

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.130
one way that pets contribute.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.150
Taking the dog for
a walk each day

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.030
is such a great
way to get active.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.000
-And when you're
walking around, you

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.220
meet people that you
normally would walk past,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.065
because we all stop and talk
to each other-- of all ages

00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:01.547
and walks of life.

00:04:01.547 --> 00:04:03.630
-At Mars, we're committed
to making a better world

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.490
for pets, because we know they
make our lives so much better.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.990
And that's why we're
here, launching

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.870
this pet-positive school,
which looks at the nine

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.058
different attributes for
cities that will make them

00:04:15.058 --> 00:04:16.666
pet-friendly--
things like access

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:22.014
to outdoor exercise areas,
pet-friendly legislation,

00:04:22.014 --> 00:04:24.882
and accommodation availability.

00:04:24.882 --> 00:04:26.810
And we've done a
lot of research,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.395
and that research has
identified those attributes,

00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:31.559
but it's also ranked
Australian cities in terms

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:33.080
of their pet-friendliness.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.110
-There's some
surprising news in here,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.992
and for a Sydneysider
like me, there's also

00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:38.200
some rather confronting news.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.790
Because Sydney
hasn't done so well.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.502
It comes in at 15 out of 16.

00:04:42.502 --> 00:04:44.885
So Melbourne scored
top, at number one,

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:48.020
then we have Canberra,
and also the Gold Coast.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.311
So over all, Sydney has a
little bit of thinking to do.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.670
So if there's one wish, it's
that as Australians, we all

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.572
work together to
make sure we stay--

00:05:20.572 --> 00:05:22.530
and hopefully, become
even more-- pet-friendly.

00:05:44.547 --> 00:05:45.130
[END PLAYBACK]

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.910
CHRIS BROWN: All
right, well, thank

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.850
you very much for
having me in here today.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.130
I should, straight
away, apologize

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.340
for missing out last week.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.990
I, like a good Labrador, went
down with an ear infection,

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.510
and, like a good
vet, decided to treat

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.470
myself, which was mildly
successful for, about,

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.960
two or three days, until I
realized that the bugs that

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.110
affect people don't actually
affect animals, and vice versa.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.520
So I had to go to
a human doctor,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.240
reluctantly, and
be treated by him.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.430
He was very good, but each time
he put anything near my ear,

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.570
I compulsorily kicked my
leg out wherever I could,

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.050
just to let him
know how it feels.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.480
But look, I'm here
to talk about how

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.700
we keep Australia pet-friendly.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.890
And obviously, in
that video, there

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.410
were some interesting
statistics around where

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.912
we're at the moment, and
probably a few surprises.

00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:37.620
It's something I'm
very passionate about,

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.320
and I'm passionate about
it for quite a few reasons,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.370
as you're about to hear now.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.660
But before we go on, I want you
to go back just a few hours,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.790
to when you first
woke up this morning.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.150
And just think about
when you first work up.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.240
Probably, like 60% or
70% of the population,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.130
you probably rolled over
and checked your phone,

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.630
and had a look
through social media.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.450
You saw what was
making news, saw

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.240
whose birthday it was today.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.050
You, sort of, caught
up on the world.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.570
And when you did
that-- probably,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.130
while you did
that-- you probably

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.880
scrolled past updates
around pets' birthdays,

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.050
and probably, in the
case of a few of you,

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.550
scrolled past social media
profiles for animals.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.110
Some of them have a lot
more followers than I do,

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.470
which I'm a little bit
resentful of, and a lot more

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.090
followers than, to be honest,
a lot of people in Australia.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.405
So I think there's a-- Jiffpom?

00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:38.540
Do you guys know Jiffpom?

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.080
Very popular-- a
little Pomeranian,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.720
looks like a teddy bear, 2.9
million Instagram followers.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:48.200
There's Tuna-- Tuna the
Dog, whose greatest talent--

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.370
not that I'm bitter-- is
nothing apart from an overbite.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.680
1.9 million followers
for that underbite.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.490
But it's an interesting
observation.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.930
And then, I'm sure, once you
got up and you got out of bed

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.130
and headed off to work on
your bus or on the train,

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:09.030
you're probably bombarded
with ads that featured dogs

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.520
selling everything
from toilet paper

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.910
to laundry cleaner
and laundry detergent.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:18.420
And then, you made your
way into work here,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.040
and you come into a
pet-friendly workplace,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.610
where you see dogs
in the office.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.790
And you hope those
dogs are the hairiest

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.180
and the smelliest members
of the workforce in Google,

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.890
but you're not entirely sure.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:35.316
And over the course
of those few hours,

00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:36.690
you're probably
entitled to think

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:41.740
that perhaps, our world
is dominated by pets,

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.920
and pets have a really
important place.

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.720
And there's a lot of love for
pets out there in Australia.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.966
But as you're about to
hear, dogs like Jiffpom,

00:08:55.966 --> 00:08:58.560
dogs like Tuna, are about to
learn a very important lesson,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.224
that sometimes, the
number of Instagram

00:09:01.224 --> 00:09:03.640
followers you have doesn't
relate to the number of friends

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.300
you have, in real life.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:11.620
Because unfortunately,
our policies as a nation

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.250
don't really show a lot of
love and a lot of friendship

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.205
towards our pets.

00:09:17.205 --> 00:09:18.580
And there's a bit
of a disconnect

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.870
there, because we simply love
animals, but our policies,

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.240
our governments, and the
way we legislate them don't

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.930
show a lot of love in return.

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.330
So I guess that's the
whole crux of what

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.700
I'm keen to talk about today.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.330
The whole idea of
pet-friendliness

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.010
is something you
hear about a lot.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.440
What we're referring to is
touched on in the video.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.920
We're talking, about how
inclusive is our world?

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.715
And how inclusive are our
communities of animals?

00:09:45.715 --> 00:09:47.460
So if you have a
pet, how easy is it

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.820
to go down to the local dog
park, take them off the leash,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.660
and let them run around
in an enclosed space

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.090
and burn off that extra energy?

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:58.560
How easy is it, if you own a dog
or a cat, to rent an apartment?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.750
How easy is it to take your
dog or cat to the local cafe?

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.220
Or if you don't
have a car and need

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.820
to go to the vet, how easy is
it to hop onto a bus or a train

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.650
or get a taxi and go to bed?

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.570
And for a lot of
those questions,

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.840
the answer is, not very.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:19.197
And certainly, in Australia,
when you compare it

00:10:19.197 --> 00:10:21.280
to the rest of the world,
especially when you look

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.886
at North America
and Europe, there

00:10:22.886 --> 00:10:24.260
are some quite
stark differences.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:27.310
I don't know if many of you
have traveled recently and been

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.930
to, say, North America
or to France, to Germany,

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.660
or to the UK.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:38.750
It's amazing how often you
see pets in everyday life.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.280
I was in Italy, three weeks
ago, and sat next to a pug

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.370
on a plane.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:49.440
And he snored, but
he didn't smell.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.190
And he was actually--
to be honest,

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.130
he was quieter than 99% of
the other passengers on board.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.720
So it's only when
you stop and think,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:01.060
and you go, hang on, why
does that happen over there,

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.470
and why don't we have that
here, that you start to think,

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.020
what's going on?

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.570
And I guess the
consequence of it

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:11.010
being, maybe, not
as easy to give pets

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.190
the life that we want them to
lead and that we think they

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:18.070
deserve by being included
in our everyday life--

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:18.575
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:18.575 --> 00:11:19.950
I don't know what
that sound was,

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:23.430
but I'll be cleaning
it up later.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.960
I'm sure.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.830
The consequence of us not being
able to give them the love

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.565
and, I guess, the life we think
they deserve is the fact that--

00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:38.420
or perhaps, our pet populations
are decreasing for that reason.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:40.430
And they're quite
startling numbers--

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:44.250
the fact that our cat numbers
have decreased by 15%,

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.340
and our dog numbers are
starting to fall as well.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.870
So for a nation that prides
itself on being pet lovers--

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:55.860
and we easily refer to our
pets as being our best mates--

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.790
it's quite a stunning discovery,
I think, to actually hear that.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:04.060
So I think I'm very
keen to look at why,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.020
and try to reverse this
trend now, before it

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.130
is too late to turn it around.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.280
So probably, you
might have been told

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.080
to ask here, why
is it such an issue

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.452
if we're not pet-friendly?

00:12:17.452 --> 00:12:18.910
Why is it such an
issue if we don't

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.770
have as many pets in
our everyday lives

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.570
as we have in the past?

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.130
Well, I guess, the
way I look at it

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.980
is that our pets are, kind
of, like the furry friends

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.280
with benefits.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.730
And they do make our lives
better across so many

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.700
different areas, whether it's
just our happiness-- they tend

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.880
to have this unique ability to
show us how we should approach

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.506
life and how we should just let
the worries of the world wash

00:12:47.506 --> 00:12:48.460
over us.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:52.540
If you could live your
days like a dog does,

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.930
with the exception of
licking certain parts,

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.590
it would be a happy day.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.580
You know, their attitude
and their easygoing style

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:05.680
are something that, I think, we
should all take a leaf out of.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.170
But also, our pets
are continually

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:10.760
proven to make us healthier.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.850
And this isn't just wishy-washy
stuff that, you know,

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:17.380
I feel better when
I'm around a dog.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.050
It's actually hard,
scientific fact

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.040
that pets have a
positive influence

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.800
in our health at all ages.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.270
So for kids, as young
as one year of age,

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:33.810
having a pet in the house
results in a reduced

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:39.120
risk ear infections, reduced
reliance on antibiotics,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.890
reduced level of asthma, and
also, reduced level of colds

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:44.390
as well.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:49.450
So that's an amazing
statistic, when you look at it,

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.620
and it's backed up by a
number of different studies.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.640
When you go into
adults, our pets

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.760
have a very dramatic effect
on our cardiovascular health.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.027
So we're generally fitter and
healthier if we own animals.

00:14:03.027 --> 00:14:04.860
They've actually been
proven in some studies

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.470
to-- despite not
wearing activewear,

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.370
they're actually the most
effective personal trainers

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.300
out there.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.130
And I'll get to why
that is, in a second.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.160
But for the
elderly-- personally,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.780
I think the facts
around the elderly

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:21.640
are probably the most dramatic.

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.740
Because the elderly-- people,
say, over the age of 65,

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.010
visit the doctor less.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:32.300
They make fewer hospital visits,
they take less medication,

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:35.370
and they experience less
loneliness, if they have a pet.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.790
And when you consider
our aging population,

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:41.290
and you consider what our
health budgets look like,

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.220
and you realize just
how much money has

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.930
to be put into supporting
our elderly, you think, wow,

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:51.670
for the price of a bowl
of dog food each day,

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.350
you could actually have that
positive health benefit.

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:58.180
I just think, to me,
it's an amazing trade-off

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.520
to be able to offer that.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:09.070
There's a lot of science around
why those benefits exist.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:12.560
You can probably condense
it down to two things,

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.730
in terms of the health benefits.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.290
It's really the
constant exposure

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:20.410
to non-threatening bugs.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.470
So if you're around
a dog, you're

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:26.380
getting bombarded with
non-threatening bugs that

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.710
really struggle to infect you.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.640
So your immune system
becomes hard and fast

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.600
at recognizing
bacteria and viruses,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.410
and dodging it, weaving
it, working out how

00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:37.350
to deal with it, and moving on.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.830
So constant exposure to
non-threatening bugs--

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.640
and in terms of the
health benefits,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.080
it's constant exposure to
non-threatening bugging

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.340
from them wanting a walk.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.380
It's very hard to
say, no, to a dog that

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.170
is sitting in front of you,
begging you to go for a walk.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.300
And as a result, we give in.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:01.215
But it's a compromise that has
really significant benefits

00:16:01.215 --> 00:16:01.840
for each of us.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:08.640
One of the-- I'm exposed to
hundreds of different studies

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.150
every year, and the one I
love-- it actually came out

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.260
a couple of years ago.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.200
And it was from Kyoto
University in Japan.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.850
Now, I love the Japanese.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.700
They can come up with some
really interesting research,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.770
but this research
centered around--

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.297
they wanted to work
out whether how

00:16:26.297 --> 00:16:28.630
we love our pets, whether
it's just us saying it-- is it

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.838
just something we talk about?

00:16:29.838 --> 00:16:33.640
Do we just love our pets because
they're there, they're cute,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.550
and they give us
extra Instagram likes?

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.620
Or is it something
more tangible?

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.250
And they actually put
owners into a room,

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.370
and they monitored.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.820
They actually took samples
from them-- samples of saliva--

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:47.820
and measured their
hormonal levels.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:51.540
What they found is, when they
brought their pets in and put

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.350
their pets in front of them
and let them pat their pets,

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.320
they released a
hormone, consistently.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.550
And that hormone is oxytocin.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.425
And oxytocin, if you
know what that is,

00:17:03.425 --> 00:17:06.640
is actually the hormone
that we, as humans,

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.119
release when we
see our loved ones

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.760
and when we see our children.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.869
So it's a chemical thing.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:14.560
It's real.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.319
The love for a pet is very real.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.819
The flip side of
that, which I love,

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.579
is the fact that they
then did the opposite,

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:27.079
and actually measured the
levels in dogs and in pets.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.080
And guess what?

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.200
It goes both ways.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.456
They actually release
the hormone as well--

00:17:32.456 --> 00:17:33.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:34.838
--which is, kind of,
reassuring in a way.

00:17:34.838 --> 00:17:36.430
They're not cheating on you.

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.890
So it's a very special
thing, but it's also

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:44.502
a very tangible thing.

00:17:44.502 --> 00:17:46.710
And so you're getting a
picture, I guess, of the fact

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.010
that there are benefits
across the line,

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.370
in terms of the physical
health benefits.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:56.390
But I think a really
powerful benefit out there

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.460
in the community, which is often
undervalued but is becoming

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.760
more researched
and more recognized

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:04.960
is the benefit on mental health.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.090
And you'll see a lot
of dogs out there

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:10.060
that are in the role of being
assistance dogs or therapy

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.080
dogs.

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.880
And the work they're doing
currently with kids with autism

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.920
is quite remarkable.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:23.020
We're still not exactly clear
why pets and animals-- dogs,

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.940
horses, all sorts of
different animals--

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.740
have a positive effect
on kids with autism.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.070
But the belief is that
it changes the brain wave

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.170
activity and results in a more
controlled brain wave activity.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.440
I've had the pleasure of having
a client at work who suffers

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.230
from extreme schizophrenia.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:46.210
And he has been in therapy,
he's been institutionalized,

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.950
and he's been on
multiple medications

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.180
over a number of years.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:55.110
But about seven years ago, he
got two dogs, Oscar and Dudley.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.005
And he comes into the clinic,
about, every three days,

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:00.990
and just loves it.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.230
He always turns up
with these two dogs.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.480
And I had the pleasure of
talking to one of his carers

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.510
the other day, and I said,
oh, talk to me about the dogs.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.230
And they said, hands down,
the most positive effect

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.190
on his life hasn't
been medication,

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.090
has not been our
hospital system.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.706
It's been those two dogs.

00:19:18.706 --> 00:19:21.920
Because in his extreme
schizophrenic state,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:24.240
where he has disordered
thoughts and isn't

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.510
really sure about what he's
doing next, what those dogs do

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:32.440
is provide him with a very
clear path and a very clear plan

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.660
for his day.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.350
And his day starts by getting
them up, getting them outside,

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.540
going to the bathroom,
and feeding them.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.520
And the whole day is
built around these dogs,

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.330
and he goes out and
takes them for a walk.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:48.320
And they say that without fail,
those dogs have saved his life,

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.430
but also turned his life around.

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.650
And these are just
two dogs who seem

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.710
to, like a lot of
animals that I deal with

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:00.260
and a lot of animals that I see
in therapy situations or even

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.920
just in your everyday
home, seem to know

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.120
what's required of them.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.700
And that's a really, I
think, undervalued thing

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:07.950
with our pets.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:08.870
Somehow, they know.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.720
Somehow, they seem to
sense when you're happy,

00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.320
they seem to sense
when you're sad,

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.830
and they seem to know
when is the right time

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.787
to put that little
nose on your lap,

00:20:19.787 --> 00:20:21.870
when's the right time to
just give you some space,

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.660
or when's the right time to
try to turn your mood around.

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:29.420
And I think that's a really,
really special thing.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:35.122
So I would hope that given
the fact that in Australia, we

00:20:35.122 --> 00:20:36.580
do pride ourselves
in being a world

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:38.900
leader in a number
of different areas,

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.930
I would hope that we
can somehow reverse

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.456
this trend, where
we're not a world

00:20:43.456 --> 00:20:44.580
leader in pet-friendliness.

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.030
We gave you some of
the scores there,

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.930
and the fact that
Sydney was 15 out of 16

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:52.820
in the pet-friendly
scores-- well,

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.930
Australia ranks right
down, quite low,

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:57.340
overall, as a country.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.670
So it's something we
do need to look at.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.480
And as I said, Europe
and North America

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.100
are, kind of, your
gold standard.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:07.530
And they're not experiencing
this issue with pet population

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.030
decline like we are.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:13.520
I was in Canada towards
the end of last year,

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.820
staying in a nice
hotel for work,

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.870
and as I was
walking to the lift,

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:19.610
a golden retriever
walked into the lift

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.480
with me, with its owner,
and went up to its room.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.370
And you know, I wasn't
deterred by that.

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:26.070
I loved it.

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:29.645
But this hotel was quite
happy to have animal guests.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.310
Anyone that's traveled
to France will

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.950
know that when
you go into cafes,

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.930
it's not out of the ordinary
to sit up next to a poodle

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.390
while you have your croissant.

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:44.470
And I think, far from
detracting from the experience,

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:45.720
it actually adds to it.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:50.460
It actually makes it more of
a pleasant, cultural moment

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.490
to enjoy.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.580
So I guess we have to
look at, why is that?

00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:00.580
Why do those countries decide
to focus on the positives

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.840
rather than fear the negatives.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.640
I think, sometimes, in
Australia, we can do that.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.560
A classic example-- I'm not
sure if you followed in the news

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:15.360
the fact that a few months ago,
the newly formed Inner West

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:20.020
Council in Sydney decided
to ban dogs from the pubs.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.670
So after years and
years and years

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.610
of dogs being allowed to go
into pubs around Balmain,

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:28.670
all of a sudden, the
council decided, no.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.860
On occupational health
and safety grounds,

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.650
the dogs would now
no longer be allowed

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:39.720
around food areas-- so not
allowed in any part of the pub.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.760
The absurdity of
that is something

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.770
that grabs me straight away.

00:22:43.770 --> 00:22:47.090
When you can see
that on a health--

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.720
if a health basis is
what's being used there,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.430
pets have their bugs
and we have ours.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:56.020
It's actually very hard
for those to cross over.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:02.110
So to think that there's a
health risk around pets being

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:05.400
in a restaurant or near where
people are eating food--

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.230
it's far more dangerous to have
a person being near the food

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.178
than it is to have a
dog being near the food.

00:23:12.178 --> 00:23:17.790
I'm hesitant to say this when
there's a couple cameras on,

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.320
but it would be far
more safe for me

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.040
to have a dog lick my face and
lick my mouth than a person I

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:24.620
don't know.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:25.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.950
I'm not going to give a
demonstration right now,

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:32.410
but that is a simple
scientific fact.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:37.380
And so it's an interesting
mental image, to be honest.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.540
But it does stack up,
time and time again,

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:42.795
on scientific studies.

00:23:45.087 --> 00:23:46.920
People are very passionate
about their pets,

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.020
so I've been encouraged
by the push-back

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.870
on that idea of banning the
pets in pubs in Balmain.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.200
But continually,
I do find, there

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.890
are little moments
in our society,

00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:59.280
where we have to check it.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:03.070
And we have to have a look at it
and go, hang on, is that right?

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:05.060
Banning the pets
in the pubs is one,

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.520
but we even had an
example last month,

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.766
with the census, that
highly successful census.

00:24:12.766 --> 00:24:14.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.240
So what we had there
was-- in the past,

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.440
some census in some
years have actually

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.280
included questions about pets.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.740
How many pets do
we have out there?

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.580
What pets do people own?

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.200
This year-- not a
single question.

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.120
So considering that the
pets are such a huge part

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.860
of our communities, how
can we possibly plan

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.840
for communities involving
pets if we don't even

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.530
know how many pets there are
out there and where they live?

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:44.030
So as a result of that, I
launched my own pet census

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.320
that night, almost in defiance.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.680
And 100,000 people filled
it out in the space

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:55.730
of 48 hours, which is a
remarkable contribution

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:59.859
of people clearly recognizing
that that's not quite right.

00:24:59.859 --> 00:25:01.650
But it also shows how
passionate people are

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.190
and how willing people are
to make sure that their pets'

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.590
voices are heard.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.250
And amongst all of
the different data

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.000
about how many different
pets people owned

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.582
and where they lived and where
they exercised their pets,

00:25:14.582 --> 00:25:16.290
there were some really
interesting things

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:21.540
which really show how much love
there is for animals out there.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:28.900
40% of people share their
beds with their pets.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.090
I was just talking before
about sharing saliva.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.660
That's a lot of pillows being
shared and a lot of wet patches

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:38.800
that-- on the pillow--
you can't quite explain.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.174
And you just go back to sleep
and think, well, hopefully,

00:25:41.174 --> 00:25:42.770
it's my drool and not his.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:48.040
So the other thing was, what's
the most affectionate way

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.540
that people show their
love for their pets?

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.410
I asked the question, do
people pat, do they hug,

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.785
or do they kiss?

00:25:54.785 --> 00:25:58.700
The most popular was the kiss.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.230
I think it was 40%, then
30% for the other two.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:06.590
So there is a lot of love.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:10.356
And so hopefully, if
government, at a federal level,

00:26:10.356 --> 00:26:11.980
at a state level,
and at a local level,

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:15.930
can recognize the fact that pets
do make a huge contribution out

00:26:15.930 --> 00:26:18.494
there, that they deserve
to be recognized,

00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:20.535
that they deserve to be
given their little slice,

00:26:20.535 --> 00:26:23.946
and that they deserve to
be given the pat in return

00:26:23.946 --> 00:26:27.700
for what they contribute to
our society, to our health,

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.030
and to our well-being--
and consistently, I

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:32.430
find that the more we
give them, the more they

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.750
give us back in return.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.260
If people are worried about pets
barking during the day, when

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.270
you're at work,
well, funnily enough,

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:42.420
access to an exercise
area in the morning

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.380
before you go to work may just
be the best cure for that.

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:50.710
So if we actually help them
out, and help them help us,

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.220
then often, we're better off.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.050
So I am encouraged
to come in here

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.517
and see these four-legged
friends sharing

00:26:59.517 --> 00:27:00.350
the office with you.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:02.516
Obviously, Google's
right on board.

00:27:02.516 --> 00:27:04.390
And hopefully, more and
more people out there

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.056
will recognize the importance of
keeping Australia pet-friendly.

00:27:07.056 --> 00:27:08.655
So thank you for your time.

00:27:08.655 --> 00:27:11.070
And I look forward to
talking with you after this,

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.350
about your own concerns.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.850
Thank you.

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.884
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:22.172 --> 00:27:23.380
SPEAKER: Thank you very much.

00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:24.190
That was fantastic.

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.122
I like the idea of
having a pet census.

00:27:27.122 --> 00:27:28.580
Because I know my
girlfriend and I,

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.880
we argue about whether or
not the cat and the dog

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.092
can go in the bed.

00:27:32.092 --> 00:27:34.050
And so I think the 40%
is about representative.

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.091
We sort of have an argument
about that each time.

00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:38.260
CHRIS BROWN: It
was 40% on the bed.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:41.195
It was another 25%
in the bedroom.

00:27:41.195 --> 00:27:43.070
So you can find, like,
a compromise position,

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.370
where they have their
own bed next to the bed.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.074
But we all know how that ends.

00:27:48.074 --> 00:27:49.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:53.362
At about midnight,
there's a little, sort of,

00:27:53.362 --> 00:27:55.070
slow crawl upwards--
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.215
SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:27:55.215 --> 00:27:57.970
And then, they're, like, up by
the pillow in a few seconds.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:58.471
Yeah.

00:27:58.471 --> 00:28:00.011
CHRIS BROWN: I know--
and look, maybe

00:28:00.011 --> 00:28:01.965
I'm, sort of, looking
towards the future here,

00:28:01.965 --> 00:28:05.810
but I know plenty of
people who have been told--

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:10.330
and I hate to put words in your
mouth-- that it's either you

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:12.490
or the dog in the bed.

00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:14.520
So you know, you can choose.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.788
That's just how it goes.

00:28:15.788 --> 00:28:16.454
SPEAKER: I know.

00:28:16.454 --> 00:28:16.518
I know.

00:28:16.518 --> 00:28:19.130
So I don't mind the cat sort of,
roaming, but the dog, for me,

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.960
has to be towards the end.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.520
But look, you know,
these are things.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.500
But we did our own
little survey here.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.850
We had the Bring Your Dog
to Work Day last week.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.430
And we, sort of, asked
people at the end of it,

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.888
you know, what did
you find useful?

00:28:28.888 --> 00:28:29.840
How did it all go?

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.410
And 50% of people said, they
found that public transport

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.740
was a big challenge for them.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.050
So they like actually found
it hard to get their dogs

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:36.850
even to the office.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.120
So they wanted to bring
them, but they couldn't.

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.170
You know, the
conversations you're

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.420
having with the government,
and that sort of thing--

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.000
how are you finding
their responding

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.630
to that sort of challenge, like
trains, the buses, and ferries?

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:47.380
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:52.520
I guess, the key message
out of any of this push

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.970
to open up the avenues for pets
to be more included in society

00:28:57.970 --> 00:28:59.530
is that it does go both ways.

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:01.280
People have to be
responsible, and they

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.240
have to be good
owners, and they have

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.440
to pick up after their pets.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:11.090
If you have a dog that wants to
jump up and hug and, you know,

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.660
tongue pash every
single person it meets,

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.360
and it weighs 60 kilos, maybe
it's not the perfect candidate

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.480
to be going on public
transport just yet.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.840
So you have to almost
self-regulate a little bit.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.210
And we're very clear
in our messaging--

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:27.800
this will only work if people
are responsible as well.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.390
But we are making progress.

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:34.000
And for the simple
fact that, I think,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.530
government does
recognize that there

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:38.350
are some significant
benefits out there,

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:45.470
and we have been caught behind,
really, the rest of the world.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:51.627
And if we are looking for people
to use more public transport,

00:29:51.627 --> 00:29:53.710
the people in the community--
it's not their fault

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.085
that they don't
have a car, where

00:29:55.085 --> 00:29:57.910
we're trying to encourage people
to use public transport and not

00:29:57.910 --> 00:29:59.010
necessarily need cars.

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.407
So that's got to include
the whole family,

00:30:01.407 --> 00:30:02.910
and that includes pets.

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.500
And look, there are votes in it.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.110
At this simple level, I do
believe there are votes in it.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:12.622
I think people-- 67% of
people out there own a pet.

00:30:12.622 --> 00:30:15.490
So generally, people
aren't offended

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.480
if we loosen up the regulations
around where pets can go.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:22.155
But people are really thrilled
if you do it for their animal.

00:30:22.155 --> 00:30:24.113
SPEAKER: You've mentioned
quite a few countries

00:30:24.113 --> 00:30:27.600
during your talk of where you've
seen this working really well.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.960
Are there countries that
have the best in class?

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.620
Is it France, or is it--

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:36.100
CHRIS BROWN: France
is pretty good.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.350
Yeah, like, northern
Europe is quite good.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:44.754
Canada is actually very
impressive, I find.

00:30:44.754 --> 00:30:45.670
Its across the border.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.440
It's in terms of
legislation, and it's

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:55.760
in terms of how they influence
their registration practices

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.725
with pets and micro-chipping
and de-sexing,

00:30:57.725 --> 00:30:58.760
and all the rest of it.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.240
But generally, northern Europe
and northern North America

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.770
are where it's at.

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:06.520
Further north you go,
the better it seems.

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.269
SPEAKER: We had some
fun questions as well

00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:09.320
that came through.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.210
So Australia has many
unique animals, locally,

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.960
but a lot of them, you
can't have as pets.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.290
This person listed a pet quoll,
a wombat, and a sugar glider,

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:20.939
and asked, how can
we raise awareness

00:31:20.939 --> 00:31:23.480
of these beautiful animals, and
how can we change the laws so

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.580
that they can also be pets?

00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.330
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:27.530
SPEAKER: Where's the
line drawn, basically?

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.613
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah, I know.

00:31:28.613 --> 00:31:29.430
It's a tricky one.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.846
Some of those animals that are
mentioned there-- the quoll

00:31:31.846 --> 00:31:34.442
is our native cat.

00:31:34.442 --> 00:31:34.942
Yeah.

00:31:34.942 --> 00:31:36.733
You want to be pretty
selective about which

00:31:36.733 --> 00:31:37.690
quoll you take home.

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:40.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:43.490
The thing we often forget
about with dogs and cats--

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:45.210
and especially in
the case of dogs--

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.110
is that they didn't
just turn up.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:49.880
We haven't just
decided one day that we

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.275
want to keep a dog as a pet.

00:31:51.275 --> 00:31:54.416
We've been domesticating
dogs for 10,000 years.

00:31:54.416 --> 00:31:58.570
So they're such great pets
because we made them that way.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:03.000
And you wouldn't just grab a
wolf and expect to raise a wolf

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.800
puppy, and think that the wolf
puppy-- it'd be awesome, but--

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:06.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.520
SPEAKER: And dingoes
stole my baby stuff.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:08.930
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:09.888
Well, that's the thing.

00:32:09.888 --> 00:32:11.590
Like, dingoes are
an example of that.

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:15.795
They, generally, as a rule,
don't make great pets,

00:32:15.795 --> 00:32:17.170
because they're
not domesticated.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.470
And so we've chosen,
as the attributes--

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:24.510
we've generally chosen the calm,
responsible, quieter ones that

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:26.070
are affectionate.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.670
So to have quolls
or sugar gliders

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:32.620
as pets-- you can get lucky.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:35.020
You can get one that's very
tame and very, very quiet,

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.070
but as a general
rule, there's always

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:39.405
going to be one in two or
one in three, at least,

00:32:39.405 --> 00:32:42.030
that's not going to be suitable
and might ruin it for everyone.

00:32:42.030 --> 00:32:43.090
SPEAKER: It's such
a shame, though,

00:32:43.090 --> 00:32:43.950
because sugar
gliders are so cute.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:44.760
CHRIS BROWN: They are.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.620
SPEAKER: At least,
they're around,

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:46.877
and you can go and visit them.

00:32:46.877 --> 00:32:49.460
CHRIS BROWN: They're remarkably
popular in the States as well.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:49.710
SPEAKER: Really?

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:50.440
CHRIS BROWN: People
actually have them

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.356
as pets in the States.

00:32:51.356 --> 00:32:52.090
SPEAKER: Right.

00:32:52.090 --> 00:32:52.250
Yeah.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:53.530
Well, I think a
controversial question

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:55.010
someone asked was about cats.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.502
So obviously, I,
sort of, prefaced

00:32:56.502 --> 00:32:57.960
by saying that
we're a dog company.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:01.030
But someone did ask, cats, while
being one of Australia's most

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:04.010
favorite pets, are
hugely destructive

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.567
to native Australian animals.

00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:08.150
And they suggest,
you know, how can we

00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:11.590
encourage people to make sure
their cats aren't roaming all

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.570
the time, or to be more
responsible about how

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:15.140
they deal with cats.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.890
CHRIS BROWN: I actually
think we give cats

00:33:16.890 --> 00:33:18.820
a hard time in this country.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.155
We're one of the few
developed nations--

00:33:22.155 --> 00:33:23.530
we might be the
only one or there

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.670
might be one other
country-- where

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:28.720
cat ownership is declining.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.470
In every other
country in the world,

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.480
as we move into smaller
areas, into apartments,

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.680
everyone else has recognized the
suitability of cats for that.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.600
And as a result, cat
numbers have increased,

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.200
apart from in Australia.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.670
And I think it's the
wildlife thing that

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.970
causes that, which is a shame.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:50.130
And certainly, cats are to blame
for a huge number of wildlife

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.040
fatalities.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.360
When you look at the studies,
though, the vast majority

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.726
of those are feral cats.

00:33:56.726 --> 00:34:01.800
Your domestic home cat accounts
for a small percentage of that.

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.550
It's still too high, obviously.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:06.860
But that's why we're saying it's
part of being a responsible dog

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.480
owner.

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:11.280
You keep a fenced backyard.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.980
With a cat, keep them inside
or keep them in an enclosed cat

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.460
area outside.

00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:19.790
If you do the responsible
thing, then there's

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.210
no reason why cats
can't be as popular

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.000
as dogs in this country.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.770
They can be amazing,
amazing pets.

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.969
I've got a cat, myself,
who was, to be fair,

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:32.480
was raised with a dog
and thinks she is a dog.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.989
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.199
And she's great.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:40.840
You know, and YouTube
can't be wrong.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.531
Look at how many cat videos that
are out there that are popular.

00:34:45.531 --> 00:34:49.472
I saw one last night of
kittens massaging each other.

00:34:49.472 --> 00:34:50.305
And that's adorable.

00:34:50.305 --> 00:34:50.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.000
How can you not like that?

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.340
My cat, Cricket, has an
obsessive compulsive massaging

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.120
disorder, where,
if I leave her--

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.120
if I don't-- she actually
doesn't sleep in my room,

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:07.700
for one simple fact that at 2:00
AM, 3:00 AM, 4:00 AM, 5:00 AM,

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.040
she massages.

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.200
She gets into my room
and just sits there.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.147
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:12.147 --> 00:35:14.230
SPEAKER: She thinks she's
going to be of service--

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:15.420
CHRIS BROWN: Like,
you're never more relaxed

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:16.900
than you are at two
o'clock in the morning.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.940
I do not need a massage at
two o'clock in the morning.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:19.439
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:19.439 --> 00:35:20.284
SPEAKER: No.

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:21.630
Fair.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:24.280
And on the point of these
social media stars-- like,

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:25.603
I had a quick look.

00:35:25.603 --> 00:35:29.330
Jiffpom had a hoodie photo
that had hundreds of thousands

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:29.930
of likes.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:33.530
And I looked at the
overbite of Tuna the Dog.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.510
How can we, sort of,
use-- if any of us

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.760
have really cute pets or
big Instagram followers,

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.560
how can help try and push this
forward, this sort of campaign?

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.899
I've seen it's got hundreds
of posts on the hashtag,

00:35:44.899 --> 00:35:46.732
already on Instagram
and that sort of stuff.

00:35:46.732 --> 00:35:47.482
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:35:47.482 --> 00:35:50.410
I think-- how do you boost the
popularity of your own pets

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:50.910
online?

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:52.666
SPEAKER: Well,
that, too, but also

00:35:52.666 --> 00:35:55.040
to get people talking about
this idea of making Australia

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.780
more pet-friendly and
that sort of thing.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:00.240
CHRIS BROWN: Look,
I think there's

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.790
a real innocence
around our animals

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.670
and I think this is
what they'd want.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:04.470
You know?

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.610
They really would, and they're
clearly right behind it.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.992
And I just think that given
all the love and all benefits

00:36:10.992 --> 00:36:13.450
that they give us, I think it's
only fair that we give them

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:14.455
something in return.

00:36:14.455 --> 00:36:16.830
And that's what the whole
pet-friendly campaign is about.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:18.380
It's just giving them something.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:20.640
And they actually
don't ask for a lot.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:26.280
And if we actually give the
dogs an off-leash area--

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.140
those enclosed
areas-- the amount

00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:33.000
of energy they burn off in a
20-minutes run around there--

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.450
they'll generally sleep
for the rest of the day.

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:38.269
So it's actually giving us
something back in return,

00:36:38.269 --> 00:36:39.810
in the way that
they're more content.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.350
They're less likely
to be stressed

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:43.420
when we're away at work.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.320
So a lot of these
measures are not

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:48.070
just about making Australia
more pet-friendly.

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:50.060
They're actually about
our pets being more

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.690
relaxed an better off as well.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.940
SPEAKER: Well, [INAUDIBLE]
questions in the room, too.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:58.245
So just raise your hand, and
we'll bring over a mic to you.

00:36:58.245 --> 00:36:58.786
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:58.786 --> 00:37:00.850
I'm Marin, I'm
French, and I've just

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.630
moved to Australia last year.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.710
And I happen to live in
a pet-friendly block.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:07.500
I don't have a pet.

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.815
But it's probably the
only block in Coogee

00:37:09.815 --> 00:37:13.300
in, about, a kilometer
radius that is pet-friendly.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:16.280
And the rule to be able to
have a pet in that block

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.390
is, the pet has to be less than
half the height of your calf.

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.530
So if you have, like, a
pet that goes to your knee,

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.690
you can't have the apartment.

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.891
CHRIS BROWN: I'm quite
tall, I could [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:27.891 --> 00:37:28.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:29.015
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:29.015 --> 00:37:30.312
You'd be fine.

00:37:30.312 --> 00:37:32.520
But yeah, my really good
friend had a Doberman.

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.380
Obviously, she couldn't
get the apartment.

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.130
So is that something
as well, that-- like,

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:42.830
I only had a cat in France, and
cats are no problem for pets

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:43.332
in France.

00:37:43.332 --> 00:37:45.540
But is that something that
you're looking at as well,

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.020
to work with the governments
to change the strata

00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.390
rules and the renting rules?

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.926
Because it's pretty much
impossible to have a pet here.

00:37:51.926 --> 00:37:52.676
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:37:52.676 --> 00:37:56.120
So the push at the
moment-- the current rule

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.400
is that it's up to the
landlord to decide,

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:05.372
and that's unfortunately
almost the-- that block

00:38:05.372 --> 00:38:06.580
is the exception to the rule.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.380
I mean, generally, a
lot of apartment owners

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:11.316
are saying, no.

00:38:11.316 --> 00:38:13.210
But what we're
trying to push for

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:18.790
is to actually switch it
around so the landlord has

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:21.980
to give a reason why not,
as opposed to you having

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.760
to push your case as to why.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:26.780
And that's an
ongoing discussion,

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.000
and it's a hard one.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.830
But what you're saying with
the height being the issue--

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:36.160
even that is a
little frustrating.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.520
Because anyone that
knows dogs knows

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:42.280
that a small dog like,
say, Jack Russell,

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:45.720
will have more energy than
a big dog like a Great Dane,

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.390
for example, and will
be, actually, probably,

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:50.970
more inclined to bark
and more inclined to be

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:52.630
destructive in an apartment.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.030
So it doesn't make sense.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.060
And that's probably
the frustration.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.085
It's that a lot of these
rules aren't based on fact,

00:38:59.085 --> 00:39:02.520
and aren't based on
science or research.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.040
And the only way you
can change these things

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.620
is by actually having
face-to-face meetings

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.430
and informing them in
a non-threatening way,

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:16.202
as to why their policy
probably needs a bit of a look.

00:39:16.202 --> 00:39:17.660
SPEAKER: And a Jack
Russell doesn't

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.640
know that it's a small dog.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:19.681
It thinks it's a big dog.

00:39:19.681 --> 00:39:20.342
You know?

00:39:20.342 --> 00:39:21.092
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:39:21.092 --> 00:39:22.180
Exactly.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.680
Generally, I know
a lot of big dogs

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:28.000
that would be
happier in apartments

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.100
than some small dogs, which
is, kind of, counter-intuitive,

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:31.889
but it's true.

00:39:31.889 --> 00:39:32.930
AUDIENCE: Thanks, doctor.

00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:33.560
What are you--

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:34.182
CHRIS BROWN: Thank you, Joe.

00:39:34.182 --> 00:39:34.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:34.682 --> 00:39:38.010
AUDIENCE: --wanting
the pet lovers to do?

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:40.260
Is it to lobby their member
and get a bit more active?

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:43.390
What are you actually wanting,
in terms of action from people?

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.140
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.015
It's a good question.

00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:46.960
Thanks, Joe.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:51.070
I think we're dealing
with politicians,

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:55.360
so it's making them realize that
the votes are involved here.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.920
It's writing letters
to the newspaper.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.050
The Telegraph has
been right behind,

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:03.420
trying to stir up the
issue with the pets

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.470
in the pubs in the Inner West.

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.650
They love opinion pieces
because they realize

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.130
that it's a passionate topic.

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:12.760
And so get involved.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.500
Start lobbying people, yourself.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:19.330
Use the Keep Australia
Pet-Friendly hashtag

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:22.810
on your social media posts.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:24.850
And certainly, keep
all the feedback

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.537
coming around on what
is important to you

00:40:27.537 --> 00:40:28.370
and your local area.

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:31.260
Because we're in a
fortunate position

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.550
where we can collate that and
actually make presentations

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:35.190
to government.

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:38.110
But if it's more than just
us that's in their ear,

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.980
if it's actually members
of their own electorates,

00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.760
then it's a lot more powerful.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.720
We met with the heads of local
government a couple of months

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.340
ago, so all the mayors
and local councils

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.340
from around the country.

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.000
And in the one month
since that meeting,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.670
they've put in eight new
off-leash area parks.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.880
They do listen, but
their big feedback

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.940
was, they didn't
understand why there

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.190
was this buzz around
off-leash area parks.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.460
They didn't really understand
why they are important.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.550
And it just takes people
to sit down with them

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:12.010
and explain the
benefits for them

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.510
to go, oh, OK, so that's
why they want the fences,

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:17.300
because we couldn't work out
why they wanted the fences.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.300
We thought that it always
looked strange to have

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.466
a fence in there, but that's
actually what you want.

00:41:21.466 --> 00:41:22.460
OK, all right.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.580
And a lot of those
parks came about

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.505
because people were lobbying
their local government.

00:41:28.505 --> 00:41:31.200
They were starting up petitions.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:36.030
Even just those Change.orgs,
those online petitions--

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:39.460
it's amazing the amount
of support they get.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.930
If you can present a couple
of hundred signatures

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:45.460
to your local government or a
couple of thousand signatures

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.880
to a state government,
they start to listen.

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.440
SPEAKER: A local
council and park

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.567
at a time, and then
hopefully, more will join.

00:41:53.567 --> 00:41:54.400
AUDIENCE: Hi, Chris.

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.350
Thanks for coming in.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:59.930
With regards to pets
being allowed or trying

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:04.295
to get them to be allowed
to come on public transport

00:42:04.295 --> 00:42:07.830
and things, I often see
people taking their dogs

00:42:07.830 --> 00:42:09.769
and having to leave
them or their animals--

00:42:09.769 --> 00:42:11.810
having to leave them
outside of shopping centers.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.550
Is there any way
that you're going

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:21.450
to be speaking to the
big shopping bugles

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.970
and things like that?

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:25.250
Because they are on the
other side of the government.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:29.190
It's really, again, like
the units in apartments.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.790
It's a matter of
the owner deciding.

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:35.438
So is there any way of, kind
of, communicating and addressing

00:42:35.438 --> 00:42:37.480
that issue with
having to not leave

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.780
your animal outside, tied
along a no-parking sign?

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:41.633
Or--

00:42:41.633 --> 00:42:42.400
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.800
It's a really good point.

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:49.654
We've tried to,
in the campaign--

00:42:49.654 --> 00:42:51.070
we don't want to
go in with a wish

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:53.460
list that is 15 items long.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:56.530
So we've tried to
condense it to four, which

00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:59.630
is the pet-friendly apartments,
it's the dog-friendly parks,

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.294
it's the cafes, restaurants,
and it's the transport.

00:43:02.294 --> 00:43:03.710
But what you're
saying is actually

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:07.280
a really important
point as well.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:09.320
So that's one that
should be looked at.

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.370
It probably comes down
to zoning and comes

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:16.720
down to just an understanding
of health regulations as well.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.590
And what I said during my
talk about that fear around--

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:24.820
it's not healthy to
have pets around,

00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:27.286
and they spread disease.

00:43:27.286 --> 00:43:31.190
Even though, as I mentioned,
the risk is extremely small.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.480
So it's part of the
broader discussion as well.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:38.484
But it always makes me nervous
when I see that sort of thing.

00:43:38.484 --> 00:43:40.400
It also gives pets a bad
name, because they're

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.310
tied up out the front.

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:43.435
They're barking because
they're left by themselves,

00:43:43.435 --> 00:43:46.370
and they're confused
and anxious.

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:50.510
And so it just almost
reinforces the opinion

00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:53.180
that those dogs shouldn't
be there in the first place,

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.996
because they're
just making noise.

00:43:54.996 --> 00:43:56.406
But thank you.

00:43:56.406 --> 00:43:58.030
SPEAKER: Do you have
a favorite animal?

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.570
Like, I've seen on
Instagram, you've

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.385
got giraffes, dogs, and quokkas.

00:44:02.385 --> 00:44:03.135
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:08.700
My favorite animal
is a strange one.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.830
It's a cow.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:10.380
SPEAKER: Cow?

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:10.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:12.220
Because they bring milk, or--?

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:13.060
CHRIS BROWN: No, no.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:17.250
I was quite a nerdy kid, and
we had a farm in the Hunter

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.990
Valley, and I used to show
cows at country shows,

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:23.440
like, in the white coat, the
hat, and the little stick.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.040
And I always liked cows.

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.380
I used to breed cows
when I was a kid.

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.935
And I love the-- I think what
I love is the fact that they're

00:44:29.935 --> 00:44:34.189
so big, yet quite placid.

00:44:34.189 --> 00:44:35.860
And yeah.

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:38.800
You don't want to see the
photos from that time.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.800
SPEAKER: What's the worst
pet someone could get?

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.800
Like, the most problematic
pet that's gonna, you

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.832
know-- the most business to see
a vet, and that sort of thing?

00:44:46.832 --> 00:44:48.290
CHRIS BROWN: That's
a question that

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:49.489
always gets me into trouble.

00:44:49.489 --> 00:44:51.280
Because no matter the
animal I say, there's

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:51.950
always someone in the room--

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:52.680
SPEAKER: Who has got one?

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.470
Yeah.

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:55.360
CHRIS BROWN: And I can
see it straight away.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.760
Their facial expression
is like, oh, god.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.180
But look, I'll play along
and name and shame one.

00:45:06.590 --> 00:45:10.660
The one I guess I-- oh,
god, why am I doing this?

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:14.070
I like all animals, but
the one I have the most,

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.655
sort of, ongoing battles
with is the ferrets.

00:45:17.655 --> 00:45:21.110
The thing is that when
you de-sex a ferret,

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:23.360
even though they're under
anaesthetic, subconsciously,

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.420
they let their scent glands go.

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:28.780
And so everyone's seen the
cartoons with skunks, right?

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:31.199
And skunks let the
scent glands go.

00:45:31.199 --> 00:45:32.240
It's, kind of, like that.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.100
SPEAKER: Right.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.716
CHRIS BROWN: I have to, when
I'm de-sexing a ferret--

00:45:35.716 --> 00:45:37.424
SPEAKER: How often do
you de-sex ferrets?

00:45:37.424 --> 00:45:39.120
CHRIS BROWN: Oh, frequently.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.110
It's not [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:41.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:44.090
But I have to, like, make an
incision, run out of the room,

00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:46.190
have a breath, come back
in, do another incision,

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:48.490
out of the room, back
in-- it's like a workout.

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:50.229
It's quite amazing.

00:45:50.229 --> 00:45:52.395
But apart from that, they
can be quite affectionate.

00:45:52.395 --> 00:45:53.790
They've just got
really sharp nails.

00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:56.289
And if they're on the loose,
they'll run up your trouser leg

00:45:56.289 --> 00:45:57.600
and start scratching.

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.020
SPEAKER: I've heard alpacas
also are quite difficult.

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:00.670
CHRIS BROWN: I
like them, though.

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:01.075
SPEAKER: You like them?

00:46:01.075 --> 00:46:01.590
CHRIS BROWN: They have
a lot of attitude.

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:02.710
SPEAKER: They are very
cute, aren't they?

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:03.460
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.070
I've seen someone-- the
whole spitting thing?

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:09.090
Everyone talks about
alpacas and llamas spitting.

00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:11.080
I always thought it was
a bit of an urban myth

00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:16.930
until I saw a kid who was riling
up an alpaca at a country show

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:18.930
cop a spit in the face.

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:20.855
And it was one of the
most remarkable things

00:46:20.855 --> 00:46:21.480
I've ever seen.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.105
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:22.105 --> 00:46:23.050
SPEAKER: Straight to YouTube.

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:23.510
Yeah.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.759
CHRIS BROWN: It was the
entire, like, stomach contents

00:46:25.759 --> 00:46:30.170
of the alpaca-- ended up,
basically, on this guy's face.

00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:31.210
SPEAKER: There you go.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:34.780
So everyone's gonna go out and
get an alpaca after this talk.

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.750
Other question?

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:37.430
Wow.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.940
Three.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:39.130
We'll take one at a time.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:41.900
That'll be too much fun to
take three at the same time.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:43.142
AUDIENCE: Hi, Dr. Brown.

00:46:43.142 --> 00:46:44.790
I'm an allergy
sufferer, and I was

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:47.480
wondering whether you have
any suggestions on how

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.330
allergy sufferers
like myself and pets

00:46:50.330 --> 00:46:52.010
can more happily co-exist.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.760
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:55.120
Really good question, and
probably a topic where there's

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:56.890
a lot of misinformation.

00:46:56.890 --> 00:47:01.410
So a lot of people think that
when you are allergic to pets,

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:02.880
you're allergic to the hair.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:06.480
And so the focus is always
on non-shedding cats

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.040
and non-shedding dogs.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.190
That's actually not true.

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:12.210
Allergy sufferers aren't
allergic to the hair.

00:47:12.210 --> 00:47:17.140
It's actually the dried
skin dander and also

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.710
the saliva that
sits on the hair.

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:22.629
So when pets groom themselves,
that sits on the fur,

00:47:22.629 --> 00:47:24.670
and then once it dries,
it flakes off and ends up

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:26.920
in the air, we breathe
it in, and give off

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.790
the signs of being allergic.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:32.690
So having a dog that
doesn't shed hair

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:34.320
doesn't make too
much of a difference,

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.330
but coincidentally, the
dogs that don't shed as much

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:40.430
don't produce as
much of this protein.

00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:43.920
So the best way, if
you're looking for a dog,

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.790
is to go and spend some time
in a room or outside-- probably

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.550
better off-- with the puppies,
have them all over you,

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:52.710
and see if you respond.

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:55.030
And it's just a bit
of a trial and error.

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.070
If you can find one
that doesn't cause

00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:02.190
you to be too allergic, then--
if you're having problems,

00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:04.280
wiping them down
with a damp cloth

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.970
removes that allergen
off their coat.

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:09.870
And so it makes you
less likely to respond.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:14.480
In terms of cats, Devon
Rex and the Rex breeds--

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:17.950
the quite short-haired cats--
produce less of that protein

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:19.560
as well.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.840
They're working madly to
produce an allergy-free cat,

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:26.910
using genetic engineering,
and they're very close.

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:29.080
And so that might help as well.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:34.950
But the funny thing
is that often, you

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:40.320
can actually manage allergies
by simple exposure to animals.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.180
I'm actually
allergic to rabbits.

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:49.010
So if I don't see a
rabbit for six months

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:51.410
or so in the vet clinic, the
next time I see a rabbit,

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:52.775
I'll sneeze and have runny eyes.

00:48:52.775 --> 00:48:55.830
If I see, say, four
rabbits in a week,

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.250
I'm not allergic to rabbits.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:02.820
You can almost self-cure
yourself by exposure.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:04.190
So it's one of those things.

00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:05.790
I'm not a human immunologist.

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:09.070
So you can
de-sensitize yourself,

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:12.450
but I don't know your exact form
of allergy to know for sure.

00:49:12.450 --> 00:49:17.360
But they're the basic principles
of allergies with pets.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:18.310
They're manageable.

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:18.976
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:49:18.976 --> 00:49:20.500
Thanks.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.160
SPEAKER: OK.

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.160
AUDIENCE: Hello, doctor.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.618
Thank you very much
for being here.

00:49:24.618 --> 00:49:28.270
And my question is
about the history.

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:30.670
Has it always been
like that in Australia?

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:32.210
Particularly, in
Sydney-- the fact

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:36.250
that it's such an unfriendly
city for dogs in particular.

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:37.960
Has it always been like that?

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.720
What was the factor?

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.070
Was there an event
or a chain of events

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:45.420
that triggered this sort of
regulations against dogs,

00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:48.710
which don't seem to be
based on any actual facts,

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:50.328
as you mentioned?

00:49:50.328 --> 00:49:51.529
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:49:51.529 --> 00:49:53.070
There's not really
an exact, sort of,

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:54.870
moment where it all changed.

00:49:54.870 --> 00:50:00.190
Generally, through the '60s,
'70s, and probably early '80s,

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:01.910
we were fairly
relaxed, but we didn't

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:06.500
have a lot of
policy around where

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.120
we sat around our regulations.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.910
But once we actually became
more, I guess, litigious,

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:17.550
and more keen to regulate,
when we regulated,

00:50:17.550 --> 00:50:21.140
we went, I guess,
probably above and beyond,

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.820
where a lot of those
other nations have.

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:27.150
So we've never been one of
the most pet-friendly nations

00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:30.480
in the world, when it
comes to regulations.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:34.710
And certainly over the
last 10 or 15 years,

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:38.340
we haven't necessarily
progressed and caught up

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.560
with some of the
deregulation that's happening

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.790
in some of the other countries.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:47.220
So we were always behind, but
I think over the last 15 years

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:50.590
or so, we've got further
behind, because we've actually

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:52.950
regulated more heavily, while
a lot of other countries

00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:55.150
have become a little
bit more relaxed.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:57.150
SPEAKER: And what made
Sydney come 15 out of 16?

00:50:57.150 --> 00:50:58.170
Are there certain
things-- obviously,

00:50:58.170 --> 00:50:59.470
you've mentioned the pub.

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:00.920
What other sort
of things are you

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:01.950
seeing that's
different in Sydney,

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:02.915
compared to the
rest of Australia?

00:51:02.915 --> 00:51:03.665
CHRIS BROWN: Yeah.

00:51:03.665 --> 00:51:07.410
It's to do with-- accessibility
of rental properties

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:08.780
is quite low.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:11.320
And I know, just anecdotally
through my friends,

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:14.380
that they really struggle
to find rental properties.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.000
Lack of exercise
areas is a huge one.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.620
So it's very hard
to find a dog beach

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:24.290
to take your dog in Sydney,
whereas in Melbourne,

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:27.910
for example, there is quite
a few that you can go to.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:30.810
But also, it comes
down to policy

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:33.790
and looking to be
positive with our policy.

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:39.910
We tend to over-regulate,
fine-- we're very

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:41.410
strict with our registration.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:44.000
So it's almost like
there's a negative tone

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.690
to our policy-making, whereas
in some of the other states,

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.800
in meeting with the other
states-- Victoria, for example,

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:54.660
is very positive when it
comes to their puppy-farming

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:55.230
legislation.

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:59.270
They're very positive when it
comes to their registration

00:51:59.270 --> 00:52:02.670
policies for pets, and reward
you for doing the right thing.

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:06.810
South Australia are
looking at a situation

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:09.520
where you'll get
discounted registration

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:13.770
fees if you can show your
dog's gone to training.

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:15.710
And I think that's a
much better way to be,

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:18.330
if you can actually give a
little bit to actually get

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:21.535
something back in return, as
opposed to, do it this way

00:52:21.535 --> 00:52:23.910
or you're going to be fined,
which I think has often been

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:25.420
the case in New South Wales.

00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:30.620
And that's probably where a lot
of the fact that we drift down

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:34.387
towards the bottom when it comes
to pet-friendliness comes from.

00:52:34.387 --> 00:52:35.970
SPEAKER: We'll take
one last question,

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:38.106
or we're gonna wrap up.

00:52:38.106 --> 00:52:39.620
I think we'll have to wrap up.

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.040
One last poll for fun.

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:42.879
Raise your hand
if you have a dog.

00:52:42.879 --> 00:52:44.295
Raise your hand
if you have a cat.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.260
Raise your hand if you
have a different animal.

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:50.030
What do you have?

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.780
AUDIENCE: Rabbits.

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:51.489
SPEAKER: Rabbits.

00:52:51.489 --> 00:52:52.238
AUDIENCE: Turtles.

00:52:52.238 --> 00:52:53.120
SPEAKER: Turtles.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:54.017
What type of turtle?

00:52:54.017 --> 00:52:55.240
AUDIENCE: An Eastern
long-necked turtle.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.340
SPEAKER: An Eastern
long-necked turtle.

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:56.839
There we go.

00:52:56.839 --> 00:52:58.420
Who else had one?

00:52:58.420 --> 00:52:59.283
Someone else?

00:52:59.283 --> 00:53:00.050
AUDIENCE: Fish.

00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:00.830
SPEAKER: Fish.

00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:02.121
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:02.121 --> 00:53:03.870
CHRIS BROWN: Can someone
say, ferret, just

00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:05.472
to really freak
me out right now?

00:53:05.472 --> 00:53:07.305
SPEAKER: We can book
an appointment with you

00:53:07.305 --> 00:53:08.180
later this week.

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:08.849
Yeah.

00:53:08.849 --> 00:53:10.390
Well, thank you very
much for coming.

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:12.300
A big thank you for Dr. Brown.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.170
So remember, try and
get your favorite pets

00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:21.000
trending on Instagram,
use the hashtag,

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.480
and complain to
your local council

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:23.849
about why you haven't got parks.

00:53:23.849 --> 00:53:25.640
And we can all keep
Australia pet-friendly.

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:26.348
CHRIS BROWN: Yes.

00:53:26.348 --> 00:53:30.190
And there is a Keep Australia
Pet-Friendly Facebook page,

00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:32.776
where you can send in
your feedback in areas

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:35.150
that you think need to be
looked at-- just Keep Australia

00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.410
Pet-Friendly.

00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:37.243
And also, I have a
Facebook page-- Dr. Chris

00:53:37.243 --> 00:53:40.440
Brown-- where you can send in
your feedback, too, as well.

00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.260
And we do listen, and
we do collate it all,

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.420
and we do present
all the information

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:47.340
to the relevant people.

00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:48.660
So it does make a different.

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:49.820
SPEAKER: Fantastic.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.560
Thanks so much.

00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:53.235
[APPLAUSE]
