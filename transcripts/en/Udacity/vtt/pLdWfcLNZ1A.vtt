Next piece is you want to think about is what in the key resources?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What do you need to make the business model work? What assets are important?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And what's an example of an asset in a key resource, well finance.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Do you need capital? Do you need a line of credit?

Some assets are in resources or physical. Do you need physical plant like a manufacturing line?

Is there's something else you need? Is there intellectual property you need?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Is there patents you need to acquire or protect? Do you need to acquire customer list?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or great hardware designers or great manufacturing people.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And then finally again at the interaction between intellectual and human capital is that's

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
another key resource. What specifically do you need to do to  keep this people and who are they.
