00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.290
"Daddy, it’s a ship."

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.530
Titanic 3D!

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:15.049
3D so real, you can actually feel James Cameron
stealing money from your pocket.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.199
A film so bloated you can honestly just skip
the first half-hour...

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.470
Don’t worry, there’s still like three
hours left to go!

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.230
Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands
of heartbreaking true stories,

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.939
comes this fake one.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.919
Jack is an unrealistically sexy peasant

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.480
and Rose is a first-class suicidal pair of
boobs.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.030
Together, their undying love made James Cameron
filthy f***ing rich.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.719
Remember the romance that encouraged a generation
to round second base in the back of a movie

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:47.719
theater.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.399
Remember the action, of the greatest game
of Human Plinko.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.210
Remember the excitement of PG-13 boobs

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.010
now in James Cameron approved 3D!

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.899
"It was the most erotic moment of my life."

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.770
So brace yourself for a whole new generation
of douchebags screaming

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.460
"I’m the king of the world!"

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.930
...and that stupid f***ing song that briefly
tricked you into thinking Celine Dion was

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.020
hot.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.231
Good luck getting that out of your head!

00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:27.869
From the Academy Award winner for best editing
comes three and a half hours of establishing

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.590
shots,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.189
rich people eating,

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:44.659
and waving,

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:47.469
more waving,

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.701
and even more waving.

00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:59.979
Witness the eternal love that ends because
one piece of drift wood cannot hold two people.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:00.979
Seriously?

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.340
That’s a huge piece of wood, they could
have both fit on it, or they could have at

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.640
least just taken turns in the water.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.320
Is it just me or did he not have to die?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.320
Starring:

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.420
Leonardo Da Vinci

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.420
boobs

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.890
the entire estate of Downton Abbey

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.140
and Bill Pullman.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.620
Er.. .Paxton.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.870
Titanic 3D

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.560
Spoiler Alert: They still drown.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:30.060
Together they will have the romance of a lifetime
expressed entirely in stares.
