00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.570
So you have worked hard,
designed, developed,

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.760
and launched your awesome app.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.870
The press received
it enthusiastically.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.540
Millions of users downloaded it.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.040
Things were looking really,
really, really good.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.650
Congratulations.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.580
But after a few
weeks, tumbleweeds.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.110
Nothing is going on.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.380
New users do not come back.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.130
Many people install your app
and then forgot about it.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.840
That is very sad.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.340
Let me ask you a question.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.950
Is your app in the Google index?

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.680
No?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.970
Then you probably don't know
that app indexing can help you.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.460
Let me show you how.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.990
It was a lazy Sunday afternoon,
and all I wanted to do

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.910
is relax.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.780
Japanese cuisine is my
go-to for comfort food.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.800
Soba would be great right now.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.300
So I looked for a recipe
I had once in Japan.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.520
OK, Google.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.360
[SPEAKING JAPANESE]

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.700
I found the recipe online
and launched my favorite app

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.740
using the deep link provided
through app indexing.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.190
Yep, I think I have
all the ingredients.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.160
For dessert, I decided
to make some cheesecake.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.366
Lets follow the app
indexing deep link.

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.940
Mm, looks delicious.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.950
After that, it was
time to relax and read.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.440
Just the other day,
my friend Lawrence

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.240
told me about the book he wrote.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.290
Let me check the book
reviews on Goodreads.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.540
Pretty good.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.930
I started reading the book,
and the action took me

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.110
to the city of Las Vegas.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.020
My mind started drifting.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.940
Las Vegas sounds
like a fun city.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.070
Silicon Valley is getting
kind of stressful and pricey.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.030
I wondered, what's the cost
of living in Las Vegas?

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.605
Let's find a real estate app.

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:41.080
I started to research
housing, and it

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.330
looked quite encouraging.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.060
I could start with
a fixer upper,

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.860
but I'm not much of a handyman.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.470
Let's look up handyman
services in Las Vegas.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.420
Yep, I'm set there.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.950
Things look promising.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.750
Since I'm a bit of
a foodie, I really

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.440
needed to check the
restaurant scene.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.020
My favorite food in my new
favorite city looks great.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.250
But what's the name
of the review I liked?

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.030
Raku, yep, that's the one.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.600
I like how indexing API
enables auto completion, which

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.979
saves me from typing.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.970
Whether I am researching
restaurant or music events,

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.310
I can quickly get back into the
proper view of the right app

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.470
directly from Google Search.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.960
Wow, this was fun.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.310
In this story, I
discovered a new app

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.900
and reengaged with several
previously installed apps.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.700
There are over 1 million
apps in Google Play.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.900
More and more of them
are in the Google index,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.690
which enables better app
discovery and higher user

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.720
engagement.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.130
It is easy to get your
app in the Google index.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.540
First of all, update
the Android Manifest

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.860
of your app to get ready
for receiving intents

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.060
from Google Search.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.170
Next, include calls to the App
Indexing API in your activity

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.470
implementation.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.600
This will help to get the user
back into the right activity

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.840
directly from Google Search.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.290
If you have a website, verify
it in the Google Play Developer

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.720
Console.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.380
App indexing can help
drive usage of your app

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.100
and improve user
engagement through Google.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.560
Is your app in the index yet?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.100
If not, try this
hands-on tutorial.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.630
You are only a few
steps away from helping

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.200
your users gracefully
navigate the web of apps.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.750
