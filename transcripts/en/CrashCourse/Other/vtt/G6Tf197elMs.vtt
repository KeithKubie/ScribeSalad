John Green (J): Now I have become pixelated.

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.859
Hank Green (H): Yeah, well, you could just
shrink yourself on down.

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.130
J: Oh, I see what you did there. You're in...So
Hank is in control of this Google+ Hangout

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:19.060
on air. Um, but, uh, but you know, I'm here,
too. I matter a little bit. Hopefully. Um.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.160
H: Yeah, that can depend....[incomprehensible
talking]

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.659
J: But anyway. Hi, yes, welcome to the Google+
Crash Course Hangout.

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.279
H: We're doing it.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.560
J: [incomprehensible talking]... which hopefully-

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.090
H: Um, I just went to the Crash Course page
to see if this is working or not. It appears

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.090
to be.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:44.390
J: And it is. Okay. Great. Um, so, uh, we
want to start by talking about Crash Course,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.550
and education and what led us to make this
channel. And then we're gonna answer your

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.670
questions on Twitter. You can tweet us @thecrashcourse
or, uh, to our individual twitters...um...

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.890
@realjohngreen and @hankgreen and we'll be
answering as many questions as we can. But

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.590
first we're going to talk about, um, how this
channel came about and why we wanted to make

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.440
it. Hank.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.430
H: It was all John's idea. Um. YouTube basically
asked us if we had ideas for original content

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.050
programming stuff that we couldn't afford
to do on our own and um... ooh, I need to

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:28.150
enable me. Ha, it's me now. And so we, uh,
we, we came at them with two ideas, both of

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.790
them were educational in nature, one was SciShow
and this is also SciShow headquarters here

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.590
in Missoula. You can see if this is familiar
to you from the news show, uh, behind me.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.140
Um, and the other was Crash Course and uh,
what we wanted to do was sort of focus on

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.440
what, you know, what we're good at, which
is explaining things, and learning things,

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.140
and, uh, and sort of something that we thought,
would, would in addition to being entertaining

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.180
might actually, uh, help the world be a better
place. Um, so that's how we got started, was

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.180
sort of a broad...

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.970
J: Yeah, so one of the things, one of the
things that Hank and I always talk about,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.290
when we talk about our ideas, when we talk
about what we, um, stuff we want to make,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.460
is, uh, whether it can do any good. Whether
it can be a useful thing in the lives of the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.060
people who, uh, participate, participate in
it with us. And uh, we felt like both with

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.370
Crash Course and with SciShow. SciShow, you
know, committed to sharing, scientific learning,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.940
and Crash Course committed to, um, you know
making educational materials available, free

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.220
to everyone that are engaging and fun, but
also genuinely educational. Um, we felt like

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.950
both those things could, could do some good.
Um. So we're really proud of Crash Course

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.069
and SciShow, and almost, gosh, almost five
months in now. Um, it's been, it's been quite

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.630
an adventure, definitely the most fun, interesting
thing I've ever done on the internet, except

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.840
for Nerdfighteria.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:09.510
H: (laughs) Yeah, uh, it's been, it's been
really rewarding to, to watch, uh, as people

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.940
sort of actually take the courses and start
from, you know, not much knowledge to a broader,

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.060
a broader amount of knowledge. It's also very
rewarding to see people, uh, being like, "I

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.580
passed my AP exam because of you!" and, or
"That episode came out right in time for me,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.550
or else I would have been screwed!" Um, so
that's pretty cool.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.450
J: Umm, so, there are lots of people with
questions Hank, so I wanna start asking you

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.450
questions, okay?

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.760
H: You're gonna ask me questions, okay.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.110
J: I'm gonna ask you some questions, this
is from @russeltospain. Are you planning,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.650
we're answering questions on Twitter by the
way, @thecrashcourse, @realjohngreen, @hankgreen,

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.080
are you planning to cover more subjects like
Salman Khan at the Khan Academy? I don't think

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.250
he's asking if were planning to cover the
subject of Salman Khan, I think he's asking

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.900
if we're planning to, to be like Khan Academy.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:05.720
H: Umm, dude, that's just generally, uh, very
hard, but, yes. I think that it would be fantastic

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.860
if we can get into other topics. Um, Khan
is amazing at, uh, at breadth, and I don't

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.320
think that we're ever going to have that breadth,
at least not in the short term. And certainly

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.729
not with just the two of us. Um, Khan can
do it all by himself because he's a genius,

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:30.240
umm, and has a different format than we do.
And uh we cannot do it by ourselves, at that

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.759
level of depth in all topic areas, which he
pretty much has covered all of them now. He's

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.569
pretty much got every topic area there is.
But we...

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.021
J: Well, he's certainly getting there. The
Khan Academy, for those of you who don't know

00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:46.320
about it, is this incredible resource, that
was really, is really the brainchild of one

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.600
person, Salman Khan, and, uh, I mean there
are thousands of videos, educational videos.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.759
But those videos are designed for highly motivated
students. Um, they're, they're long, they,

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:02.509
you know. They're designed for, for people
who, you know, go into the video wanting,

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:09.040
desperately, to learn, and our, our, our video
series, Crash Course is designed, umm, for

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.740
more, I guess, casual learners. Umm, you know,
people who, people who see learning as part

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.580
of, part of their life, and not necessarily
like just, just school-focused. But also,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.069
you know, hopefully in a way that, that can
be helpful to, to students. Um, Hank, do you

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:29.490
guys have people editing your Vlogbrothers
videos as well as your Crash Course videos,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.090
asks @katiefab (Katie Twyman)

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.690
H: (laughs) Oh, I just clicked on the wrong
thing, sorry, I was trying, trying to activate

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.509
myself and I paused the video. Um, the answer
to that question is that John and I still

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:49.789
edit our Vlogbrothers videos. Umm, occasionally,
Michael Aranda will help me edit a Vlogbrothers

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.270
video. I have him right there.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.789
J: Just pure panic.

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:00.050
H: Um, but, (laughs), we do, we do uh, we
still do all of our Vlogbrothers editing.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.050
And uh...

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.419
J: Yeah, I edit all the Vlogbrothers videos.
I mean it's important to note that we also

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.539
work a lot on Crash Course and SciShow. Um,
but, as you may have noticed, we aren't great

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:10.949
video editors.

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.759
H: I am! I'm a wonderful editor.

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:18.900
J: You're an okay editor, ah, you're, you're
good at jump cuts, I mean, I-I-I don't think

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.039
that, you, I don't think, I wouldn't trust
you to make a Thought Bubble, let's put it

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:24.039
that way.

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:29.130
H: Yeah, though, that's, that's, that's more
than just editing, but I, yeah, and I think

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.520
that, it's, it's a skill set that-that uh,
we have, we have just sort of been thrown

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.729
into, whereas a lot of other people are well-trained.
Um, and so, uh for-for SciShow and Crash Course

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:47.619
we have two full-time editors here, and one
in Indianapolis, so that is a whole different

00:06:47.619 --> 00:06:53.529
world for us to have that kind of support.
Um, but yeah, anytime, the only time that

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:56.819
I would ever, like, not edit a Vlogbrothers
video is if there was literally something

00:06:56.819 --> 00:07:01.099
I wanted to do that I didn't know how to do,
and that, that's what Michael's for.

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:07.219
J: Yeah, I mean, we still, Hank and I both
feel pretty strongly about keeping Vlogbrothers

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:12.490
its own separate thing, and, and kind of keeping
it the thing that it always has been. Um,

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.800
but Crash Course and SciShow allow us to live
our dream of making really educational content,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.110
um, which is what we always wanted to do,
we just never had the ability to do it, because

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.969
it takes a big team of people, like, I just
don't know enough about the French Revolution,

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:31.599
um, to make a video about it, you know. And
Hank, no offense, but like, Hank doesn't know

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:35.930
enough about meiosis to make an authoritative
video on it and he certainly doesn't know

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:41.240
enough about illustrating meiosis to, you
know, do all the animations necessary to,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.309
to explain it. Hank you wanna an...you wanna
answer some questions, or do you want me to

00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:47.309
keep going?

00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:51.460
H: I think that I could, if I had the skills
to be able to animate, I think that I would,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.699
I do have the knowledge necessary to animate
meiosis, but...

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:59.710
J: Whatever, I...you're always saying that
though. I...no one, no one is more convinced

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.599
of, of, of his, of his own breadth of talent
than my brother.

00:08:03.599 --> 00:08:10.449
H: I-I'm not saying talent, I'm just saying
I-I understand, uh, the basic levels of biology,

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:12.119
otherwise I could not do this.

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:17.469
J: Um, why is the new history show, this is
for me, consistently focused on military and

00:08:17.469 --> 00:08:21.620
religion, and why did you choose the particular
narrative that it has? Um, well, it's not

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.009
exclusively focused on military and religion,
I also talk a lot about the plague, and in

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:31.339
fact, I think, I think ultimately, arguably,
uh, as I said in, in yesterday's Vlogbrothers

00:08:31.339 --> 00:08:37.120
video, um, microbes have a bigger effect on
human history than either military or religion.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.860
Um, but, and there's also, there's also some
focus on, on technology and scientific development,

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:49.300
you know, things like, uh, how innovation,
inventions changed, um, uh, you know, made

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.600
the world smaller and made it easier to travel,
for instance across the Indian Ocean, things

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.750
like that. Um, but, you know, the focus is,
is on religion, partly because that was the,

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:04.580
or that was one of the focuses certainly,
of lives in the time period that I'm talking

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:12.470
about. So, you know, people, people's decisions,
their values, uh, were shaped a lot of times...uh,

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:16.149
almost always, actually...by, by their religious
beliefs, and as those religious beliefs changed,

00:09:16.149 --> 00:09:19.980
a lot of responses to it changed. I'm always
criticized by military historians for not

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:26.511
talking enough about wars, so, I'm glad you
think I talk too much about wars. Um, but

00:09:26.511 --> 00:09:31.360
you know, we, I try to be...I try to be as
broad as possible, um, but, you know, our,

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.930
I feel like my job is to try to talk about
how decisions that were made over the, by,

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:42.260
by people and also not by people, over the
course of, over the course of world history

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.040
led to the world that we have now. And that,
hopefully, will, allows us to, to think, sort

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.279
of more broadly, and with greater depth about
the decisions that we're making now that are

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:55.190
going to shape, uh, you know, the world for
the next thousand or five thousand years,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:01.009
or whenever, um, we end up killing ourselves
off. Hank, what was your favorite...

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:04.899
J: ...episode of Biology Crash Course, so
far?

00:10:04.899 --> 00:10:10.820
H: Umm, I don't know, I like the early stuff
a lot, uh, where we're talking about the...like,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:18.500
I'm a bio-chemist by training and so that,
that stuff was, uh, I get more into that stuff,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.879
despite the fact that most people don't. Um,
so I really enjoyed that. I also really enjoyed

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:29.019
the episode we just did on natural selection,
um, and, uh, because that that's, that's the

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:36.470
area that sort of gets the most attention,
in, in, uh, our world, uh, you know, in terms

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:42.019
of policy and, and like controversy, and I
just like, you know, the opportunity to talk

00:10:42.019 --> 00:10:46.730
about that in a way that's not talking about
the controversy and not, like, an argument

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.370
between two sides, but just presenting the
information, which I think John did a really

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:55.449
good job of as well, you know, when you're
talking about more hot-button topics in history

00:10:55.449 --> 00:11:01.630
like Islam and Christianity, and stuff like
that. So, it's really, really, you know, it's

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.720
great to have an opportunity to talk about
these things in an educational context on

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:10.370
the internet, when usually they're talked
about in a polemical context on the internet.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:14.560
J: Right, I mean, Hank and I are really interested,
really interested, and we have been for a

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:18.699
long time, in de-politicizing traditionally
politicized issues, particularly when they

00:11:18.699 --> 00:11:23.440
aren't political, like climate change, for
instance, which is not a political problem,

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:31.829
um, uh, or, uh yeah, or Islamic history, which
shouldn't be a political problem. Like, people

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:35.509
shouldn't be, people shouldn't...but uh, but
it is and you have to, you have to acknowledge

00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:39.060
the, the, the complexity of that. Like, I
mean, the weird, the weirdest part about making

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.819
that video, which was...that Islam video I
guess was my favorite so far, although I like

00:11:43.819 --> 00:11:49.829
this week's, the one that comes, goes up tomorrow,
about Mansa Musa in West Africa a lot. But,

00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:54.420
uh, the thing about that Islam video that
made me nervous was talking about, talking

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:59.750
about things that Sunnis and Shi'as still
disagree about. Um, and that, that was actually,

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.960
that was where most of the hot-button conversation
was, I mean the rest of the, i-i-it was great,

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.810
for the first couple days and we al...we always
experience this Hank, where the first couple

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:17.340
days, the discourse is astonishingly sophisticated
and thoughtful and then slowly it degenerates.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:22.769
H: There are fewer and fewer comments, and
uh, you start to see, that there will be one,

00:12:22.769 --> 00:12:28.399
like usually the crazy comments get pushed
down by the intelligent comments, and then,

00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:33.080
eventually there are fewer comments and so
the crazy comments don't get pushed down,

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:39.180
and people feel the need to respond to the
crazy people and then you end up with stupid

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:40.180
conversations.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:45.069
J: But I do that too, I feel that same urge
to respond to the troll.

00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:46.279
H: We have...we have a...

00:12:46.279 --> 00:12:49.310
Michael Aranda: I was, I was gonna say that
uh after the video goes up, you're probably

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.839
also getting fewer people who are subscribed
to the channel because they're interested

00:12:52.839 --> 00:12:53.839
in the content...

00:12:53.839 --> 00:12:54.839
H: Right.

00:12:54.839 --> 00:12:56.579
M: ...and more people that find the video
because they just Google "Islam."

00:12:56.579 --> 00:12:57.579
J: Right.

00:12:57.579 --> 00:13:00.339
H: Right, and they are looking for something
to argue about.

00:13:00.339 --> 00:13:05.160
J: Let me just tell you, Michael, incidentally,
that, um, if we can get to that point where

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.060
you Google "Islam" and the first thing that
comes up is Crash Course...

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.709
H: (laughs) That would be, that's winning!

00:13:13.709 --> 00:13:16.399
J: We're a long ways, we're a long ways off
from that but...

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:19.149
H: John, I have a question for you. I have
a question for you uh that no one is going

00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:24.500
to be polite enough to ask, why do you think
Crash Course history gets so many more views

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.300
than Crash Course biology?

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:34.230
J: Because it's about history and not about
biology. (laughs) Um, I mean, it's really,

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.830
it's pretty easy to make history populist,
I mean, to make history something that you

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:43.540
would choose to learn about. Um, there's a
relatively low barrier to entry, right, because

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:49.130
we're all, um, we're all human beings living
amid history and we all remember that there

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.660
was a French Revolution or something. Um,
when it comes to studying biology, it, it

00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:00.529
is, it is, I mean, I don't buy that hard/soft
science distinction, but there is that, there

00:14:00.529 --> 00:14:04.350
is that distinction in it. Like, you're gonna
have to learn some terminology, you're gonna

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:08.819
have to pay attention to the way that cells
are built in order to later understand natural

00:14:08.819 --> 00:14:12.759
selection. And, uh, there's a relatively high
barrier to entry there. So, I think that's

00:14:12.759 --> 00:14:17.699
the issue, although I mean, how astonishing
is it that just, just a few months into this

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:23.389
project, you know, 60 thousand or 70 thousand
people are choosing to watch videos about

00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:25.129
mitosis. I think it's awesome.

00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:30.329
H: Yeah, yup, I am, I'm pretty consistently
shocked, but what I always say to the people

00:14:30.329 --> 00:14:35.250
who are like, "Now what do you do?" and they're
like, "But who pays for that, who watches

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:39.540
that?" And I'm like, well, people who are
learning these things choose to come find

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.370
them. Or if they're not even learning them,
they're just curious. And that's the most

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:46.430
exciting thing to me, is that, like, we're
creating content that people come out, like

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.379
go out of their way to watch instead of you
know, have to watch in a classroom. Sorry,

00:14:50.379 --> 00:14:54.139
I just forgot to click on myself before my
monologue, but now I'm done.

00:14:54.139 --> 00:15:00.120
J: Oh, I'm glad people got to see me, see
me listening to you. Um, I have a question

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.160
from @philipwhite, and this has also been
asked by a lot of other people, um, it's:

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.589
Is Crash Course mostly supported by ads and
by Google, what makes your medium different

00:15:09.589 --> 00:15:15.759
from television, uh, and also I've frequently
seen, um, are you guys gonna charge schools

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:17.720
for Crash Course?

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:25.139
H: Umm, we are at the moment supported almost,
well, entirely. We are supported entirely

00:15:25.139 --> 00:15:31.499
by a grant from YouTube/Google, umm, and that
is the reason why we can make the content.

00:15:31.499 --> 00:15:38.279
Uh, there is a sort of hope that at some point,
uhh, this content could support itself through

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:43.269
advertising or through grants from other organizations.
Uh. There are lots of educational grants in

00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:49.959
the world. Umm, and, umm and also through
you know sales of Mongols T-shirts and, err,

00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:51.059
and we recently...

00:15:51.059 --> 00:15:55.360
J: Err, err, you're right, Hank, that's the
key...

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.360
H: Yeah.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.899
J: Mongols. We'll all be rich! (laugh)

00:15:58.899 --> 00:16:06.749
H: (laugh) I'm telling you that's the only
path to true success... It's the Mongols T-shirts.

00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:12.170
J: (laugh) To answer your other question,
uh, Crash Course is already taught in hundreds

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.630
of schools, which is amazing and something
that we are really excited about and really

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:20.759
grateful for. No, we don't charge them, no,
we won't charge them. The whole idea of this

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:28.400
project is to find a new way to make educational
materials possible that doesn't use that old

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.660
model of charging academic institutions for
the right to show those, umm to... to share

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:38.740
that... to share that stuff in class, um,
we don't like that model. We think that it's

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.730
inefficient; we think that, that schools could
spend their money in different and better

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:47.730
ways. Um, and we want them to be spending
their money in those ways, um and we want

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:53.139
this to be supported through other things,
whether it's advertising or grants or whatever.

00:16:53.139 --> 00:17:01.139
Um, so that was the idea of Crash Course,
you know we... we don't like the idea of...

00:17:01.139 --> 00:17:06.760
you know having schools fund, err, educational
video because we think there's a market for

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.920
educational video. We think people want to
watch it. We don't think people need to be

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.880
forced to watch it, um...

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:17.620
H: It's also very interesting to have, uh,
come to the realization that, um, you know

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:21.440
this, these things like what we're doing,
you know, when you do it for free, people

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.290
have a harder time taking you seriously, and
they're like, well, one, you don't have a

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:29.500
bunch of money to pay like salespeople to
go into schools and try and sell the content,

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:35.470
and try and like, explain to teachers, like,
like, do a, do a symposium at, like, at you

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.001
know a teacher conference, and talk about
how useful this content is, and that's what

00:17:39.001 --> 00:17:45.460
all the for-profit institutions are doing,
and so we are in this situation where, we're

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:50.090
creating content that may very well be better,
it's certainly cheaper ('cause it's free),

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:56.571
um, but uh, a lot of places are less interested
in it, because they don't understand, like

00:17:56.571 --> 00:18:02.180
how could this be better if it's so much cheaper.
Which is an interesting problem.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:08.490
J: Right, [laughs] well, but you know, we're
just getting started, so it'll work out, umm,

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.870
Hank? Are you looking at Twitter, because
I'm looking at Twitter, I can keep asking

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.620
questions, but I thought maybe you wanted
to.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.470
H: I don't know, I don't understand how you
can multitask like that.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.820
J: What do you mean, look at Twitter and also
talk?

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:19.820
H: Yeah!

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:24.861
J: Um, well, I mean, that's, first off, when
you're talking, I'm looking at Twitter, I'm

00:18:24.861 --> 00:18:30.320
not listening to whatever boring crap you're
saying, so, so there's that.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.550
H: Ag, uuuh, well there's, uh, there's Katie.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.250
J: Oh, more importantly...no but okay...

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.590
H: (laughs) - Uh-

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.590
J: Uh-

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.590
H: Sorry.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:41.190
J: You talk, Hank.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:46.840
H: Uhm, there's Katie who - ooh, shoot - who
asks, "Will Crash Course ever be used for

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:51.310
charitable purposes like teaching people in
third world countries who can't afford schooling?"

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:56.900
J: Well it's already used for that in the
broadest sense. I mean, the great thing about

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:02.940
the mobile internet and the spread of broadband
internet to the developing world, is that

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:08.980
it allows us to sort of take a jump in terms
of infrastructure development, at least hopefully,

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:15.490
so that you don't have to develop telegraph
lines and then telephone lines and then dial-up

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:19.720
and then this and this and this. You can go
straight to 3G or 4G, which means that all

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:25.470
of a sudden not just students outside of schools
in the developing world, but also students

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:30.780
in schools in the developing world have the
opportunity to take advantage of all of the

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:34.220
many educational resources that are freely
available on the Internet, whether it's Khan

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:40.030
Academy or Crash Course or Ted-Ed, which is
doing great stuff, or MinutePhysics, or CGP

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:44.580
Grey -- whatever it is -- and that's really
really exciting to us, and one of the things

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:51.980
that gets us fired up and makes us wanna do
this is the believe that education is central

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:57.670
to development, and that the biggest hurdle
to development on some level is education,

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.140
and this isn't...

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:03.980
J: ...the only way, I don't think that it's
a magic bullet but I think that it's one way.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:09.940
And so I'm...I'm really excited about that,
and it's already happening. We already see

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:15.001
lots of YouTube comments in Crash Course and
SciShow from the developing world, and hopefully

00:20:15.001 --> 00:20:18.610
in three to five years we'll see many many
more.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:23.570
H: I have another question for you, this one
from Samantha. "What is the deal with the

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.960
phrase of the week?" Cuz I don't really understand
it either, John.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:29.470
J: Yeah, it was probably not a good idea in
retrospect.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:30.470
H: (laughs)

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:35.780
J: And I've never explained it well. So, here's
how it works. Every week, we take a phrase

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:41.370
that someone suggested in comments, and we
put it in the video. We somehow manage to

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:48.260
find a way to insert it into the script of
the video. And, the idea there was that people

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:51.340
would guess at the phrase of the week and
then they would suggest phrases of the week.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.720
But people mostly have found it very confusing,
which has left us with relatively few phrases

00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:01.330
of the week suggested, which makes it even
harder to work them into comments, which is

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.390
why I had to write an entire episode about
Kim Kardashian.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.650
H: (laughs fully)

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:11.140
J: I was like, "There's no way I can work
Kim Kardashian's name into an episode of Crash

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.750
Course. I guess I'm just going to have to
write the episode of Crash Course about Kim

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:15.750
Kardashian."

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:20.270
H: What a disaster! John, a question from
Meeva. "Do you think that Crash Course will

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:29.560
branch out into literature and the arts from
its less literature and arts-based foundations?"

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:37.320
J: Uhm, yeah, I mean we are, I dunno, I'd
love to teach art history down the road, and

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.260
I definitely would like to teach some kind
of world literature class. It's challenging

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:46.950
because while everyone is a part of human
history, not everyone has read "Things Fall

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.460
Apart." You know, everyone knows there was
a French Revolution, not everyone is deeply

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:56.480
familiar with the plot of Macbeth or desires
to read it again. So I think that's one of

00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:00.480
the challenges, but we definitely want to
do it. We just have to figure out the right

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.880
way to do it. Whether that's all of us read
the book together and then talk about it,

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:11.540
or whatever it is, whether we focus on shorter
works which most early college classes tend

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.570
to do now, for better or worse... I don't
know.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.070
That's something I'd like to do, I'd love
to do arts, art history... I'd love to do

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:27.100
"Comp," like English language and usage and
grammar. I know that that stuff sounds really

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:33.560
boring, but it is actually astonishingly exciting.
I get really geeked out about it, and, like,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:41.020
when we get to talk about what is and is not
wrong with ending a sentence with a preposition

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:46.480
and what a preposition is and how it functions
in the world and how it opens up the world

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.090
of observation to us, I get really really
psyched.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:54.140
So Hank, what do you want to teach?

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.720
H: Uhm, I don't know, science?

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.290
J: (laughs) Good job, Hank!

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:01.310
H: Stuff.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:02.340
J: Stuff?

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.910
H: Yeah, more science-y stuff.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:11.570
J: Do you wanna teach like, uh, physics, or
teach liiiiike, uuuh, geology?

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:20.020
H: Well, both of those are very interesting
to me. I would really like to teach biochemistry,

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:23.600
just because that I just know a lot about
it.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600
J: Right.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.890
H: I get excited about it pretty easily. I'd
love to have someone teach physics, but I

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:31.790
don't think that I'm the right person.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.570
J: No, I also would love to have someone teach
physics.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:42.480
H: And I also think, uh, I really... there's
sort of a distinction between sort of hard

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:48.830
physics of, like, of Newtonian and also beyond,
and then there's a discussion of sort of broader,

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:54.880
like, this is how weird quantum mechanics
is. And I like to talk about that stuff even

00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:01.010
though at a base mathematical level I am nowhere
near, um, understanding it, but...

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:04.960
J: Could you talk about that stuff without
talking about the math, though? I mean, that's

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:05.960
one of my...

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:11.000
H: Well you could talk about, like, what a
quark physically is, what color charge means...

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
J: Right.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.660
H: Why they change color, what the weak force
is, what the strong force is, um, you could

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.020
talk about that stuff, and you can do it in
a way that's...that's, y'know, lets people

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:30.520
understand it. So you actually get a pretty
marvelously good understanding of the structure

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:34.490
of the universe without having to talk about
math and that...we talk about that stuff on

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:42.940
SciShow. To do a course on quantum physics
would be cool, but probably would better be

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.710
done by someone who is not me.

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:48.890
J: Right, that reminds me of when I was writing
Will Grayson, Will Grayson, and I was writing

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:54.060
about Schrödinger's cat, and I had this like,
I had this character, this, this, seventeen-year-old

00:24:54.060 --> 00:25:00.940
girl Jane, uhm, going on and on and on about
the mathematics involved in the problem that

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:06.250
led to the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment,
um, all of which, almost all of which was

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:11.720
written by my cousin, Blake, um... It wasn't
even written by me. By my cousin, I mean Sarah's

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:12.850
cousin, Hank's like...

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.630
J &amp; H: We don't have a cousin Blake. (both
laugh)

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.990
J: Blake who? Blake, he just had a baby, he
didn't have the baby, his wife, had the baby...this

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:26.160
is a disaster of a story, um... but my point
is, that eventually, it became obvious to

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:31.160
me that having this like six-page monologue
from this seventeen-year-old girl about math

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.310
I didn't understand was not going to be an
asset to my novel.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:36.360
(Hank laughs)

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.810
H: I just have received word that my wife
has a question.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:40.900
J: All right.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:45.540
Katherine: I just think it might be interesting
for people to know what the process is for

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:51.320
every Crash Course video, because I know that
it's different for each of you. So you could

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:52.330
talk about that.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:58.190
H: I don't know if you heard Katherine but
what she said was, uh, maybe our processes

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:02.060
for creating Crash Course videos are different,
and maybe we could talk about the actual process

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.120
behind how it works.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.130
J: Sure.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.490
K: Like Hank's have to be made farther in
advance...

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:14.340
H: ...from beginning to end. Yeah, mine are
made quite a long time in advance. We're about

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:20.360
eight episodes out now. By the time the episode
goes online I'm like "What? I don't remember

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.970
that. What is this stuff?" That's not ideal.

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:30.190
J: Ours is filmed well in advance too, um.
I think we're about the same far... the same

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:35.520
amount out. By the way Hank, CGP Grey is watching
us, don't get nervous....but, um, he's asking

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:40.310
questions so I think he's watching us. He
just asked, "How do you feel talking about

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:44.670
subjects on which you might not be experts
yourselves?" To which my answer is, uhh not

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:49.360
so bad. I mean, I'm not a historian at all,
and here I am cranking away like an expert.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.050
I mean, we have educators working with us,
so that's the reason I don't feel that nervous

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.880
about it, but it is a little weird.

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:02.760
But to answer Katherine's question, um, yeah
it's very different from traditional video

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:10.351
blogging because...well, I don't know about
you, Hank, but I'm in a studio, and um, Stan

00:27:10.351 --> 00:27:16.470
and Danica are there with me, and y'know,
they're there to make sure that, y'know the

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.940
lighting is right and all the stuff that I
never understood in video blogging and the

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:25.620
sound sounds good, and that, y'know Danica
makes the beautiful chalkboard illustrations

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:29.910
and all that stuff, um... and then....but
the rest of it really is like video blogging

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:35.920
except that I usually don't make a video blog
from a script because, y'know I'm talking

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.410
in my own words about something I care about,
um, and so that is a little bit like video

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:45.220
blogging. I don't know what your experience
is, though.

00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.210
H: Yeah. But we don't... we write scripts
for Vlogbrothers videos too.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.450
(Katherine saying something in background)

00:27:49.450 --> 00:27:51.840
J: Oh, I don't. (Laughs) Do you, a lot?

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.600
H: Yeah, I script a fair amount.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.150
J: Wow. I don't.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:00.380
H: Yeah. I always find it goes significantly
better by script.

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.910
J: I do script, uh, the "Thoughts From Places,"
you'll be surprised to hear.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.050
H: Oh, really. (Laughs)

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:08.120
J: Yeah...astonishing.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:15.810
K: When I think about the Crash Course and
Sci Show, and if you planned the...breadth

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.930
of the whole, of the series of videos.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.990
H: Right, so I mean we start out...

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:26.090
(Katherine in background) K: From beginning
to end, what you've planned for. Those topics

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.810
are pretty much chosen, right?

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.440
J: Right, yeah, so I always start with like
forty topics.

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:36.350
H: We sit down at the beginning of the process,
and we, we y'know, sat down with a biology

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:42.880
textbook, with a biology teacher, with, y'know,
sort of the AP guide to what you're supposed

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.130
to know at the end of an AP biology class,
and we were like, "OK, how are we going to

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:51.470
put these into classes?" and we've stuck to
that pretty much. Occasionally there will

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:55.810
be a script that is, y'know, twenty pages
long, and we'll be like "we should probably

00:28:55.810 --> 00:29:00.230
do this in two episodes." Uh, but generally,
you can do that.

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:05.600
J: Yeah, when we first started the writer,
Raul Meyer, sent a list of 40 topics he wanted

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:09.930
to cover and we had a little bit of back and
forth about which, you know, which 40 we should

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:14.240
go with and then we, we eventually figured
it out. Although now I wanna make, I wanna

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.930
make a full 41st one, because I promised the
last episode would be about the, the t-shirts

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.650
and the global economy, which, as you know,
Hank, is something I find completely fascinating,

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:28.680
much to your consternation. Umm, and I really,
really want to make that video so I, we might

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.710
have to cut something along the way or I'll
just do a special bonus episode.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:36.980
Speaking of special bonus episodes we have
a couple surprises, and Hank, do you wanna

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.850
crank one of those out now, since we're at
the midway point of our, of our live show?

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.420
H: Yeah, let me just get it ready.

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:47.190
J: Okay, Hank is gonna get something ready.
While he does that I will answer another question.

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.760
Um, "would you let someone outside the Vlogbrothers
teach in Crash Course?"

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.940
Absolutely! Um, you know, the reason that
we haven't so far is strictly, frankly, kind

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.450
of a budgetary thing. Um, Hank and I are free!

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:04.960
J: Ahh... we're free and we have a lot of
experience at doing this and we kind of know

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:08.470
how to do it and there aren't that many people
who know how to do it, and those who do generally

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:13.230
aren't free. Umm... a lot of people in comments,
Hank, have suggested that we have Neil Tyson,

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:17.780
umm, Neil deGrasse Tyson teach physics, which
would be great...

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:19.060
H: That would be great!

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.910
J: I don't think he's available.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:22.830
H: Yeah, he's a busy guy.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.220
J: He's got a bunch of stuff going on.

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.960
H: This is a very time-consuming project that
we do here. Okay, so I'm going to try to do

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:35.801
this. There's no guarantee that it will work
but we, ah, we have a process by which, by

00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:42.590
which we do this, so I'm just going to share
one of my windows, and, uh, and then we will

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.980
watch a video.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.210
J: Hopefully.

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.440
H: Yup.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.750
J: {in outtakes video} Oh...we're recording...oh
God.

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:56.870
Hi, my name is John Green, and this is Crash
Course World Histor-whoops! (laughs)

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:02.430
OW. Hi, my name's OW...my name is John Green,
and I'm the host of Crash Course world history,

00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.680
and that hurt.

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:17.200
Hi there, my name's John Green, this is champagne
in a plastic cup, and today, we're going to

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.140
talk about Egypt, as you might have guessed
from the hieroglyphics behind me. Pardon me,

00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:20.140
I'm drunk.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.140
Hi, there, my name is John Green, this is
Crash Course-I'm gonna do that again (laughing)

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.140
The fall of Rome, according to-ahh.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:23.140
Hi, I'm John Green and today's...GOD.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:37.720
J: {in hangout} Hank...did you just...go away?
Hank...can you hear...Hank, talk.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.270
(Hank and Katherine mutter inaudibly)

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.780
J: Now I'm scared because I'm alone in the
live show.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:45.320
H: ...and the answer is no.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:50.720
J: Hank? Hank, I can hear what you're saying,
just so you know. Hank, hi.

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.260
J: {in outtakes} Aw, I missed it.

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.590
Next week, we will journey to-mmm. missed
it.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:56.590
J: {in hangout} Oh, hello, again, Hank!

00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:00.410
J: {in outtakes} Is it anti-feminist to never
talk about women except when I'm talking about

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:01.820
how their brutal...

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:06.510
J: {in hangout} This isn't going well. Can
we exit...

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:11.680
H: I tried. Can you not hear me? (breaks up)

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:17.430
J: ...video. We'll upload it, we'll upload
it so that you can actually watch it instead

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:22.970
of seeing it in a series of apparent screen-caps.
It's an episode of Crash Course outtakes that,

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.890
um, that Stan put together. There's also one
of Hank's.

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:29.850
Hank, you're a beautiful black screen right
now.

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.850
H: Can you hear me?

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.510
J: Can you hear me?

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:36.220
H: I can hear you, but you can't hear me.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:39.290
J: Yeah, I can hear everything you're saying.
I could hear everything you were saying while

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.680
the video was playing too.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.320
H: (laughing) Oh, was I saying...

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.320
J: Yeah.

00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.370
H: Did I say any curse words?

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:45.370
K: Yeah.

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.200
J: No, I don't think you said any specific
curse words, but they were implied.

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.440
H: (laughs)

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:53.930
J: Um, anyway, is there any way that you can
not be a gigantic black screen, 'cause it

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:54.930
makes me sad.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:58.790
H: I would also love to not be a gigantic
black screen.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:03.310
J: I miss when you looked like a Hank! That
was my favorite part of the show...was when

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:05.600
you looked like Hank.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:13.530
H: (laughs) I also...I love it when uh.....I
have such a good voice though, John.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.100
J: Find a way to turn off the screen-share,
that's the key.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.660
H: Oh, no, I've done that.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:23.870
J: Oh. You just don't have...is your camera
not on anymore? Do you not have the little

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:25.050
green light that I have?

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:26.790
H: My camera's on.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:30.270
J: Oh. All right! Rock n' roll, man!

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.270
H: (giggles)

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:35.900
J: Um. I guess you should just put me up on
the screen and then you will just be a voice.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.630
H: You're up on the screen.

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:43.800
J: Okaaaay. It's just gonna be me from here
on out, it seems like, so I will, uh...I don't

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:50.330
know, anyway, so we both have, ah, we both
have made, we both made special outtakes videos.

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:51.810
(John's voice played back very loudly from
Hank's end)

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:57.510
J: Hank, that was very loud. Don't do that
again. Um. We both have...we both have special

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:02.650
outtakes videos for you guys, uh, that you
can watch, um. But we'll upload them to the

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:07.440
Crash Course channel or Vlogbrothers or something
so that you can watch them instead of just

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.980
doing it this way.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:14.409
All right, so I guess I will ans...I will
ask some more questions of the disembodied

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:18.160
black screen that used to be my brother.

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.380
Hank: [laughs]

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:26.630
John: Um...um...ahhhh... do you do foreign
subtitles at all, Hank?

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:27.630
Hank: Uh...

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:31.149
John: Some one asked it, someone offered to
make Czech subtitles to Crash Course and said

00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:33.540
if we, if he made them would we use them?
Or she?

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:38.850
Hank: Let me just switch over to me black
screen so you guys can see me... [laughs]

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.110
John: Yeah, please don't.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:44.810
Hank: Yeah, I mean, we, ah, we are actually
investigating at the moment... [laughs at

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:45.899
John dancing on screen]

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:49.690
John: Sorry, I figured, they can't see you
then I'll do something funny on the screen

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.780
to be entertaining, while you are talking.
Do do doo do do do doo [singing circus type

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:54.780
music]

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:59.750
Hank: Um, yeah, yeah, we are looking at, ah,
at an application where, we're looking at

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:05.290
creating an application of sorts that will
allow us to streamline the creation of, of

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:10.750
subtitles to our videos because that's something
that we really want to, not just for Crash

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.660
Course and SciShow but for all of the internet,
to...

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:14.670
John: Right.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:20.520
Hank: ...be, to have access to. Um, we're
just not, we have always felt like there could

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:23.790
be a much better system to do that, and hasn't
been.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:28.000
J: And the answer to your question, first
off, all the World History episodes are already

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.690
subtitled in English. The answer to your question,
"would we use Czech subtitles if you gave

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:36.190
them to us" is yes. Although we don't know
how to use them yet, so we would have to learn

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:42.500
how to use them, but we will. So yes. That
is the answer to that question. Um, someone

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:47.290
says that they're listening to dubstep while
they uh, while they watch us, Hank.

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:53.080
H: Well that's okay, because our, our uh,
manager of the office here listens to dubstep

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.930
while he manages us.

00:35:54.930 --> 00:36:02.000
J: Wow. Um...that's, that's, that's crazy.
Um, I'm gonna ask you some more questions,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Hank.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
H: Okay.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.750
J: You can also ask me questions now that
you are, you are just a black screen.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:09.330
H: I am.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:13.680
J: Um, how much of your houses have been turned
into video studios? [Laughs]

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.370
H: Only like a third or so.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:21.750
J: Well, Hank's house is very small, because
it's a green house. Not in the sense that

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:26.400
it's owned by a person named Green, but in
the sense that it is an, uh, eco-friendly

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.870
house. Right?

00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:30.370
H: Uh...I don't know about that.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:35.080
J: I don't know, it strikes me as very green.
You have like, bamboo flooring or something.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:42.330
H: Yeah, it's uh, it's a, it's a new house.
It is...it's fairly small, I guess, by modern

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:43.330
standards... um...

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:46.550
J: Yeah, by modern standards, but whenever
you go into like... That's one of the things

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:49.270
that I've been really into, actually, when
researching Crash Course. And I will let you

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:53.730
finish in a moment, but, you know, since you're
just a black screen right now, I-I own the

00:36:53.730 --> 00:37:01.840
video now! Um, but, uh, in researching Crash
Course, I am always astonished by the luxury

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:10.670
that we take for granted that was literally
nonexistent in 99.9995% of the population

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.220
until like 80 years ago.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:19.960
H: Yeah. Well, yeah, when I went to Haiti
and, like, we...I, like, went over to someone's

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:30.690
house, um, and it was their, um, their bedroom,
um, and there was...it was a two-room house,

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:36.330
one of their rooms had a bed in it. You walked
into the door--it had a door--you walked into

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:43.180
the door and there was a bed and there was
a desk and it was maybe, you know, 20 square

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:49.950
feet. And then behind that, there was another
bed and another desk and another sort of room,

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:53.290
and then -- and this was a nice, like, this
was a nice house in Haiti. And then out the

00:37:53.290 --> 00:38:01.050
back there was a pit toilet, and, like, that
was, you know, like, a couple of people doing

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:02.050
fairly well.

00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:03.060
J: Yeah.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:08.410
H: And, um, so it's always very strange to
me when people refer to my house as small.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.410
[Laughs]

00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:13.830
J: Yeah, no, I mean your house is not small,
but it's small compared to most American houses,

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:14.830
um.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:20.240
H: Yeah, um, so I...yeah, you know, but we
got, you've got the radiant floor heating

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.720
and it's basically a refrigerator in there...

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.720
J: Right.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:27.110
H: ...in terms of letting heat out, um, so
we have to have an air circulation system

00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:28.810
or else we'd suffocate, um.

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:34.760
J: Yeah, yeah. That all sounds very fancy.
I just live in a normal American house, because

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:35.760
unlike you...

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.760
H: A very normal American house.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:45.060
J: ...with your crazy Montana wilderness leftism,
I'm an American. A regular, normal American.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:49.920
[Hank laughs] So, uh, long story short, I
also converted about a third of my house into

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:55.920
a video studio. Um, but my third is bigger.
[Laughs]

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.440
H: Right, yes, um... One of...one of my bedrooms
is a video studio, um.

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:05.530
J: Yeah, uh, my whole basement is and then
I do some filming upstairs, as well. Umm...

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:10.810
H: But then, I would show you around our office
and show you, like, 'cause right now I'm in-

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.010
I'm in the Crash Course offices, this is not
my house, um.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:14.010
J: Yeah.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:19.080
H: I would show you around if you could see
me, but you can't.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:25.590
J: Um, um, will you, um, will you look at
some questions while- while you're there being

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:28.090
a black screen, so that we can answer good
questions?

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:29.750
H: Yeah, sure.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:35.470
J: Um, oh, uh, Manu...uh, on Twitter has a
really important question for you, Hank, which

00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.740
is that have you tried turning it on and off
again?

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:42.210
H: [Laughs] I mean, I could do that, but then
the entire Hangout would end.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:47.090
J: Oh, uh, there's apparently already a cool
app that Philip DeFranco uses for open source

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.090
subtitles.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:49.090
H: Oh, really?

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:56.390
J: Yeah, it's called, um, captiontube.appsbot.com.
So thank you very much for letting us know

00:39:56.390 --> 00:40:00.040
about that, Christine. Um, uh...

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:06.440
J: Okay, Hank. Oh, someone wants Hank to join,
uh, CGP Grey suggested Hank join the video

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:16.690
on a third laptop, which isn't a terrible
idea, um. Okay, um, so Hank, let's, uh...do

00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:22.010
you have questions for me, or should I keep
asking you questions? By the way, we're answering

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:27.410
questions on Twitter @TheCrashCourse, and
also @realjohngreen and @hankgreen. There

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:31.000
are a lot of questions about interns, Hank.
I don't know if all these interns live in

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.869
Montana or not, but there are a lot of them
so I thought I'd ask.

00:40:35.869 --> 00:40:39.440
H: What do you mean by interns? Our interns?

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:44.550
J: Do- Do you have need of them? There seem
to be a lot of people who wish to become your

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:45.550
intern.

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:50.100
H: Oh, um, yeah! I mean, we need people to
help all the time, but I don't know...uh,

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.700
we-we also would need an intern to have the
capacity to hire and manage interns.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:58.930
J: [Laughs] Yeah, sort of the biggest problem
that we have right now is figuring out...is

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:04.630
figuring out that, um. But yes, down the road,
certainly, we do want to have interns, um.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.369
Uh, Crash Course Indianapolis is going to
have an intern over the summer starting, uh,

00:41:09.369 --> 00:41:13.051
in a couple weeks, um, and I think that- that
will be great for us. But, uh, I don't know-

00:41:13.051 --> 00:41:20.160
I don't know about anything else. Um, um...
do you have any other questions, Hank, or

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.160
do you want me to keep going?

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:25.190
H: I'm sorry, the reason why I'm not, um,
answering questions is because I'm trying

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:26.800
to fix the problem that we're having.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:32.430
J: Okay, well then I'll-I'll answer some questions.
Um, someone asks -- Nigel Prentice asks, "Hey,

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:36.890
how can I score some 2D glasses?" So for those
of you who don't know, my brother Hank invented

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:43.540
the 2D glasses, uh, which are like 3D glasses
except that you go to a 3D movie and you see

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:50.580
that movie in a crisp 2-dimensions. Uh, you
can get them at 2D-glasses.com, is that right

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:58.520
Hank? Whatever, just Google 2D glasses, um,
but yeah. Hank...[Laughs] I think it's...of

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.590
all of the things that Hank has invented,
and he has invented far too many things, 2D

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:09.140
glasses are my favorite because they're extremely
funny and, um, also astonishingly useful,

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.910
so, most things aren't.

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:11.910
H: [Laughs in background]

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:15.990
J: I'm just gonna keep talking while Hank,
uh, mumbles quietly to his team because apparently

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.220
he's not figured out how to mute himself on
video.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:23.180
H: [Laughs] I did, I figured it out, I just
undid it and then I redid it and then I undid

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.460
it again and it was....

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.450
J: Yup, well Hank, there's only 15 minutes
left so I'm not sure that there's necessarily

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:33.340
that much purpose to getting your face back
for 10 minutes. I'd rather have a high-quality

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:36.890
conversation between me, my face, and you,
a black screen.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:38.590
H: Okay, let's do that.

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:42.750
J: Okay, great, so we'll just do what we were
doing until you decided to try to make it

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:43.750
work.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:44.750
K: Why don't you just [inaudible]

00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:49.240
H: Someone asked when I got a corgi because
recently in a video I showed myself with a

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:54.660
couple of dogs, a greyhound and a corgi. Uh,
that was my greyhound. It was not my corgi,

00:42:54.660 --> 00:43:00.190
that corgi was named Abby and it sometimes
lives in our office. It is the corgi of our

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:06.450
technical director, Nick Jenkins, who you
will sometimes hear me refer to, as John will

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:13.321
occasionally refer to Stan. I will refer to
Jenkins or Nick. Don't call him "Leroy." He

00:43:13.321 --> 00:43:14.860
doesn't like it.

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:21.730
J: [laughs] I do like referring to Stan, but
it has to be said that generally, when I make

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:28.700
references to Stan, it's because of actual
things that Stan did or said moments before

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:36.890
that was recorded. I don't know if that's
true for you and Leroy, but, um...

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:45.710
H: [groans/laughs] Um...yeah. Uh...Yes, Nick
is standing there the whole time while we're

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:46.710
making those videos.

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:47.710
J: Wow.

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:52.580
H: So he'll be telling me to do things and
I will invariably say, "Okay, Mom." [John

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.540
laughs] Because he's always like, "Look into
the camera!" And I...

00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:01.480
J: A number of people have asked me to, have
asked me to teach a creative writing Crash

00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.220
Course, which I can't do because I don't know
how to teach creative writing. Um, I have

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:09.840
no idea how to teach such a thing, but there
are people who can do it and I admire them.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:15.110
But I know absolutely nothing about how to
write a story except by, by doing it. Um,

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:21.131
so I wouldn't know how to teach that. And
right now we're focused on more, um, I would

00:44:21.131 --> 00:44:27.180
say traditionally academic subjects that're
maybe undertaught or not taught as well as

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:33.300
they could be at schools. Whereas I think,
um, certainly at colleges...creative writing...there

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.480
tend to be really good creative writing professors
because there are a lot of writers who teach

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.840
for a living, or for part of their living,
anyway.

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:48.240
H: I've also got a question: uh, are we ever
going to join forces and make an epic history

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.380
of biology or the biology of history episode?

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:54.280
J: That would be good. We should do that.

00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.280
H: I like that idea.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:45:00.430
J: I like...I actually think that's kind of
a cool idea. Uh, later on, when...you know,

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:06.160
when we both...maybe in, like, the 30th week
or something, when Crash Course World History

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:13.890
is relatively modern and Biology is relatively
human-focused, it might be really cool to

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:18.340
talk about the relationship between history
and microbes, or to talk about the relationship

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:23.100
between, you know, evolutionary biology and
contemporary history or something. That might

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.180
be cool.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:30.220
H: I'm also really interested in the actual
history of science. Um, like the men and women

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:38.930
who basically created the institution of science
and the people who created biochemistry and

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:42.550
sort of founded of genetics and...a lot of
these people...and...we do a series on SciShow

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:45.030
called "Great Minds"...Is that what it's called?

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.030
M: Yep.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:51.860
H: That's what it's called. And that's been
really interesting to do. We...I don't...I

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:56.460
know this is written, but I don't know if
we've recorded it yet, but we did a great

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:59.180
episode on Fritz Haber. Was that his name,
Mike?

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.060
M: We also did the Marie Curie one, right?

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:09.430
H: The Marie Curie one is, like...was featured
in the New York Times and, um, on Jezebel,

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:11.430
which I find equally impressive.

00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:15.890
J: [laughs] My two favorite news sources.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:22.570
H: [laughs] Um, and so people obviously like
those a lot, but Fritz Haber's a super-interesting

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:27.750
dude because he basically saved billions of
people by trying to kill people for the Germans

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:33.990
in World War I and then went on to create
chemical weaponry, and his wife was so despondent

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:39.520
that he was only interested in killing people
that she told him to stop or else. He said,

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.470
"No," and she shot herself to death.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:42.500
J: Wow.

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:44.340
H: And then he went to a party!

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:50.401
J: Wow. Yeah, I mean, they-they-they are,
some...you know, the people who have a big

00:46:50.401 --> 00:46:55.910
impact on history tend to be maybe perhaps
a bit eccentric. But I do also think that

00:46:55.910 --> 00:47:01.710
it goes both ways, that we also sort of look
to the eccentric stories and put them at the

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:02.990
center of history. You know?

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:06.770
H: Well, I mean, the dude figured out how
to fix nitrogen, which doesn't sound that

00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:12.880
impressive but he...it basically made it so
that all of Europe didn't starve at the beginning

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.270
of the 19th century.

00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:20.370
J: Right. But...but I'm just saying, I'm just
saying there were lots of historical actors,

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:23.220
important historical actors, who weren't crazy.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.410
H: Yes. That's true.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:31.970
J: I feel like it's an under-appreciated fact
of both the history... of both history and

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:35.980
the history of science like...Cantor, for
instance, hugely important mathematician but,

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:41.670
like, these days, famous mostly for devoting
the second half of his life to trying to prove

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:43.240
that Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.240
H: Right.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.010
J: Um, and that seems to me, it seems to me
a little unfortunate that we end up conflating

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:54.100
genius and insanity. There does seem to be
a bit of casual relationship between the two.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.760
H: I, ah, I would like to see some data on
that.

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.750
J: [laughs] Well, I mean, I, I, I know a lot
of crazy people who aren't geniuses.

00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:03.260
H: [undecipherable talking under John] What?

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:06.370
J: I said I, I know a lot of crazy people
who aren't geniuses. Um...

00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:07.370
H: It's true.

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:08.370
John: Including myself, um..

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:13.350
H: It's true. I think what, what we really
need to do is, is sort of figure out the per-capita

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:14.350
level of crazy.

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:15.510
J: Right, um...

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:17.500
H: It's prpbably pretty high.

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.660
J: Yeah, I don't know, I mean I think it's
probably pretty high. For Hank, besides the

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:25.960
AP Curriculum, how do you determine what to
talk about in the Biology Crash Course videos?

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:27.890
Well first he chooses what's sexy.

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:30.060
Hank: That's true actually!

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:31.060
J: Really?

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:34.430
Hank: Ah, we try and find things where we
can have the title of the video have the word

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:35.430
sex in it.

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:36.430
J: [laughs]

00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:40.260
H: Which is pretty easy in biology. (?)
Um, no, it's, ah, it's ...

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:41.780
J: Keep it classy, Green.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:48.480
H: It's the stuff that I really enjoy, that,
um, eheheh we like to have it all, you know

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:55.850
it's ten minutes long so there has to be kind
of a narrative, um, and so we try and, and

00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:02.070
when we're figuring out what to talk about
to create a, ah, a story around it, but generally

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:08.360
we do choose a lot of it based on exact, like,
those, that exact, criteria, which is, you

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:13.440
know we're trying to teach a course here,
and so there's standards that have been decided

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.920
upon, and I may not agree with them, but we're
going to agree with them, because otherwise

00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:20.490
we're not helping people. So..

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:26.300
J: Right. Yeah, I think it's important, it's
important to note there that, um, Hank and

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:31.220
I, both, when we're making these videos and
really, and also in SciShow and, um, and in

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:36.980
Vlogbrothers too like, we do look for narratives.
We look for ways to tell stories, like even

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:40.859
though I was sick yesterday, and I'm still
quite sick, I apologize by the way if I'm

00:49:40.859 --> 00:49:45.110
off my game a little bit, but my, my head
is pounding with tiny chicken poop.

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:52.869
Um, even then, um, I try to make a, a, a story
about Sarah calling me, and telling me that

00:49:52.869 --> 00:49:57.370
I had to vote and going to vote, and when,
when I'm making history videos I think about

00:49:57.370 --> 00:50:00.240
that a lot, I think about the fact that this
is a show, um...

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:05.100
J: ...and history is a narrative and that's
one of the ways to make it engaging and to,

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:09.270
to, to make the learning process, I think
deeper in a way, is if you can engage with

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:13.400
it as narrative and not just engage with it
as a set of facts that appear to have been,

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:18.750
like, laid at your door step that you now
have to memorize, um, so.. for instance, a

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:22.590
lot of people have asked if there's any way
that we could ever make a Crash Course about

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:27.270
math, or math is just "too boring". Well,
the truth of math is that it's not boring

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:32.790
at all, as you know if you watch Vi Hart videos.
Um, math is really exciting, and it's also

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:36.609
in many ways, very narrative. I mean, Hank
was talking about the history of science but

00:50:36.609 --> 00:50:42.331
the history of math is-is, equally exciting,
and, uh, and in the same way that the history

00:50:42.331 --> 00:50:47.580
of science is marked by these, y'know, huge
discoveries that then lead to these big consolidations

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:51.220
of knowledge, the same thing happened in the
history of mathematics. And, y'know, talking

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:54.620
about that from a historical perspective turns
it into a narrative and I think it makes it

00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:58.171
a lot more fun to learn about, so I do think
there is a way to teach math and to have it

00:50:58.171 --> 00:50:59.880
be really interesting.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:06.410
H: I have a question from moymoymccardo. It
is, "Michael Aranda is awesome!!!"

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:14.950
J: (laughs) I wasn't aware that that was a
question. Um, I've never doubted Michael Aranda's

00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:15.950
awesome.

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:16.950
H: (laughs)

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:21.880
J: Um. Okay Hank, people...eeh...Hector Hernandez
says, "Where do you get your information from

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:26.500
in Crash Course and why don't you cite it?"
It's a good question.

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.210
H: Do you not cite it?

00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:31.440
K: Biology does citations every video.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:36.470
H: Katherine, who is in charge of citations,
says that Biology does citations on every

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:38.740
video, so this question is clearly for John.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:43.410
J: Well, biology, yeah, the biology part is
really well cited. Um. We don't-we don't cite

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:49.900
things because, um, I wouldn't know how to
begin citations. So for when we begin, we

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.869
talk-we've done a couple of videos-I don't
think any of them have uploaded yet-where

00:51:52.869 --> 00:51:58.670
we talk about sort of deep reads of a book,
a famous book of history. So we'll take, y'know,

00:51:58.670 --> 00:52:05.160
one of these modern historical classics and
we'll use it as a way into talking about some

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:08.940
historical phenomenon like talking about the
Columbian Exchange, for instance, um, which

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:15.140
was the exchange of microbes and people and
plants and animals between the-Europe and

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:22.500
Asia and Africa, and the Americas. Umm...
and in that we're going to cite a source because

00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:26.610
much of the-much of the conversation that
we're having is about a book. But when we're

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:31.740
talking about sort of these broad historical,
um...trends we don't cite sources because

00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:37.060
they're not really...that source-y. But I
guess we could do better citations and that's

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.491
a good suggestion, and we'll look-we'll look
to it.

00:52:39.491 --> 00:52:42.640
H: I do-I will tell you that it is a pain
in the butt.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.260
J: Well, um. That's the other reason we don't
do it.

00:52:46.260 --> 00:52:48.220
H: (laughs)

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:56.570
J: I don't like to do things that are hard.
Um. Yeah, do you have other questions? We

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:59.920
have five minutes left in our big show, Hank,
that we're not going to be able to show, and

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.480
we have to upload it. Do you think-can we
upload it to, ummm...

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:10.520
H: What we'll do is, uh, is what- we'll have
it uploaded to Crash Course as a video that

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.070
is unlisted and we will tweet it from the
Crash Course account.

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.080
J: Why can't we list it? Why can't we just
show it to the people?

00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:23.600
H: I don't know, 'cause maybe in the future
we will want to- 'cause I don't- 'cause you

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.040
have a policy of not putting-

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.720
J: Well, we can unlist it- we can unlist it
later.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:32.260
H: What do you mean? What?

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:34.369
J: We can- we can just make it unlisted later?

00:53:34.369 --> 00:53:37.609
H: Oh, I see. Okay. I think-

00:53:37.609 --> 00:53:40.930
J: That's gonna work. Yeah let's do it. We're
putting it up!

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:41.930
H: Okay.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:47.310
J: I-I- Hank, I am the one with the face here.
I make the decisions.

00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:49.480
H: (laughs) The face is in charge!

00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.510
J: The face makes the show!

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:52.740
H: Well, let's...

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:58.710
J: Well, you used to have a face. I remember...now
I'm feeling nostalgic for early in the live

00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:00.420
show when you had a face.

00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.350
H: Sorry, I know.

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:03.770
J: Those were the best parts.

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:06.450
H: When I had a face and I wasn't just a disembodied
voice.

00:54:06.450 --> 00:54:11.910
J: Y'know. I always-I always get nostalgic
for the recent past. In this case it's thirty

00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:17.160
minutes ago when you had a voice. Um, but
we will, uh. Maybe we'll upload one gag reel

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.540
now and one next week. What do you think of
that, Hank?

00:54:19.540 --> 00:54:20.660
H: That sounds like a good plan.

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:25.470
J: All right, so we'll upload-we'll upload
mine that you sort of got to see now, and

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:30.980
we'll upload Hank's, which I have to say is
even funnier, and if anything....the thing

00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:34.130
that's surprising most about watching your
gag reel, Hank, is watching how often you

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:35.210
had to be bleeped.

00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:39.000
H: (laughs) I figured that's what you would
say, just then.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:44.310
J: Umm...It didn't surprise me how often I
had to be bleeped (laughs)

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:46.609
H: Uhh yes, I uh

00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:47.609
J: Yeah.

00:54:47.609 --> 00:54:52.070
H: It's a dirty time, there in the studio.

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:57.320
J: Well it's-for me at least it's very high
pressure, because I know we only have...I

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.540
know we only have like, y'know, six hours
or whatever to film two episodes, and I get

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:08.109
really mad at myself and I can't say things
right. And, uhm, the way that I deal with

00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:11.310
getting really mad at myself is saying words
I shouldn't say.

00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:15.610
Michael Aranda: I have a question for both
of you that's kind of related to that. Before

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:21.520
you guys did Crash Course and SciShow, you
both mostly just filmed by yourself, in a

00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:26.030
bedroom or whatever, without other people
around, so what was the transition like, having

00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:30.410
to go into a studio, where all of a sudden
you've got someone working the camera, and

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:35.430
someone doing script supervision, and y'know,
for Hank there's like, snake handlers in the

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:36.750
room or whatever.

00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:39.150
J: Right. (laughs)

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:40.910
H: There were snake handlers.

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:46.849
J: Right. I mean, one of the keys to my success
is no snakes,

00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:49.740
H: And what? No snake handlers?

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:53.780
J: I don't do well with snakes and I don't
do well with people who do well with snakes.

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:59.030
H: Oh. Um, yeah, it was definitely a transition
the first time I went into the studio, and

00:55:59.030 --> 00:56:02.910
I was like, "Okay, there's people in here
with me." I was not very natural, I was not

00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:07.610
very comfortable. Umm. I have gotten over
that, it's still definitely more pressure

00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:12.574
than filming at home, and I definitely feel
drained afterward, and I'm like, "Oooh, I

00:56:12.574 --> 00:56:17.770
need to go to sleep now", and-oh, good I'm
glad that you have that. We have a wrap-up

00:56:17.770 --> 00:56:20.500
question, an excellent wrap-up question from
CGP Grey.

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:23.750
J: Well can I first-can I first answer that
question that Michael just asked?

00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:25.990
H: I thought you did, already.

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.990
J: No.

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:28.050
H: Okay, well-

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:33.140
J: I-I only had a joke answer. The real answer
is that I didn't feel awkward at all but it's

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:40.130
because it's Stan and Danica. Like, the other
day a reporter for the Chicago Tribune was

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:46.170
watching me record and I was super bad...umm,
and not in the good way, but in the genuinely

00:56:46.170 --> 00:56:52.130
bad way. Umm, I was really awkward, and I
was talking too fast and I couldn't get my

00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:57.770
lines out and it was really interesting, because
I just, I had a level of comfort with Stan

00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:02.110
and Danica immediately that I just don't have
with most people and it was a good lesson,

00:57:02.110 --> 00:57:06.869
which is that, um, I can't do it in front
of just anyone. It has to be the right um,

00:57:06.869 --> 00:57:14.920
the right people, so it's because I'm friends
with them and I like them, and they're nerdfighters,

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:21.640
and it doesn't feel awkward. If it feels awkward,
if I feel like I'm being watched, I get very

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.640
bad.

00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:26.290
H: Yeah. Yeah we had like six people in the
studio the other day because we had a bug

00:57:26.290 --> 00:57:28.530
handler, and he came in with some giant bugs.

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:29.530
J: Bug handler!

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:30.770
H: Really cool...

00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:33.180
J: Wow, I do not like bug handlers.

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:37.540
H: Um, some giant rhinoceros beetles that
are like the size of your fist...

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:39.080
J: Shut up.

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:44.751
H: (laughs) and they had- and we brought in
a-he had a pupa, he had a rhinoceros beetle

00:57:44.751 --> 00:57:46.440
in the pupa stage...

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.440
J: Aw God...

00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:51.960
H: ...in a hard casing but it's like writhing
around. it's sooo cool.

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:57.070
J: Ugh god. You how know I know that Henry
is my son, Hank?

00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:58.070
H: What?

00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:00.869
J: Before we get to the wrap-up question can
I tell you how I know Henry is my son?

00:58:00.869 --> 00:58:01.890
H: No.

00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:07.330
J: We saw a beetle the other day, and we were
walking in the woods and we saw a beetle,

00:58:07.330 --> 00:58:14.880
and Henry said, "Daddy, beeeetle!" and I was
like "Oh God!" and I pulled him away, of course,

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:17.440
because y'know beetles are very harmful potentially.

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:18.440
H: (laughs)

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:25.619
J: And about five minutes later we were just
walking along the edge of the White River

00:58:25.619 --> 00:58:31.150
and Henry looks up at me and says "Daddy,
beetles, scawwy!" (laughs)

00:58:31.150 --> 00:58:37.560
H: (laughs) I was, ah, I wasn't particularly
comfortable with the rhinoceros beetles but

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.650
I was very excited by them.

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:42.390
J: Yeah, I mean this beetle was the size of
maybe a roach, but even so I was terrified.

00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:43.390
H: Yeah.

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:47.790
J: Aaughh...pfwoarrgh...alright so moving
on, what's the wrap-up question from our friend

00:58:47.790 --> 00:58:48.790
CGP Grey?

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:53.990
H: Our friend CGP Grey says, "If you're looking
for a wrap-up question, where do you see Crash

00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:55.040
Course in a year or two?"

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.359
J: That's a great question, I'll let you handle
it.

00:58:57.359 --> 00:58:59.830
H: No. Just a black screen talking.

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:00.990
J: (laughs)

00:59:00.990 --> 00:59:09.470
H: Umm...I ahh, I think that there are multiple
paths for Crash Course, and they all excite

00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:14.020
me and some of them are smaller scale and
some of them are much larger...um. What I'd

00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:20.480
really like is for there to be broader infrastructure
behind the videos where it's not just a video,

00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:25.170
but it has a place where it lives, there's
a sort of a better question-and-answer system

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:31.180
than YouTube comments, there are potentially,
like, worksheets, or... other resources whether

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:37.030
or not they're physical or not. Umm, ways
to, ways to reemphasize the information you've

00:59:37.030 --> 00:59:43.130
got into your head during this Crash Course
episode because watching a show is one thing,

00:59:43.130 --> 00:59:49.150
but watching it and taking a worksheet or
taking a short quiz to reinforce it, and then

00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:54.840
a couple weeks down the line, doing that again,
you really end up with a lasting knowledge

00:59:54.840 --> 01:00:00.740
of the topic, and that seems like the sort
of thing, like an innovation on top of an

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.740
innovation...

01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:07.900
H: ...that could really be powerful. Umm so
that's something that I'd really like to do,

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:14.780
but as far as it being significantly different
than it is now, just more of it, hopefully.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.740
J: Yeah. Yeah, I'd like there to be more,
I'd like there to be more teachers and more

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:23.410
courses and more, more stuff, that's the first
thing that I would like, and I would also

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:31.869
like, what Hank wants. Um, and I'd really
like to expand the idea to include background

01:00:31.869 --> 01:00:41.540
on historical events, so for instance, when
you see the Greek debt crisis, or when, y'know,

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:49.040
Greece is having a debt crisis, which these
days is usually, Crash Course could provide

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:54.330
a place where you could go and get background
both on debt crises and traditional sovereign

01:00:54.330 --> 01:01:01.510
defaults over the course of history and how
that generally affects national economies,

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:08.200
and whether austerity historically has led
to faster recoveries than defaults, and questions

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:15.331
like that, but you could also get historical
background on Greece's economy, or if you're

01:01:15.331 --> 01:01:20.080
looking at the Syrian riots. Not riots, I
should say revolution. But you can go and

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.710
you can get background on the history of Syria
over the last hundred or two hundred years

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:28.890
that will allow you to have a better-formed
opinion about news stories that are going

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:35.970
on today. So I see that as within the idea
of Crash Course and what Crash Course is really

01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:42.080
about and what we can do well. So I'd like
to expand it into that as well.

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:47.590
H: That's wonderful. Umm. This is an exciting
thing that we're doing together, John.

01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:53.190
J: Aww, thanks. I hope so, I mean, they decide
if it's exciting, not us. But we are having

01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:58.140
fun doing it and it's a real privilege to
be able to do it and we feel really, really

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:03.100
lucky so, uh, thank you guys, all for watching,
and thank you for being awesome, and Hank,

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:07.440
thank you for being a black screen so that
I could be the star of the show, that was

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:09.660
very generous of you.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:15.680
H: (laughs) Yeah, thanks to all 4,152 of you,
sorry to leave you in the cold, but we will

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:22.790
still be on TheCrashCourse on Twitter, and
you will see our first outtakes reel being

01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:25.720
uploaded to Crash Course, youtube.com/crashcourse
momentarily.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:29.339
J: All right. Don't forget to be awesome!

01:02:29.339 --> 01:02:30.250
H: DFTBA.
