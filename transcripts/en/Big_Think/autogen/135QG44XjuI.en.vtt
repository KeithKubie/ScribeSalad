00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.230
well so whenever you encounter some

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240
well so whenever you encounter some
 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.630
well so whenever you encounter some
sudden danger out there in the world

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.640
sudden danger out there in the world
 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.330
sudden danger out there in the world
that the information from that stimulus

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340
that the information from that stimulus
 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.900
that the information from that stimulus
let's say it's a snake on the path will

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910
let's say it's a snake on the path will
 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.940
let's say it's a snake on the path will
go into your brain through the visual

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:15.950
go into your brain through the visual
 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.220
go into your brain through the visual
system if it's a visual stimulus and

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230
system if it's a visual stimulus and
 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.980
system if it's a visual stimulus and
then will rise through the visual system

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990
then will rise through the visual system
 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.410
then will rise through the visual system
through the standard pathways so every

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420
through the standard pathways so every
 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.939
through the standard pathways so every
sensory system has this very

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949
sensory system has this very
 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.260
sensory system has this very
well-organized set of circuits that

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270
well-organized set of circuits that
 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.510
well-organized set of circuits that
ultimately leads to a stop in a part of

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520
ultimately leads to a stop in a part of
 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.910
ultimately leads to a stop in a part of
the brain called the thalamus on route 2

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920
the brain called the thalamus on route 2
 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.680
the brain called the thalamus on route 2
reaching the sensory cortex

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690
reaching the sensory cortex
 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.169
reaching the sensory cortex
so each sensory system has an area in

00:00:38.169 --> 00:00:38.179
so each sensory system has an area in
 

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:40.500
so each sensory system has an area in
the cortex the cortex is that wrinkled

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510
the cortex the cortex is that wrinkled
 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.549
the cortex the cortex is that wrinkled
part of the brain that you see whenever

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559
part of the brain that you see whenever
 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.770
part of the brain that you see whenever
we see a picture of the brain and that's

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780
we see a picture of the brain and that's
 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.029
we see a picture of the brain and that's
where we have our perceptions and

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039
where we have our perceptions and
 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.919
where we have our perceptions and
thoughts and all of that so in order to

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929
thoughts and all of that so in order to
 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.139
thoughts and all of that so in order to
have a visual perception information has

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149
have a visual perception information has
 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.939
have a visual perception information has
to be transmitted from the eye from the

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949
to be transmitted from the eye from the
 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.399
to be transmitted from the eye from the
retina through the optic nerve into the

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:54.409
retina through the optic nerve into the
 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:56.529
retina through the optic nerve into the
visual thalamus and from the visual

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539
visual thalamus and from the visual
 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.719
visual thalamus and from the visual
thalamus to the visual cortex where the

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729
thalamus to the visual cortex where the
 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.430
thalamus to the visual cortex where the
processing continues and you then

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440
processing continues and you then
 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.549
processing continues and you then
ultimately have the perception so the

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559
ultimately have the perception so the
 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.070
ultimately have the perception so the
visual cortex connects directly with the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080
visual cortex connects directly with the
 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.830
visual cortex connects directly with the
amygdala and so that's one route by

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840
amygdala and so that's one route by
 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.140
amygdala and so that's one route by
which the information can get in retina

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150
which the information can get in retina
 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.380
which the information can get in retina
thalamus cortex amygdala but one of the

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390
thalamus cortex amygdala but one of the
 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.420
thalamus cortex amygdala but one of the
first things that I discovered when I

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430
first things that I discovered when I
 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.060
first things that I discovered when I
started studying fear was that that rat

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070
started studying fear was that that rat
 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.220
started studying fear was that that rat
that pathway the usual pathway that we

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230
that pathway the usual pathway that we
 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.980
that pathway the usual pathway that we
think about for sensory processing was

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990
think about for sensory processing was
 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.650
think about for sensory processing was
not the way that fear was elicited or

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660
not the way that fear was elicited or
 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.990
not the way that fear was elicited or
not the only way what we found was that

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000
not the only way what we found was that
 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.290
not the only way what we found was that
if the cortical pathway was was blocked

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300
if the cortical pathway was was blocked
 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.590
if the cortical pathway was was blocked
completely rats could still form a

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600
completely rats could still form a
 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.900
completely rats could still form a
memory about a sound we were studying

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910
memory about a sound we were studying
 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.300
memory about a sound we were studying
sounds and shocks but we've also done it

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310
sounds and shocks but we've also done it
 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.480
sounds and shocks but we've also done it
with the visual stimuli so the what we

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490
with the visual stimuli so the what we
 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.190
with the visual stimuli so the what we
found was that sound had to go up to the

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200
found was that sound had to go up to the
 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.440
found was that sound had to go up to the
level of the thalamus but then it didn't

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
level of the thalamus but then it didn't
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.510
level of the thalamus but then it didn't
need to go to the auditory cortex or the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520
need to go to the auditory cortex or the
 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.250
need to go to the auditory cortex or the
visual cortex if it was a visual

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260
visual cortex if it was a visual
 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.670
visual cortex if it was a visual
stimulus instead it made a an exit from

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680
stimulus instead it made a an exit from
 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.620
stimulus instead it made a an exit from
the sensory system and went directly

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630
the sensory system and went directly
 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.660
the sensory system and went directly
into the amygdala below the level of the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670
into the amygdala below the level of the
 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.219
into the amygdala below the level of the
cortex that was really important because

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229
cortex that was really important because
 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.810
cortex that was really important because
we generally think that the cortex is

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820
we generally think that the cortex is
 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.070
we generally think that the cortex is
required for any kind of conscious

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080
required for any kind of conscious
 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.350
required for any kind of conscious
experience so this is a way that

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360
experience so this is a way that
 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.679
experience so this is a way that
information was being sent through the

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:11.689
information was being sent through the
 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:13.830
information was being sent through the
brain and triggering emotions

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
brain and triggering emotions
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.450
brain and triggering emotions
unconsciously so the psycho animal

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460
unconsciously so the psycho animal
 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.400
unconsciously so the psycho animal
love this it was it because it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410
love this it was it because it
 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.110
love this it was it because it
vindicates the idea that you could have

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120
vindicates the idea that you could have
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.080
vindicates the idea that you could have
this unconscious fear that the cortex

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090
this unconscious fear that the cortex
 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.060
this unconscious fear that the cortex
has no understanding of so the the idea

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070
has no understanding of so the the idea
 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.680
has no understanding of so the the idea
was elaborated a bit into this concept

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690
was elaborated a bit into this concept
 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.920
was elaborated a bit into this concept
where these patents it's possible that

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930
where these patents it's possible that
 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.260

the cortical and the thalamic inputs to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270
the cortical and the thalamic inputs to
 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.720
the cortical and the thalamic inputs to
the amygdala could become dissociated in

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730
the amygdala could become dissociated in
 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.110
the amygdala could become dissociated in
people for one reason or another such

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
people for one reason or another such
 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.290
people for one reason or another such
that the stimuli that are triggering the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300
that the stimuli that are triggering the
 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.820
that the stimuli that are triggering the
amygdala from the thalamus wouldn't

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830
amygdala from the thalamus wouldn't
 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.250
amygdala from the thalamus wouldn't
necessarily match those that the cortex

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260
necessarily match those that the cortex
 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.620
necessarily match those that the cortex
is attending to so in order to again to

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630
is attending to so in order to again to
 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.210
is attending to so in order to again to
consciously attend to a stimulus you

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220
consciously attend to a stimulus you
 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.780
consciously attend to a stimulus you
need the cortex so let's say we're

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790
need the cortex so let's say we're
 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.260
need the cortex so let's say we're
having lunch one day and it's a red and

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270
having lunch one day and it's a red and
 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.270
having lunch one day and it's a red and
white checkered tablecloth and we have

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280
white checkered tablecloth and we have
 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.240
white checkered tablecloth and we have
this argument and then the next day I

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250
this argument and then the next day I
 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.680
this argument and then the next day I
see somebody coming down the street

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690
see somebody coming down the street
 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.830
see somebody coming down the street
that's saying I have this gut feeling

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840
that's saying I have this gut feeling
 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.480
that's saying I have this gut feeling
about this guy he's an sob I don't like

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490
about this guy he's an sob I don't like
 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.840
about this guy he's an sob I don't like
him and maybe what's going on there he

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850
him and maybe what's going on there he
 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.820
him and maybe what's going on there he
says he's got a red and white checkered

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830
says he's got a red and white checkered
 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.700
says he's got a red and white checkered
necktie on consciously I'm saying it's

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710
necktie on consciously I'm saying it's
 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.730
necktie on consciously I'm saying it's
you know my gut feeling because I don't

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740
you know my gut feeling because I don't
 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.590
you know my gut feeling because I don't
like the way he looks but what's

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600
like the way he looks but what's
 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.830
like the way he looks but what's
happened is that the necktie has

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840
happened is that the necktie has
 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.260
happened is that the necktie has
triggered the activation of the amygdala

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270
triggered the activation of the amygdala
 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.120
triggered the activation of the amygdala
through the thalamus the lope the so

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130
through the thalamus the lope the so
 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.100
through the thalamus the lope the so
called low-road triggered a fear

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110
called low-road triggered a fear
 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.050
called low-road triggered a fear
response in me which I now consciously

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060
response in me which I now consciously
 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.270
response in me which I now consciously
interpret as this gut feeling about not

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280
interpret as this gut feeling about not
 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.120
interpret as this gut feeling about not
liking the guy but in fact it's being

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130
liking the guy but in fact it's being
 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.830
liking the guy but in fact it's being
triggered by external stimuli that I'm

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840
triggered by external stimuli that I'm
 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.480
triggered by external stimuli that I'm
not processing consciously so this this

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490
not processing consciously so this this
 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.450
not processing consciously so this this
is important because a lot of people

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460
is important because a lot of people
 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.900
is important because a lot of people
have fears and phobias and anxieties

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910
have fears and phobias and anxieties
 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.660
have fears and phobias and anxieties
about things they don't understand they

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670
about things they don't understand they
 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.250
about things they don't understand they
don't know why they're afraid or anxious

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260
don't know why they're afraid or anxious
 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.280
don't know why they're afraid or anxious
in a particular time it may be through

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290
in a particular time it may be through
 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.050
in a particular time it may be through
various kinds of experiences the low

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060
various kinds of experiences the low
 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.050
various kinds of experiences the low
road gets potentiated in a way that it's

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060
road gets potentiated in a way that it's
 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.140
road gets potentiated in a way that it's
activating fears and phobias outside of

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150
activating fears and phobias outside of
 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.660
activating fears and phobias outside of
conscious awareness and that doesn't

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670
conscious awareness and that doesn't
 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.710
conscious awareness and that doesn't
make sense in terms of what the

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720
make sense in terms of what the
 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.200
make sense in terms of what the
conscious brain is looking at in the

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:17.210
conscious brain is looking at in the
 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.360
conscious brain is looking at in the
world or hearing in the world because

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370
world or hearing in the world because
 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.970

they've been separately parsed out so

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980
they've been separately parsed out so
 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.020
they've been separately parsed out so
the subcortical pathway we've been able

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030
the subcortical pathway we've been able
 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.120
the subcortical pathway we've been able
to time all this very precisely in the

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130
to time all this very precisely in the
 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.300
to time all this very precisely in the
rat brain

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310
rat brain
 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.310
rat brain
it takes an order for a sound to get to

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320
it takes an order for a sound to get to
 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.990
it takes an order for a sound to get to
the amygdala from the subcortical

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000
the amygdala from the subcortical
 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.290
the amygdala from the subcortical
pathway takes about ten or twelve

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300
pathway takes about ten or twelve
 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.120
pathway takes about ten or twelve
milliseconds so take a second divide

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130
milliseconds so take a second divide
 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.460
milliseconds so take a second divide
into a thousand parts and after twelve

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470
into a thousand parts and after twelve
 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.860
into a thousand parts and after twelve
of those little parts the amygdala is

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870
of those little parts the amygdala is
 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.530
of those little parts the amygdala is
already getting the sound consciously it

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540
already getting the sound consciously it
 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.120
already getting the sound consciously it
you know for you to be consciously aware

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130
you know for you to be consciously aware
 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.240
you know for you to be consciously aware
of a stimulus it takes 250 300

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250
of a stimulus it takes 250 300
 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.430
of a stimulus it takes 250 300
milliseconds so the amygdala is being

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440
milliseconds so the amygdala is being
 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.700
milliseconds so the amygdala is being
triggered much much faster than

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710
triggered much much faster than
 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.920
triggered much much faster than
consciousness is processing so the brain

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930
consciousness is processing so the brain
 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.590
consciousness is processing so the brain
ticks in milliseconds the neurons

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600
ticks in milliseconds the neurons
 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.240
ticks in milliseconds the neurons
process information on the level of

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250
process information on the level of
 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.610
process information on the level of
milliseconds but the mind is processing

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620
milliseconds but the mind is processing
 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.320
milliseconds but the mind is processing
things on the order of seconds and half

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330
things on the order of seconds and half
 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.580
things on the order of seconds and half
seconds you know so if you have a fear

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590
seconds you know so if you have a fear
 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.900
seconds you know so if you have a fear
response that's being triggered very

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910
response that's being triggered very
 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.240
response that's being triggered very
rapidly like that consciously you're

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250
rapidly like that consciously you're
 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.310
rapidly like that consciously you're
going to be interpreting what's going on

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320
going to be interpreting what's going on
 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.200
going to be interpreting what's going on
but it's not going to necessarily match

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210
but it's not going to necessarily match
 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.320
but it's not going to necessarily match
what's really going on
