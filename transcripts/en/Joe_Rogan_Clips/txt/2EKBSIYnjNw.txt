Speaker 1:          00:00          Which are crucial to our wellbeing. And one of them is the capacity to openly debate ideas and to expose ourselves to ideas across the gamut. And I'm not just talking about political ideas, I'm talking about scientific ideas. Yes. So how are we going to win the battle against anti-vaxxers? Like how are we going to persuade people who believe that vaccines kill people for which there is no scientific evidence that they're wrong. We could imprison them like that's force. Uh, we could vote, which is sort of what we're doing. We're saying, okay, well you're a minority group who believes these things so we're not going to allow you to control policy. Or we could try to win the battle of ideas and persuade them. Ultimately, that's the only path that's in my view that gets us to where we want to be. Yeah. And

Speaker 2:          00:44          just an honest assessment of the actual data. Like what we really know and understanding how the scientists come to these conclusions. But the problem is these echo chambers where people get involved with online that magnify, uh, all of these beliefs and you get radicalized. I mean, I've seen people get involved in these Facebook groups. He's anti vaccs face Facebook groups or you know, all, all sorts of different things. I mean that's how these flat earth people get going. They start listening only to people that are involved in this circle. They don't have a, a greater understanding of the science involved in,

Speaker 1:          01:21          did you just see, I just saw online their sec accrues to the flat or cruise for a flat earth. I don't know if you saw it to ice wall. Yeah, the ice wall. That's a new wrinkle. Cause the old flat earthers used to think that the water was shown falling off the disc of the earth. You know, like the edge of the earth. They was just a disk. Now the new theory that there's an ice wall, actually, it's kind of not falsifiable. That is to say you, you could get on a cruise and sail to the edge of the earth and you would find a wall of ice there. So you Antarctica. So you'd think, Huh, it's flat. In other words, they, they have redefined their theory too, to make it so that you can't disprove it. Right. You don't get to an edge. There's no edge. There's an ice wall is what they're saying. No. And Are you aware of Hashtag spaces fake? No, I'm not. I have to say, but not expose myself to that space. There's a bunch of people that I

Speaker 2:          02:16          believe that space is fake. It's not real, but there's no real space and that there's like lights up there. Oh. And that this is some sort of a, a plan by Satan to a, it's a lot of, it's very biblical. It's really interesting. A lot of the flat earth stop is very biblical. That's, it has to do with the firmament. And they use descriptions and depictions from the Bible. Oh yeah. It's super bizarre. And what's really bizarre is when you listened to the youtube videos or these discussions that are done by people that use words that are real, they string them together correctly. They have like full sentences. They appear to be articulate. It's very, if you're a dummy, if you listen to those, you go like, wow, this guy's making a lot of sense. He's not, but it sounds like he's making a lot of sense because he's using all these words that are correctly users.

Speaker 2:          03:09          There's oms. He saying it articulately, there's like everything seems like like, oh my goodness, this man is exposing. He's exposing the reality, but it's not. It's just fucking nonsense. Yes. And if you don't know any better, and that's all you listened to, that's where your head will go. The same with the Anti Vaccine Movement. If you only listen to these anti-vaxxers, they're making so much sense of like, oh my God, it's giving everybody, uh, all sorts of ailments. Or you're on the spectrum. They have a theory of how it does that, which is not, it's uses, as you say, scientific words, but it's actually not scientifically correct. Right? It does this, which then does that, which then does that, they lay out a kind of causal chain, which is false. And then there's a problem of nuance in perspective because there's so many people that get vaccinated. There's hundreds of millions of people in this country, billions of people worldwide.

Speaker 2:          03:56          And then there are instances, rare occurrences where people have real issues with vaccinations. Well, there are some where they have real issues. So for example, there's some vaccines which are known to cause certain neurological conditions, rarely one out of a million or 100,000 vaccinations. More commonly is a situation in which you have vaccination is so common. Everyone is getting vaccinated. And often that occurs near to an occurrence of some other rare condition. Yes. And people associate the two, they think, oh, because of the vaccine, this happened. No. It's a coincidence. Either a war. Yes. There's both in the, and there's also, you know, if it's one out of a million and you have 300 million, exactly. You have 3 million, you know, I mean, 1 million people with an issue is a big deal. Yeah. With 300 million people. Yes. You, you easily could have 300 really big cases, you know, 300 cases where if something died from vaccines and then you bring those in front of people and say, Oh my God.

Speaker 2:          04:56          And then there's this one and this one, this one, and there's 298 more. And you're like, Holy Shit. All these people are dying from vaccines says, you know, it doesn't feel good if it's your child. But when we look at the greater perspective of humanity, and you say, well listen, you don't want to bring back smallpox. You don't want your child to get measles. Babies can get measles when they can't even be vaccinated for it. This is one of the reasons why we need to vaccinate children, is to make sure they don't get measles is a serious fucking problem and a serious problem that scientists have labored for untold decades to try to try off of our civilization. That we can actually stop these diseases. Yes. And save children's lives. I had a woman yesterday who is an expert and she's a medical historian, an expert in Victorian era surgery. Uh, Lindsey Fitzharris, and she wrote this great book called the butchering art. And in it, there's all these images should shoot one of them. She brought up of what smallpox actually looks like when people get it. It's horrible. Yes. I just covers people's bodies. Yes. For radicating this like in and you die from it. It's actually gone. Yes. We don't get it anywhere credible.
