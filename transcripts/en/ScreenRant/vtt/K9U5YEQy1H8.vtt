00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.130
While some fans would love to think that their
favorite actors write their own lines of dialogue,

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.420
films are scripted.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.390
Still, when you are working with talented
actors that immerse themselves into a role,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.480
their dialogue becomes natural for them.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.790
From serious performances to comedic roles;
actors sometimes improvise their dialogue

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.230
while performing in a scene.

one.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:38.620
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Actors
Who Wrote Their Own Dialogue In Popular Movies.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.070
Robert Downey Jr. and William Hurt in The
Incredible Hulk

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.250
At the end of Louis Leterrier’s 2008 film
The Incredible Hulk there is an end credit

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.430
scene with actors Robert Downey Jr. and William
Hurt.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.350
After being disgraced by the incident with
Emil Blonsky, Thaddeus Ross drinks away his

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.680
troubles in a bar.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.780
Intoxicated, he is greeted by Tony Stark,
who tells him that a special team is being

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.059
put together and even though he doesn’t
mention the name we know it is The Avengers.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.180
The actors were given plotlines to discuss
but no dialogue and improvised their entire

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:20.569
scene.

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:22.520
Bill Murray in Caddyshack

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.670
Bill Murray’s hilarious role in Caddyshack
was only supposed to be a cameo but after

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.259
his performance, director Harold Ramis asked
him to stick around for six days.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.719
Not surprisingly those six days of acting
proved to be comedy gold but surprisingly

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.950
all of his dialogue was improvised.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.600
From his speech about meeting the Dalai Lama
to his iconic “Cinderella Story.”

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.590
In fact, the only direction in the script
for his “Cinderella Story” read: “Carl

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.320
cuts off the tops of flowers with a grass
whip.”

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.920
Talk about talent!

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.179
Jeremy Renner in Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.899
Jeremy Renner plays Hawkeye for the MCU and
in the film Avengers: Age of Ultron, he has

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.329
a lighthearted competition with Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s
Quicksilver.

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:12.189
During a battle Quicksilver dashed off when
Hawkeye points his bow at him remarking, “Nobody

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.850
would know… ‘last I saw him, Ultron was
sitting on him!’”.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.701
This improvised dialogue received big laughs
and is one of Renner’s best moments in the

00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:26.819
film.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.230
Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.599
Harrison Ford starred in 1993’s The Fugitive
but his co-star stole the movie from him.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.040
Ford plays Dr. Richard Kimble who was wrongly
accused of murdering his wife and is chased

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.890
by a U.S. Marshal played by Tommy Lee Jones.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.129
In the scene where Ford gets the upper hand
on Jones, he points his gun at Jones and proclaims,

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.709
“I didn’t kill my wife!” Jones responds
with the simple and character driven line,

00:02:50.709 --> 00:03:00.620
“I don’t care,” which was improvised
and proved to best explain his character’s

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.040
motivations.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.670
Denis Leary in The Amazing Spider-Man

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.300
Denis Leary’s comedy is far from PG and
the actor had a hard time keeping his jokes

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.349
clean while performing in 2012’s The Amazing
Spider-Man.

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.549
Since he is a seasoned actor he did find ways
to use his quick sense of humor in the film

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.099
and sneak in a few improvised lines.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.859
Including the scene where Peter Parker goes
to the police station to ask Captain Stacy

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.140
for help to defeat Dr. Curt Connors.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.370
Leary makes a reference to Godzilla, asking
Parker “do I look like the mayor of Tokyo,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.370
to you?”

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:40.719
Leaving star Andrew Garfield in silence.

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:43.120
Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.709
Martin Scorsese knows how to work with actors
and how to get the best performance out of

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.080
them, if you don’t believe us just watch
anything Leonardo DiCaprio or Robert De Niro

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.569
have done with the director.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.859
He lets his actors-act and does not hold them
back giving them ample room for improvisation.

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.860
In 1976’s Taxi Driver, when De Niro utters
the famous line “You talking to me?”

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.930
the script simple said, “Bickle speaks to
himself in the mirror” De Niro gave us one

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:22.190
of the most memorable lines in movie history.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.120
Sean Gunn in Guardians of the Galaxy

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.250
When you watch the film Guardians of the Galaxy
you hear Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.460
Raccoon, but it was director James Gunn’s
brother, Sean, who performed him on set.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.040
When Star Lord gets his team to rally behind
him, they stand up to show their support.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.030
To mock other film moments like this, Rocket
is the last to stand and says, “Now I’m

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.100
standing, you all happy?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.610
We’re all standing up now.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.860
Buncha jackasses standing in a circle.”

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.740
Sean improvised this on set and since his
brother loved the line he had Cooper record

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.880
it for the final product.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.480
The Main Cast in The Breakfast Club

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.560
When John Hughes directed The Breakfast Club,
he shot the entire 1985 classic in chronological

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.560
order.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.780
Despite being a talented writer himself, he
saw the talent his cast had and decided to

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.760
let them improvise the final scene.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.830
Since they knew their characters and the emotions
their characters went through, the cast mostly

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.830
improvised the scene.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.870
With little direction from Hughes he took
a big chance on his young cast and it worked

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.510
out perfectly.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.130
Richard Castellano in The Godfather

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.890
Italian-American actor Richard Castellano
plays the Corleone family’s capo Peter Clemenza

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.310
in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.760
His character is ordered to carry out a hit
on Paulie Gatto for his betrayal of the family’s

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.550
boss, Don Vito Corleone.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.240
Before leaving his house for, let’s just
say…work, his wife reminds him to bring

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.910
home some cannolis.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.670
After shooting Gatto his line was supposed
to be “Leave the gun” but he added the

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.630
now famous line, “Take the cannoli.”

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.910
Chris Evans and Scarlet Johansson in Captain
America: The Winter Soldier

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.131
Captain America and Natasha’s relationship
were a key plotline to Captain America: The

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:09.880
Winter Soldier and who knows these characters
better then their stars.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.220
During various scenes with actors Chris Evans
and Scarlet Johansson their dialogue was improvised.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.001
The screenwriter Christopher Markus placed
these two characters at moral odds in the

00:06:19.001 --> 00:06:23.220
film and felt their improvised dialogue was
true to the theme of his story.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:36.900
So did the director and their dialogue made
it to the final cut.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.480
