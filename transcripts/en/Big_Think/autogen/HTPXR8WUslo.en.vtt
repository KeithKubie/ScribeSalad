bites and one of the difficulties that
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.890
bites and one of the difficulties that
the energy industry hasn't telling its

the energy industry hasn't telling its
 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.560
the energy industry hasn't telling its
story is that very fact is that it's

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570
story is that very fact is that it's
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.859

all the alternatives that we have been
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.700
all the alternatives that we have been
talking about I think have absolutely

know how many of your observers have
 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.630
know how many of your observers have
actually seen when firms we talk about

storable form of energy so what we first

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
storable form of energy so what we first
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.630
storable form of energy so what we first
have to do is back up and say what do we

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
have to do is back up and say what do we
 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.480
have to do is back up and say what do we
want from energy and what do we think we

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
want from energy and what do we think we
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490
want from energy and what do we think we
can actually get from energy and the

can actually get from energy and the
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.020
can actually get from energy and the
problem is that we all say we want

either now does it mean we shouldn't be

either now does it mean we shouldn't be
doing things about it not at all we

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700
doing things about it not at all we
 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.970
doing things about it not at all we
should we absolutely have to but when I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980
should we absolutely have to but when I

could sit down with the department of
 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.449
could sit down with the department of
energy secretary and ask him how much

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459
energy secretary and ask him how much
 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.860

research for alternate fuels and he

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300
research for alternate fuels and he
 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.940
research for alternate fuels and he
tells me we're spending 250 this is

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950
tells me we're spending 250 this is
 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.500
tells me we're spending 250 this is
several years ago we can maybe spend

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510
several years ago we can maybe spend
 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.900
several years ago we can maybe spend
another 250 wisely before it became

really marginal in terms of returns that
 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.699
really marginal in terms of returns that
means we can't spend 18 billion dollars

means we can't spend 18 billion dollars
which is what some of your congressmen

which is what some of your congressmen
 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.270
which is what some of your congressmen
are telling you can be done that they'd

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959
leading our energy solution that's
 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.660
