00:00:02.088 --> 00:00:04.024
- [Voiceover] In this video,
we're going to be talking

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:06.260
about how to find the rate constant K

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.087
for a first order reaction.

00:00:09.087 --> 00:00:10.922
We're going to work through this example,

00:00:10.922 --> 00:00:14.431
and we have a table of data,
so we know the concentration

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:18.598
of our reactant, hydrogen
peroxide or H2O2, over time,

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:22.682
so we have one, two, three,
four, five different data points

00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:25.624
and concentrations for
each of those data points.

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:29.889
The overall reaction we're
looking at is the decomposition

00:00:29.889 --> 00:00:34.056
of hydrogen peroxide to go
to water or H20 and oxygen.

00:00:39.588 --> 00:00:43.755
We're looking at this reaction
at 40 degrees Celsius.

00:00:45.447 --> 00:00:49.614
The question we'd like to
answer here is, what is K?

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.776
Based on the data we
have, this concentration

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:58.165
over time data, we would like to know what

00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:00.082
is the rate constant K.

00:01:01.777 --> 00:01:05.165
So there are two pretty
common ways that you might

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.965
go about trying to answer this question.

00:01:08.965 --> 00:01:12.522
The first way you might do it, and I think

00:01:12.522 --> 00:01:15.115
for a lot of people, this
might be your first instinct,

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:17.487
is that you actually solve it graphically.

00:01:17.487 --> 00:01:20.434
You can graph, and since we know this is

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:22.684
a first order reaction, you
might know that in order

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:26.367
to look at a first order
reaction, you usually graph

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:30.534
the natural log of your
concentration over time versus time.

00:01:35.537 --> 00:01:39.737
When you do this, you can
use the integrated rate law

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:42.320
for a first order reaction,
so the natural log

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.027
of the concentration at
any point in time, is equal

00:01:46.027 --> 00:01:50.194
to the natural log of the
initial concentration minus Kt.

00:01:53.136 --> 00:01:55.388
We can graph our data.

00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:57.069
We can take the natural log of this,

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.074
graph it versus time, and then we know

00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:02.074
that the slope will give us minus K.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:05.922
That's a perfectly fine way

00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:08.364
to solve this particular problem.

00:02:08.364 --> 00:02:10.930
But I would suggest,
especially since we know

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.921
that this particular reaction
is a first order reaction,

00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:18.063
we're going to solve this
a slightly different way.

00:02:18.063 --> 00:02:20.731
So what makes first
order reactions special,

00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:24.898
is that their half-life,
or t 1/2, is constant.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.571
Not only is it constant, it is related

00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:33.488
to the rate constant K.

00:02:35.547 --> 00:02:38.627
Our half-life does not change over time.

00:02:38.627 --> 00:02:40.627
And we have an equation:

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:45.706
t 1/2 is equal to the
natural log of two over K.

00:02:48.872 --> 00:02:51.322
The natural log of two
we can calculate out,

00:02:51.322 --> 00:02:55.322
so it's actually 0.693
over the rate constant K.

00:02:56.374 --> 00:02:58.265
We have a separate video where we talk

00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:00.815
about deriving this particular equation.

00:03:00.815 --> 00:03:04.512
All you really need to do is,
you know that your half-life

00:03:04.512 --> 00:03:07.997
by definition, is the time it takes to go

00:03:07.997 --> 00:03:10.080
from your initial concentration

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.223
to half the initial concentration,
so all you have to do

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:17.390
is plug in 1/2 times your
initial concentration,

00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:22.439
and then solve for t.

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.106
But if you're taking an exam, chances are

00:03:24.106 --> 00:03:26.840
you might already know this equation,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.345
or you've been given
this equation already,

00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:34.198
so we can actually use this
equation to solve for K,

00:03:34.198 --> 00:03:37.006
without actually graphing our data.

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:38.233
This is useful too if you don't have

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:41.582
a graphing calculator for an exam.

00:03:41.582 --> 00:03:43.989
We can look at our data and
then see if we can figure out

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.105
our half-life from our table.

00:03:46.105 --> 00:03:48.894
Here, from our first data
point to our second data point,

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:52.172
and I will just actually
number these so you know

00:03:52.172 --> 00:03:55.914
what I'm talking about, we go
from data point one to two,

00:03:55.914 --> 00:03:59.854
we've halved our
concentration, and the time

00:03:59.854 --> 00:04:04.021
that's gone by is 2.16 times
10 to the four seconds.

00:04:05.048 --> 00:04:06.981
Just to be thorough, we can look at some

00:04:06.981 --> 00:04:08.372
of the other data points,

00:04:08.372 --> 00:04:11.205
and make sure the half-life
indeed stays constant.

00:04:11.205 --> 00:04:13.647
If we look at points two and three, again,

00:04:13.647 --> 00:04:16.364
our concentration goes down by half,

00:04:16.364 --> 00:04:18.587
and three and four, the same is true.

00:04:18.587 --> 00:04:20.438
In fact, for all of these
data points, if you look

00:04:20.438 --> 00:04:23.739
at any two data points, the
concentration goes down by half,

00:04:23.739 --> 00:04:28.097
and it always takes 2.16
times 10 to the four seconds.

00:04:28.097 --> 00:04:31.930
So we know that our
half-life is equal to 2.16

00:04:33.285 --> 00:04:35.702
times 10 to the four seconds.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.565
I just want to add here that this

00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:42.232
is a slightly contrived example.

00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:46.079
This data is very nice-looking data.

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:49.432
If you were to do an experiment
with a first order reaction,

00:04:49.432 --> 00:04:51.481
and actually measure this kind of data,

00:04:51.481 --> 00:04:55.081
there's a really high
chance that your data

00:04:55.081 --> 00:04:57.889
wouldn't look quite this
clean, and that's totally okay.

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.105
In fact, that's perfectly
normal, so don't feel bad

00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:03.408
if your experimental data doesn't look

00:05:03.408 --> 00:05:05.192
quite as nice as this.

00:05:05.192 --> 00:05:07.694
That's actually probably a good sign.

00:05:07.694 --> 00:05:10.126
Anyways, now that we know the half-life,

00:05:10.126 --> 00:05:13.027
from looking at our data table,
we can actually rearrange

00:05:13.027 --> 00:05:16.186
this equation here to solve for K.

00:05:16.186 --> 00:05:18.752
So if we solve for K, K is equal

00:05:18.752 --> 00:05:21.585
to 0.693 divided by our half-life.

00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:29.004
Now that we know our
half-life, we can plug that in

00:05:29.004 --> 00:05:31.671
and get K, so it's 0.693 divided

00:05:32.553 --> 00:05:35.720
by 2.16 times ten to the four seconds.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.485
If we plug this into
our calculator, we get

00:05:41.485 --> 00:05:45.652
that K is equal to 3.21
times ten to the minus five,

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.169
and our units are one over seconds.

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:52.730
The main things to remember here,

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.329
are that for first order
reaction, since your half-life

00:05:55.329 --> 00:05:59.148
is constant, you can
use this handy equation

00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:02.578
to calculate K if you know
half-life and vice versa;

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:04.736
if you know half-life, you
can always calculate K,

00:06:04.736 --> 00:06:07.622
and it should always be
really easy to recognize

00:06:07.622 --> 00:06:10.879
a first order reaction based
on a graph or table of data,

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:12.467
by checking for constant half-life.
