00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.170
Welcome to the presentation
on multiplying fractions.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.120
Well, I think today you'll be
very happy because you'll find

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.860
out that this is one of the few
times where multiplying

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.730
something is easier than adding
it, I think, or subtracting

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.630
it for that matter.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.455
And if you don't believe me,
let's do some problems.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:29.020
Let's start with 1/2 times 1/2.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.200
So when you multiply fractions
it's very straightforward.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.450
It's essentially just two
separate multiplication

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.360
problems.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.100
You multiply the numerators,
so you get 1 times 1.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.080
And you multiply the
denominators, 2 times 2.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.330
1 times 1 is 1.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.870
2 times 2 is 4.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.360
So 1/2 times 1/2
is equal to 1/4.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.140
That makes sense.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.810
That's like saying 1/2 of 1/2
is 1/4, which makes sense.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.340
What if we had
negative numbers?

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.880
Well, if I had 1/2 times
negative 1/2 -- and when you

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.280
have a negative fraction it's
good ascribe the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.970
negative number.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.540
I tend to ascribe the negative
number to the numerator

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.110
-- negative 1 over 2.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.740
You realize that negative
1/2 is the same thing

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.820
as negative 1 over 2.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.950
Hopefully that make sense.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.670
So 1/2 times negative 1/2,
that's just the same thing as 1

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.070
times negative 1 over 2 times
2, which equals negative 1

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:40.300
over 4, which is the same
thing as negative 1/4.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.710
What if I had different
denominators, and when you're

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.430
adding and subtracting
fractions that tends to

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.320
make things difficult.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.360
Well, it's not necessarily
the case here.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.590
If I had 2/3 times 1/2, just
multiply the numerators, 2

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.800
times 1, and you multiply
that denominators 3 times 2.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.690
So you get 2 times 1
is 2, 3 times 2 is 6.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.920
And 2 over 6 we know from
equivalent fractions is

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.420
the same thing as 1/3.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.510
That was an
interesting problem.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.590
Let's do it again and I want to
show you a little trick here.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.090
So, 2 over 3 times 1/2 -- as
we said, any multiplication

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.890
problem you just multiply the
numerators, multiply the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.620
denominators and you
have your answer.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.540
But sometimes there's a little
trick here where you can divide

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.660
the numerators and the
denominators by a number,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.500
because you know that this is
going to be the same thing as 2

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.360
times 1 over 3 times 2.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.415
Which is the same thing -- I'm
just switching the order on top

00:02:41.415 --> 00:02:45.910
-- as 1 times 2 over 3 times 2.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.250
All I did is I switched the
order on top, because you can

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.990
multiply in either direction.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.170
And that's the same thing
as 1/3 times 2 over 2.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.430
Well that's just is 1/3 times
1, which is equal to 1/3.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.700
And why did I do that?

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.110
Well I want to show you that
these 2s, these 2s, all I did

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.040
is switch the order, but at
all times we had 1, 2 in the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.210
numerator raider and I had
1, 2 in the denominator.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.320
If I wanted to, and this is
kind of a trick for doing

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.700
multiplication really fast so
you don't have to reduce the

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.650
final fraction too much,
you get 2/3 times 1/3 --

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.650
2/3 times 1/2, sorry.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.190
You say I have a 2 in the
numerator, 2 in the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.740
denominator, let me divide them
both by 2, that equals 1/3.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.680
Just a fast trick.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.380
I hope I didn't confuse you.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.190
Let's do a couple of more
problems, and I'll do

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.230
it both with the trick
and without the trick.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.460
What if I had 3/7
times 2 over 5.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.640
Well, multiply the
numerators, 3 times 2 is 6.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.820
7 times 5 is 35.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.610
That's it.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.440
Let's do some negative numbers.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:05.420
If I had negative 3 over 4
times 2 over 11, well, that's

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.630
negative 6 over 44, which
is the same thing as

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.920
negative 3 over 22.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.980
And we could have done that
cross-dividing trick here.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.380
Let's do it again
with the cross--.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.080
Times 2 over 11.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.653
We say oh, well 2 and 4,
they're both divisible by 2, so

00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:27.770
let's divide them both by 2.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.190
So 2 becomes 1, 4 becomes
2, and then our answer

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.280
becomes minus 3 over 22.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.170
Negative 3 times
1 is minus is 3.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.560
2 times 11 is 22.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.470
Do another one right here.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.760
If I had negative 2/5 times
minus 2/5, well, that just is

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.860
equal to negative 2 times
negative 2 is positive 4.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.690
It's 5 times 5 is 25.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.550
4 over 25.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.450
And that's, just remember, a
negative times a negative is a

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.050
positive, which makes sense.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.630
Let's just do a couple
more problems since we

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.330
have a lot of time.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.070
But I think you probably
got this by now.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.410
You're probably realizing that
multiplying fractions is a

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.890
lot easier than adding or
subtracting them, hopefully.

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.910
I guess it's not a bad thing if
you find adding or subtracting

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.320
fractions easy as well.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.453
Let's do -- I'm just
making up numbers now

00:05:18.453 --> 00:05:25.910
-- 2/9 times 18 over 2.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.710
Well here we could, well, we
have a 2 in the numerator

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.310
and a 2 in the denominator.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.530
Let's divide them both by
2, so they both become 1.

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.460
And we have an 18 in
the numerator and a 9

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.290
in the denominator.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.090
Well they both are divisible
by 9, so let's divide

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.840
them both by 9.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:47.890
So 9 becomes a 1, and
the 18 becomes a 2.

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.600
So you have 1 times 2 over 1
times 1, well, that just equals

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.840
2 over 1 which equals 2.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.100
That was pretty
straightforward.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.650
We could have done it, I guess
you could call it the hard

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:05.940
way, if we said 2 times 2
over 9 times 18 over 2.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.680
2 times 18 is 36.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.360
9 times 2 is 18.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.090
And 36 divided by 18, and we
can see 18 goes into 36 two

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.190
times, that also equals 2.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:18.280
Either way is fine.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.650
If you don't feel comfortable
doing this trick right

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:21.780
now, you don't have to.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.710
All that does is you won't end
up with huge numbers in your

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.880
product that you'll have to
figure out if they can

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.700
be reduced further.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.585
Let's do two more problems.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:46.120
Minus 5 over 7 times 1 over 3.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.950
Minus 5 times 1 is minus 5.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.750
7 over 3 is 21.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.270
That's it.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:59.650
Let me do one with the
little trick I showed you.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.660
Say I had 15, and here I think
you'll see why that trick

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:11.580
is useful, over 21
times 14 over 5.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.880
Well clearly, if we multiply
this out we end up with

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.090
pretty big numbers.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.840
I think 220 one 105 and
you have to reduce those.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.960
It becomes a big mess.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.770
But we can see that 15 and
5 are both divisible by 5.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.560
So let's divide them both by 5.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.260
So 15 divided by 5 is 3.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.180
5 divided by 5 is 1.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:33.240
14 and 21, they're
both divisible by 7.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.960
14 divided by 7 is 2.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.770
21 divided by 7 is 3.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:48.640
So we got 3 times 2 is 6 over 3
times 1 is 3, which equals 2.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.090
That's the same thing
as what I said before.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:52.510
If we had multiplied 15
times 14 that would

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:56.200
have been 210 I think.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.430
Yeah, 15 times 14 is 210.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.100
And 21 times 5 would have been
105, and you would have to say,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.320
I guess in this case it's kind
of obvious, that 210 is 2 times

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.840
105 and you would have
gotten 2 as well.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.530
So hopefully I didn't
confuse you too much

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:10.670
with that last problem.

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.900
But I hope you realize
multiplication's pretty

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.110
straightforward.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:15.340
You just multiply the
numerators, you multiply the

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.400
denominators, and then if you
have to reduce you reduce, but

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.500
you're pretty much done.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.050
I think you're ready now to try
the multiplication module,

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.120
and I hope you have fun.
