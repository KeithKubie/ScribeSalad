00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.330
We're on problem 87.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:10.980
It says an employee is paid 1.5
times the regular hourly

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.340
rate for each hour worked in
excess of 40 hours per week.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.680
OK.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.090
So after 40, they get overtime.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.420
1.5 times.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.150
Excluding sunday.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.580
And 2 times the regular
hourly rate for each

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.470
hour worked on sunday.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.560
So each hour worked on Sunday,
regardless of whether or not

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.050
they're above 40 hours.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.200
How much was the employee
paid last week?

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.330
OK.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.960
So let's see.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.730
Statement one tells us the
employee's regular

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.580
hourly rate is $10.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.380
$10 per hour is normal.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.550
Now based on that, we know
what their overtime is.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.010
Overtime is 1.5 times,
so it's $15 an hour.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.280
And it tells us that sunday is
double that. $20 an hour.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.250
All of that was said in the
problem description, I guess

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.970
you could call it.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.459
But we still don't know how much
they were paid because we

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.550
don't know how many hours they
worked and when those hours

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.210
happened to be.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.736
So it's still not enough
information.

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:11.940
Statement number two.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:19.150
It says last week the employee
worked a total of 54 hours but

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.515
did not work more than
8 hours on any day.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.970
OK.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.970
So let's think about that.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.200
If you worked no more than 8
hours in a day, how many days

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.630
would you have to work?

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.070
Well you would have to work-- I
guess at minimum, you'd have

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.920
to work 6 days for 8 hours.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.160
And 1 day you would
work for 6 hours.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.950
Right?

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.470
Or there's other ways
you could say it.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.380
You could have all 7 days you
could be working-- for how

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.916
many times does 7 go into--
you could be working 7 6/7

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:10.240
hours a day.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.510
Now neither of these help us
because we don't know where

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.670
the hours were allocated.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.910
We don't know how many of these

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.280
hours ended up on sunday.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.430
Because that's a critical
question.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.420
And we know that there
was some overtime

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940
in some form, right?

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.090
But we don't know if that was
sunday overtime or if that was

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.340
regular overtime.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.360
Imagine working 7 6/7
hours every day.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.670
Then you would have 7 6/7
hours for monday through

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.090
friday, then you get some
overtime for saturday as soon

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.220
as you got above 40 hours.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.145
And then on sunday you would
get paid double.

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:43.560
But then you have
this situation.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.720
Maybe sunday is a day
you worked 6 hours.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.660
Or maybe sunday is one of the
days you worked 8 hours.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.320
So we don't know.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.970
So, this problem, there's not
enough information to solve

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.750
this problem.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.440
88.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.060
What was the revenue that a
theater received from the sale

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.400
of 400 tickets, some of which
were sold at the full price,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.620
and the remainder which were
sold at reduced price?

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.040
OK, fair enough.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.290
The number of tickets sold at
full price-- so this is

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.900
statement number one-- so
immediately we know that there

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.130
were 400 tickets sold.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.600
And that is the number of
full-priced tickets plus

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.160
reduced priced tickets.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:36.182
It's equal to 400, right?

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:36.660
Wait.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.110
Some of which were sold at full
price and the remainder

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.890
of which-- oh, they want
to know the revenue.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.850
OK.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.810
They want to know the revenue.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.340
So we have to know how much we
got for each of these tickets

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.520
in order be able to
figure it out.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.550
So number one.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.110
The number of tickets sold at
full price were 1/4 of the

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.150
total number of tickets sold.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.000
So 1/4 times-- what was the
total number of tickets sold?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.900
Well they already told us that.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.500
400.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.900
So it equals 100.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.006
And then we could just look at
that and that tells us that

00:04:10.006 --> 00:04:13.330
the reduced price were equal
to 300 tickets were sold at

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.490
the reduced price.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.100
But that still doesn't tell us
the total revenue because we

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.329
don't know how much full
price was or how much

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.630
reduced price was.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.079
So that's not enough information
just yet.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:30.040
Problem two says the full price
of a ticket was $25.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.200
But we still don't know what
the reduced price is.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.030
We know the 25 100, or $2,500
were generated from the sale

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.960
of the full-price ticket.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.090
But the reduced price, they
don't tell us that.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.970
How much did they reduce
the price, right?

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.720
Some of which were sold at full
price and the remainder

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.810
of which were sold at
a reduced price.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:46.640
We don't know what that is.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.800
It was 25% off?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.480
50% off?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.260
We don't know.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.820
So unless we know the price of
the reduced price ticket, we

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.690
can't figure this out.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.720
So once again, not enough
information

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.970
to solve the problem.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:05.610
Problem 89.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.640
What is that, a circle?

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.830
The circle represents one
of the operations

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.280
plus, minus and times.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.580
OK.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:12.750
This is interesting.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.400
So they say a circle represents
one of the

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:30.150
operations plus minus and times
is k circle l plus m

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:45.660
equal to k circle l plus
k circle m for all

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.070
numbers k, l, and m?

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.340
Well essentially, what
are they doing?

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.380
They're doing the distributive
property, right?

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.310
They're saying that k-- whatever
this operation times

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.050
l plus n-- is the same thing
as k times whatever this

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.150
operation is with l, plus
k whatever this

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.500
operation is with m.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.130
And the only places where the
distributive property works is

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.820
either with multiplication
or division.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.220
And division isn't one
of these properties.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.150
So essentially this doesn't
work with addition or

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.750
subtraction.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.160
So if essentially we're able
to prove or disprove that

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.720
multiplication is this operator,
then we have enough

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.970
information.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.650
This question could be rephrased
as: is circle equal

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.210
to multiplication?

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.150
So if we can answer this with
the statements, then we can

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.980
answer this top one.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.720
Because only multiplication
works with this.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.410
Or division, but division isn't
one of the options.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:55.850
Statement one says k circle 1 is
not equal to 1 circle k for

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.205
some numbers k.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.090
Well this immediately tells
me that this is not

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.890
multiplication, right?

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.050
In fact, this tells me that
this is subtraction.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.310
Right?

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.540
Because the only time where k
minus 1 is different than 1

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.620
minus k, with addition, they'd
always be equal to each other.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.640
With multiplication they'd
always equal each other.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.020
So this has to be if you believe
statement one, then

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.370
circle is subtraction.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.750
Which tells you that this
statement up here is not true.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.280
So statement one alone is
sufficient to determine

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.270
whether this statement
is true.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.720
Or another way to phrase
problem, whether circle is

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.230
equal to multiplication.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.750
So statement one
is sufficient.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.660
Statement one actually tells
us that the circle is

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.910
subtraction.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.870
Statement number two.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.100
Circle represents subtraction.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.090
OK well they just told
it outright there.

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.410
Well so this and this are
equivalent information and so

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.980
they're enough to determine that
this up here is not true.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.210
Remember, they're not saying,
is the statement true?

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.490
They're just saying, do you
have enough information to

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.140
figure it out?

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.050
And we know that this isn't
true because circle is

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.770
subtraction.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.860
And this statement only holds
true if the circle is equal to

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.570
multiplication.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.750
So each statement alone
is sufficient

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.000
to solve that problem.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.800
Problem 90.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.950
How many of the 60 cars sold
last month by a certain dealer

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.710
had neither power windows
nor a stereo?

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.970
OK.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.000
So it tells us 60 sold.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.420
And we want to know how
many had neither power

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.190
windows nor a stereo.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:37.090
Statement one tells of the 60
cars sold, 20 had a stereo but

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:38.340
not power windows.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:46.825
Fair enough.

00:08:46.825 --> 00:08:50.010
But that still doesn't tell
us how many had neither.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:54.770
So let me draw a little circle
Venn Diagram here.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.050
OK.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:57.790
So that's all 60 cars
that were sold.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.320
That pool right there,
that set.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.540
20 had stereos with
no power windows.

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.880
So let me draw some Venn
Diagrams. [SNEEZES]

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:07.980
Excuse me.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.590
All right.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.890
That sneeze that I was talking
about a couple of videos ago

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.790
finally happened and
I feel-- [SNEEZES]

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:15.990
excuse me.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.410
All right.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.750
Back to the problem.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.450
20 had stereos with
no power windows.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:25.570
So let's say that this is the
pool that had stereos.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.690
This is the pool that
had power windows.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.790
And what we care, actually, is
what had neither stereo nor

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.400
power windows.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.890
So we care about this outside.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:37.600
Oh, that looks tacky.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.010
That's a little garish.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.680
But anyway.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.130
So if this is stereos, this is
power windows, this would be

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.850
stereos and power windows.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.100
You're saying 20 had stereos
but no power windows.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.170
So that's this right here.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.250
So I'll do another fill.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:53.500
Yeah.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.430
That's not pleasant
to look at.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:02.840
But this is 20 stereo,
no power window.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.170
But that alone doesn't tell us
what this green area is.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:07.430
So what's the second
statement?

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.770
That's too dark.

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:14.660
Statement two tells us, of the
60 cars sold, 30 had both

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.265
power windows and a stereo.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.910
So that tells us that this range
right here-- let me do

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:30.000
it in another tacky color.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.040
That tells us that that's
how many had

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.230
power windows and stereos.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.520
Let me make sure I have
a good color here.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.580
So that's 30.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.000
I know that you can't
see that.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.110
OK.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.130
So we could answer a couple
of questions.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:56.350
We can answer, how many cars
sold had stereos in general?

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.045
Well 50, right?

00:10:58.045 --> 00:11:01.030
20 had a stereo, no
power windows.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:03.480
30 had a stereo with
power windows.

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.920
So a total of 50 stereos
were sold.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.850
We know that.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.800
50 had stereos.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.150
But that still doesn't
answer our question.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:18.060
Of the 10 that remained-- 60
were total, and there's 10

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.390
left within this space
and this space.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.070
We don't know how those
10 fall out.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.410
Maybe 5 had neither and
5 had only power

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.200
windows with no stereo.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.790
Or maybe there were no cars with
only power windows and no

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:35.430
stereos, and all
10 had neither.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.980
So you don't know, even
using both statements.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.100
So, at least for this one, they
haven't given us enough

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.140
information to figure out
how many had neither.

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.760
They did give us enough
information figure out how

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.510
many stereos got sold,
or how many cars

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:48.980
with stereos got sold.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:49.300
Anyway.

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.150
See you in the next video.
