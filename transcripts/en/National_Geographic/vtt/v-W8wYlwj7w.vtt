00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:02.767
NARRATOR: From Welsh girl
from an unknown fly speck

00:00:02.767 --> 00:00:06.533
of an island to supermodel.

00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:07.734
Darling, hello.

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:08.867
I'm Michael.

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:10.033
You look like you're in hell.

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.266
I'm sorry.

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.300
You can see it in
your eyes, darling.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.633
And [inaudible] a camera.

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:14.467
[inaudible]

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:16.767
Hold it, let me drag you away.

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:21.100
NARRATOR: In the end, a defining
cultural icon of our times.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.200
As ageless art director
of American "Vogue,"

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.567
she is fashion's version
of a literary giant.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:31.600
I've got to admit, I've had some
butterflies about all of this.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.533
Oh, no.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.166
You mean about
fashion generally.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.633
Well, that's a separate issue.

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:37.834
No, I'm talking about
meeting Grace Coddington,

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:41.266
because it's like meeting any
great leader in their field.

00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:42.667
Hey, it's like--
- Oh, no.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.000
NARRATOR: --when I meet
one of the great Taliban--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.233
No, no, no, I'm not that.

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:46.533
When I meet a great
Taliban commander,

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.100
I get a little bit nervous--
- Well--

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.033
--or a four-star general.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.033
--yeah, I would be too.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:51.367
It's the same.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:53.200
You know, I mean, you
are Grace Coddington.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.066
I mean, how do you carry that?

00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:56.233
Forget "Vogue" and forget--

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:56.967
Don't ask me
questions like that.

00:00:56.967 --> 00:00:58.233
[inaudible]

00:00:58.233 --> 00:00:59.500
Well, tell me about
fashion, all right?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.433
I'm a stranger in
a strange land.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:02.700
I've been here a week.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.667
I think I know less
than when I arrived.

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:05.533
Probably, yeah.

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:06.600
It's confusing.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.667
Does any of this
thing have any meaning?

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:13.533
I think we're all more
lost than we were before.

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:17.667
We're at a very strange moment
in fashion at the moment.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.133
Has fashion ever been
under such assault,

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.633
if I may use that word, before?

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.133
Because it's coming
from you and me--

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:27.000
I think every so often
it is, and it does,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.333
and one has to ask the question.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:37.367
I can't remember it being in
such a kind of strange place.

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:39.533
And it's a cultural thing.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.266
It's not just the fashion thing.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.900
So all this is
happening, because

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.867
of all the different things
that are happening in the world.

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:52.533
To wear clothes that are
extreme and very fashiony

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:57.000
doesn't feel right
now, because it's not

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.333
that moment in the
political situation

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:02.166
or the cultural situation.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.500
Obviously, it affects fashion.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.433
It does.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.033
Fashion's not like
a little island.

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:09.000
Well, this is precisely one of
the burning questions I've had

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.367
is about that interface between
history or culture and fashion.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.667
Right now we live in a
relatively dark political age--

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:17.867
Yeah.

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:19.834
--where Paris can blow
up at any moment, Brussels

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:21.033
can blow up at any moment.

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:23.033
Fashion can offer
us an escape or it

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:25.934
can offer us an expression of
that mood or it can offer us--

00:02:25.934 --> 00:02:27.767
It should offer
all those things.

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:28.834
--a reflection.

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:29.667
Yeah.

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:30.533
And it does.

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:31.633
It does?

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:34.533
And what we're seeing
now is exactly that.

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:38.433
It's a reflection of
all the insecurities

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:40.700
and the darkness and all
those different things

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.300
that you mentioned.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.767
You really think it is, yeah?

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:45.033
Yeah, I do.
I do.

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:46.233
Because that's been
a little pet theory.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.100
As a outsider, it's nothing.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.033
No, you get it, even
though you're not really

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.200
a fashion person, you know.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.266
Don't you love
the way she looked

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:55.633
at me when she said that?

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.200
Oh, my god.
