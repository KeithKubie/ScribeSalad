Narrator: DR. RHYS MORGAN IS AT
THE ROYAL NAVY SUBMARINE MUSEUM

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.044
IN GOSPORT, ENGLAND,

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.581
UNCOVERING INFORMATION
ABOUT A SECRET WEAPON

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.683
FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:35.435
BUSHNELL'S PLAN FOR THE TURTLE

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.938
WAS TO SNEAK UP ON
THE BRITISH ENEMY SHIPS

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.974
MOORED IN NEW YORK HARBOR.

00:00:44.143 --> 00:00:46.345
THE VESSEL HAD LOTS
OF WEIGHTS IN IT

00:00:46.345 --> 00:00:47.981
TO HELP IT SINK INTO THE WATER,

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:51.150
AND UNDERNEATH THE BASE,
THERE WAS A BALLAST TANK,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.986
WHICH WOULD BE FILLED
WITH WATER.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:55.922
AND THE OPERATOR,
A MAN CALLED EZRA LEE,

00:00:55.922 --> 00:00:59.526
WOULD PUMP THE WATER
IN AND OUT OF THE TANK

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.062
TO HELP SINK TO THE RIGHT DEPTH.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.401
Narrator:
AS THE TURTLE SLIPS UNDERWATER,

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:11.171
ITS TWO SURFACE-MOUNTED
SNORKELS SEAL.

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:15.708
THE PILOT POWERS THE CRAFT

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:18.511
USING A HAND-CRANKED
FRONT-MOUNTED PROPELLER.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:27.419
AS HE APPROACHES HIS TARGET,
HE READIES THE TURTLE'S WEAPON.

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:29.788
THE TURTLE'S WEAPON,
A KEG OF GUNPOWDER,

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.991
WAS ATTACHED TO THE BACK
OF THE WOODEN HULL.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:35.627
AS THE SUBMARINE SILENTLY
CREPT UP UNDERWATER

00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:37.196
TO THE BASE OF THE SHIPS,

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:39.332
IT WOULD BE ATTACHED
BY THIS DRILL,

00:01:39.332 --> 00:01:41.333
WHICH WOULD BE LITERALLY
HAND-DRILLED

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.269
INTO THE BASE OF THE SHIP.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.805
Narrator: UNFORTUNATELY
FOR THE PILOT, EZRA LEE,

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:48.641
THE BRITISH FLEET
HAD METAL HULLS.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.176
BY SHEER BAD LUCK,

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:53.779
EZRA LEE WASN'T ABLE
TO DRILL INTO THE SHIP'S HULL,

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.914
SO THE TURTLE WAS A BIT
OF A FAILURE.

00:01:55.914 --> 00:01:57.516
BUT HAVING SAID THAT,

00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:00.853
IT DID SET THE PRECEDENT
FOR SUBMERSIBLE COMBAT,

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:05.592
AND THE PRINCIPLES
OF BALLAST TANKS AND PROPULSION

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.828
STILL, TO THIS DAY,
REMAIN ON ALL SUBMARINES.
