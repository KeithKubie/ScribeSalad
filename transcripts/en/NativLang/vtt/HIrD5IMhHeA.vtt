2
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.810
have you ever tried shave ice? That's right. Shave ice,

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.230
that snowy powdery treat served around Hawaii.

4
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.840
Some shops even use homemade flavors, extracted straight from local fruits.

5
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.990
It's a great antidote to the heat and humidity.

6
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.330
So let's say you're giving me directions to a worthy shave. I shop.

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.250
Here's a map for you. I'm here and the shop is, oh,

8
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:38.490
right around here. How do I get there?

9
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.520
Whether or not you're aware of it,

10
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.730
the way you answered that question says a lot about how you've been taught to

11
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:51.030
speak about directions in your language. Take two directions, systems,

12
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.650
cardinal directions and relative directions. If you're American,

13
00:00:55.651 --> 00:01:00.060
European or Chinese, cardinal directions are probably second nature to you.

14
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.390
You imagine a map with a fixed north at the top eastern west to the sides and

15
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.683
south at the bottom.

16
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.460
So you tell me to go north and then east until I see the storefront.

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.070
There's another way to get me there.

18
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.340
You can direct me from my own point of view. Instead,

19
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.250
this gets called egocentric direction.

20
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.930
Putting yourself in my shoes, you'll tell me to turn to my left.

21
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.940
Then go forward. Then make a right turn and go straight again until I've arrived

22
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.860
so far. I'm not really telling you anything you don't already know,

23
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.960
but you're in Hawaii now.

24
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.860
And the language here lets you get around without the systems.

25
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.520
The main directions are Mocha towards the mountains or MCI towards the sea.

26
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.190
Mar means towards Lukas Land and Kai is sea.

27
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.400
So the shave ice is milk of the library.

28
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.050
I'm currently MCI of the shopping center, so I need to walk Mocha to get there.

29
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.230
Notice that the MOCA MCI system isn't egocentric if you're standing here in the

30
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.590
sea is here, but the mountains are there. This way is Malkin.

31
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:13.020
No matter which way you turn,

32
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.940
it's unlike cardinal directions to north is north.

33
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.580
No matter where you are on the island, but,

34
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.980
and Mocha depend on your current location.

35
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.950
So mocha and Mckayla are unique geographical directions.

36
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.970
This is one of many unique quirks I've found in my journeys.

And thank you for learning with them. [inaudible].
