00:00:00.343 --> 00:00:02.009
VINAY SHET: The reason
we are here today

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.800
is because spam continues
to be a major problem

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.840
on the internet.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.340
ReCAPTCHA's mission
is to fight the spam

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.740
and to keep the internet clean.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.730
We believe a spam-free,
clean internet is

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.284
a better internet for everyone.

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:18.200
My name is Vinay Shet.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.530
I'm a product manager
for reCAPTCHA.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.792
I'm here today with my
colleagues Aaron [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:24.500
and Aaron [INAUDIBLE]
who are engineering

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.270
leads for reCAPTCHA.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.840
And we have an exciting
session planned for you today.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.850
They are going to start
by giving a sense of,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.040
an overview of what
reCAPTCHA is and how

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.480
it has evolved in the last few
years to get to where it is

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.920
has gotten to today.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.950
We'll then go under the hood
and see how reCAPTCHA works

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.510
and how you can reCAPTCHA
on your site or your apps

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.240
to fight spam.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.090
We'll then take a quick look at
some recently released features

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.250
and some upcoming features
that they're launching soon.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.420
And then we have some
very exciting talks

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.120
on a couple of our partners.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.170
We have [? Dan ?] [INAUDIBLE]
from Ticketmaster joining us

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.120
today to tell us how to get
master users reCAPTCHA's

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.475
to fight bots.

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:03.600
And we have [? Danny ?]
[? Grant ?] from Cloudflare

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.140
joining us today as well to
tell us how they used reCAPTCHA

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.860
to make a better
experience for their users.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.680
And towards the end, we're
going to show you something

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.190
that I think you're going
to find extremely exciting.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.120
All right, so today
a significant amount

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.200
of the traffic on the internet
comes from automated bots.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.490
These bots hurt your
site and your apps.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.370
They could do so by
creating fake accounts,

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.970
by posting
inappropriate comments,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.520
or by engaging in fraud or
abuse on an e-commerce system,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.110
or by simply posting
spamming emails or messages.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.620
In other words, if
your site or app

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.050
has any resource of any
value, it is prone to abuse

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.016
by these bots.

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:51.390
But reCAPTCHA can help.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.090
ReCAPTCHA is a free
API that you can

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.160
use on your site or your app
to fight the span and abuse,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.000
and you can do so while
letting your valid users

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.220
through with these.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.740
If you use reCAPTCHA
on your site today,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.340
this is what it would look like.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.600
You would embed a widget
which is a checkbox that says,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.170
I'm not a robot.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.320
When users come
to this checkbox,

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.380
they would click on that
or tap on the checkbox

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.955
to show that they are human.

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:21.080
And for a significant fraction
of your users, that is all

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.740
they would have to do.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.230
The checkbox would check,
and they would get through

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.840
to the next page.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.540
Now for a certain
fraction of your users,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.784
you would prompt a challenge.

00:02:30.784 --> 00:02:32.450
You would say, hey,
prove you are really

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.630
a human by, in this example,
clicking on all the pictures

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.980
that to show a coffee.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.150
So a single click or a few
taps or some other times.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.800
ReCAPTCHA today is utilized
by over a million customers,

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.470
by companies or
organizations worldwide.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.570
Every day we just
see on the order

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.300
of hundreds of
millions of solutions

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.240
back from across 240
locales around the world.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.380
So we have a fairly broad
view of the abusive activity

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.310
that happens around the world.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.660
So the bad guys cannot hide.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.910
Oh, and reCAPTCHA is
also available to you

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.010
in over 56 languages.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.040
So no matter where in
the world your users are,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.414
reCAPTCHA has a solution for
them and will work for them.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.390
But this is easy, right?

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.910
A single checkbox, a few
taps, and you're through.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.290
But reCAPTCHA was
not always this easy.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.000
As recently as two years ago,
this is what reCAPTCHA was,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.760
right?

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.487
This is what we call
syntactic, distorted text.

00:03:34.487 --> 00:03:35.320
Let me say it again.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.290
It's a mouthful.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.110
Syntactic distorted text.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.750
Synthetic because we
would generate the image.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.334
We would take text of words,
and we know what the word is,

00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:45.750
and you'd create
it into an image,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.550
and then the human would
say, hey, what word is it?

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.350
And they would type it out.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.710
And 10 years ago, literally, if
you said that the idea was that

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.917
a human could read that,
but machines could not

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:02.000
because computer vision
or artificial intelligence

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.270
was not yet at the point
where they could do that.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.460
But guess what?

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.090
It began catching up.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.550
It began catching
up to a point where

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.960
we had to distorting the text
because the more you distort,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.482
the harder it is for machines.

00:04:17.482 --> 00:04:18.940
Oh, yeah, it's hard
for humans too,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.130
but yeah, sure, they
read the thing somehow.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.370
If they squint a little bit
hard they could read it.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.980
Right?

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.110
But ultimately it
got so bad, the image

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.820
on the right hand side there?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.120
That's crazy image is one of the
hardest in our text distorted

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.580
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.067
And two years ago in 2014 we
asked ourselves a question.

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:36.650
All right, so synthetic
distorted text

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.245
is what's the rage right now.

00:04:38.245 --> 00:04:41.440
Can it really tell humans
and machines apart?

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.770
So we took the hardest
variant of this reCAPTCHA

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.130
that we had, and we
showed it to some humans.

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.796
They were able to get
through at 33% accuracy.

00:04:51.796 --> 00:04:52.595
That's a third.

00:04:52.595 --> 00:04:54.196
All right?

00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:56.260
All right, right, so
humans can pass at 33%.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.820
What about machines?

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.450
So we gave the same CAPTCHA's
to our state-of-the-art machine

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.367
learning algorithm that our own
team had built within Google.

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:06.950
And this was two
years ago by the way.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.670
This was 2014.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.470
And the results shocked us.

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.670
So the state of the art machine
learning algorithm in 2014

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.570
was able to solve the hardest
synthetic distorted text

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:20.050
CAPTCHAs at 99.8% precision.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:21.356
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:24.224 --> 00:05:26.612
Now when most of you
folks think of CAPTCHAs,

00:05:26.612 --> 00:05:28.820
these are the kind of CAPTCHAs
you're thinking about,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.060
this synthetic distorted text.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.477
This was a wake up call.

00:05:32.477 --> 00:05:34.060
We had to go back
to our drawing board

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.190
literally to say, What
can we do to change this,

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.731
to pivot into
something that actually

00:05:37.731 --> 00:05:39.510
works in the real world.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.200
And that's when we decided
to go into [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.840
and learn something called
a risk analysis engine.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.530
A risk analysis engine is a
back end that does not look only

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.280
at the solution
to that challenge,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.380
but rather looks at the
whole engagement the user has

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.760
with that CAPTCHA
holistically, and then uses

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.420
that try to determine whether
someone is a human or a bot.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:04.300
In doing so, the challenge
is useful, but not

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.880
the only component.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.736
The second elementary really
was that we moved away

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:12.310
from a synthetic image,
one that was generated

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.790
by us, into a natural image.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.660
We could now tap
into street view

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.410
to try to see how we
can use a natural image

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.350
and use that as a
challenge when required.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.630
In 2016, the state of the
art in computer vision

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.750
is still not at a point
where at scale you

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.050
can understand everything
in the natural image,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.050
so it does provide some
degree of signal there.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.510
Now, of course, this
will not be true forever.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.580
We have a window of time
as the eye catches up,

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.490
as computer vision catches up.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.007
But as of today it works.

00:06:42.007 --> 00:06:43.590
And what our team
is going to focus on

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.370
is to try to stay
ahead of the curve.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.020
As technology evolves,
we keep trying

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.610
to improve our system,
[INAUDIBLE] technology

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.026
it was, to stay
ahead of the curve

00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:53.250
and to provide the best
security [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.850
But now let's tell
you a little bit more

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.890
about what's behind this risk
analysis engine, and to do so,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:59.820
I call upon Ying Liu.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.990
YING LIU: Thanks, Vinay.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.910
My name is Ying.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.340
I'm a 10-year-old
Google engineer.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.502
So that's the same
age with Google IL.

00:07:11.502 --> 00:07:13.210
I just look a little
bit older than that.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.900
So let me take you
behind the scenes,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:22.315
and let's all check out how
reCAPTCHA actually works.

00:07:22.315 --> 00:07:25.470
Turns out you just
need two lines of code.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.860
The first line is to request
a JavaScript library from us,

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.570
and the second line
is the div to render

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.110
the I'm not a robot widget.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.760
So as a developer, you
embed these two lines

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.220
of code in your web page
and [INAUDIBLE] a request

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.535
to the reCAPTCHA server.

00:07:44.535 --> 00:07:48.130
And in response we give you
the widget itself together

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:49.395
with some JavaScript library.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:57.090
And when your end user clicks on
the I'm not a robot check mark,

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.420
it sends another
HTTP request to us.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.270
And this time, we're looking
at the wide range of signals

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.090
that you're sending to us
including the full HTTP stack,

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.250
IP address, and et cetera.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.950
And on the server side, there's
something really interesting

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.580
is happening.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.170
So as Vinay was
mentioning, we're

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.900
deploying advanced
risk analysis system,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.820
which is using machine
learning to predict

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.750
how abusive this
incoming request is.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.250
And based on this
prediction, we give you

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.530
different CAPTCHA treatment.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.549
So if a well-behaved
human, we give you

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.559
a green check directly.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.594
For bad bots we reject
you right on the spot.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.160
That's a Photoshop
of the rejection.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.460
The actual picture
doesn't look like that.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.355
It was much worse.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.790
But everything else in
between, when we're not sure,

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.140
when we think you're suspicious
we give you different CAPTCHAs.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.640
Here I'm just showing
you two examples.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.060
The one on the left is
a three-by-three grid.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.420
We're showing you
nine natural images,

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.890
and you're asked to select
the common object among them.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.670
The one on the right
is even harder.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.130
Here we have one natural
image, and you're

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.530
asked to select to locate
a particular object

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.190
inside that picture.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.320
So as of today,
2016, this is still

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.710
considered very difficult.
Even for advanced AI.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:32.740
Now with this
preclassification, it

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.440
allows us to do a lot of
interesting experiments,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.700
and we start to gaining
insight about how

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.480
humans and bots behave
differently on the internet.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.090
And for the next few
slides, I'm going

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.714
to share with you
some of the insights.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:51.580
So as I mentioned just now,
there's preclassification,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.400
and for highly
suspicious traffic,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.100
we give them very
difficult CAPTCHAs.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.420
And this is how bots
behave-- they walk away.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.640
So here I'm showing two bars.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.390
The blue one is the
number of challenges.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:08.870
So challenge is defined as a
click on the checkbox of I'm

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:13.790
not a robot, and the red bar is
the number of solutions, that's

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:17.980
attempts to solve a CAPTCHA
when we are presented with one.

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.120
So as you can see
here is a big drop

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.270
from challenges to solutions.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.180
So it turns out
for bots, only 5%

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.660
of the challenges
lead into a solution,

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.690
and the remaining 95%,
they abandoned the CAPTCHA

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.790
experience.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.950
So you might wonder how
does that work for humans

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.650
if you present them a
very hard CAPTCHA, right?

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.370
So we did this experiment
on humans where we give them

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.030
the same hard CAPTCHAs, and
it turns out more than 90%

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.330
of humans actually try
to solve this CAPTCHA.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.810
So there's a huge difference
in terms of behavior

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.120
between bots and humans.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.560
So reCAPTCHA's mission has been
helping the internet clean,

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.670
keep it free of spam and abuse.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.170
So to do that, we cannot
drive humans away.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:07.960
Actually, the humans' usability
is a top priority for us,

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.580
so with the preclassification,
we can give humans

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:15.090
a lot easier challenges.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.450
So in the one that means
much easier text distortions,

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.940
and the v-1 human users
get an 89% pass rate.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.420
So here pass rate is defined
as the passed solutions

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.710
over total number of solutions.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:35.830
When we get onto V2, that number
is significant proving to 96%.

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:38.850
And for the remaining
4% of human users,

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.110
you failed, but you
can always try again.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.050
And CAPTCHA solving has
been faster and faster

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.660
for human beings.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.440
So in V1, because
it's text distortion

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.550
that you have to type in
through your keyboards,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.700
which is particularly
hard for mobile users.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:00.100
In V2, that experience has
changed into mouse clicks

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.620
or even screen touches.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:04.705
So with that, we have
seen the solving time

00:12:04.705 --> 00:12:08.260
for humans has reduced
by half, and that

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.160
means having humans solving
online was saving them

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:18.070
few seconds, and cumulatively
that is 50,000 hours every day

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.970
that we save internet users.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:26.110
50,000 hours every day that
is six man years, and that

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:28.420
is a lot of cats
and dogs videos you

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.150
could have watched on YouTube
rather than solving CAPTCHAs.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.210
And I think YouTube
should thank us for this.

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.530
So every day we receive
hundreds of millions

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:44.200
of CAPTCHA solutions, and
among the past solutions,

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.910
roughly one third
of them is coming

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.130
from no CAPTCHA experience.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.100
So of course that number
varies side by side.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.060
So to find out the particular
number for your sites,

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.310
Aaron is going to explain
more details, how to get that.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:08.730
So this is a map of the overall
pass rate we observed from V1.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:12.120
So here is color coded
by red as being low

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.120
pass rate, meaning most
of the solutions failed.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.710
And green is high pass rate.

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.500
Most of them succeeded.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:23.720
When we move on to
V2, you see it's

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.460
transitioning into a
land of green which

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.190
means whenever you envounter
V2 reCAPTCHA on the internet,

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.020
you're most likely to solve it
correctly, but if you're bots,

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.520
you're most likely to walk away.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:45.810
So to recap reCAPTCHA, it
is getting easier and faster

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.490
for humans and harder for bots.

00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:50.650
What that means for
you as a developer is

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.570
that your human users will enjoy
a much higher conversion rate,

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.130
and the bots are blocked out.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.210
So next, I'll have
Dan from Ticketmaster

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:02.070
to share us a story of
how reCAPTCHA V2 has

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.580
helped Ticketmaster human users
to buy more tickets online.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.335
So with that, Dan.

00:14:08.335 --> 00:14:09.085
DAN: Thanks, Ying.

00:14:09.085 --> 00:14:12.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.570
DAN: Hi, everyone.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.732
So my name's Dan
[INAUDIBLE], and I'm

00:14:17.732 --> 00:14:20.148
the director of abuse prevention
for Ticketmaster and Live

00:14:20.148 --> 00:14:21.600
Nation, and what
that means to you

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.750
guys is that myself
and my team, we battle

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.590
again bots all the time
trying to get you tickets

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:32.420
and keep people who aren't
people out of events.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.800
The long and short of it is
that this is our entire jobs,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.870
just like it is for them.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.627
We stop bots.

00:14:39.627 --> 00:14:41.210
Ticketmaster is a
40-year-old company.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.580
We're just celebrating our
40th anniversary this year,

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.340
and 2015 about 12,000
clients, 43,000 events,

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:51.960
465 million tickets, and
38 billion web requests

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.950
we serviced.

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:56.677
Bots are an absolutely
massive problem for us,

00:14:56.677 --> 00:14:58.010
just like they are for you guys.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:00.170
We want to get you guys in.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.270
When I go to bed I dream
about bots, so I'm not weird.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.260
And when I wake up, I
dream about bots still.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.330
That that might make me weird.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:12.525
But the, oh no, sorry
no tickets found.

00:15:12.525 --> 00:15:13.900
Yeah, you don't
like to see that.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:15.750
We don't like you
see that either.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.490
This can be, if it's a week
after an event goes on sale,

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.230
it's OK.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.620
You know, it's in a
normal organic traffic.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.730
If it's an hour after,
it kind of sucks,

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:25.110
but it's still maybe OK.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.360
If it's 15 seconds
in, I'm sure you

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.520
have some pretty
choice words about

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.902
that particular situation.

00:15:30.902 --> 00:15:32.610
So we don't want that
to happen, and this

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.450
is sometimes due to bots,
sometimes other things.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:37.850
But a lot of bots.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.417
So what do the bots
and bad actors do?

00:15:40.417 --> 00:15:42.500
Why do we have the problems
in general with people

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.230
not able to get tickets?

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:45.275
Like we said, bots again.

00:15:45.275 --> 00:15:46.400
The thing is CAPTCHA farms.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.490
So they'll take these CAPTCHAs,
they'll ship them off to China,

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.840
get them solved for low rates,
they'll ship back the solution,

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.296
then they can continue going
through with their programs.

00:15:56.296 --> 00:15:57.420
They violate ticket limits.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.810
So we say eight tickets
allowed, they'll buy 800, 8,000?

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.899
There's some number they can
actually accomplish in getting.

00:16:05.899 --> 00:16:07.940
They'll use other system
exploits to get tickets,

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.349
and then finally they'll
hold inventory in reserve.

00:16:11.349 --> 00:16:12.890
They'll put it on
a secondary market.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.110
If they sell it, they buy it.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.568
If they don't sell it, they
release it back into inventory.

00:16:16.568 --> 00:16:18.030
And we call this
no-risk arbitrage.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:19.850
And we need that to stop too.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.230
This market for just this
is $4-5 billion a year.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:25.550
So the bad guys who are
trying to get these tickets,

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:29.140
they have a lot of
money at stake here.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:31.414
So Ticketmaster, we use a
lot of different strategies.

00:16:31.414 --> 00:16:32.330
This is a few of them.

00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:35.060
We use a lot-- like you guys--
like the IT blocking schemes

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.310
based on velocities, we'll
look at the IP addresses,

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.510
we'll look at the sider blocks
that are coming through,

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.610
the accounts that
people are using,

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.107
the device identifiers
as well, and there's

00:16:45.107 --> 00:16:46.940
a bunch of other things
that we use as well.

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:48.356
We have internal
machine learning,

00:16:48.356 --> 00:16:50.090
and so we have a team
of data scientists

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.719
that's dedicated to
determining and figuring out

00:16:52.719 --> 00:16:55.010
what the bot signatures are
and how things are actually

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:58.330
behaving to predict
who's good and who's bad.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.800
So they'll say, You guys
look good, you guys look bad.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.150
I'm not used to holding
two things here, sorry.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:08.089
So, and so it'll categorize
based on how you appear to be.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:09.275
So these people looked good.

00:17:09.275 --> 00:17:11.390
You look good coming through,
we'll put you with that group.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.806
You guys look bad, we're going
to put you with that group.

00:17:13.806 --> 00:17:15.250
So that's how we
internally we'll

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.980
do that by categorization.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.780
And we have a little bit of
experience with CAPTCHA, too.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:23.359
So our history with
CAPTCHA, actually, we

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.050
wrote our own a
bunch of years back,

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.829
and it was fairly effective
for a little while.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:29.485
And then we also
had another CAPTCHA

00:17:29.485 --> 00:17:31.910
as well that was still
based on the text,

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.690
and as [INAUDIBLE]
mentioned, the OCRs

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.410
have gotten really good,
fabulously good, better

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.870
than pretty much any people are.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.187
So when you have that
type of CAPTCHA presented,

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:43.770
the ability for bots
to get through it

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.686
is actually better than
the ability for humans

00:17:45.686 --> 00:17:46.470
to get through it.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.053
So this is the presentation we
have on Ticketmaster right now,

00:17:49.053 --> 00:17:51.277
the check box that
you like to see.

00:17:51.277 --> 00:17:53.860
And for me, I love this because,
when I get up for an on sale,

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:54.770
I buy tickets too.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:55.600
We're all fans.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.090
We go to a lot of events.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:59.370
And when I see this in the
morning I'm like, whew,

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.120
I don't need glasses
and a shot of tequila

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.320
to get through this experience,
so it makes me really happy.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.990
And so what it's meant that
Ticketmaster, really, is we're

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:10.772
confident we're getting
more fans through.

00:18:10.772 --> 00:18:12.230
And we have a lot
of spiky traffic.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.938
We have a lot of big
on sales that we do,

00:18:13.938 --> 00:18:16.616
so some of these spikes could
be Garth Brooks and Beyonce

00:18:16.616 --> 00:18:17.990
and Adele and that
type of stuff,

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.489
and then when those on sales
complete, traffic kind of drops

00:18:20.489 --> 00:18:21.110
back off.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:23.290
But the averages before
reCAPTCHA enablement

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:25.081
were higher than they are now.

00:18:25.081 --> 00:18:27.080
So for a lot of you guys,
a reduction in traffic

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.700
may or may not be good,
for us is very good.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:33.050
We're getting 70% less traffic
in the same number sales.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:39.520
So 270% increase in
conversion rate, so fabulous.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.390
Thank you.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.170
And then post-conversion,
post-CAPTCHA conversion rate

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.370
as well is another
gate that we check.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:49.650
And so it's like, when
somebody goes through CAPTCHA,

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:51.120
do they actually buy something?

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.180
And so the conversion rate
when we had the AB testing was,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.740
we set it at 1.

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.160
The new conversion rate
is 226% greater than that.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.050
So we know that more
fans are getting

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.920
tickets out of that experience.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.160
So again, to quote
Ying, to recap

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.310
RECAPTCHA for Ticketmaster,
it's been better for us.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.880
70% less traffic going to the
event pages, so that's good.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.050
Event page conversion rate
has really been great,

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:20.032
the post-CAPTCHA conversion
rate up by 230%, and then

00:19:20.032 --> 00:19:22.490
the carted conversion rate, or
when somebody puts something

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:24.410
in their cart, do they buy it?

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.800
Up by 128%, so
that's been awesome.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.570
Things are really much
harder to measure,

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:31.070
but we kind of get an indication
based on like Twitter feeds

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.153
and what people are writing
about their experience

00:19:33.153 --> 00:19:35.620
and seeing things, less
bots getting tickets.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.654
So he's not super
happy about that.

00:19:38.654 --> 00:19:40.570
You have a lot better
ease in getting tickets,

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:43.920
because the inventory will be
there for you to access it.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.390
Actually, the
ecosystem comes down

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.120
so the ticket prices
for your average entry

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.470
will end up being
lower, because you

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.640
don't have to go to secondary
markets to buy them.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.700
And then we have our
little rock one guy,

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.250
you get the rock
one more because you

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.740
have to spend less money.

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.690
Thank you.

00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:59.408
And with that, I'm going
to pass on to Aaron.

00:19:59.408 --> 00:20:03.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.970
Hi.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:08.430
I'm Aaron Malenfant.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:10.010
I'm with the reCAPTCHA team.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.930
So you saw Ying present stats
on how reCAPTCHA does globally.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.250
And you saw Dan present
some stats on how reCAPTCHA

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.020
works for Ticketmaster.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.510
But you're probably
wondering, how

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.420
does reCAPTCHA work
for you and your site?

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:25.340
You may not know
this, but reCAPTCHA

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.770
has a number of charts and
graphs on our admin console

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.620
which are specific to your site.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.902
To get there, you can
go to g.co/recaptcha.

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:37.735
Click Get ReCAPTCHA.

00:20:39.996 --> 00:20:41.745
And from there, you'll
see a list of sites

00:20:41.745 --> 00:20:43.400
that you've registered with us.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.020
If you don't have
a site yet, you

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.660
can also register one there.

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:51.260
So once you're there, you
can click on your site.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.380
And the first chart,
which we launched

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.540
when we launch reCAPTCHA,
was a pass/fail chart.

00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:01.730
So this is, for all
the CAPTCHAs we served,

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.270
was it passed or failed?

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:08.040
But as you saw from Ying's
presentation, with V2,

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.420
the bots don't even
try to solve it.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.630
So it wasn't really giving
us a good metric of how

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:17.330
effective reCAPTCHA is doing.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:20.780
So earlier this week,
we launched a new chart

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.640
which is a session pass rate.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.030
What this says is, for
all the traffic which

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:29.280
clicked on the I'm
not a robot check box,

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:31.330
did they eventually pass?

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.800
Or did they walk away?

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.080
And so this will give you an
idea of your own conversion

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.345
rate for reCAPTCHA.

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:46.490
We also have a chart which
gives the average session time.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.870
And again, this is from the
time the user clicks on the,

00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:53.270
I'm not a robot, to
whether they succeed.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.265
This tells you how
much time your users

00:21:55.265 --> 00:21:57.450
are spending to solve CAPTCHAs.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.440
Another thing we've
been dealing with lately

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:11.810
is that not all websites have
the same value to spammers.

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.640
And also, not every
place on your website

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.080
has the same value.

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.500
There are some places where
the bots and the bad actors

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.590
will spend real money to try
to break in, because they can

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.130
make some money out of that.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.790
And we treat-- we
previously treated

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:31.020
those two things the same way.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.530
So recently we
added a way for you

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.290
to signal to us how you
want to treat the traffic.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:40.160
Should we optimize for security?

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.080
Or should we optimize
for usability?

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:47.600
And this is-- in the case where
we know it's a human or a bot,

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.350
we still treat it the same.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:54.390
But this allows you to signal
to us which way you wish us just

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:57.010
to bias our
decisions so that you

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.980
can make the appropriate
decision for your site

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:02.140
or for different
places on your site.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.070
To enable this feature,
you go to the same place

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.190
that you would for
the charts and graphs.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.810
And at the bottom, you can
open up the Advanced Settings

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:19.320
and set the Security
Preference for your site.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.390
By default though, we recommend
you just leave it in the middle

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:25.470
and let us make the decision.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.650
But for areas where you want
to bias towards usability--

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:33.650
for instance, let's say you
had a contact your sales form.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:37.540
And if there was some
spam that got in there,

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.630
that's not that big of a deal.

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:43.410
We're still protecting
you against bad actors,

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.980
but we're [? biased ?] a little
more towards the usable side

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:51.670
so that as much of-- so your
users have the easiest time.

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:56.760
But let's say you're in
a place where spammers

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.620
are willing to put
real money behind it,

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.420
then we want you to
go to Most Usable.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.310
So for commerce, maybe
Forgot My Password

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:07.020
links, those type
of things where you

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.360
want to bias towards security.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.345
So now, Dani from
CloudFlare is going

00:24:12.345 --> 00:24:14.900
to talk about how they used this
to solve a problem that they

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:15.400
were having.

00:24:19.464 --> 00:24:20.380
DANI GRANT: Hey, guys.

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.829
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.260
I'm Dani, and I'm the Product
Manager working closely

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.320
with Google's reCAPTCHA
at CloudFlare.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:31.630
CloudFlare is a content
delivery network

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.120
that also makes websites
resilient to attacks.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.050
Content delivery networks
sit in between the visitor

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:40.910
and the origin web server,
and accelerate traffic

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.280
in between them.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.520
What makes CloudFlare unique
is its special attention

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:46.630
to security.

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.170
When CloudFlare
proxies web traffic,

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:53.090
it let's good traffic in,
but keeps bad traffic out.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:55.090
Four million websites
use CloudFlare.

00:24:55.090 --> 00:25:00.590
So every second, we serve
3 and 1/2 million webpages.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.490
CloudFlare uses
Google's reCAPTCHA

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.610
to verify visitors when
we've seen their IP addresses

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:08.490
previously in cyber attacks.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.720
We're pretty big fans
of Google's reCAPTCHA.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.880
That's a picture of
our office in London

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.750
where Google helps us
keep our beer safe.

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.270
We see a lot of cyber attacks.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.580
This is a snapshot of just
some of our DDoS attack traffic

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.650
volume.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.870
So we end up serving
a lot of CAPTCHAs.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:31.550
We serve a billion and a
half CAPTCHA pages every day.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.460
I want to talk to you about
one interesting challenge

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.010
of serving reCAPTCHA, which is
serving to the users of the Tor

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.230
browser.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.560
Tor makes a browser
that allows anyone

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.050
to surf the web anonymously.

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.500
Anonymity is incredibly
important for people

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:50.760
who have their speech or access
to the internet restricted

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:52.400
all over the world.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.740
Unfortunately, anonymity
is also really useful

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:57.810
if you're a cyber criminal.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:00.980
And so unfortunately,
94% of the traffic

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:04.760
we see from the Tor browser
is malicious traffic.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.970
That means that when
Tor visitors visit

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.960
CloudFlare websites, their
IP reputation scores often

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:11.735
trigger CAPTCHAs.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.490
Google takes the following
logic, the more abusive

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.560
the traffic, the
more challenging

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.220
the CAPTCHA should be.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:24.340
There are a few ways to
make a challenging CAPTCHA.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.180
One is to serve images
that are visually

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.650
similar or instructions
that our lingually nuanced.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.440
This guards against
bots that are

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.940
using computer vision to
solve the CAPTCHAs themselves.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.860
But not all bots are doing this.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.770
Some are randomly
guessing at the CAPTCHAs.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.670
And for them, the
guard is to require

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.360
multiple correct
solutions of the CAPTCHA

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.340
to complete the
CAPTCHA challenge.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:53.150
The more correct solutions
you require, the less likely

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:56.680
a bot is to randomly guess
the CAPTCHA challenge.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.990
And so, for the
most suspicious IPs,

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:03.010
Google would serve
difficult CAPTCHAs

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.220
that would require
multiple correct solutions.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:10.930
This could be a very frustrating
experience for a Tor user.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:14.450
We care a lot about the
usability of the internet.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.410
And so we were trying
to find a solution.

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:22.180
And then Google did
something very neat.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.290
They offered this toggle
that, among other things,

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:28.040
would allow us to cap
the number of CAPTCHAs

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.320
in each CAPTCHA
challenge at one.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.600
We care a lot about the
usability of the internet,

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.320
more than allowing
a few extra bots in.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.330
And so, when they
released this setting,

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.350
we turned the slider
to the left right away.

00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.650
And now, if you
encounter a CAPTCHA

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.680
through CloudFlare,
even through Tor,

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.390
you only get one
CAPTCHA per challenge.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:53.690
I can show you what this
looks like on the Edge.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:56.860
So this chart shows the two
weeks before and two weeks

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.580
after we made this change.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.760
And this yellow
line is the day we

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.920
turned the slider to the left.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.390
The dark blue line at the
top is the total amount

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:08.550
of CAPTCHA sessions we serve.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:10.590
And the light blue
line at the bottom

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:14.200
is the total number of sessions
that were successfully passed.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.470
You can see that after
we made this change,

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:19.290
there's no increase in the
number of sessions passed.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.560
This means that, even
though the CAPTCHA is now

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:25.010
easier for users, no
extra bots are getting in.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:25.570
This is cool.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.080
Here's something interesting.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.900
This chart shows the
total number of CAPTCHAs

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.910
that we serve, including
the duplicate CAPTCHAs

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:39.250
inside the you
need to solve more

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:43.500
to complete the CAPTCHA
challenge CAPTCHA loops.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.290
Right away, when we turned
the slider to the left,

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:51.770
the number of CAPTCHAs that
we have served dropped by 70%.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.060
This is a win.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:57.530
This means that we are able
to serve 70% less CAPTCHAs,

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.410
but still not let
in any more bots.

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:03.060
And because users have
to solve less CAPTCHAs,

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:05.160
they're faster getting
in through the site.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.330
Immediately when we
turned on this option,

00:29:07.330 --> 00:29:11.500
users took 17% less time to get
through the CAPTCHA challenge.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:12.950
This is cool.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.980
So we're really happy
with the solution.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.070
And we hope tor users are, too.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.490
I'm going to hand this
back to Vinay and Aaron.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:22.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:23.964 --> 00:29:25.130
VINAY SHET: Thank you, Dani.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.270
That was an awesome story.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:27.930
Thanks for sharing
that with this.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.510
So I hope by now you've seen
that reCAPTCHA has truly

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.400
evolved over the
last several years.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.760
We have moved from a
synthetic distorted text

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.010
into a risk analysis
engine that looks

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.120
at the traffic in
a holistic manner.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:42.160
And in doing so, it has
truly become more secure

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.249
and is more effective
at stopping bots.

00:29:44.249 --> 00:29:45.790
You heard from
Ticketmaster how, when

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:48.920
they began using reCAPTCHA, they
were able to stop more bots,

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.090
and their user conversion
actually went up.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.790
You heard from CloudFlare how
when they began the switching

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:55.580
on to this new
version, they were

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.220
able to let the valued
users pass through easily,

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:02.500
while not seeing any increase
in the abusive activity.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:06.519
So the key point here really
is that, as technology evolves,

00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:08.560
as we see in more and
emerging threats coming up,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.689
we will stay abreast
with those threats.

00:30:10.689 --> 00:30:12.480
And hopefully we'll
stay ahead of the curve

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.950
so that you don't have to
worry about the security--

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:19.000
or spam abusing your site.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.300
And by doing all of this
stuff, we are relentlessly

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.570
focusing on usability.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:25.570
How can we make this as easy
as possible for the user?

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.950
So today already, a significant
number of users on your site

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.920
can get through
with just one click.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.770
But, but can we do better?

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.871
Are we done with just this?

00:30:38.871 --> 00:30:39.670
Let's ask Aaron.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:40.950
Hey, Aaron.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.380
Come on up.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:43.144
How you doing?

00:30:43.144 --> 00:30:44.060
AARON MALENFANT: Good.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:44.560
No, we--

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.010
DANI GRANT: Are we done?

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.520
AARON MALENFANT:
We're not done yet.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:51.940
What if we could make it zero
clicks instead of one click?

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.360
VINAY SHET: Zero clicks.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.530
What do you mean?

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.200
AARON MALENFANT: Let me show
you a screencast of something

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.513
we're working on right now.

00:31:00.707 --> 00:31:01.457
VINAY SHET: Sorry.

00:31:04.175 --> 00:31:06.300
AARON MALENFANT: Let's say
that the next generation

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:07.910
smartphone is coming
out, and they're

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.890
going for a retro style.

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:11.540
VINAY SHET: I would buy that.

00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.697
AARON MALENFANT: And you
know that a lot of people

00:31:13.697 --> 00:31:15.530
are going to attempt
to buy this and sell it

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:17.030
on the secondary
market, so you want

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.110
to put a CAPTCHA on the page.

00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:23.490
So the user would
come to the form.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.995
They would enter
their information out,

00:31:25.995 --> 00:31:30.684
type in their email
address, pick a color,

00:31:30.684 --> 00:31:32.190
and then click Buy Now.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.790
And that's it.

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:33.496
VINAY SHET: That's it?

00:31:33.496 --> 00:31:34.850
Wait, what just happened there?

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:35.349
Go back.

00:31:35.349 --> 00:31:36.140
Take it back.

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:40.880
So this is a normal form.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.310
The user just enters
their normal information,

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:45.660
and you would have had a
CAPTCHA on this page, correct?

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.220
AARON MALENFANT: That's correct.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.140
VINAY SHET: But in
this particular case,

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:49.630
they fill out the
information, they hit Buy Now,

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:50.675
and that's it?

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:51.550
AARON MALENFANT: Yes.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:52.258
VINAY SHET: Wait.

00:31:52.258 --> 00:31:53.740
Was there a CAPTCHA on the page?

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.615
AARON MALENFANT: Yes.

00:31:54.615 --> 00:31:55.666
It was invisible.

00:31:55.666 --> 00:31:58.960
VINAY SHET: The
invisible CAPTCHA.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.310
How does it work?

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.550
AARON MALENFANT: So we'll
do the risk analysis

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:04.480
before you click
the Buy Now button,

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.822
so that way we know,
when you click Buy Now,

00:32:07.822 --> 00:32:09.780
if we're going to give
you a no CAPTCHA or not.

00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.256
That way the third of the users
that would get the no CAPTCHA

00:32:13.256 --> 00:32:14.880
don't have to click
on anything at all.

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.004
VINAY SHET: That's amazing.

00:32:16.004 --> 00:32:17.990
So the fractions
of users who today

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:20.770
get a no CAPTCHA single click,
would, in this experience,

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.067
see nothing at all?

00:32:22.067 --> 00:32:23.400
AARON MALENFANT: That's correct.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:23.930
VINAY SHET: That's awesome.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.419
Has this launched
already, Aaron?

00:32:25.419 --> 00:32:26.460
AARON MALENFANT: Not yet.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.210
We will provide a link
at the end for beta sign

ups for anyone interested.

00:32:30.669 --> 00:32:31.710
VINAY SHET: That is cool.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:32.940
We have a video, don't we?

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.195
AARON MALENFANT: Yes.

00:32:33.195 --> 00:32:34.528
VINAY SHET: Shall we roll video?

00:32:34.528 --> 00:32:36.130
AARON MALENFANT: Sure.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.980
-Since the launch of the
no CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA,

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.440
a simple check box has
helped identify humans

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.830
from even this sneakiest bots,
stopping billions of attacks

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:48.910
on websites around the world.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.420
But to stay one step
ahead of the bad guys,

00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.370
reCAPTCHA needed
to keep evolving

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:56.540
to ensure the most
delightful user experience.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.910
And now we're taking
it even further.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:32:59.950
Can you see it?

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:00.910
Of course not.

It's invisible.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.490
Powering these advances
is a combination

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.370
of machine learning
and advanced risk

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:09.950
analysis that adapt to
new and emerging threats.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:17.210
So whether on desktop or
mobile, reCAPTCHA still

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:19.140
means no frustration.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.200
