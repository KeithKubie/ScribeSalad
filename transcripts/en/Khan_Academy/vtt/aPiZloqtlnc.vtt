00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.620
- [Instructor] We've spent several videos

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.020
already talking about
graphs like you see here.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.750
This is the graph for a particular firm,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.640
maybe it's making donuts
so in the donut industry,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.570
and we can see how the marginal cost

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.920
relates to the average variable
cost and average total cost.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.260
We go into some depth several videos ago,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.760
but we see that trend, that marginal cost,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.210
can trend down initially
because as quantity increases

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.930
each incremental unit could benefit

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.780
from things like specialization.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.020
And then the marginal cost,
the cost of each incremental

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.510
unit as a function of quantity could go up

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.810
because of things like coordination costs.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.010
And then we've also seen
how that relates to average

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.850
variable costs, that while
marginal cost is below average

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.740
variable cost, every incremental
unit is going to bring

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.350
down the average variable
cost, but then when marginal

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.710
cost crosses average variable cost,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.980
well now every incremental
unit is going to bring up

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.260
the average variable cost.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.330
And the same thing happens once it crosses

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.660
the average total cost.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.220
And of course the difference between,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.900
for any given quantity,
between the average total cost

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.400
and the average variable cost,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.430
that is the average fixed cost.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.410
Now with that out of the way,
we're going to think about

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.590
how this firm would react under
different market conditions.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.270
We're going to assume that
it's in a very competitive

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.330
or we could say a perfectly
competitive market

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.070
and so it is a price-taker.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.030
And so let's first imagine
what would be a positive

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.480
scenario for this firm.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.270
Let's imagine the price up
here, so let's call this P

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.730
sub-one and in a previous
video, we already said

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.640
it would be rational for
a profit-maximizing firm

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.830
to produce at a quantity
where the marginal cost

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.110
and the marginal revenue is meet.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.000
And if we're talking about
a competitive market,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.480
then this price right over
here is not going to be

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.980
a function of the firm's
quantity, so that's why

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.080
it's horizontal, and it
would be the same thing

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.700
as the marginal revenue.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.700
So in this situation at P
sub-one, the firm would produce

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.470
Q sub-one, and this is a
good situation for the firm

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.660
because the price that
it's getting is higher

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.170
than its average total cost
and so there is going to be

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.550
a nice amount of profit for this firm.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.280
The profit is going to be
the price minus the average

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.890
total cost at that quantity
times the actual quantity

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.890
so because P one is greater
than the average total cost,

00:02:26.473 --> 00:02:29.850
we have a situation where
the firm is profitable,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.850
firm is profitable, it would
want to stay in the market

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.400
but because you have a
profitable firm in this market

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.100
and you're likely to have
many profitable firms

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.103
in that market, it will
probably attract entrants.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.780
Other people might say, hey,
I wanna make just as much

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.750
money as this donut
company right over here,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.120
than this firm, and so you'll
probably have more and more

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.380
entrants into the market,
which will probably

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.380
reduce the prices.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.370
Now they could reduce
the prices until you get

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.610
to a price that looks something like this.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.510
So I will call that P sub-two.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.150
Now, a profit-maximizing
firm in this world

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.210
would keep producing
until the marginal cost

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.950
is equal to the marginal
revenue, which in this case

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.640
is the price, and this would
be, my lines aren't completely

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.770
straight there but you get
the idea, so that's Q sub-two.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.700
Now in this situation, P
sub-two is equal to the average

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.720
total cost, so the firm is break-even.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.230
It's not running at a loss or a profit.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.060
So it is break-even and so
here the firm is neutral

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.090
about whether in the long-run,
it stays in the market

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.700
or it exits the market,
but you're no longer

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.230
likely attracting entrants,
so no longer attracting,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.653
attracting entrants.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.304
But it does make sense for
the firm to keep operating

00:03:58.304 --> 00:04:01.040
at this situation even in the long run

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.730
because it is at least break-even.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.310
Now let's imagine another scenario,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.000
let's imagine this price level.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.870
So for whatever reason, the
market price gets to that

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.938
as we've talked about, a
rational firm would be producing

00:04:15.938 --> 00:04:20.420
at Q sub-three, and at P
sub-three right over here,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.670
there's some interesting things.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.570
Because P sub-three is less
than your average total cost,

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.640
your firm is running at a loss,
it's running at a loss here.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.640
So running, so firm, firm not profitable.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.040
Not profitable.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.460
Now you might say, well what
is this firm likely to do,

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.160
would it just shut down?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.070
Well in the short-run,
it would not make sense

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.620
for this firm to shut
down because the price

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.050
that it's getting is still
higher than its average

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.690
variable cost, in the
short-run, the fixed cost,

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.255
they've already been
spent, so you might as well

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:01.770
get as much incremental profit
on the margin as you can

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.100
and so as long as the price
is higher than the average

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.973
variable cost, well outside
of their fixed cost,

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:12.970
they're still making some money
to make up those fixed costs

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.900
so you have two things going on.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.050
So they would stay
operating in the short run,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.050
stay operating, operating
in the short-run, short-run,

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.450
but what would this
firm do in the long-run?

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.882
Well in the long-run, it
makes no sense to have a,

00:05:31.882 --> 00:05:34.000
to be in a market where
you can't make a profit

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.180
so in the long-run it
will exit, so it will exit

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:42.360
in the long-run.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.490
And in general, the terminology
when people are talking

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.700
about, well, do you start
or stop in the short-run,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.050
they usually talk about,
do you either shut down

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.590
or operate in the short-run,
and then in the long-run,

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.330
where it's like, hey, are you
going to sell your factories

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.740
or somehow dismantle them
or are you going to build

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.610
new factories, that's all
about exiting or entering

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.720
the industry.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.700
And of course, you have
another even worse scenario

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.090
for this firm, which might be down here,

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.250
where you have price sub-four.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.550
Here, in theory, this
is where we intersect

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.690
the marginal cost curve, Q sub-four.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.940
Now here it makes no sense for the company

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.850
to operate at all, so
because P sub-four is less

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.730
than the average total
cost, you would want to exit

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.705
in the long-run, exit in
long-run, exit the market

00:06:30.705 --> 00:06:33.760
but you wouldn't even wait for that long,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.630
wait to sell your factories,
because P sub-four

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.910
is less than your average variable cost,

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.910
you would also just shut down,
shut down in the short-run.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.120
So big picture from a
firm's point of view,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.094
you obviously want to be at
P one where you make a profit

00:06:53.094 --> 00:06:55.760
but you might attract entrants.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.250
At P sub-two, you as a firm
in the long-run are neutral

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.090
versus exiting the market
or entering the market

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.340
or other people entering the
market, you're at breakeven.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.340
At P sub-three, in the
long-run, you'd wanna exit

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.050
because you're not
profitable if the prices stay

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.340
at P sub-three, your price
is below your average

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.170
total cost at the rational
quantity to produce,

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.110
so in the long-run, you would exit.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:26.420
But because P sub-three is
greater than your average

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.270
variable cost at the rational quantity,

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.090
you would stay operating in the short-run

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.040
and then the last scenario
of course is P sub-four

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.840
where the price gets so low
that it just doesn't make

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.103
sense to even operate another moment.
