[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:09.470
EDD WILDER-JAMES:
Hey, everybody.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.410
How you doing?

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.010
Good.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.510
Good.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.240
Excellent.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.180
That was an amazing set
of demos, wasn't it?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.490
So I work with
TensorFlow, helping

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.200
build community
and collaboration

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.850
around the open source project.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.130
And usually, I put the
thank you slide at the end,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.270
for listening to me.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.240
But actually, I want to thank
you for contributing and being

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.080
part of the TensorFlow project.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.530
Whether you're here in this
room or on the livestream--

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.680
there's been some amazing
talk on YouTube from people

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.980
in China, and India, and Japan,
and all over the world joining

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.695
us virtually today--

00:00:42.695 --> 00:00:44.070
thank you for your
contributions.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.530
The project is where it
is today because of you.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.160
Of course, in core
TensorFlow alone, we've

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.890
had this many commits.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.150
Now this figure is out
of date-- over 50,000

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.880
from 1,800 contributors,
and much more than just code

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.625
commits.

00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:03.810
There's been 39,000
Stack Overflow

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.430
questions about TensorFlow.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.690
We have 66 machine learning
Google Developer Experts,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.290
many of whom are
here with us today.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.996
So welcome, and thank you guys.

00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:17.342
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.427 --> 00:01:20.010
It's really great
to have you with us.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.802
And thank you for
everything you do helping

00:01:21.802 --> 00:01:23.770
teach people about TensorFlow.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.680
And we've had 14 guest posts
to the TensorFlow blog,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.840
and that keeps going up.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.030
There are so many ways that
people are contributing.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.650
Whether you're organizing
a meetup, whether you're

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.020
teaching other people, whether
you're speaking at conferences,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.560
thank you.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.770
You're really helping build
out the TensorFlow ecosystem.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.335
So in this talk,
what I want to do

00:01:40.335 --> 00:01:42.085
is discuss how we're
growing the ecosystem

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:44.070
and report back on
some of the changes

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.700
that we've made
over the last year.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.700
So I'm going to cover how
we're making it easier

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.500
to get involved in TensorFlow.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.390
How, also, we're trying
to consult better

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.550
with the users in
the community and be

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.595
more transparent
about our development.

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:01.200
I'm going to cover how
we're empowering everybody

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.390
to get involved, and to
do more, and increasing

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.520
the number of contact
points where you can

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.853
get involved in the project.

00:02:07.853 --> 00:02:09.770
Finally, I'm going to
go into a bit more depth

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.750
about the conference that
was announced this morning,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.625
the TensorFlow World.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.010
So let's talk about how we're
making contribution easier

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.130
to TensorFlow.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.020
One of the most
important things to help

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.800
people contribute to the project
is increasing its modularity.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.720
You heard Martin
talk, this morning,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.580
about the low-level APIs.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.920
And with the move
to TensorFlow 2.0,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.930
we're trying to make it
less of a monolith, both

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.390
in terms of code and in
terms of people organization.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.807
When you come and you want to
contribute to an open source

00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:43.580
project, it helps to be able
to find where to contribute

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.020
and who to work with.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.723
By splitting things out, we're
creating more surface area

00:02:48.723 --> 00:02:50.640
where it's easy to start
building and creating

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.097
new projects.

00:02:52.097 --> 00:02:54.430
And our special interest
groups play a big part in this,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.940
and I'll talk a bit
more about them later.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.908
But it's not just code.

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:02.450
There's so many more places to
contribute this year, compared

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.763
to where we were last year.

00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:05.930
So I'm going to talk briefly
about our documentation

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.540
groups, the groups
getting involved

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.330
in testing, people who are
blogging, and on YouTube,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.110
and more.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.050
I was super excited
to see, last week,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.110
that we have published a
TensorFlow tutorial now

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.890
in Korean.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.580
And that's not a translation
that we've done on our team,

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.490
but that has come
from the community.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.990
So thank you so much to Hasin
Park for the Korean work.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.300
Similarly, we're able, also,
to publish it in Russian.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.890
Thank you to Andrew Steppen.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.410
This is just so exciting,
to see that TensorFlow

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.340
is being taken to more
areas around the world,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.923
thanks to you.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.930
I'm also really excited about
the TensorFlow 2.0 testing

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:43.710
group.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.630
Led by Paige Bailey,
this is a bunch

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.550
of contributors and
Google Developer

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.100
Experts who are working to give
TensorFlow 2.0 a thorough test.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.530
And you see, on the screen,
an example of a friction log.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.280
And so what's happening
here is that folks

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.250
are going through ML
workflows with TensorFlow 2.0,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.620
documenting what they find
delightful and awesome,

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.742
and also things that could
be a little bit better.

00:04:04.742 --> 00:04:06.200
If you'd like to
join in this work,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.800
this group meets weekly
and often has guests talks

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.380
from maintainers, and
SIG leaders, and so on,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.708
and is really helping
bring TensorFlow 2.0

00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:17.000
from the cutting edge into
something that is thoroughly

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.380
tested and ready for use.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.420
Already mentioned,
we have over 14 posts

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.520
from guests on the
TensorFlow blog.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.770
This is from a great post about
realtime person segmentation

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.830
in the browser
with TensorFlow.js.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.410
It comes from a grad student
and researcher and ITP.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.990
So whether it's testing,
whether it's documentation,

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.550
whether it's blogs and
conference talks, thank you.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.400
Now I want to talk a little
bit about TensorFlow RFCs.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.320
As you probably know, RFC
means Request For Comments.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.542
This time last year, we
weren't that organized

00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:58.250
about how we evolved
TensorFlow's design,

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.790
in terms of communicating it.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.700
And I stood on this
stage and told you

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.270
about how we were going
to launch the RFC process.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.960
Well, now we've accepted
21 RFCs over the period

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.590
of the last year.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.370
This is our key way to
communicate design, where

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.140
before code gets
landed in the project,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.610
we post an RFC about the
design and consult widely.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.050
This isn't just
about code that's

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.430
coming in from the TensorFlow
core team outwards.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.180
They can be created and
commented on by anyone.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.030
We've had several RFCs that
come from the broader community.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.080
And I expect to see so many
more of those in the future.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.580
We have several, for instance,
from. the SIG groups already.

00:05:37.097 --> 00:05:38.680
One of the things
I'm most proud about

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.050
is how the RFC process
is underpinning

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.862
the 2.0 transition.

00:05:42.862 --> 00:05:45.070
This was mentioned earlier,
but all the major changes

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.980
in TensorFlow 2.0 have
been proposed and consulted

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.410
with in RFCs.

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:52.960
This isn't just a great way
of consulting and getting

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.490
information feedback.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.070
Going forward, you now
have a big repository

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.310
of technical documentation about
why design choices were made

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.742
a certain way in TensorFlow.

00:06:01.742 --> 00:06:03.700
And it's a great educational
resource, as well,

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.908
for people who are coming
on and want to get involved

00:06:05.908 --> 00:06:07.838
in contributing to the project.

00:06:07.838 --> 00:06:09.380
So I really want to
give a big thanks

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.248
to anyone who has authored
or reviewed an RFC.

00:06:12.248 --> 00:06:14.540
You've played a vital role
in making TensorFlow better.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.580
Now let's talk a bit about the
social structure of TensorFlow.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.980
Last year I talked about how
coming to a large project

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.510
can be a little bit daunting.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.505
You don't know where
people are, where

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:32.266
the people that have your
interests in common are.

00:06:32.266 --> 00:06:35.010
And so we created the Special
Interest Groups, or SIGs,

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.360
as a way of organizing our work.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.090
There are so many
uses of TensorFlow,

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.680
so many environments,
so many architectures.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.707
And many of them are
outside of the scope

00:06:43.707 --> 00:06:45.040
that the core team can resource.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.500
And what we wanted to
do was enable TensorFlow

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.580
to grow and be more
sustainable by creating

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.070
a way for like-minded
people to collaborate

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.440
around well-defined projects.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.940
So this is why SIGs exist.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.030
They're groups of people
who are working together

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.640
for a defined project focus.

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.320
We started last
year with SIG Build,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.600
and now we have six of
them up and running.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.900
I'm going to give you a
quick state of the SIGs.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.820
Many-- in fact, most--
of all the SIG leaders

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.500
are here with us
today as well, so I'll

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.030
give a shout-out to them.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.850
And hopefully, you'll also
be able to talk to them

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.100
in the lunch and tomorrow.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.890
So SIG Addons first--

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.680
thank you to Shaun Morgan
and Amanda Fandango

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.740
for leading this group.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.980
Martin mentioned, at the
beginning of the day,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.920
that tf.contrib is no
longer a part of TensorFlow

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.180
going into TensorFlow 2.0.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.120
And SIG Addons is a place where
a lot of that code is going.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.410
So these are parts of TensorFlow
that don't fall into the core,

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.950
but do conform to these
well-defined APIs--

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.000
so more losses, ops,
layers, and so on.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.550
Now there's already
an RFC published

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.470
about where you can
find things that you

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:59.753
used to find in contrib
that have gone into addons.

00:07:59.753 --> 00:08:02.170
And addons are also going to
publish another RFC real soon

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:04.330
to say, well, how
can you get involved,

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.895
if you have your
favorite app or whatever,

00:08:06.895 --> 00:08:08.770
that you want to step
up and be a maintainer,

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:10.240
and maintain it
for everybody, how

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.620
you can join in the project.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:15.370
So I'd encourage you
to take a look at that.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.870
SIG Build-- SIG Build
really is where TensorFlow

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:19.170
meets the outside world.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.790
And it's not always the most
glamorous piece of work,

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.540
but building TensorFlow,
and packaging it,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.700
and distributing it is tough.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.850
And so thank you so much
to Jason Ziman and Austin

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:33.419
Anderson, who lead that SIG.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:36.659
SIG Build has achieved a
lot in the last few months.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.940
One thing, it's the
home for third-party

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.919
contributed builds
for architectures

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.080
that we don't ship
out as part of core--

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.250
so IBM Power, Intel
MKL optimized builds.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.770
And SIG Build works on
improving the TensorFlow build

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.490
and helps us be a better
neighbor in the Python

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.200
ecosystem as well.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.700
As you can imagine,
machine learning

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.550
generates a lot of
extreme situations

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.177
that need changes in ways
we evolve in packaging

00:09:02.177 --> 00:09:03.260
and distributing software.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.710
SIG IO is a fantastic group
that helps connect TensorFlow

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.060
to other systems.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.460
Out in the real world,
your data exists somewhere.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.380
You're using other
systems in other formats.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.660
So this group is led by Yong
Tang and Anton Dimitriev.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.850
IO really ships support for
extra file systems, extra file

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.910
formats.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.960
So if you're using any of these
things in the Apache ecosystem

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.640
or any of these
file formats, you

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:35.430
can use the SIG Addons module
to use that data in TensorFlow.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.390
This group is prolific.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.520
They've already
dropped four releases.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.120
Last week, they just
created their 0.4 release.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.670
And they also ship R integration
with their module too.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.390
SIG Networking is where a lot
of the alternative networking

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.330
schemes that are available
in contrib are going to.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.690
This is led by Byron
Yi and Jeron Bedoff.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.290
So if you're using
GDR, VERBS, MPI,

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:02.880
this is where you can find that.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.510
SIG Rust, led by Adam Crume, is
developing idiomatic language

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.250
bindings for the Rust
programming language.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.810
If you're interested in this,
or any of the other SIGs,

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.190
please talk to the leaders.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:14.697
They really do want more help.

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:17.030
And now they're up and running,
they're in a great place

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:18.103
to bring people on.

00:10:18.103 --> 00:10:19.520
If you're looking
for a way to get

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.230
involved in contributing
to TensorFlow,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.890
this is an ideal one.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.650
Finally, let me touch
on SIG TensorBoard.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.990
We've rebooted SIG
TensorBoard this year

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.630
to really work closely
with the community.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:35.500
And so this is a great time to
be involved, as the TensorBoard

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.500
team are starting to consult
and figuring out how we can best

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.390
enable people who are
using TensorBoard,

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:44.520
both in terms of creating
plugins or using it at scale.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.210
If you go to the demo area
above and go to the TensorBoard

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.785
stand, you'll find
Mani and Gal there,

00:10:49.785 --> 00:10:51.160
who will be happy
to talk to you.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.737
So this is the URL
for anything you

00:10:56.737 --> 00:10:58.320
want to do with
joining the TensorFlow

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.130
community, from docs,
to testing, to SIGs,

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.930
and all the other
ways to be involved,

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:04.580
the developer mailing list.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.715
Please head there.

00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:08.090
And if you're here with us
rather than on the livestream,

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.037
we're doing a contributor
luncheon tomorrow,

00:11:10.037 --> 00:11:12.620
where there'll be a little panel
discussion about contributing

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.630
to TensorFlow.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:15.642
And many of the core
team and the SIG leaders

00:11:15.642 --> 00:11:16.850
will be there to talk to you.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.120
So finally, let's move on and
talk about TensorFlow World.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.900
I'm so excited about this.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.740
It's our vision to bring
together the amazing people who

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:32.710
are part of our community
and give a space for everyone

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.880
to connect with each other.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.380
You know, there's
so much we can all

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.117
learn from how we're all
working with TensorFlow.

00:11:40.788 --> 00:11:42.330
So working with
O'Reilly Media, we're

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.760
going to have this event at
the end of October this year,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:48.190
here in Santa Clara.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.630
It'll be four days that really
celebrate the TensorFlow

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.570
ecosystem.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.910
We'll have content from
talks to tutorials.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:58.330
There'll be an expo and a
place for vendors to present.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.500
So we understand, as TensorFlow
gets out into the real world,

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:07.000
there is a large ecosystem
beyond folks in this room.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And we're really excited
that that means that we

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.170
can bring everyone together.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:12.000
You know, the main
point of doing something

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.150
like this is to connect all
the amazing users and everyone

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.320
with experience to share.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.240
As you heard, the call
for proposals is now open.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.450
So if you have anything
to share with your work,

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:27.690
your product, your company,
head to TensorFlow World.

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.190
Put in a proposal.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:31.080
You've got about
four or five weeks,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.370
while the call for
proposals is open.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.090
And then we'll be selecting
talks a few weeks after that.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.150
I really hope that you will
lend your voice to this event,

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:43.670
and I'm so excited to
see you all in October.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.620
So once again, thank you.

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.450
We really appreciate
how much that you

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.370
are a part of our community.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.380
Honestly, in my job, the
best thing, every day,

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:54.200
is when I get to talk to folks
who are using or developing

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.800
TensorFlow.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.390
And I know that's the same
for everyone on the team.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:00.760
It really is so exciting to
work with everybody here.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.010
This is the way you can meet me.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:03.880
Please do.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:06.760
If you have any
issue, or any desire

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.350
to contribute, or get involved
with the community, reach out.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.890
We're really happy
to talk to you.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.640
So thank you very much
for your attention.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.590
[MUSIC PLAYING]
