[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.320
SPEAKER 1: Well, thank
you for joining us today.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.980
JEREMY PIVEN: Absolutely.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.100
RICHARD T. JONES: Yes.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.860
SPEAKER 1: We're excited to
have you for "Talks at Google."

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.080
And we're here to talk
about "Wisdom of the Crowd."

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.950
So could you tell us a little
bit about who each of you play?

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.430
JEREMY PIVEN: We waited all
that time for you to say that?

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.984
My 10-year-old niece Pearl
could have done that.

00:00:24.984 --> 00:00:27.400
SPEAKER 1: You want to go with
the hard-hitting questions?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.860
JEREMY PIVEN: No.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.920
We'll do the heavy
lifting, and here we are.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.770
I play Jeffrey Tanner,
who is a tech innovator.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.744
And not unlike Steve Jobs,
we are introduced to him when

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:45.410
he's addressing
[? All Sourcer, ?] which

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.930
is his company, and
he's letting them

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.480
know that he'll be leaving
to pursue, basically,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.730
the killer of his daughter--

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.180
the man that's been accused--
is wrongfully accused.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.480
And that's where we
are introduced to him.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.050
And it's an incredibly--

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.040
I'll let Richard jump
in, and then we'll

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.795
talk about the
premise, or whatever.

00:01:08.795 --> 00:01:13.250
RICHARD T. JONES: I play
Detective Tommy Cavanaugh.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.040
I'm an old-school cop.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.280
I believe in the old-school
method of hard work and labor

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.290
is the way you solve crimes.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.052
We're introduced, early
on in our relationship,

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.010
because I investigate--

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.650
I was one of the detectives
on the case for his daughter's

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.320
murder.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:40.010
And Jeffery-- we disagree
on who we put in jail.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.800
So we come-- yeah, what, 180?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.740
That's how we start the show.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.790
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.000
SPEAKER 1: Had you guys
worked together before?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.240
JEREMY PIVEN: No.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.520
RICHARD T. JONES: No.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.240
JEREMY PIVEN: Never had.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.870
SPEAKER 1: So the
important question

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.300
is, did you Google
each other before you

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.410
started working together?

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.112
RICHARD T. JONES: I
watched "Entourage," so--

00:01:55.112 --> 00:01:55.612

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:56.497 --> 00:01:58.580
RICHARD T. JONES: No, I've
loved Jeremy since back

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.766
in "Say Anything" days, so--

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:00.890
JEREMY PIVEN: There you go.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.250
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah, man.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.100
I know all your work.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.113
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah, and I've--

00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:04.141
RICHARD T. JONES: Lucas.

00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:05.140
JEREMY PIVEN: Oh my god.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.130
Yeah-- go way back.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.520
Still in high school.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.390
No, and I've seen Richard--

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.900
he's been doing this thing
for as long as I have.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.570
And it's great to work with--

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.030
Richard's amazing
and doing his thing,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.240
and it's really fun
for us to work together

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.270
on many different levels.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.420
And I think, also, just the fact
that his character is so old

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.040
school and hasn't necessarily
embraced technology--

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.970
and certainly not in this way--

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.200
and I think that our ideologies
are so completely different.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.140
And the reality is is that
the police would, indeed,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.090
be leery of a crowdsourced
crime-solving site,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.900
because it could lead
to vigilante behavior

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.590
or we don't even know.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.800
So I think that it's a really--

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.989
it's a great premise that
could absolutely exist today.

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.780
SPEAKER 1: I do appreciate
your character--

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.860
the voice of reason.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.240
Because as someone who
works at a tech company,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.475
it could be like that.

00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:12.910
But we do have people
who try and dial it back

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.110
when things are on
the verge of insanity.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.650
But I'm curious as to--

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.090
how familiar were you with the
Silicon Valley, Bay Area scene

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.303
before you signed on to this?

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:25.803
RICHARD T. JONES:
I watched a movie.

00:03:25.803 --> 00:03:26.630
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:27.380
Steve Jobs.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.850
RICHARD T. JONES:
Yeah, Steve Jobs.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.180
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah, I mean--

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.930
RICHARD T. JONES:
That's about it, for me.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.387
SPEAKER 1: Different company.

00:03:33.387 --> 00:03:35.470
RICHARD T. JONES: But I
saw the Google movie, too.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.480
SPEAKER 1: There we go.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.700
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah,
there's so much information

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.110
available to us
now, because it's

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.460
moving at the speed of
light, and it's important.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.210
And I'm a bit of
a caveman myself,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.530
just in terms of technology.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.220
So it's fun to learn
about all this.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.580
And I don't know
the numbers, but I

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.000
think probably
this and anti-aging

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.384
are the fastest-growing
markets in the world, probably.

00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:05.300
RICHARD T. JONES: Wow.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.730
JEREMY PIVEN: Or
anti-aging on Google.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.896
RICHARD T. JONES: Or Google!

00:04:07.896 --> 00:04:09.490
JEREMY PIVEN: Put
them both together.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:11.570
SPEAKER 1: Slowly
merging into one Super.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.100
JEREMY PIVEN: Exactly.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.675
SPEAKER 1: So would you say that
technology doesn't play, like,

00:04:13.675 --> 00:04:15.592
a large role in either
of your personal lives?

00:04:15.592 --> 00:04:17.050
RICHARD T. JONES:
I would say that.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.130
SPEAKER 1: Yeah?

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.230
RICHARD T. JONES: I
think Jeremy's role--

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.560
I think technology plays
a bigger role in his life

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.650
than mine.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.049
I'm such a caveman.

00:04:25.049 --> 00:04:25.840
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.020
I am, too.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.181
And it's just from, you know,
just not having to rely on it.

00:04:32.181 --> 00:04:34.180
And then when you do, you
know, because it's all

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.440
about logging the hours--

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.460
and we haven't.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.822
So we look like dummies
trying to figure stuff out.

00:04:38.822 --> 00:04:40.072
SPEAKER 1: Does that make it--

00:04:40.072 --> 00:04:42.080
RICHARD T. JONES: I have
a hard time with my phone.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.330
SPEAKER 1: Does that make
it more challenging, though?

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.829
Because obviously,
you have to learn

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:47.470
this kind of, like, you
know, different language

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.440
that we tend to speak up here?

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.377
And you don't have to!

00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:51.271
RICHARD T. JONES: Not from me!

00:04:51.271 --> 00:04:53.060
So I'm kind of
learning the process.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.180
JEREMY PIVEN: He just
has to look perplexed.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.520
RICHARD T. JONES: Which is true.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.020
It's the--

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.300
SPEAKER 1: Method acting.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.752
RICHARD T. JONES:
--easiest job for me.

00:04:58.752 --> 00:05:00.110
JEREMY PIVEN: It's true.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.260
No, but for me, yeah,
it's been really

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.900
fun to learn this new
language, and to study it,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.762
because it is a really
interesting mix of having

00:05:11.762 --> 00:05:13.720
both sides of your brain
work at the same time,

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.110
because it is indeed technology.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.300
But it's also artistic.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.660
So you know, that's
really exciting to me.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.660
And you know, it's about time
that I embrace it, anyway.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.802
So I'm loving the journey.

00:05:29.802 --> 00:05:32.260
SPEAKER 1: What do you think
the biggest change that you've

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.074
embraced has been?

00:05:34.074 --> 00:05:38.630
JEREMY PIVEN: Oh,
that's a great question.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.780
I don't know, just not
having a fear of it,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.610
you know, because it can
be very intimidating.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.410
You know, when I--

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.880
like, my mother, like,
she's even worse than I am.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.340
Like, she doesn't know
how to use call waiting.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.930
I mean, that's where my mom is.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.720
She panics.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.980
She just, like, will give
up if there's another call.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.400
She just kind of throws the
phone away, and just gives up.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.940
So I can help her,
and so that's great.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:03.440
Yeah.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.020
It's mostly just kind of, like,
not being intimidated by it,

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.989
and making friends
with it, embracing it.

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:10.030
Because it is the future.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.405
The thing that
scares me, though,

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:14.830
is the whole AI aspect of it.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.540
I mean, like, why
are we developing

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:17.950
artificial intelligence?

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.220
We haven't even developed
our own intelligence,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.500
and, you know I mean?

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.170
You know, and, like, we have
so many other things to solve,

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.770
you know?

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.860
RICHARD T. JONES: And I have
so many people smarter than me.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.150
I don't need, like, a computer
being smarter than me.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.550
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.175
RICHARD T. JONES: I
look at my computer

00:06:35.175 --> 00:06:37.650
and I'm like, my
goodness, you're a genius.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.174
JEREMY PIVEN: And that's
not going to end well.

00:06:42.174 --> 00:06:43.240
You know what I mean?

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.340
How could that
possibly end well?

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.000
We're going to just figure
out a way for these machines

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.320
to think for themselves.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.850
RICHARD T. JONES: Right.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:51.640
JEREMY PIVEN: OK, great.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.660
RICHARD T. JONES:
Terminator, for real.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.493
JEREMY PIVEN: Right.

00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:54.540
I mean--

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.290
SPEAKER 1: Heard it here.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.180
Thanks so much.

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.254
Enjoy your time.

00:07:00.254 --> 00:07:02.170
RICHARD T. JONES: But
you're doing great work.

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.086
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:07:03.086 --> 00:07:04.086
SPEAKER 1: Nobody worry.

00:07:04.086 --> 00:07:06.402
We're all good.

00:07:06.402 --> 00:07:08.110
But it is one of those
interesting things

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.109
that I think we grapple
with here, and I'm sure,

00:07:10.109 --> 00:07:12.430
you know, the show runners
and writers grapple with.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.290
And it kind of trickles
down to being issues

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:15.130
that you guys face.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.460
And so, are there particular--
aside from AI, maybe,

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.932
things that, you know, the
show is covering that suddenly,

00:07:19.932 --> 00:07:22.390
you're finding yourself doing
more research into, and being

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.710
like, wait, what's
that, or like,

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.001
what's the application of this?

00:07:25.001 --> 00:07:28.540
Or is it more of a, I don't want
to know, I don't want to know?

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.110
RICHARD T. JONES: For me, it's
more of just really starting

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.260
to get into social media.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.000
I really suck at
the whole thing.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.790
And I have four kids, so I
spend so much time with them

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.650
that I have a hard time
doing what they do,

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.630
because they're so good at it.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:49.316
So now, I'm starting to learn
what social media really does.

00:07:49.316 --> 00:07:50.180
A little bit.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.460
He's laughing.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.670
So I'm starting to learn
how it really functions,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.935
and how information is
dispersed through social media

00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:01.120
at such a high level.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.310
I just-- it still kind of
amazes me how it does it.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.920
And so much of it is luck.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.370
I mean, what blows
up and what doesn't.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.755
And the timing of it, and
all that kind of stuff,

00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:15.130
is amazing to me,
because I think

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.360
there have been a
lot of great ideas

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.560
that haven't taken off, because
they were before their time,

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.240
or there are many
other variables.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.390
So, you know, from
a business aspect,

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.036
I think it's also
kind of fascinating.

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:25.910
SPEAKER 1: So not being,
like, super involved

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:27.493
in it before this,
what makes you want

00:08:27.493 --> 00:08:29.680
to sign on to a show like this?

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.730
JEREMY PIVEN: Because it's
so prevalent and current.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.490
And I'd like to
hear from you guys,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.929
but I think that a site,
like a platform like this,

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:42.010
could exist.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.020
And it probably already does--

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.200
it probably does, right?

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:45.555
RICHARD T. JONES: It does.

00:08:45.555 --> 00:08:45.910
It does.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.326
JEREMY PIVEN: You
know, and that's

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:50.050
why people are gravitating
towards this, because it's

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:51.100
completely plausible.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.240
RICHARD T. JONES: Right.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.880
JEREMY PIVEN: And, you know,
there's an argument to be made

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.100
on both sides, you
know, that you could--

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.770
the whole crowd-sourcing
idea that, you know, I mean,

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.500
90% of it you can't use,
and you pull from 10% of it,

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.150
and you know--

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.420
but we're living by
committee, anyway,

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.620
any time you look
up a restaurant,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.250
or try to figure out the best
way to travel to a place,

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.060
you know, so--

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.720
RICHARD T. JONES:
That's a good point.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.700
JEREMY PIVEN: --I
mean, we're already

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.180
very much using all that stuff.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.170
And the human aspect of it--

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.360
I'd like to play a human being.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.307
That's exciting to me, you know,
that actually has feelings.

00:09:25.307 --> 00:09:27.640
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah, the
characters are really rich--

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.320
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.260
RICHARD T. JONES: --also in it.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.160
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.785
SPEAKER 1: What do
you think you admire

00:09:31.785 --> 00:09:33.950
most about your characters?

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.120
JEREMY PIVEN: You
know, it's funny.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.220
My character is
broken, and he's--

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.820
and he thinks-- he
believes that if he

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.690
finds the killer, that his
grief and his pain will go away.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.136
And of course,
that's not the case.

00:09:49.136 --> 00:09:51.010
And I think it's just
a very fertile premise,

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:55.900
because it can lead to any
type of behavior on his part.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:57.580
And it's kind of dangerous.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.310
And he's, you know,
emotionally available.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:06.280
And we were developing this
great friendship, you know,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.380
even though you
wouldn't see it coming.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.272
And we have a lot of really
good, rich characters

00:10:11.272 --> 00:10:13.730
that are surrounding us-- we
were just talking about this--

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.300
that, like, everyone's
really great on the show.

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.000
And so, you could go into
any one of their stories

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.840
at any time.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.000
And also, we're trying to do
something that really hasn't--

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.650
outside of "The
Good Wife," I can't

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.140
think of another case
in which you've had

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.700
a real hybrid like our show.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.370
It's not a procedural.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.580
I have this throughline about
trying to find Mia's killer.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:43.300
And yet, the platform is opening
us up to solving other cases.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.430
And I've made a deal
with the cops that,

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.600
if they give me information--
oh, I can't-- well--

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.760
RICHARD T. JONES:
Yeah, you're on--

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.801
JEREMY PIVEN: I'm going--

00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:51.625
I'm going to tell you
too much information.

00:10:51.625 --> 00:10:53.340
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah,
that's Episode 4, Episode 5!

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:53.400
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:53.932
All right.

00:10:53.932 --> 00:10:54.890
I have to stop talking.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.540
I haven't slept so I would
have started confessing things.

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:58.680
It's going to be weird.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.620
Awkward.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.786
RICHARD T. JONES: All right.

00:11:00.786 --> 00:11:01.695
Just so you know.

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:03.930
SPEAKER 1: So I noticed--I think
one of the things I love is

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.471
that, Jeremy, you realize that
Tanner's more dressed up than,

00:11:06.471 --> 00:11:08.471
like, any Silicon
Valley CEO, right?

00:11:08.471 --> 00:11:09.970
Did you not make
the case for, like,

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.580
sweat pants and a black
t-shirt for your wardrobe?

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.772
RICHARD T. JONES: Actually,
I did, for my character.

00:11:14.772 --> 00:11:15.754
SPEAKER 1: You did?

00:11:15.754 --> 00:11:16.740
RICHARD T. JONES:
I would love that.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:18.614
JEREMY PIVEN: Well, I
mean, it's interesting.

00:11:18.614 --> 00:11:20.920
I mean, you've got
everyone from, you know,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.926
the classics like
Steve Jobs, or like,

00:11:23.926 --> 00:11:25.300
Fassbender-- all
he had to do was

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.490
put on those dad jeans
and a turtleneck.

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:31.810
And it was like, somebody
nominate this guy.

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:32.690
It's genius.

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:34.750
Do you know what I mean?

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:38.830
Yeah, I mean-- but then you have
the Elon Musks of the world.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:40.820
And, you know, he
puts it together well.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.594
And so it's a little
bit all over the place.

00:11:43.594 --> 00:11:45.010
And you have to
understand, he was

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.490
a guy who was
running his platform

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.990
and was wearing suits and
doing that whole thing.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:58.360
And now, he's totally
driven and very casual.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.630
So you'll see that
kind of journey.

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.670
He becomes more
casual as it goes on,

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.046
not caring what he looks like,
and being totally focused.

00:12:06.046 --> 00:12:07.836
SPEAKER 1: We know
nothing about that here.

00:12:07.836 --> 00:12:08.650
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:09.983
Everyone looks very comfortable.

00:12:09.983 --> 00:12:11.170
That's good.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.540
SPEAKER 1: Did you sort
of look to the kind

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.842
of titans of this industry
for your performance?

00:12:16.842 --> 00:12:19.300
Or was it something that you
sort of looked within yourself

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.450
to shape?

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:25.350
JEREMY PIVEN: Well, you've
got a guy, like I said,

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:27.360
who's pretty broken.

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.990
And this isn't modeled
after a specific person,

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.360
like if I was playing
the Elon Musk story,

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:40.890
then, you know, then that's
something very specific.

00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:43.140
But he's an original creation.

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.520
So you can look at the Steve
Jobs of the world, who really

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.690
believe that the
variable to his success

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:56.430
was not limiting his thinking,
and being incredibly creative,

00:12:56.430 --> 00:13:03.210
and not fearing other people,
their judgment about his ideas,

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.955
and being able to take
all these chances.

00:13:04.955 --> 00:13:08.170
So I would look at guys like
that and go, OK, that's cool.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.910
And then you help figure
out who that guy is.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.920
He's been able to
walk into rooms

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.200
and dominate, and
blah, blah, blah.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.820
But that's where
I'm coming from.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.770
And now, I'm broken.

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:22.110
So it's kind of,
as an actor, it's

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:25.980
fun to play all of those
things, and then, you know,

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.050
hopefully try to
make it original.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.360
SPEAKER 1: Richard, did
you ask to go on any police

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.910
ride-alongs, or did you
do these kind of hands-on,

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.201
where he's like, I'm just
going to wear dress-up pants?

00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:38.460
RICHARD T. JONES: What's funny
is that I've played so many law

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.160
enforcement characters that--

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.900
I've done so many ride-alongs,
it's kind of like, OK, I'm--

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:44.490
SPEAKER 1: You're good.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.120
JEREMY PIVEN: You're over it.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:45.603
RICHARD T. JONES: I'm good.

00:13:45.603 --> 00:13:46.570
I'm good.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.185
But, you know, I have
a lot of officers

00:13:49.185 --> 00:13:50.460
that are friends of mine.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.750
So I just talk to them and try
to get in the headspace of, OK,

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.770
how would you embrace somebody
who knows nothing about law

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:00.460
enforcement, who knows--

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.135
but thinks he has a platform
to help you solve cases?

00:14:03.135 --> 00:14:05.580
He's like, we go through
that all the time.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.650
Everybody is a cop.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.210
And so they have a
little resentment.

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:15.097
But they also need them, because
they do have information.

00:14:15.097 --> 00:14:15.930
That's the only way.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.850
It's the same--
crowd-sourcing happens.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.100
It's just they like
to see people's faces.

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.495
They like to hear from them,
and not through the media.

00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:24.120
JEREMY PIVEN: I think,
in a weird way--

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:28.890
I think the cops hate
that they need technology.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:29.890
RICHARD T. JONES: Right.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.520
JEREMY PIVEN: And I think
there are some civilians that

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.600
hate that they need cops.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.677
An interesting duality.

00:14:35.677 --> 00:14:36.635
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah.

00:14:36.635 --> 00:14:39.754
And you witness
that on the show.

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:40.920
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.340
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah.

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.964
SPEAKER 1: I think
a lot of us probably

00:14:42.964 --> 00:14:45.750
feel we could be less dependent
on technology, you know.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.007
It's certainly a crutch for--

00:14:47.007 --> 00:14:48.340
RICHARD T. JONES: Whoa, hold on.

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.930
That's what you guys feel like?

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.680
SPEAKER 1: I'm speaking
for myself, maybe!

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.770
RICHARD T. JONES: Oh!

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:54.310
SPEAKER 1: But, you know,
in my everyday life, there

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.020
were times when it's like,
I wish I could disconnect.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.903
I wish I didn't need
my phone near me,

00:14:57.903 --> 00:14:58.160
or something like that.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.600
JEREMY PIVEN: Well, but,
I mean, think about it.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.790
Think about how tied
we are to our phones.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.700
RICHARD T. JONES:
Oh, my goodness.

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:04.950
JEREMY PIVEN: You know, we
look to it for validation,

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.340
to guide us to
where we're going,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.340
to connect us with people.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.300
And I know I remember
that, you know--

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:15.900
they've done this
research, and I

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:17.940
don't know the exact
amount of time it takes,

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.280
but you rarely find
anyone that can

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:22.851
go more than five minutes
without checking their phone,

00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:23.350
you know?

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.100
And then these people check
the algorithms of all that,

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.010
and how to keep, like,
giving them little prizes,

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.100
you know, and suck
them in, you know?

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.150
And it's crazy.

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:36.339
It's psychological
warfare, at this point.

00:15:36.339 --> 00:15:37.380
SPEAKER 1: You said that.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.640
Not me.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.210
JEREMY PIVEN: You
are evil people.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:42.744
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:42.744 --> 00:15:44.410
SPEAKER 1: Switching
gears a little bit.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.155
JEREMY PIVEN: OK.

00:15:45.155 --> 00:15:47.812
SPEAKER 1: Do either of you
have any hidden talents?

00:15:47.812 --> 00:15:48.864
RICHARD T. JONES: Uh-oh.

00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:51.030
JEREMY PIVEN: I mean, I
don't know how hidden it is,

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.360
but I play the drums.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.842
And I'm learning
how to tap dance.

00:15:56.842 --> 00:15:57.800
Yeah, I play the drums.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.300
I've played drums since
I was eight years old.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:15:59.796
Yeah.

00:15:59.796 --> 00:16:01.420
RICHARD T. JONES: I didn't--
it was hidden from me!

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.280
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:02.980
RICHARD T. JONES: I
see you every day!

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:03.810
JEREMY PIVEN: No, I love it.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:05.268
I mean, there's no
drum kit on set.

00:16:05.268 --> 00:16:07.320
Otherwise, I'd be on
that thing day and night.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:07.440
RICHARD T. JONES: Why not?

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.850
You should put
one in the office.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:10.641
JEREMY PIVEN: It's
actually not a bad idea.

00:16:10.641 --> 00:16:12.360
No, I love to play the drums.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.390
And that's definitely what
I would have been doing.

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:18.220
And I have a band, and
we play when we can.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.000
And it's fun.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.250
I've played some fun events.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:25.350
I played one of Manny
Pacquiao's victory parties.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.710
But no one told us that
the entire audience was

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.640
flown in from the Philippines.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.990
And they were-- no
one told us that.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.530
And all they wanted was, you
know, they're very into karaoke

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.070
in the Philippines.

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.044
And we were playing,
like, you know--

00:16:41.044 --> 00:16:42.585
RICHARD T. JONES:
I can imagine this.

00:16:42.585 --> 00:16:46.340
JEREMY PIVEN: --not
soft, you know--

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.260
we weren't "musacians,"
if you will.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.270
And so, at the
end of every song,

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.790
it looked like a
Filipino oil painting.

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:55.260
They were just frozen.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.050
And there was no response.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.602
So it was a disaster.

00:16:59.602 --> 00:17:00.810
And then Manny got out there.

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:02.067
And they went bananas.

00:17:02.067 --> 00:17:03.900
And he was singing,
(SINGING IN NASAL VOICE)

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:09.150
"Sometimes, when we touch,
the honesty's too much."

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.670
Like that.

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:12.020
And I can't sing, either.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:13.000
Bless him.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
But they were going crazy--

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.187
crazy.

00:17:16.187 --> 00:17:20.859
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:21.670
OK.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:24.150
Enough of that.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:26.911
RICHARD T. JONES: He's also
dabbling in-- what else?

00:17:26.911 --> 00:17:28.369
JEREMY PIVEN: A
little tap dancing.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:28.670
I can't--

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:29.586
RICHARD T. JONES: And?

00:17:29.586 --> 00:17:30.300
Stand-up--

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:31.980
JEREMY PIVEN: Oh,
stand up comedy.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.540
You came-- Richard
came to see me.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:33.870
He was--

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.630
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.060
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah, he came to
see me do some stand up comedy

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.630
the other night.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.740
RICHARD T. JONES: That--I know.

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.670
SPEAKER 1: Very
nice and supportive.

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:38.655
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah,
he was supportive.

00:17:38.655 --> 00:17:39.140
Yeah.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.760
RICHARD T. JONES:
And he's funny.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.740
He is--

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.610
JEREMY PIVEN: You
were surprised.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.385
RICHARD T. JONES:
I was surprised.

00:17:42.385 --> 00:17:43.620
I'm not going to lie.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.260
I came out like, [INAUDIBLE],,
he's kind of good.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.070
I was very, very surprised.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.164
And he's very, very good.

00:17:49.164 --> 00:17:50.330
JEREMY PIVEN: I had a blast.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.510
It's like anything else.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:55.102
I have a huge respect for it,
and I've been studying it.

00:17:55.102 --> 00:17:56.685
And I think those
guys are incredible,

00:17:56.685 --> 00:17:58.470
that they could just get
up there by themselves

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.610
and transform the space.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:02.119
And I grew up doing
improv and whatnot.

00:18:02.119 --> 00:18:03.660
But, you know,
stand-up is different.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:07.537
And so, I've just been getting
up there and having fun.

00:18:07.537 --> 00:18:08.370
SPEAKER 1: Dabbling?

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.870
JEREMY PIVEN:
Dabbling, if you will.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.050
RICHARD T. JONES: I
play video games, and--

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:13.950
yeah.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.682
JEREMY PIVEN: Is that a talent?

00:18:15.682 --> 00:18:18.720
RICHARD T. JONES: It is for me.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.090
Yeah, I have-- wow.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:23.325
My life is-- I know how
to drive kids around.

00:18:23.325 --> 00:18:24.450
SPEAKER 1: That's a talent.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:24.770
JEREMY PIVEN: Yes.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.660
SPEAKER 1: Multitasking,
scheduling.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:26.550
RICHARD T. JONES: Thank you.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:27.720
I didn't say that part.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.075
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:18:28.075 --> 00:18:30.033
RICHARD T. JONES: I don't
know how to schedule.

00:18:30.033 --> 00:18:32.730
But my talents are very limited.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.249
Sorry.

00:18:33.249 --> 00:18:34.290
SPEAKER 1: To build off--

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:35.670
RICHARD T. JONES:
(WHISPERING) Sorry.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:36.700
SPEAKER 1: To build off that
last point, do either of you

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.766
have a go to karaoke song?

00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:40.170
RICHARD T. JONES: Oh.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:41.555
JEREMY PIVEN: You
know, I'm not--

00:18:41.555 --> 00:18:42.680
RICHARD T. JONES: I do rap.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.620
JEREMY PIVEN:
Yeah, it's easiest.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.100
RICHARD T. JONES: Karaoke rap.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.460
SPEAKER 1: Yeah?

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.320
RICHARD T. JONES:
That's why I do it.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.720
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.155
It's so easy. (RAPPING) 5:46
in the morning, crack of dawn

00:18:48.155 --> 00:18:49.030
and now, I'm yawning.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:50.550
Wipe the cold from my eyes--

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:50.970
RICHARD T. JONES: Oh.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:51.645
SPEAKER 1: He's multi-talented!

00:18:51.645 --> 00:18:51.779
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah.

00:18:51.779 --> 00:18:51.870
Look at that [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:53.012
SPEAKER 1: You're
really showcasing today!

00:18:53.012 --> 00:18:53.420
RICHARD T. JONES: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.500
JEREMY PIVEN I'm
really old school.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.540
SPEAKER 1: What inspires you?

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.420
JEREMY PIVEN: Just sunsets,
long walks, Chinese food,

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.840
black-and-white movies,
holding hands, gratitude--

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.090
RICHARD T. JONES: Good movies.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:07.631
JEREMY PIVEN: --just
hashtag blessed.

00:19:07.631 --> 00:19:08.379
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:08.379 --> 00:19:10.670
SPEAKER 1: See, you've got
the internet thing down pat.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.632
You've got it down pat.

00:19:11.632 --> 00:19:14.040
RICHARD T. JONES: That
actually is my hashtag.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.302
JEREMY PIVEN: There you go.

00:19:16.302 --> 00:19:17.260
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:23.700
Oh, my god.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:25.090
Sorry, what was the question?

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:26.730
SPEAKER 1: It doesn't
matter anymore.

00:19:28.469 --> 00:19:29.760
JEREMY PIVEN: What inspires us?

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.968
SPEAKER 1: What inspires you?

00:19:30.968 --> 00:19:32.299
JEREMY PIVEN: --inspires us?

00:19:32.299 --> 00:19:33.590
RICHARD T. JONES: Mountaintops.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:34.940
I actually do like mountains.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.820
See, I like nature.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.725
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:19:37.725 --> 00:19:39.940
RICHARD T. JONES:
Making fun of me.

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.994
I like the strength that it--

00:19:41.994 --> 00:19:42.910
SPEAKER 1: --embodies?

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:43.330
RICHARD T. JONES: That's right.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:45.410
And That's why I like mountains.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:46.062
Big mountains.

00:19:46.062 --> 00:19:47.020
JEREMY PIVEN: Oh, yeah?

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.735
SPEAKER 1: What frustrates you?

00:19:49.735 --> 00:19:50.943
RICHARD T. JONES: Long hours.

00:19:50.943 --> 00:19:52.944
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:52.944 --> 00:19:53.860
JEREMY PIVEN: I just--

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:58.630
when people-- I
love collaborating.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.530
And when people aren't into
collaboration, or at least

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:05.560
attempting to--

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.690
when they feel like their
way is the only way,

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:11.080
you know, I just like to have my
day in court, and just to kind

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.300
of, like, when you're
being creative,

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:17.200
just throw stuff in there, and
then whatever is, you know,

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.550
the best idea wins.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.480
And that should
always be the case,

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.850
no matter where it comes from.

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.100
And when people are kind of
limited in their thinking,

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.495
that's a problem with me.

00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:30.280
RICHARD T. JONES: It is.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.530
SPEAKER 1: You've led into
my next question, which is,

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:35.169
living or dead, who is someone
you'd like to collaborate with?

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:36.460
RICHARD T. JONES: Wow, you're--

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.310
JEREMY PIVEN: Now, these
are really good questions.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.210
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.380
JEREMY PIVEN: You went
from nothing to everything.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:41.285
SPEAKER 1: Thank you!

00:20:41.285 --> 00:20:42.646
I tried to save it.

00:20:42.646 --> 00:20:44.020
RICHARD T. JONES:
Living or dead?

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.103
SPEAKER 1: Living or dead.

00:20:45.103 --> 00:20:47.070
RICHARD T. JONES: Ooh.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.780
JEREMY PIVEN: I
think someone like--

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.670
I mean, Stanley Kubrick,
who's no longer alive,

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.030
is a genius, obviously.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.190
Charlie Chaplin, Marlin
Brando, Carrot Top.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:02.622
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:02.622 --> 00:21:04.372
RICHARD T. JONES:
Carrot Top was a genius.

00:21:04.372 --> 00:21:05.478
Why are you all laughing?

00:21:05.478 --> 00:21:06.103
SPEAKER 1: Was?

00:21:06.103 --> 00:21:07.809
What do you mean, was?

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:09.600
JEREMY PIVEN: He's in
Vegas right now, man.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.190
He's still around.

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.820
RICHARD T. JONES: He is?

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.250
JEREMY PIVEN: Yes.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:11.616
RICHARD T. JONES: Damn.

00:21:11.616 --> 00:21:12.350
I thought he'd passed away.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.058
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah,
he's playing tonight.

00:21:14.058 --> 00:21:15.377
We can go catch him.

00:21:15.377 --> 00:21:17.960
SPEAKER 1: We're going to take
a few quick audience questions.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.918
If anyone wants to head
back to the microphone.

00:21:19.918 --> 00:21:23.420
And in the interim, what's one
of the best pieces of advice

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.560
you've been given?

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.460
JEREMY PIVEN: Best
pieces of advice.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.965
Recently--

00:21:29.965 --> 00:21:32.090
RICHARD T. JONES: You
[INAUDIBLE] some good advice?

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.840
JEREMY PIVEN: Yes.

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.930
I was about to go on
stage to do some stand-up.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:40.210
And Kevin Nealon, who is just
a great old-school brilliant

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.420
stand-up, just said, you
know, take your time.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.190
Breathe.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:47.530
And let the audience
come to you, you know,

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.990
because, you know,
I'm so excited,

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:53.520
I want to bring it to them,
show them I got it, you know.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.630
And it's like, no,
let them come to you.

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:58.112
And it just-- you
saw, it worked.

00:21:58.112 --> 00:21:58.820
It really worked.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:21:59.290
RICHARD T. JONES: Oh,
was it that night?

00:21:59.290 --> 00:21:59.670
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.160
RICHARD T. JONES: It worked.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.132
JEREMY PIVEN: It works.

00:22:01.132 --> 00:22:01.840
It totally works.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.295
That was a really
nice piece of advice.

00:22:06.295 --> 00:22:08.590
RICHARD T. JONES: You know,
I'm a very big Christian,

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.770
so the advice I was given
a long time ago was,

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:16.630
always be passionate
about Jesus,

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:21.630
and understand that your
profession, which is acting,

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.442
that it shouldn't
be your passion.

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:24.650
It should be your profession.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:27.390
But you're always passionate
about who you work for,

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.576
because I work for him.

00:22:29.576 --> 00:22:31.540
So that got deep on you, see.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.387
JEREMY PIVEN: Matt--

00:22:32.387 --> 00:22:33.600
SPEAKER 1: Multi-layered.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.350
JEREMY PIVEN: And he's
working with a Jew.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.521
Imagine that.

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:38.270
RICHARD T. JONES:
That's my favorite part.

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:41.030
JEREMY PIVEN: But, you know,
Jesus was a Jew, so we're all--

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.280
RICHARD T. JONES: You know,
the Holy Day is coming up.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.366
Yeah, see, look at--

00:22:44.366 --> 00:22:44.722
SPEAKER 1: Tomorrow.

00:22:44.722 --> 00:22:45.470
It's tomorrow.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:46.616
RICHARD T. JONES:
Yeah, it's tomorrow.

00:22:46.616 --> 00:22:47.000
JEREMY PIVEN: That's right.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:47.834
There you go.

00:22:47.834 --> 00:22:49.750
AUDIENCE: I got a little
double-part question.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:52.750
The first part is, there
was another show that

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:55.220
came out last year called "APb"
with Justin Kirk and Eddie

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.720
Hudson.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.690
Very similar, tech giant,
inventor, has an app,

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.789
solves crimes, avenging
his loved one who died--

00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:02.080
RICHARD T. JONES: Never saw it.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:02.800
AUDIENCE: Never saw it.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:03.610
RICHARD T. JONES: Nope.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.380
AUDIENCE: Anyway, any
similarity between that show

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:05.963
and your show?

00:23:05.963 --> 00:23:07.957
And do you guys film
in San Francisco,

00:23:07.957 --> 00:23:09.665
or just pretend to
film in San Francisco?

00:23:09.665 --> 00:23:11.510
RICHARD T. JONES: I'll
take the second part first.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:12.230
AUDIENCE: Second part first.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.480
RICHARD T. JONES: We pretend
to film in San Francisco!

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.045
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:23:15.045 --> 00:23:15.710
And Oakland.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.360
No.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.480
Yeah, we-- two very
leading questions,

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.630
and I appreciate that,
because I love a challenge.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:25.330
I've never seen
or heard of "APB."

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:27.880
But I bless them
because, listen man,

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:30.280
you know, any time you do
a show, it's difficult.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.130
Like, we were up
against 30 other pilots

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:36.110
at CBS when we got
lucky and we got picked.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.680
Now, we're on Sunday
nights after "60 Minutes."

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.640
And Oprah is joining
"60 Minutes."

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.430
So-- that's crazy.

00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:48.624
So "APB"-- someone
should put an APB out

00:23:48.624 --> 00:23:50.290
on "APB," because
it's no longer around.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:51.580
RICHARD T. JONES: --because we
actually do get this question.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:53.270
But we actually
never saw the show.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.130
AUDIENCE: It could
have been canceled.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:54.781
I don't know.

00:23:54.781 --> 00:23:56.530
RICHARD T. JONES: Oh,
did it get canceled?

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:57.488
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:23:57.488 --> 00:23:58.289
I saw it last year.

00:23:58.289 --> 00:23:59.080
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.070
I don't-- I the
rumor is it's not--

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.780
SPEAKER 1: There's
a search engine

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.650
you can use to look
up the answer to this.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:04.780
JEREMY PIVEN: Yes!

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.065
RICHARD T. JONES: But anyone
who is upset about that,

00:24:07.065 --> 00:24:08.440
they can just tune
into our show,

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.790
because I think it's going
to be a little more--

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:10.790
AUDIENCE: Good solution.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.640
JEREMY PIVEN: I think
that was something

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:17.530
about, he literally took over
a police station himself.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.280
AUDIENCE: Correct.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.330
JEREMY PIVEN: So, I mean, it
was technologically-driven.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.530
But they're
completely different.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.340
And this whole relationship--

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.020
it's a whole other show.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:34.300
There will be no copyright
infringement enforced, at all.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.900
And we shoot in LA.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.160
And it takes place in San
Francisco and Oakland.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.650
And we shot the
pilot in Vancouver,

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.862
and, you know, that's
the way it goes.

00:24:46.862 --> 00:24:47.820
I'd love to shoot here.

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.370
It's amazing.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.040
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.850
JEREMY PIVEN: It's incredible.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.180
RICHARD T. JONES: I think
you guys are too expensive.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:51.760
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.620
AUDIENCE: We hope you're on
for another 10 years solid,

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.450
and it becomes one
of those great shows.

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:55.990
JEREMY PIVEN: Thank you, sir.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.200
RICHARD T. JONES:
Well, thank you.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.590
JEREMY PIVEN: I appreciate it.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.260
AUDIENCE: So how do you--

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:05.090
do you see the show as a
vehicle to explore, like,

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.700
sort of the
relationship between two

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.980
characters and the
technology piece, right?

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.480
Because your character
plays someone

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.600
who represents a large
portion of, you know,

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.475
CBS, of regular viewers
in the United States.

00:25:15.475 --> 00:25:18.867
And your character represents
sort of this area and, like,

00:25:18.867 --> 00:25:19.950
the embrace of technology.

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.165
How do you see that playing out
through the rest of the show?

00:25:23.165 --> 00:25:24.665
JEREMY PIVEN: It's
a great question.

00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:29.930
And I think that's part of this
incredibly fertile premise,

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:34.819
because he's completely
on the fence about--

00:25:34.819 --> 00:25:35.610
you know, because--

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:36.140
RICHARD T. JONES: Completely.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.410
JEREMY PIVEN: --yeah.

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.390
Because this is the
Wild, Wild, West,

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.010
you know, technology to him.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.960
And he doesn't understand it.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:49.270
And yet, there's so much
access to so much information.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.860
And so, I think that
it would be great--

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.380
and I don't want to-- this
would be great if Ted was here,

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.210
our creator, and I'm going
to have to just speak--

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:00.204
I won't speak for him.

00:26:00.204 --> 00:26:02.370
I'll speak for myself,
because that's all I can do--

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:12.225
I hope that we explore all the
dangers that it could present.

00:26:12.225 --> 00:26:13.100
You know what I mean?

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:18.890
Because between my character,
who I think is obsessed with

00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:23.270
finding his killer-- and that
can lead to some interesting

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.270
behavior--

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.000
and so that premise alone,
like, we're, you know,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.030
becoming friends where, in the
beginning, we weren't at all,

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.610
you know?

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:38.136
But I value the way--
he's a straight shooter.

00:26:38.136 --> 00:26:40.010
And I could tell he's
a real human being that

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:44.390
would be accessible to
doing the right thing.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:47.240
So, you know, to answer that
question, I think that's--

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.740
listen, vigilante
behavior is already--

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.630
you know, it's already happened.

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.580
We see it all the time.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.160
And so, it could lead to that.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:03.940
And it already has led
to solving some cases.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.760
So I think it can go either way.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:08.190
It's a very fertile premise.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.440
RICHARD T. JONES: But, yeah,
to bridge those two gaps,

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:15.300
I think that ultimately, it
would be a desired outcome from

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.240
[INAUDIBLE], I would think.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.910
Like we said, we can't really
speak for the creator, but--

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.370
JEREMY PIVEN: But it's
also really scary,

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:32.010
because in the pilot,
you see it being

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:35.220
used for the highest purpose.

00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.870
RICHARD T. JONES: Right.

00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:38.610
JEREMY PIVEN: And
there are the--

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:41.670
you know, celebrities
are under surveillance.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:42.765
That's what it is.

00:27:42.765 --> 00:27:44.355
I mean, call it what it is.

00:27:44.355 --> 00:27:49.260
You know, TMZs of the
world are hunting you

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.270
down for their own
profit and gain.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.180
And now, we're talking
about people doing it

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.790
for the right reasons.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:57.840
And that's pretty cool, I think.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.550
And as you can see in
the pilot, everyone

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:04.500
is kind of following
this sexual predator.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.070
And they bring him
down, all of them,

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.600
by, you know, videotaping
him, and everyone kind

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.780
of crowds around him.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.720
And I think it's
exhilarating and also scary.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.439
So I think that could
make for some good TV.

00:28:16.439 --> 00:28:18.480
SPEAKER 1: I do think one
of the important parts,

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.400
though, is that it also broaches
the topic of, like, what

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.040
happens when that goes wrong?

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.030
What happens when that's
misused, you know?

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:23.280
RICHARD T. JONES: That's right.

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:23.650
JEREMY PIVEN: Right.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:25.816
SPEAKER 1: We have to realize
there are consequences

00:28:25.816 --> 00:28:27.019
to actions, you know--

00:28:27.019 --> 00:28:28.310
RICHARD T. JONES: That's right.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.635
JEREMY PIVEN: Absolutely.

00:28:28.635 --> 00:28:29.926
SPEAKER 1: --vigilante actions!

00:28:29.926 --> 00:28:31.441
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah, it's--

00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:31.940
and then--

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.440
RICHARD T. JONES: We're also
putting other people in danger,

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.940
if people do it the wrong way.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:39.750
So it's complicated.

00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:44.182
AUDIENCE: What Comedy
Store did you go up at?

00:28:44.182 --> 00:28:45.390
JEREMY PIVEN: At the Improv--

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.670
you saw me at the Improv.

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.980
And I do Laugh
Factory Comedy Store.

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:50.700
And I get-- I just
throw myself up there

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:55.512
in the middle of, you
know, like, you know,

00:28:55.512 --> 00:28:56.470
seasoned professionals.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.880
RICHARD T. JONES: Like,
seasoned professionals!

00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.230
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.810
RICHARD T. JONES: He was, like,
in between, like, seasoned--

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:01.579
I was like, oh, no,
Jeremy, don't do this!

00:29:01.579 --> 00:29:02.370
JEREMY PIVEN: Yeah.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:03.660
RICHARD T. JONES: That's
why I was nervous for him,

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.493
'cause, like, wait--

00:29:04.493 --> 00:29:07.625
like, Dane Cook's up here--
like, a lot of the big stars

00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:08.270
are up here.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:09.000
You're like--

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.464
JEREMY PIVEN: Joe Rogan, and
all these guys that really

00:29:12.464 --> 00:29:14.130
have just honed their
craft, and they're

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:15.713
really great at what
they-- and I just

00:29:15.713 --> 00:29:20.070
figured, if I could
put myself in that mix,

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:24.030
and I can still kind of survive,
then I might be all right.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:28.650
But also, I love the
stakes of all that.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.560
And so, it's just been a
real learning experience.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.280
And I just got to keep
logging the hours.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.738
So I'm having a really great
time, and I took it seriously.

00:29:35.738 --> 00:29:39.190
And that's the only way you
could survive, in an arena

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.945
like that.

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:43.785
Like, you can't just get up
there and wing it, you know?

00:29:43.785 --> 00:29:44.660
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.743
So I think we have time
for a last question, which

00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:50.220
is, if you could go back and
tell your younger self one

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.660
thing, what would it be?

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.660
JEREMY PIVEN: Wow, now we're
getting really deep, huh?

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:55.976
Wow.

00:29:55.976 --> 00:29:57.975
RICHARD T. JONES: You
couldn't have briefed us--

00:29:57.975 --> 00:29:58.780
SPEAKER 1: Do you want
me to lead with that?

00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.610
RICHARD T. JONES: You
couldn't have briefed us--

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:00.985
JEREMY PIVEN:
Yeah, we could have

00:30:00.985 --> 00:30:02.706
prepared for these questions.

00:30:02.706 --> 00:30:05.330
RICHARD T. JONES: If I could go
back and tell my younger self--

00:30:10.522 --> 00:30:11.980
JEREMY PIVEN: You
know, it's weird,

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.450
because I was such
a class clown.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.610
And it somehow
paid off, you know?

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.230
It's weird.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.560
I would have just-- it's like,
there's a part of me that

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.430
goes--

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.440
you know, because
one of my teachers,

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.064
you know, in high school,
was just like, you know,

00:30:26.064 --> 00:30:28.480
(ACCENT) Jeremy, if you don't
straighten up and fly right,

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.871
you would be nothing!

00:30:29.871 --> 00:30:30.370
You know?

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.066
And it was a disaster.

00:30:33.066 --> 00:30:34.690
I don't even know
what accent that was.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.240
I was so random, and vague.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.137
It was supposed to be Indian.

00:30:41.137 --> 00:30:41.720
And it wasn't.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.660
It was a disaster.

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.620
So, you know, I've
been on the stage

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:54.070
since I was a child, and loving
it and having a great time.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:56.800
And, you know, there
were a lot of subjects

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.902
that I wasn't good at.

00:30:59.902 --> 00:31:01.360
But, you know, just
in terms of, we

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.735
were talking about a little
bit of organization and stuff

00:31:03.735 --> 00:31:06.280
like that, and I
really, you know, I wish

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:08.050
that I knew Spanish, you know.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.010
I was terrible.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:13.420
And now, you know, just being
able to communicate when

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.490
you travel, is, like,
you take that for granted

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:16.364
as you're growing up.

00:31:16.364 --> 00:31:18.370
And it'd be so great
to be in these cultures

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.830
and actually be
communicating with people,

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.350
speaking Italian, whatever.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:26.670
So in that way, I kind
of feel like a dummy.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:28.040
Wah-wah-wah.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.498
RICHARD T. JONES:
I would have told

00:31:29.498 --> 00:31:33.750
myself to pay more attention
in math and science,

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:39.168
so I could have created
something like Google.

00:31:39.168 --> 00:31:41.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.810
SPEAKER 1: Now you create art.

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.018
RICHARD T. JONES: Yeah, I
would have been, like, hey,

00:31:45.018 --> 00:31:46.010
if Google ever comes--

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.540
if you ever hear of a thing
called Google, invest.

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:49.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:50.880
OK, what do you have?

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.610
Sell it all.

00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:52.030
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.050
Well, thank you both so much.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:53.290
Congrats on the show.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:53.830
JEREMY PIVEN: Thank you.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:54.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:55.180
Thank you, guys.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:55.980
RICHARD T. JONES: Thank
you for watching, guys.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.800
JEREMY PIVEN: Thank you.
