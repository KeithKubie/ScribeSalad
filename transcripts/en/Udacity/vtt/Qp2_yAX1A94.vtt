00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hi, everybody. Welcome back. We're in unit 7, which is the last unit of our class.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In this unit, we're not going to cover any new material,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and there's no quizzes or homework that count for anything.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Instead, I want to accomplish two things.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
My main goal for this unit is to remind you of what we learned

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and to put it into a broader context.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I've asked some colleagues to help me out by sharing some of their experience with us over Skype.
