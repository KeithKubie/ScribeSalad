00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:06.010
 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.590
Around 2,500 years ago, a
group of revolutionary thinkers

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.275
changed the way we
think about mathematics.

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:14.450
Through the idea of
proof, the ancient Greeks

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.520
showed that maths isn't just
about performing calculations,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.750
but a way of
understanding and testing

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.260
the reality of the
world around us.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.095
The sign above
Plato's Academy was

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:27.110
said to have read: let no
one ignorant of geometry

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.302
enter here.

00:00:28.302 --> 00:00:31.580
And the great Archimedes
was even killed by a soldier

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.680
because he refused to
leave a proof unfinished.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.560
But, what is a proof?

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.970
Simply put, a proof is
a convincing argument

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.240
to demonstrate whether
something is true or false.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.920
For example, if all dogs have
four legs, then: is this a dog?

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.560
It's easy to prove that just
because all dogs have four

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.182
legs, not everything
with four legs is a dog.

00:00:53.182 --> 00:00:54.814
How about a mathematical proof?

00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:56.730
You've probably heard
of Pythagoras's theorem,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.570
a mathematical fact
about the sides

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.240
of a right-angled triangle.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.670
Here's one demonstration
of the theorem.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.230
Does it convince you?

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.020
Good proofs are undeniably true.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.550
200 years after
Pythagoras was around,

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.140
another Greek
mathematician called

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.860
Euclid perfected the
way to write proofs.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.760
With just a few basic
assumptions known as axioms,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.330
Euclid was able to prove many
other mathematical results.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.820
He compiled these results into
one remarkable book called

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.980
The Elements, and his
proofs are as true today as

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.770
when it was first
written and have

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.840
formed the foundations
of modern mathematics.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.100
From proofs about infinite
prime numbers used

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.715
internet encryption to
mathematical formulae used

00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:38.820
in engineering,
the ancient Greeks

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.990
have provided scientists,
economists, lawyers,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.790
architects, and well,
just about everyone,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.070
with a new mathematical
understanding of our world.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:02:00.162
