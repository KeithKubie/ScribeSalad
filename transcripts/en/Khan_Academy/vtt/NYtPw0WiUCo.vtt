00:00:00.254 --> 00:00:01.763
Voiceover: Now that we know a little bit

00:00:01.763 --> 00:00:03.255
about electron configurations,

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:06.323
I want to start thinking
about Valence electrons

00:00:06.323 --> 00:00:07.504
which are the electrons

00:00:07.504 --> 00:00:09.465
that are associated with an atom.

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:11.309
They are the ones that
are most likely to react

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.846
with other atoms or most
likely to form bonds

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:17.325
or be taken away or shared
in some way with other atoms.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:19.593
We've already kind of talked
a little bit about this

00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:21.908
as we talked about the trends
through the periodic table

00:00:21.908 --> 00:00:24.149
but now we'll do a
little bit more formally

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.424
and we'll use what we
call Lewis dot structures

00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:28.789
to visualize this.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:37.372
As I said this tend to
be the highest energy

00:00:37.372 --> 00:00:39.322
and furthest out.

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.708
You might be saying well
aren't the highest energy

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.741
the furthest out

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:43.702
or aren't the furthest out,

00:00:43.702 --> 00:00:44.979
the highest energy electrons.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:47.545
Well that is true if we're
talking about the s-block,

00:00:47.545 --> 00:00:50.467
if we're talking about the
s-block right over here

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:53.049
or if we're talking about the p-block

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:58.242
right, the p-block right over here

00:00:58.242 --> 00:00:59.954
but that is not true.

00:00:59.954 --> 00:01:04.891
That is not necessarily true
for the transition metals

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:07.026
for the non-main block elements.

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:09.455
That's why I'm not using an absolute.

00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:11.911
I'm saying this it tends
to be the highest energy

00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:13.322
for the said electrons.

00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:15.132
Let's think this through a little bit

00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:17.032
and let's try to draw
some Lewis dot structure

00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:19.453
so we could start with
the simplest of elements.

00:01:19.453 --> 00:01:21.029
We could start with hydrogen.

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:22.946
Hydrogen has one electron.

00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:26.302
Its electron configuration is one, S1

00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:29.404
that one electron is its
one Valence electron.

00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:31.354
That's the electron that hydrogen will use

00:01:31.354 --> 00:01:32.039
when it reacts.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:33.469
It could be swiped away from hydrogen

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.711
where hydrogen will just
become a positive ion

00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:38.094
or maybe it will share
it with another one,

00:01:38.094 --> 00:01:40.776
it can share this
electron with another atom

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:42.944
and that atom will share
an electron with it

00:01:42.944 --> 00:01:44.481
and then hydrogen maybe could pretend

00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:46.640
to have a more stable
configuration like helium.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.584
That's its one Valence electron.

00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:53.570
We would do that just as
a dot around the hydrogen.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.108
Now what about the other
group one elements?

00:01:56.108 --> 00:01:59.986
Let's say sodium.

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:03.541
Sodium, what's its electron configuration.

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:05.653
Well I use a short hand
where we could say,

00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:08.143
well it's base configuration
is the same as neon.

00:02:08.143 --> 00:02:11.429
It has a base configuration of neon.

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:17.727
Neon is one S two, two S two, two P six,

00:02:17.727 --> 00:02:19.175
that's what this represents

00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:20.605
and then to get to sodium,

00:02:20.605 --> 00:02:26.971
you would then have three S one.

00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:29.618
How many Valence electrons
does sodium have?

00:02:29.618 --> 00:02:32.110
Well its highest energy,
furthest out electron

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.429
or I say the electron that's
in a non-stable shell.

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.901
That's in a shell that
hasn't been stabilized.

00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.977
It hasn't gotten to
its fully stable state.

00:02:42.977 --> 00:02:45.280
There's only one electron
in that situation

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.217
right over here, the three S one electron.

00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:50.085
Sodium as well, you
could depict like that.

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:51.713
It only has one Valence electron

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.829
that's the electron that
could be swiped away from it

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.773
or that somehow could be

00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:58.211
involved in a covalent bond somehow.

00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:02.000
Now let's do things with
more, more Valence electrons

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.449
than hydrogen or sodium

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:04.833
but the important thing to realize

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.985
and actually for the
example of hydrogen sodium

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.099
is that all of these group one elements

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.674
are going to have one Valence electron.

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:12.881
They're going to have one electron

00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:15.417
that they tend to use when
they are either getting lost

00:03:15.417 --> 00:03:18.260
to form an ion or that
they might be able to use

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.150
to form a covalent bond.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.653
Now let's think about helium

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:24.077
and helium's an interesting character

00:03:24.077 --> 00:03:29.296
because all of the rest of the noble gases

00:03:29.296 --> 00:03:31.119
have eight Valence electrons

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:32.451
which makes them very stable

00:03:32.451 --> 00:03:34.845
but helium only has two Valence electrons.

00:03:34.845 --> 00:03:36.709
The reason why it's included here

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.770
is because helium is also very stable

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.524
because for that first shell,

00:03:40.524 --> 00:03:44.530
you only need two electrons
to feel full, to feel stable.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:51.554
Helium has two Valence electrons,

00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:54.292
its electron configuration is one S two.

00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:56.146
Once again the reason why it's out here

00:03:56.146 --> 00:03:57.209
with the noble gases

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.061
is because it's very stable and very inert

00:03:59.061 --> 00:04:00.194
like the noble gases

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:02.698
that's why we now use
those helium for balloons

00:04:02.698 --> 00:04:03.820
instead of hydrogen.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.195
It's not going to blow
up like the Hindenburg

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:09.269
but you might say, well, if
it has two Valence electrons

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.436
maybe it should be in group two

00:04:10.436 --> 00:04:11.938
because wouldn't all of
the group two elements

00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:13.136
have two Valence electrons?

00:04:13.136 --> 00:04:15.846
That actually would be a
very reasonable argument

00:04:15.846 --> 00:04:17.061
and we've seen that already.

00:04:17.061 --> 00:04:18.886
One can make a very reasonable argument

00:04:18.886 --> 00:04:26.501
to put helium in group
two for that reason.

00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.381
All of the elements in group two

00:04:28.381 --> 00:04:30.504
are going to have two Valence electrons.

00:04:30.504 --> 00:04:33.391
Now, let's jump to one
of the most interesting

00:04:33.391 --> 00:04:35.732
and versatile elements
in the periodic table,

00:04:35.732 --> 00:04:37.550
the one that really
forms the basis of life

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.638
as we know it, and that's carbon.

00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:41.450
I encourage you to pause this video

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.067
and based on what we've just talked about,

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:48.149
think about how many
Valence electrons carbon has

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:50.787
and what its Lewis dot
structure could look like.

00:04:50.787 --> 00:04:55.909
Well carbon's electron configuration

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:02.391
is going to be the same as helium plus

00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:10.197
you're going to have two
S two and then two P two.

00:05:10.197 --> 00:05:14.164
How many electrons does it
have in its outer most shell

00:05:14.164 --> 00:05:16.388
that has not been completed yet?

00:05:16.388 --> 00:05:19.321
Well it has these four, two plus two.

00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:22.189
We could depict them as one, two, three,

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:24.843
four Valence electrons.

00:05:24.843 --> 00:05:26.968
Why is this interesting?

00:05:26.968 --> 00:05:28.082
Well we can now think about

00:05:28.082 --> 00:05:30.296
especially if we see
carbon's Valence electrons

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:32.347
and we see hydrogen is
this Lewis dot structure,

00:05:32.347 --> 00:05:35.307
we can begin to predict
what types of molecules

00:05:35.307 --> 00:05:37.252
carbon and hydrogen could form together.

00:05:37.252 --> 00:05:40.149
For example, carbon
would like to get to A,

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:42.499
it would like to pretend
like it has electrons

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:46.868
so it feels more stable
like the noble gas neon

00:05:46.868 --> 00:05:49.458
and hydrogen would like to at least feel

00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:52.232
like it has two electrons
in its outer most shell

00:05:52.232 --> 00:05:54.363
so it can feel more stable like helium.

00:05:54.363 --> 00:05:56.802
If these are carbon atoms

00:05:56.802 --> 00:05:59.082
and if these are hydrogen atoms,

00:05:59.082 --> 00:06:00.647
I'll do the hydrogen orange.

00:06:02.401 --> 00:06:03.797
Actually let me do it this way.

00:06:05.858 --> 00:06:11.308
Hydrogen, hydrogen, hydrogen

00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:14.478
and actually let me do it
the way I was doing it first.

00:06:16.907 --> 00:06:18.817
You could imagine something like this

00:06:18.817 --> 00:06:23.963
where carbon could bond just
based on what we've learned

00:06:23.963 --> 00:06:25.900
about Valence electrons
and Lewis dot structures.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.547
You could say, well,

00:06:26.547 --> 00:06:28.392
I would predict that
maybe a molecule like this

00:06:28.392 --> 00:06:30.184
could form where a carbon

00:06:30.184 --> 00:06:32.255
shares it's four Valence electrons

00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:33.406
with four different hydrogens

00:06:33.406 --> 00:06:35.834
and in exchange it shares an electron

00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:37.104
from each of those four hydrogens

00:06:37.104 --> 00:06:38.589
and so the carbon can feel like

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:40.163
it has eight Valence electrons.

00:06:40.163 --> 00:06:41.766
Each of the hydrogens can feel

00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:43.887
like it has two Valence electrons.

00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:46.040
If you did this, if you say,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.784
"Well there should be
some molecule out there"

00:06:47.784 --> 00:06:49.741
"in nature that seems
pretty stable like this."

00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:51.172
You would be absolutely correct.

00:06:51.172 --> 00:06:54.410
This is methane and the way
that this would be depicted

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.618
with the Lewis dot structure

00:06:55.618 --> 00:06:58.593
is this right what I did over here

00:06:58.593 --> 00:06:59.936
is less conventional notation.

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:02.222
Each of these electron
pair so that electron pair

00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:04.419
would be represented as a covalent bond.

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.523
This would be represented
as a covalent bond.

00:07:06.523 --> 00:07:08.565
That would be represented
as covalent bond.

00:07:08.565 --> 00:07:10.653
That would be represented
as a covalent bond.

00:07:10.653 --> 00:07:13.012
Each of these bonds or
the sharing of essentially

00:07:13.012 --> 00:07:18.680
two electrons, the two electrons.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.243
Carbon can feel like
it has two, four, six,

00:07:21.243 --> 00:07:23.225
eight electrons even it's sharing.

00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:24.593
Each of the hydrogens can feel

00:07:24.593 --> 00:07:27.606
like they have two electrons which gets it

00:07:27.606 --> 00:07:29.983
into a more stable state.

00:07:29.983 --> 00:07:35.171
In any of the elements, in carbon's group,

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:40.112
they are all going to have
four Valence electrons.

00:07:40.112 --> 00:07:44.803
For example tin, even though neutral tin

00:07:44.803 --> 00:07:49.227
is going to have 50 electrons,
the Valence electrons,

00:07:49.227 --> 00:07:50.649
the ones that are going to react

00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:53.908
are going to be the one, two, three, four

00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:55.140
in its outer shell.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.288
One, two, three, four
and so you might predict

00:07:58.288 --> 00:08:00.788
well maybe it could form
bonds not too different

00:08:00.788 --> 00:08:03.626
or it might react in a
similar way in some ways

00:08:03.626 --> 00:08:07.285
to say something like
carbon and/or maybe silicon

00:08:07.285 --> 00:08:09.564
could react something
similar to say carbon.

00:08:09.564 --> 00:08:11.659
People even think, there
could be life forms

00:08:11.659 --> 00:08:13.441
in other planets that
aren't based on carbon

00:08:13.441 --> 00:08:15.313
but actually are based on silicon

00:08:15.313 --> 00:08:18.300
because silicon would
have similar types of bond

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.435
that it can form similar
types of structures

00:08:20.435 --> 00:08:23.133
to carbon for this exact reason.

00:08:23.133 --> 00:08:25.823
Now what about, I kind of said

00:08:25.823 --> 00:08:27.264
that you have your transition metals,

00:08:27.264 --> 00:08:28.865
you d-block right over here

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:30.530
and actually your f-blocks

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.265
are going to be thrown in here as well

00:08:33.265 --> 00:08:34.642
and these are special cases.

00:08:34.642 --> 00:08:38.205
These get a little bit more involved

00:08:38.205 --> 00:08:39.643
because as we already learned

00:08:39.643 --> 00:08:41.678
that once you're in the fourth period,

00:08:41.678 --> 00:08:50.026
Let's say we want to do
the electron configuration.

00:08:50.026 --> 00:08:52.158
of say iron.

00:08:52.158 --> 00:08:57.108
Iron's electron configuration,

00:08:57.108 --> 00:09:03.554
we could start with argon as a base

00:09:03.554 --> 00:09:10.174
and then we're going to go four S two

00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:13.277
and then we're now in the d-block

00:09:13.277 --> 00:09:19.349
but we're not going to
fill the four D suborbital.

00:09:19.349 --> 00:09:21.472
We're not going to back up and back fill

00:09:21.472 --> 00:09:23.379
into the three d-suborbital.

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:25.705
It's one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:28.851
It's three D six.

00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:31.541
This is where this gets a
little bit more vigorous.

00:09:31.541 --> 00:09:32.934
What are the highest energy electrons?

00:09:32.934 --> 00:09:35.924
Well those are these D
electrons right over here.

00:09:35.924 --> 00:09:37.085
What are the furthest out?

00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:38.813
Well they're the ones
in the fourth sub shell,

00:09:38.813 --> 00:09:40.135
these four S two.

00:09:40.135 --> 00:09:42.942
That's why iron's
reactivity is a little bit

00:09:42.942 --> 00:09:44.552
at least based on just this

00:09:44.552 --> 00:09:46.490
superficial electron configuration.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:47.829
It's a little bit harder to predict.

00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:50.313
Iron is known to lose one electron,

00:09:50.313 --> 00:09:51.832
known to lose two electrons,

00:09:51.832 --> 00:09:53.533
known to lose three electrons

00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:55.874
and so those could be some combination

00:09:55.874 --> 00:09:58.626
of these highest energy electrons,

00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:00.039
both the ones that are furthest out

00:10:00.039 --> 00:10:03.084
and the ones that are highest energy.

00:10:03.084 --> 00:10:06.479
Iron becomes all the transition elements,

00:10:06.479 --> 00:10:08.855
figuring out the Valence electrons,

00:10:08.855 --> 00:10:10.674
the electrons that are most slightly right

00:10:10.674 --> 00:10:12.276
becomes a little bit hard to predict.

00:10:12.276 --> 00:10:14.686
Some people, some even textbooks will say,

00:10:14.686 --> 00:10:16.307
"Oh, all the transition metals"

00:10:16.307 --> 00:10:18.365
"have two Valence electrons"

00:10:18.365 --> 00:10:20.596
"because they all get the four S two"

00:10:20.596 --> 00:10:21.902
"and then they're back filling.”

00:10:21.902 --> 00:10:23.080
They would say, "Okay,"

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.716
"these are the two Valence electrons"

00:10:24.716 --> 00:10:26.519
"for all of these transition metals."

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:28.183
Well that doesn't hold up for all of them

00:10:28.183 --> 00:10:30.182
because you even have
special cases like copper

00:10:30.182 --> 00:10:32.208
and chromium that only go four S one

00:10:32.208 --> 00:10:33.513
and then start filling three D

00:10:33.513 --> 00:10:34.705
depending on the circumstances.

00:10:34.705 --> 00:10:36.122
Sometimes it does it otherwise

00:10:36.122 --> 00:10:39.098
but even for the other transition elements

00:10:39.098 --> 00:10:41.537
like say iron is not necessarily the case

00:10:41.537 --> 00:10:44.169
so these are the one,
the only two electrons

00:10:44.169 --> 00:10:45.113
that are going to react.

00:10:45.113 --> 00:10:48.067
You might have some of your D electrons,

00:10:48.067 --> 00:10:50.011
your three D electrons
which are high energy

00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:51.962
might also be involved in reaction.

00:10:51.962 --> 00:10:54.922
Might be taken away or
might form a bond somehow.
