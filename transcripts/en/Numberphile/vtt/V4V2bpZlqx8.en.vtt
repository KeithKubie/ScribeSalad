00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.340
DR. JAMES GRIME: So in our first
Enigma video, we left

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.640
you on a bit of a cliffhanger.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.910
I was just about to
show you the flaw

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.440
in the Enigma machine.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.940
Now, that video was only meant
to be a short follow-up video.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.230
But when we saw the reaction to
our first Enigma video, we

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.880
decided to come in and film
again to show you how that

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.340
flaw worked and how they
broke the Enigma code.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.930
Now, if you want to see the
original Enigma video--

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.020
it shows you how the Enigma
machine worked--

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:28.830
go check that out.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.170
We'll put the links in
the description.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.610
But now let's have a
look at that flaw.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.260
So here's the Enigma
machine again.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.582
Now, if I press the letter K--

00:00:41.582 --> 00:00:44.680
there we go-- the letter
Q lights up this time.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.420
Now, if I keep pressing the
letter K, a different letter

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.160
lights up each time.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.750
So a double-letter
would not be a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.470
double-letter in the code.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.770
So it's a very good
code indeed.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.400
But it is never K itself.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.500
So this was the flaw.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.690
A letter never becomes itself.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.450
So A is not A, B is
not B, and so on.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.620
Z is not Z. This is a clue.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.370
So the way you break the Enigma
code is, if you imagine

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.060
you have an Enigma message, you
try and guess a word or a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.810
phrase that might appear
in that message.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.060
Now, every morning, 6 o'clock
in the morning, the Germans

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.890
would send a weather report.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.280
Now, that was a standard form.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.030
That was always the same
every day, apart

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.270
from the actual weather.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.970
It was always a standard
format.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.450
So we can pick a word that's
going to be in

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.480
that weather report.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.250
We might pick the word or phrase
"weather report," or

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.250
"Wetterbericht" in German.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.960
And I apologize now if I've
translated that badly.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.200
[SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.940
Now, I'm going to write
"Wetterbericht"

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.040
on a piece of paper.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.040
BRADY HARAN: That's
"weather report."

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.590
DR. JAMES GRIME:
That's "weather

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.020
report" there in German.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.690
Here, I've got an Enigma code.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.310
And I'm going to slide my guess
underneath the code.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.990
Now, I'm going to try
and find where this

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.090
phrase fits in the message.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.310
Now, I know a letter can't
become itself.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.550
So it can't fit here, because
I have a T becoming T. So

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.220
that's not where it fits.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.940
Let's try this.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.420
Can it fit here?

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.520
No.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.090
I've got this T matching
with T again.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.380
Let's try here.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.890
No, I've got no matching,
no matching.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.115
From what I can see, no matching
letters there.

00:02:27.115 --> 00:02:28.410
So it might fit there.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.600
If I tried that--

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.390
see, those R's match up,
so it can't fit there.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.310
So maybe it's here.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.660
Maybe this is the phrase
"weather report." Now, from

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.730
this point, we can start
breaking the Enigma code.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.820
So you could use different
phrases.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.230
Try and imagine what a German
officer would send

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.350
in World War II.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.330
So for example, messages would
end with "Heil Hitler." So is

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330
it "Heil Hitler" at the
end of the message?

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.730
Now, if it is, we shouldn't have
any letters matching with

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.630
"Heil Hitler"--

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.860
H's, E's, I's, L's.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.650
What the British code breaker
Alan Turing had to do was find

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.830
a way to use this flaw to
break Enigma messages.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.080
So he built a huge machine
called the Bombe machine.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.420
It was designed by Alan Turing
and another code breaker

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.120
called Gordon Welchman.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.920
It was a big machine,
noisy thing.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.730
It would rattle around.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.380
And this could help you break
the code in under 20 minutes.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.110
So you would have to break
the code every morning.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.390
So every morning, the settings
for the Enigma

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.930
machine would change.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.500
So all the Enigma
machines would

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.090
change stroke of midnight.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.900
So that's why a machine that
could break the code that

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.840
quickly was so important.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.910
So the Bombe machine tried to
work out the plug board at the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.210
front of the Enigma machine.

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.360
If we go back, at the front of
the Enigma machine, we have

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.730
this thing called the plug board
that connects letters

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.580
into pairs.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.220
You actually make 10
pairs of letters.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.790
When I press a letter, the
signal first goes through the

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.950
plug board.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.890
It then goes through the first
rotor, through the second

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.890
rotor, through the
third rotor.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.970
It then loops back, and it goes
through the machine again

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.970
in reverse order.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.070
So then it goes through the
third rotor, the second rotor,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.320
the first rotor.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.340
And finally, it goes through the
plug board one more time,

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.790
and it lights up one
of these bulbs.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.160
Now, I'm going to try and
draw it up for you.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.519
But I'm going to make it
as simple as I can.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:20.754
Let's try and do that.

00:04:20.754 --> 00:04:22.860
So first of all, it goes
through the plug board.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.760
Then it goes through
all the rotors.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.560
And I'm going to call that just
one big magic box called

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.260
R for rotors.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.950
And the last thing it
does is it goes

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.910
through the plug board.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.110
If we look at our weather report
here, let's look in the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.370
second place.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.820
T becomes E. Let me do that.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.010
If I press T, it goes through
the plug board, through all

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.050
the rotors, through the plug
board again, and out comes E.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.230
Now, we're going to use this
to work out the plug board.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.990
I'm going to make one guess.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.100
I'm going to guess
T is connected to

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.390
A on the plug board.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.350
That's a guess, but I'm
going to use it.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.230
So let's say that means that T
goes through the plug board,

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.250
and out comes A.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.290
Now, A goes through
the rotors.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.510
Now, we know how the rotors
are wired up.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.280
So we know that.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.120
We pick a position and find out
what happens to A. That's

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.300
not hard to do.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.610
And I don't know-- let's
make something up.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.760
Let's say it comes out as P. But
if I do that, I can deduce

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.430
that P goes through the plug
board and becomes E, which

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.260
means I can deduce that
P is connected to

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.580
E on the plug board.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.770
Now, that's pretty cool.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.280
So you've worked out one of
the plug board settings.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.390
If that diagram works, P
must be connected to E.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.530
So I've done this a few more
times doing the same method,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.200
using my weather report crib.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.870
And I've discovered a few more
plug board settings.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.395
So the first one we discovered
was P-E. Now I've discovered K

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.720
and Q are connected
on the plug board.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.280
I've discovered X and B are
connected on the plug board.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.210
And I've discovered T and G are

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.680
connected on the plug board.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.870
But this last one
is a problem.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.200
I've discovered that
T and G are

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.750
connected on the plug board.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.360
But I guessed that T and A were

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.780
connected on the plug board.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.690
And it can't be both.

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.550
This is called a
contradiction.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.170
It can't be both T-A and
T-G at the same time.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:23.140
This means my guess,
the T-A, was wrong.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:24.450
Throw it away.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.670
I got it wrong.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.150
Now I'm going to check the
next one-- what, T-B?

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.200
I might check T-C, T-D. I have
to do all 26 options--

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.620
T-A, T-B, T-D, T-Z. If all the
26 options are wrong, that

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.780
means your rotor position
is wrong.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.576
And what do is you go, click.

00:06:43.576 --> 00:06:46.010
You check the next rotor
position, and you go through

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.970
all that again.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.300
Now, that would take
a very long time.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.710
So Alan Turing came up
with two ways to

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.350
make this a bit quicker.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:55.665
The first one--

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.640
a really clever idea.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.310
He noticed that once you've
found one mistake, like T-A

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.450
and T-G, this means that all
these other deductions are

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.750
also wrong, and they don't
need to be checked.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.120
So they're all fruit
of a poisoned tree.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.410
They can all be rejected
at the same time.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.620
And you don't need to
check them again.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:18.750
So that really speeds it up.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.810
The other way to speed it
up is you can do this

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.940
instantaneously with electrical
circuits.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.680
So that's what the Bombe
machine did.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.460
It applied an electrical current
to my assumption, T-A.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.325
The electrical current flows
through the machine.

00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:37.750
It flows through T-G,
which means wrong.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.590
But it'll also flow through all
these other deductions,

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.390
which means I can find all my
deductions, which are all

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.410
wrong, and I can do it
instantaneously with

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.900
electrical circuits.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.420
And then it will go, click,
and check the next.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.330
And it could go through all the
rotor positions in about

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.690
20 minutes.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.930
So the main thing to remember is
the Bombe machine is built

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.220
a little bit backwards.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.710
It's a process of elimination.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.690
So what you're left with
is what wasn't wrong.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:07.170
And you would actually
check that by hand

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.220
and see if it works.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.590
The Bombe machine was named
in honor of a Polish code

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:15.000
breaking machine,
called Bomba.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.310
Bomba was a completely different
machine, worked on a

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.070
completely different
principle.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.400
It wasn't a huge machine.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.570
You could sit it on your
desk if you wanted to.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.210
And it exploited a flaw in
the German procedures.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.720
Now, they could use Bomba, the
Polish could use Bomba, to

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.370
break army and air force
Enigma codes.

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.070
But they couldn't break
naval Enigma codes.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.520
So what Alan Turing had to do
was find a way to break army,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.260
air force, and navy
Enigma codes.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.310
And it had to be a bit more
robust so that if the Germans

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.810
choose to change their
procedures, that this method

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:48.980
would still work.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.290
What the navy was doing
differently is the rotor

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.690
starting positions were actually
sent at the beginning

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.210
of each message, but they were
sent in another code entirely.

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.220
So it was a completely different
code just to send

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.300
the rotor starting positions.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.430
So you needed to work out how
that worked, as well, before

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.290
you could even start breaking
the naval code.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.540
BRADY HARAN: Is there anything
that the makers of the Enigma

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.770
machine could have done to have
avoided this problem?

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.820
Was there some simple thing that
the Enigma makers could

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.955
have put into that device there,
and it would have not

00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:26.450
been broken like this?

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.390
DR. JAMES GRIME: Well, hindsight
is a fabulous thing.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.340
You wanted to make it so that a
letter could become itself.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.520
That was the flaw.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.110
And so the British saw Enigma.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:38.270
They said, that's a good idea.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:38.900
We'll have that.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.260
They nicked the idea.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.790
We saw Enigma, and we decided
to make one of our own.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.110
We called it the Typex
machine, except we

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.430
took out the flaw.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.690
So a letter could sometimes
become itself.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.050
This made it a more
secure machine.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.350
Now, from what I've heard,
the Germans tried

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.230
to break our code.

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.100
But they concluded that it was
better than the Enigma

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.430
machine, so they
gave up trying.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:04.570
At least that's what
I've heard.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.050
It's very difficult
to know for sure.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.790
It was all very secret.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.500
BRADY HARAN: So if you've
watched our original video

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.710
about how the code machine works
and this one, and you

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.200
still want more, I've got a
third video with all the extra

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.290
material and off-cuts, which
isn't listed, but you can find

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.950
the links here on the
screen and in the

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.460
video description below.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.030
The bits of brown paper used
in these videos can also be

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.560
found on our eBay site for
people who like to get their

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.570
hands on them.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:31.510
And if you've watched all the
Enigma videos and all the

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.890
Numberphile videos and you
still want more, can I

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:37.340
recommend my chemistry channel,
Periodicvideos?

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.370
Because recently, we got our
hands on a super high-speed

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.480
camera and filmed a bunch of
reactions so we can show them

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.220
in ultra slow motion.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:46.980
The videos are really
cool, and there's

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:48.620
loads more to come.

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.200
Go and have a look if it sounds
like something you

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.200
might like.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.750
All the links are below in the
video description and here on

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:54.560
the screen.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.930
And as usual, thanks so
much for watching.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.180
Talk to you again soon.
