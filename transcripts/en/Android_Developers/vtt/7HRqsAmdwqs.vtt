00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.230
&gt;&gt;Sparky: And welcome once again to the weekly
Android developer office hours.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.280
This is your EMEA edition coming to you in
the middle of the afternoon again.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.740
Lovely sunny or almost sunny London UK.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.080
Where I am visiting from Munich and I'm joined
by my local cohorts.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.350
Rich, Nick, and Matt.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.720
And also joined by Roman from New York, New
York.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.810
We are here to take on any and all questions
related to Android development.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.090
So let's see what's going on.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.860
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, as usual we won't be making
any announcements on Roadmaps, future product

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.930
releases and things like that.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.500
So please don't ask 'cause we'll just say
"No."

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.510
If you want to join the hangout live, come
in and ask questions, then please just comment

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.640
on the thread on the plus Android developers
Google plus page.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.579
And I'll add you in and you can come with
us live.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.230
If not, as the questions on the Moderator
or on the thread.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.730
We will answer them live on here.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.560
So, we might as well get started.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.520
We do actually have one person live in the
hangout already.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.520
Yosi

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.520
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Oh.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.520
Hi.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.270
&gt;&gt;Rich: Did you actually have a question,
Yosi?

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.300
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah, two questions.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:16.220
First of all, about the play services API,
and, all the jar and when it should come out

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.810
and we can use it, live.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.060
If you can have an answer for that.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.180
And secondly about fragments.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.240
It can wait until you answer the first one.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.340
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well the answer to the play services
API.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.729
Question's pretty quick.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.690
'cause that's a future roadmap question.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.330
We don't have an answer for you right now.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.740
We can't comment on that.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.229
So if you just move on to the fragments, we'll
hopefully help you with that one.

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.049
&gt;&gt;Yosi: OK, I'm trying to do a fragment, dialup
fragment.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:51.260
That should be in a popup above or two pane
fragments.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:02:03.810
And I want the view to stop, to wait and to,
so the user can select the account he needed.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.670
You know I wanted to do something like that.

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.569
Select the Google account.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.920
But if I'll do the down fragment it continues
to the next fragment and won't wait.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:25.140
Is there any option to hold the UI until the
user waits for the selection?

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.260
What's the best option to do it?

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.470
&gt;&gt;Roman: Can you rephrase the part of the
question where you're saying it goes on so

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.470
that it—

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.830
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Actually I'm trying to use Account
Manager to get all the Google accounts.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.830
And show popup screens for the user to choose
which Google account I can use to do auth

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.020
with the API.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.930
And [pause] oh, OK.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.849
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sorry about that.

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.650
We just dropped out for a second there.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.650
[laughter]

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.490
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Should I repeat the question again?

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.810
&gt;&gt;Rich: yeah if you don't mind.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:01.840
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah, OK.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.840
From the start.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.160
I'm using account manager to do auth for my
application to get all the contacts from the

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.220
Google besides the synced ones.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.140
So the user won't get a popup in the download
fragment saying which Google account he wants

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.150
to use.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.209
Or maybe add a new one.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:29.489
And then the next fragment should be where
I'm scraping out the entire address book or

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.489
contacts.

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.220
But the problem is, when I'm popping out the
first fragment, I'm getting some intensely

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.320
moving forward to the next fragment.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.650
And I want to know what should I do.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.110
[video cuts out]

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.880
&gt;&gt;Roman: the UI thread, right?

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.850
I mean the dialog fragment also like the interaction
with the dialog fragment also happens on the

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:58.850
UI thread.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.470
And you know, before fragments, what you could
do is probably have it as a separate activity

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.310
that would have a dialog scene.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.310
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.830
&gt;&gt;Roman: But the activity underneath it would
be in the "start it but pause" state.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.670
So, just, and I don't wanna answer the question
straight on here.

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.349
But I think it may depend on a couple of things.

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:23.520
But what I would do, instead of using a dialog
all together, have a kind of a first step.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.999
So it would be a full screen activity or a
full screen fragment in that activity that

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:29.190
will let you select that account.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.969
Once you select that account, it either goes
on to the next activity or just pops the account

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:38.330
selection fragment from the core layout.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.689
And shows the next fragment.

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.810
So basically, my short answer, so this will
be, don't use a dialog fragment.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.229
Just use an inline account selection fragment.

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.749
Any of you guys have any other thoughts?

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:53.819
&gt;&gt;Nick: Works for me

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:54.819
[laughter]

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:55.819
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yes.

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:56.939
&gt;&gt;Yosi: [laughs] OK.

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:00.620
&gt;&gt;Roman: Is there a reason you aren't doing
that?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.719
Or is there just the basic—

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:08.029
&gt;&gt;Yosi: No, uh, what I'm trying to do is make
a more generic approach.

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:14.259
Because I want to make the user options to
be like, I can choose the Google account.

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:17.330
I can choose the Twitter account, I can choose
a Facebook account.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.171
And so on and so on.

00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:22.699
And I'm going to Account Manager getting all
the accounts by types.

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:30.539
And each time I'm popping out a selector for
all the appropriate accounts, and the user

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:35.749
can also add the new account according to
the type he chose.

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:42.009
But then, when I'm popping up the dialog,
sometimes it just doesn't wait 'til the user

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.659
selects.

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.689
And just goes, moves on to the next selector,
fragment.

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:54.569
What I did, was divided the dialog to two
options.

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:58.839
And then popped up the window with the dialog
fragment.

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:04.289
And just waited until the return from the
o-auth.

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:05.699
And then I moved on.

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:12.462
But, it's not so good 'cause sometimes you
need, you see the UI thread hangs for a bit.

00:06:12.462 --> 00:06:17.009
And that's why I wanted to know if you, if
there was any other options to do it.

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:21.270
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah, and I mean, just in case, I
don't know if I follow this entirely.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.339
But just in case you're kind of assuming that
there's blocking involved when you pop up

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:28.259
the fragment.

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:33.690
That's gonna block the function that triggered
the dialog fragment that called the show method.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:34.839
That doesn't actually block.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:42.370
So what I would do instead, assuming you have
to use the dialog fragment, and like I said

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.800
earlier you probably shouldn't use a dialog
in this case.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.219
But assuming you have to, you shouldn't have,
or sort of assume any blocking operations.

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:49.900
Just use a series of callbacks.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:56.689
So don't actually add the next fragment until
you get the callback that, the user—

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:58.389
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah, and that's what I did eventually.

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.929
But I wanted to know if there is a better
option than that.

00:07:01.929 --> 00:07:02.929
&gt;&gt;Roman: No, there's—

00:07:02.929 --> 00:07:08.460
&gt;&gt;Yosi: So the callback, sometimes when you
get the call back in, you see the dialog still

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:14.099
hangs about half a second until you get to
the new fragment and so on.

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:20.259
And so I wanted to be a bit more precise on
the UI and not be so much delayed.

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:27.229
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah, I mean if it's hanging, it
might be like you, you are blocking the UI

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:28.229
sort of with something.

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:29.929
Off the top of my head, I can't think of.

00:07:29.929 --> 00:07:32.599
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I'd probably instrument that
and try to find out what's going on during

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:34.800
that sort of user assist phase.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.800
Assist rates.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.740
Find out what's going on during that time.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:38.740
&gt;&gt;Yosi: OK.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.789
&gt;&gt;Roman: yeah, if it's in dialog fragment,
you may wanna file a bug.

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:46.209
If you know, you're not doing anything yourself
on the UI thread and the dialog is hanging

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:49.339
on the screen for half a second, it sounds
like it might be bug for the dialog.

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:51.629
&gt;&gt;Nick: You wanna make sure you move all the
logic.

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:53.349
Like on the click handle on the dialog.

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:55.029
So the first thing it does is hide it.

00:07:55.029 --> 00:08:00.439
And any business logic that happens after
the click, happens like in the callback.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:02.469
So that you know, there's nothing stopping
the—

00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:03.469
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:06.020
I'm doing a [assig] task on the callback.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:12.159
So the callback returns to the holder activity.

00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:16.419
And then triggers an event about half a second.

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:21.930
That's why I'm trying to see if that's the
real issue here.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:22.930
OK.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:23.930
That's nice.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:24.930
&gt;&gt;Rich: Alright.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:25.930
Thanks.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.930
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Thank you.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.930
&gt;&gt;Rich: Cheers.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:28.930
Thanks for coming in today.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:29.930
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Bye-bye.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.729
&gt;&gt;Rich: Alright then, during that conversation
we've also been joined by Alex Lucas.

00:08:33.729 --> 00:08:34.729
Some other guy.

00:08:34.729 --> 00:08:35.729
[laughter]

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:37.110
&gt;&gt; Zach Galfin, I guess.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.110
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.089
&gt;&gt;Rich: Any one of those names, he would answer
to.

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:45.300
So feel free to ask questions to him as well.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.400
When will that meet?

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.550
What are your special subjects, Alex?

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.650
&gt;&gt;Alex: I like Android.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:53.650
[laughter]

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:54.650
&gt;&gt;Rich: [inaudible]

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.470
&gt;&gt;Alex: Before Android, I was on the analytics
team.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:03.089
So I've covered a lot of stuff on implementing
analytics in Android.

00:09:03.089 --> 00:09:06.889
Also accessibility and just general frameworking
questions.

00:09:06.889 --> 00:09:09.720
&gt;&gt;Rick: So if you wanna ask questions about
Android, Android, Android, Android, Android

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.360
or Google TV

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.360
[laughter]

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.959
Please jump in.

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:16.819
Hey, Chrome pusher.

00:09:16.819 --> 00:09:17.819
Nice.

00:09:17.819 --> 00:09:18.819
Um, yeah.

00:09:18.819 --> 00:09:20.890
Feel free to jump in.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.860
we'll have a look quick on the thread.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.959
I wonder if people are on holiday.

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:26.110
We usually have quite a lot of question on
the thread by now.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.459
&gt;&gt;Sparky: It's a holiday today.

00:09:28.459 --> 00:09:29.640
&gt;&gt;Rich: In Germany?

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.050
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yes.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.050
In Bavaria.

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.050
&gt;&gt;Rich: In Bavaria they have a public holiday.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.050
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yes, yes.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.110
Today is Assumption day.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.639
Also known for assumptions

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:38.079
&gt;&gt;Rich: for assumptions?

00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:40.959
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Also known as Bavarian Himmelfahrt.

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:41.959
&gt;&gt;Rich: Ding.

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:42.959
[laughter]

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:47.410
OK, in which case let's have a look through
some of the Moderator questions.

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.149
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yes.

00:09:49.149 --> 00:09:54.000
&gt;&gt;Rich: The first Moderator question is asking
about something, a future product.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.120
Release slash announcement.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.230
&gt;&gt;Roman: When will we be able to add our own
location providers?

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:59.370
&gt;&gt;Rich: We can't.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:02.829
&gt;&gt;Roman: Well, I think, I believe, and I haven't
verified this myself.

00:10:02.829 --> 00:10:04.579
I haven't created a sample up to do it.

00:10:04.579 --> 00:10:12.000
But I believe that if you check the "allow
mock locations" check box, somewhere in your

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.079
system, you can actually install third party
providers.

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:18.260
Having said that, I don't know what the APIs
are to do so.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.260
&gt;&gt;Rich: Where is that?

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.260
On Developers?

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.260
[inaudible]

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.260
&gt;&gt;Roman: Somewhere in Developers.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.290
&gt;&gt;Rich: Somewhere in applications development.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:24.290
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:29.079
I mean the reason being like, you don't want
just any app to willy nilly add like a fake

00:10:29.079 --> 00:10:30.230
GPS provider.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.230
Right?

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:37.380
Because then you know, any apps that rely
on GPS or whatever for example, GeoFencing

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:43.000
or you know, making sure the content is restricted
by geography.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.209
If somebody is using that, then you'd basically
get fake results.

00:10:46.209 --> 00:10:51.350
So I believe that 's why it's hidden behind,
or disabled by default.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.470
And enableable for development purposes.

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:57.490
Having said that, I honestly don't know how
to create a provider.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:04.209
I know the emulator kind of has "fake provider"
because it needs to let you specify GPS coordinates

00:11:04.209 --> 00:11:05.209
manually.

00:11:05.209 --> 00:11:07.529
But yeah, there's gotta be an API somewhere.

00:11:07.529 --> 00:11:10.100
If not then, don't know.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:16.250
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Well you were definitely right on
about the developer options.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:17.250
'cause there it is.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:18.250
Developer options.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.079
&gt;&gt;Roman: We should probably double check if
there is an API.

00:11:20.079 --> 00:11:22.850
I mean, you can probably extend the location
provider.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.220
Having said that, I don't know how you would
register that.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.350
I don't know if an API for that exists.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:32.639
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Maybe I should dust off my old Bluetooth
GPS book.

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:34.120
[laughter]

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.079
&gt;&gt;Rich: Excellent.

00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:43.970
OK, the next question on the Moderator is
"How can I create an add-on dictionary.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:44.970
Bilingual.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.610
I find that anything I type in other languages
is automatically edited.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:49.870
This is very frustrating.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.910
Find the options in language input and your
keyboard add-on dictionaries."

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:59.380
Anybody know about add-on dictionaries.

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.380
&gt;&gt;Sparky: He's talking about add-on.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:05.519
I turned on a couple alternative languages
just for typing input.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:07.680
But, only the ones that came stock with the
system.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.680
&gt;&gt;Rich: Mm-hm.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.680
We're going to where he says—

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:10.680
&gt;&gt;Roman: Personal dictionaries?

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:16.830
&gt;&gt;Matt: Even and added one would you be able
to still type in a different language, keyboard,

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.350
and work out which one you're going for?

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.209
&gt;&gt;Sparky: You tell it which one you want to
switch too.

00:12:23.209 --> 00:12:25.029
So there's a little globe icon.

00:12:25.029 --> 00:12:26.029
Yeah.

00:12:26.029 --> 00:12:27.029
&gt;&gt;Matt: Message bar.

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:28.029
Yeah.

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:29.029
[pause]

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:30.029
&gt;&gt;Roman: Oh, add-on dictionaries, there it
is.

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:31.959
&gt;&gt;Rich: Right on page [unintelligible] under
"Text correction."

00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:35.449
&gt;&gt;Roman: Oh, this is, yeah, this may be a
new API.

00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:36.449
Yeah.

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:38.019
Either Ice Cream Sandwich or Jellybean.

00:12:38.019 --> 00:12:39.120
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh here.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.959
&gt;&gt;Roman: This may be new.

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:45.720
So I mean, one way you could do it is assuming
this is new, 'cause for example, the emoji,

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.670
that was never there before.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:48.670
Anyway.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.010
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, that's definitely Jellybean.

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.029
&gt;&gt;Roman: So if it's new we could probably
just take a look at the API disc.

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:54.029
Between Jellybean and Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:55.029
Just to see.

00:12:55.029 --> 00:12:57.439
I don't know if we should do it now?

00:12:57.439 --> 00:12:58.889
If you guys want?

00:12:58.889 --> 00:12:59.889
If you have time?

00:12:59.889 --> 00:13:00.889
You probably have time.

00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:04.230
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, let's all, let's take a look
at it in the background while we go on to

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.870
the next question.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:09.529
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah, let's go on.

00:13:09.529 --> 00:13:11.171
I'll take a look and--

00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:12.171
&gt;&gt;Rich: And then we can come back and continue.

00:13:12.171 --> 00:13:13.171
[pause]

00:13:13.171 --> 00:13:14.171
Are you keeping check on the air?

00:13:14.171 --> 00:13:15.171
&gt;&gt;Alex: Researching live on the air.

00:13:15.171 --> 00:13:16.171
[chuckles]

00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:17.171
[laughter]

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: We're just that kind of crowd.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.290
OK.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.300
"Have you considered" This is from Ken Dawood
in Teesside.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:29.620
"Have you considered making developers.Android.com
a community editable like wiki?"

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.620
I certainly haven't.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.620
Do you?

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.620
&gt;&gt;Sparky: I've thought about it.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.620
&gt;&gt;Rich: You've thought about it?

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.860
What'd you think?

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.860
[chuckles]

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.910
&gt;&gt;Sparky: It's hard.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:41.050
I mean, besides which, we already have something
like that.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:43.670
There's like stackoverflow and many other
sites like it.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.690
We have our forums as well.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:46.690
So.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:51.180
&gt;&gt;Rich: We do have a very hardworking, dedicated
team of tech writers.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.770
[pause]

00:13:52.770 --> 00:14:02.310
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Oh wow, check this out.

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:07.080
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sorry about.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.889
Just dropped out the Hangout just briefly
there for a second.

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:11.759
&gt;&gt;Sparky: How are things?

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:13.639
&gt;&gt;Matt: I don't know.

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:18.110
I think that actually it's, when you actually
have something that has a definitive right

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.149
and wrong, and you have somebody who is making
it definitively right or wrong, it kind of

00:14:22.149 --> 00:14:25.959
makes a lot of sense for them to be the ones
to document that.

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:26.959
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:30.810
I can understand why you want it as well.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.120
Because there are things in the documentation
that get out of date.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.819
And people file bugs and we update them and
things.

00:14:35.819 --> 00:14:38.329
But it would be good to have more manpower
behind it.

00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:41.029
As Matt says, yeah, it is nice to have the
definitive guide there.

00:14:41.029 --> 00:14:44.139
And we do have other sources.

00:14:44.139 --> 00:14:45.990
On the Google groups.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.990
Stackoverflow.

00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.990
Etcetera.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:52.870
&gt;&gt;Roman: It mentioned something about the
add-on dictionary.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:15:00.870
[video cuts out]

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:08.449
&gt;&gt;Roman: Provider of user-defined words for
input methods to use for predictive text input.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:11.850
Applications and info methods may add words
into the dictionary.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:16.819
So this seems like this will just add something
to your existing dictionary.

00:15:16.819 --> 00:15:21.060
So you can create an app that's basically,
just, if you have 20 words you wanna add,

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.100
yeah, you just kind of looking at an add-on
dictionary manager.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.230
Maybe even imports things from the cloud or
what not.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.269
&gt;&gt;Alex: You should probably write a sample
app-er in a U class for that.

00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:31.209
&gt;&gt;Roman: Mm. that sounds good.

00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:32.370
Pretty good idea.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.860
&gt;&gt;Sparky: We already have a dictionary sample.

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:35.860
&gt;&gt;Alex: Hm?

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.790
&gt;&gt;Sparky: we already have a dictionary sample.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.939
We could extend it.

00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:45.399
&gt;&gt;Roman: But there's probably something that's
specific to Jellybean.

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:47.529
And I haven't found it yet.

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:48.529
Oh well.

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:49.529
Wait, Android.

00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:50.529
Yeah.

00:15:50.529 --> 00:15:54.850
That's probably all we could say at this time
about it.

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.850
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.850
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:57.850
Oh.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:58.850
[pause]

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:04.350
Anyone wanna take a look at that one there?

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:11.279
&gt;&gt;Sparky: How is [goodee] at google.com bug
tracker for Android handled?

00:16:11.279 --> 00:16:14.689
Oh, it's is that the one we were looking [on]
or the end one?

00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:15.689
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah, this one.

00:16:15.689 --> 00:16:16.689
Yeah.

00:16:16.689 --> 00:16:17.689
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Right.

00:16:17.689 --> 00:16:18.689
There are tons of very very old issues that
are now,

00:16:18.689 --> 00:16:19.689
&gt;&gt;Alex: [Inaudible]

00:16:19.689 --> 00:16:22.209
&gt;&gt;Sparky: that are not now even assigned.

00:16:22.209 --> 00:16:24.689
Others are fixed but the ticket is still open.

00:16:24.689 --> 00:16:29.410
Yes, well curating multiple, I mean, curating
the bug trackers that we have internal to

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.959
the company is hard enough.

00:16:30.959 --> 00:16:37.209
Let alone curating ones that are external
facing as well, what with two or three or

00:16:37.209 --> 00:16:41.990
five or 700,000 users all wanting to contribute
their own bugs.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.560
&gt;&gt;Alex: The best way, if there's a bug on
the public bug tracker and you want us to

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.009
get a better look at it, is to link to it
and make sure that it gets uploaded in startalot.

00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:54.300
So that it will sort of float to the top of
the sidebars.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:59.371
We don't necessarily go by the age of the
bug so much as the importance of the bug.

00:16:59.371 --> 00:17:05.699
And the number of starts that the bug receives
is the main metric for that.

00:17:05.699 --> 00:17:09.470
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah, look for a question that already
touches on what you want, and upload that.

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:10.470
&gt;&gt;Alex: Right.

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:11.980
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Rather than forking a new one.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:19.069
I will say, also, that they, I believe that
that list actually does influence our development

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:20.069
course in some cases.

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:25.409
I suspect that a large part of the reason
why we made such leaps and bounds of improvement

00:17:25.409 --> 00:17:30.830
in bidirectional text input for Ice Cream
Sandwich and Jellybean was because of those

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:34.970
bugs that had sat up at the top of the queue
of collected thousands and thousands of forks.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:35.970
&gt;&gt;Alex: Right.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.790
And it was not thousands and thousands of
bugs saying the same thing.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:43.169
It was a couple of bugs with thousands and
thousands of bugs.

00:17:43.169 --> 00:17:44.169
&gt;&gt;Rich: Mm-hmm.

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:45.169
Yeah.

00:17:45.169 --> 00:17:49.840
So reconciling bugs we fix into maybe ones
that have been raised externally is also tricky.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.980
People try and do it.

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.750
But obviously the Android team are fixing
quite a lot of bugs for each release and they

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.270
can't go through the entire bug tracker seeing
if someone's raised that externally and then

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.270
closing it off.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:04.140
So there are definitely bugs in the tracker
that are fixed one ticket [unintelligible]

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:05.140
[pause]

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.140
OK.

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.880
Ask, oh, someone's asking whether they can
ask a question.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:11.880
Uh.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.130
Yeah, you can.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:14.130
[laughter]

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.130
Yeah.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:20.669
&gt;&gt;Rich: We'd love you to ask the question
on media APIs live and we'll see what we can

00:18:20.669 --> 00:18:21.669
do.

00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:23.320
&gt;&gt;Alex: Well, we're not really here to "answer
questions."

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.320
[laughter]

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.400
&gt;&gt;Rich: We are, I, I don't know—

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.039
&gt;&gt;Roman: We need a really dodge questions.

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:29.039
That's—

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:30.039
&gt;&gt;Alex: Mostly.

00:18:30.039 --> 00:18:31.039
&gt;&gt;Rich: We've got a new question just popped
in.

00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:35.730
"Hi, I need to create an app which will play
videos from YouTube and show external subtitles

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:36.730
for the played video.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.560
Can you please advise me on how to start or
if it's even possible?"

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.560
&gt;&gt;Roman: Well.

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:46.100
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, there's a talk in Google IO
which is about doing just this.

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.240
There's a new player library which allows
you to embed YouTube videos.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.360
And I think do subtitles as well, right?

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.110
&gt;&gt;Roman: The YouTube library.

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.010
So that was announced, but it's not yet available.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:58.010
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:59.010
It's not yet available.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.510
So keep an eye on developers.google.com.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.309
&gt;&gt;Alex: Is there a workaround for right now?

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:07.460
&gt;&gt;Roman: YouTube videos and captioning?

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:09.060
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Using the web view.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.220
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's embedded web view for most people.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.220
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.289
&gt;&gt;Nick: But it's not—

00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:19.230
&gt;&gt;Roman: Uh, that'll work, actually that'll
probably rely on flash, or is it going to

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.230
use HTML5.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.230
&gt;&gt;Yosi: HTML5.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:22.230
&gt;&gt;Roman: HTML5?

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.720
HTML5 in web view is Android 3.0 or higher.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:25.980
&gt;&gt;Nick: And it's not great.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:29.970
It's been actually, I'd say it wouldn't be
worth at this point going down the path of

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:30.970
writing that.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.970
Because there's later APIs coming out.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:34.850
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah, just hold tight.

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:39.270
In terms of captions though, I'm not sure
if it supports, I mean it supports—

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.721
&gt;&gt;Nick: We had it in IO, I don't know whether
that was--

00:19:42.721 --> 00:19:46.750
&gt;&gt;Sparky: There's a difference between turning
on captions in the viewport and like, getting

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:51.220
a feed of the captions like in display next
to it in your UI.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.220
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:56.159
Let's just table that question until that
library is released.

00:19:56.159 --> 00:19:59.779
It was announced [inaudible] development.

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:01.950
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hey there.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.440
See, we moved back to the Moderator.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.340
We've got Oiwani joined us, if that's how
you pronounce your name, hopefully.

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.340
&gt;&gt;Oiwani: Yeah.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.340
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hi there.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:17.179
Have you got a question for us today, or have
you just come in to say hello?

00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:18.690
&gt;&gt;Oiwani: Hi.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:23.250
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yes, yes, we hear you.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.010
So, are you doing Android development at the
moment?

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:28.360
Is there something—?

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.700
&gt;&gt;Oiwani: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.500
I'm doing Android development.

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.840
Yeah in Nigeria.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:33.840
&gt;&gt;Roman: Awesome.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.470
&gt;&gt;Oiwani: I'm developing on the Google page
a reality application using the Android platform.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:40.210
Using the camera location services.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:41.320
&gt;&gt;Rich: Awesome:

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.430
&gt;&gt;Roman: Great.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.200
Do you have any questions.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.770
Like technical questions or best practice
or something like that?

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:50.900
&gt;&gt;Oiwani: No, no, no, not at the moment.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.080
I just came to learn.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.080
To see what's up.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.080
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:55.080
&gt;&gt;Roman: OK.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:00.169
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well thanks for dropping in, just
stay there, and maybe if you do have questions,

00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:04.190
just shout them out.

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:06.340
Moderator is now complete I think.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.470
&gt;&gt;Roman: There should be one more somewhere
in there.

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:11.470
Probably.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.470
Yeah.

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:13.470
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh yeah.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:16.610
"Could you recommend a sample project to do
low level media API?"

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:19.450
Uh, the best thing at the moment would be
the YouTube videos again.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:24.940
The YouTube video from Google IO this year
on the low-level APIs has loads of samples

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:26.950
in it and sample code and how to do it.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:30.540
Also the top of the classes for media codec,
in the API doc.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.740
There's a bunch of sample code in there as
well.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.020
I'll try and post the link to that quickly.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.090
&gt;&gt;Roman: [humming]

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:44.049
&gt;&gt;Yosi: I have another question if you can
answer.

00:21:44.049 --> 00:21:45.230
&gt;&gt;Rich: Alright, go for it.

00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:46.970
&gt;&gt;Roman: Let's hear it.

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:49.149
&gt;&gt;Yosi: OK, making a widget.

00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:50.149
Home screen widget.

00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:51.149
&gt;&gt;Rich: Mm-hmm.

00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:59.169
&gt;&gt;Yosi: And the main issue is when sometimes
you do a pending intent if you want to do

00:21:59.169 --> 00:22:03.990
an on click on the view, so you go back to
the activity.

00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:09.330
But sometimes it happens that you click on
the widget.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:10.340
You go back to the application.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:15.289
And you go back and forth for some, like,
four or five clicks.

00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:21.780
And then when you click again on the widget,
on the home screen, you get an exception.

00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.970
That you cannot send pending intent.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.530
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hm.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:30.049
&gt;&gt;Nick: Did it tell you why?

00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:31.830
Does it give any more of its stat regs?

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:36.300
&gt;&gt;Yosi: That's the only, if you want I can
try and see just a second.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:37.300
It gave me—

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.279
&gt;&gt;Rich: Is this happening during development
or with the production version of the app.

00:22:41.279 --> 00:22:42.789
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Same thing.

00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:47.309
It doesn't influence if it's on production
or not.

00:22:47.309 --> 00:22:55.510
But the main issue is, here, it's I'm trying
to make a distinct unique intent each time

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.140
I click on the button so it won't happen again.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:04.970
After the, when I go back and forth from the
context.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.480
But just a second.

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:12.160
I'm looking for the stat. [pause]

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.470
&gt;&gt;Roman: So are you creating a new task every
time?

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:18.700
&gt;&gt;Yosi: No, I'm not creating a new task.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.410
I'm creating a new intent.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:21.630
A new pending intent.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:27.460
&gt;&gt;Roman: Right, but is that creating a new--
so for example, let's say you touch the widget

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.460
and you—

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:35.090
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah, you must use the flag, "create
new tabs" each time you use a pending intent.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:39.019
Or is there another option?

00:23:39.019 --> 00:23:43.190
&gt;&gt;Rich: No, that's-- is that necessarily true?

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:44.190
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible]

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.620
&gt;&gt;Rich: Do you have to create a new task every
time you create new tabs?

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.110
&gt;&gt;Roman: It doesn't seem like that's a mandatory
flag.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.980
&gt;&gt;Rich: No.

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:55.680
I think, having intents, that's the concept
of them.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.820
I mean you can pass them around and other
people can watch.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.820
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:04.559
Um, I mean, just, as an example, like in our
design guidelines we have this updated section

00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:05.559
of navigation.

00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:08.640
And it talks about-- and this is not Android
developers.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:12.740
This is around the interaction and the design
guidelines.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:17.690
There's a section that covers how to navigate
into your app deeply into your app from a

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.320
widget or a notation.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.130
And the implication there is that when you
jump into your app from a widget, you shouldn't

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:26.720
be creating a new task every time.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:31.809
You shouldn't, in your recent, when you touch
on recents, you shouldn't see four or five

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:33.679
different instances of your app.

00:24:33.679 --> 00:24:35.090
&gt;&gt;Yosi: No, you won't see.

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.330
You'll see only one.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.510
You'll see only one instance on recents.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.510
&gt;&gt;Roman: OK.

00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:45.740
&gt;&gt;Yosi: But each time you create a pending
intent, because you're not going from a context

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:54.570
of a specific activity, you must declare the
flag new task or clear task and so on.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:25:02.419
And after a few back and forth clicks from
going to inside the app, going back to home,

00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:05.230
you know, exiting the app.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:11.610
You know, finish all the Google, all the application
resources, and then going back to the widget

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:15.960
and clicking again, after a few times it just
gives me the exception.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.970
I'm trying to find the stack.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.279
I saved it on a text file.

00:25:20.279 --> 00:25:23.860
And just wanted to see--

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.299
&gt;&gt;Rich: [unintelligible]

00:25:25.299 --> 00:25:26.730
&gt;&gt;Yosi: OK.

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:31.330
Give me a few minutes and when time—

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.590
&gt;&gt;Roman: We can get back to that.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.690
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hey, Atar.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:43.539
Good to see you made it along this week.

00:25:43.539 --> 00:25:44.639
Atar?

00:25:44.639 --> 00:25:45.740
Frozen.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:50.139
Can you hear me?

00:25:50.139 --> 00:25:52.340
&gt;&gt;Atar: Hey.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:53.440
Hey.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.539
Hello.

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:57.769
&gt;&gt;Rich: You have a question on the Moderator?

00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:58.769
&gt;&gt;Atar: [unintelligible]

00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:00.539
&gt;&gt;Rich: You have a new question.

00:26:00.539 --> 00:26:01.580
[unintelligible, feedback echoing]

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.360
Atar, we've got some feedback coming through
on your speakers.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:10.010
&gt;&gt;Atar: Oh, I was thinking we'd just lower
that.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.010
It [inaudible]

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.019
&gt;&gt;Rich: [inaudible] Yeah.

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:14.019
[inaudible]

00:26:14.019 --> 00:26:15.019
[pause]

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:19.799
Um, was it, uh, should read that.

00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:26.390
&gt;&gt;Roman: "Was it intentional that shortcuts
aren't part of the new Jellybean widget design

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:27.390
guidelines?

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:33.409
Since they live in the widget drawer in four
point oh plus, are you phasing them out, discouraging

00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:34.419
their use?"

00:26:34.419 --> 00:26:35.419
No.

00:26:35.419 --> 00:26:37.820
It was intentional that they were left out?

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:38.929
They're not widgets.

00:26:38.929 --> 00:26:40.039
They're short cuts.

00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:45.039
In terms of what the user sees, we happened
to place them in the same area.

00:26:45.039 --> 00:26:49.389
Because to a user they may not make a difference.

00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:51.500
But in terms of your design.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:57.389
I mean, shortcut design is, we probably should
have another guideline for like, what should

00:26:57.389 --> 00:26:59.210
be in the app drawer.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:01.240
Which go on the home screen.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.409
But it doesn't really belong in the widget
design guidelines.

00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:05.789
It'll probably be a separate guideline.

00:27:05.789 --> 00:27:08.700
So we don't treat them the same.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.460
Although users may kind of understand them.

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:13.250
They may have the same mental model for them.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.149
But yeah.

00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:19.690
So, it's not intentional that they're not
in the design guidelines altogether.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:24.790
But that's just a matter of priorities whether
or not we'll be able to add things like shortcuts.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.790
So.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:26.860
&gt;&gt;Nick: So I wouldn't read too much into it?

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:27.860
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.559
&gt;&gt;Nick: I mean, they're still pretty core.

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:31.880
I mean trying to put up shortcuts you know,
contact and so on.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:36.350
That's still a pretty core ability.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:40.080
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah, they're' incredibly useful.

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.080
[pause]

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:46.419
&gt;&gt;Nick: So if we ran out of questions, we
could always talk about last night updates

00:27:46.419 --> 00:27:48.080
to the design guide chips.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.409
So has anyone seen that thing?

00:27:49.409 --> 00:27:50.980
&gt;&gt;Roman: You should talk about it.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:51.980
&gt;&gt;Rich: Mm-hmm.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:52.980
&gt;&gt;Roman: Tell us.

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:53.980
&gt;&gt;Rich: I haven't seen it.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:54.980
&gt;&gt;Roman: Tell us.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.980
&gt;&gt;Alex: [inaudible]

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.980
&gt;&gt;Roman: Tell us, tell us.

00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.980
Go.

00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:00.890
&gt;&gt;Nick: Uh, well the thing I thought was really
interesting is if you have the action bar

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.159
pattern and the design guide.

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:06.690
There's a little bit of talk about their sliding
drawer navigation pattern which is gaining

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:11.120
some traction as used in the Google plus app.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.120
Or the YouTube app.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:13.370
And many apps like that.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.690
Like Facebook and Spotify.

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.059
So it's nice to see that starting to get formalized
into a pattern for this.

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:19.059
It's a start.

00:28:19.059 --> 00:28:20.059
Let's call it that.

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:26.350
&gt;&gt;Roman: Now the kind of the reference and
implementation that you should look at, not

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.350
the implementation, sorry.

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.860
The reference app you should look at is the
YouTube app.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.409
I believe that that's the screenshot that
we show in the design guideline.

00:28:34.409 --> 00:28:37.500
The Google plus app, there's things a little
differently.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.360
So I recommend looking at YouTube.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.950
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible] widgets, confirming
and acknowledging help and accessibility.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:45.950
So.

00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.150
&gt;&gt;Roman: And help includes tutorials.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:51.630
So like, when to show a tutorial, when not
to show a tutorial.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.269
Hint, you shouldn't really have to show a
tutorial.

00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:56.269
Yeah.

00:28:56.269 --> 00:29:01.580
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, it's generally better I think,
the goal is UI is so intuitive that you don't

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:04.169
need to have labels and tutorials and so on.

00:29:04.169 --> 00:29:08.789
But you know it's almost better to have a
one-time tutorial, like, for say people, with

00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:11.600
you've got a lot of complex behavior.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:17.240
Rather than a lot of the labels in your UI
the whole time.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.049
&gt;&gt;Rich: Any other changes you saw in that?

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:21.049
In the design guideline?

00:29:21.049 --> 00:29:22.440
&gt;&gt;Nick: I've not had a chance to look at it.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.440
[laughter]

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.440
&gt;&gt;Rich: You've been busy today.

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.620
You can check 'em out tonight.

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.809
&gt;&gt;Roman: There are a couple updates overall.

00:29:26.809 --> 00:29:32.179
I mean, it's also we added for example, a
lot of the graphics there.

00:29:32.179 --> 00:29:33.299
Have like the Xoom.

00:29:33.299 --> 00:29:35.250
The Galaxy Nexus.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.520
We added the Nexus 7 in there for good measure.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.520
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.570
&gt;&gt;Nick: Into what?

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.610
The device generator or what?

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.840
&gt;&gt;Roman: Uh, no.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:44.070
Not the generator.

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:45.070
That's been there.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.340
But, some of the just basic hi-level graphics.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:51.389
So, if you're showing the page to say, product
managers, they may be like "Oh, what's that?

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:52.460
Is that a seven inch tablet?"

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:57.290
And you can be like "Yeah, we should plan
for seven inch tablets."

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.650
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible]
[pause]

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.201
&gt;&gt;Roman: What else we got?

00:30:02.201 --> 00:30:03.201
&gt;&gt;Rich: We've got a new visitor in the hangout.

00:30:03.201 --> 00:30:04.201
Hey Joe.

00:30:04.201 --> 00:30:05.201
Thanks for coming in.

00:30:05.201 --> 00:30:06.201
Oh, you're a bit quiet.

00:30:06.201 --> 00:30:07.380
I'm not sure if your microphone's muted.

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.380
[pause]

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.679
&gt;&gt;Roman: Can't hear you.

00:30:10.679 --> 00:30:12.650
&gt;&gt;Rich: He's typing.

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.290
"My audio isn't working."

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:18.580
You can't hear us either?

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:19.580
No.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.580
OK.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.070
Well you can type the question in the—

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.070
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible]

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:25.809
&gt;&gt;Rich: You can type the question in the chat
window if you have one.

00:30:25.809 --> 00:30:29.279
And we can answer it.

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:33.440
And read it out for you.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.440
[pause]

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:38.039
&gt;&gt;Roman: In the mean time, is that another
question in the moderator?

00:30:38.039 --> 00:30:39.039
Yes.

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:40.770
&gt;&gt;Rich: Mm-hmm.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:44.410
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Have we considered?

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:48.960
Yes, we have considered it.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.640
It's been discussed over and over again.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:51.640
&gt;&gt;Nick: Can you read the question?

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:52.640
&gt;&gt;Sparky: OK.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:57.320
Have we considered implementing a system which
would allow the user to select if they wish

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:01.130
to allow an individual app to write secure
settings, e.g.: enable GPS?

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:06.070
To enable it's developers to make an app with
better UX.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:10.120
Yes, it's been discussed at length many many
times.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:14.879
The problem is just that there is always a
tradeoff between flexibility and tractability.

00:31:14.879 --> 00:31:19.669
You know, you give too many affordances and
all of a sudden you have chaos.

00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:23.090
Basically can't control the experience in
any way.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:26.169
So we, I mean, you can correct me if I'm wrong.

00:31:26.169 --> 00:31:30.899
But I believe that a lot of these design choices
in the system were an attempt to find the

00:31:30.899 --> 00:31:36.970
right balance between giving the user enough
control without overwhelming them with choices.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:42.350
And requiring the user to spend all their
time making nitpicky minute decisions about

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:45.379
the administration of their device.

00:31:45.379 --> 00:31:51.890
That's, for, a classic example is, that's
why you, when you install an app, you either

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.690
approve or disapprove all of the permissions
all at once.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:58.260
When you decide to install or uninstall the
app.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.370
And then you don't have to revisit that decision
again.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:03.360
&gt;&gt;Roman: yeah, and remember that, that's just
spot on.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.850
Remember that Android users aren't by default,
or aren't in general techies.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:13.370
So a lot of the features that you think are
"Oh my God, these are must have features.

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:14.539
How do you not have them?"

00:32:14.539 --> 00:32:21.409
A lot of those features would be just downright
confusing to the average end user.

00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:25.750
So you're absolutely right, there's always
a tradeoff between making something that kind

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:30.759
of intimidates and alienates users, and giving
them enough control.

00:32:30.759 --> 00:32:31.759
So.

00:32:31.759 --> 00:32:32.759
&gt;&gt;Nick: Alright.

00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:34.720
There's a question coming in on the G plus
thread.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.720
Reuben.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.720
Oh.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.720
&gt;&gt;Roman: Should we read Joe's.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.840
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh, no he's not—

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.210
&gt;&gt;Nick: He's not connected.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:41.240
&gt;&gt;Roman: Oh, sorry.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.820
&gt;&gt;Rich: Can we have a better guide to contacting
him?

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.840
&gt;&gt;Matt: I see.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.860
So you're talking about the

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.440
&gt;&gt;Sparky: sync provider.

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.440
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:55.679
Where essentially you pump in all the information
and the Android system will aggregate them

00:32:55.679 --> 00:33:01.970
into the contacts that you have as well as
any kind of social media contacts that you've

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:02.970
got.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:03.970
All those things.

00:33:03.970 --> 00:33:04.970
Is that right?

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:05.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:09.029
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, there's a great series of blog
posts out there which I often refer to myself.

00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:12.039
If you search for um, yeah, see nice.

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:13.039
Sam Steele.

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:15.100
The developer for Google Plus [unintelligible].

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:20.159
He did a serious of blog posts which are excellent.

00:33:20.159 --> 00:33:23.289
Is there something that series of blog posts
isn't covering?

00:33:23.289 --> 00:33:28.019
Or would just like to see that level of detail
in the official docs?

00:33:28.019 --> 00:33:33.419
&gt;&gt;Roman: Also there's a sample sync adapter
which does all of that.

00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:35.539
It does contact, syncing.

00:33:35.539 --> 00:33:40.340
It does social stream APIs as in Ice Cream
Sandwich.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:47.740
Sync adapter, authenticator, it does pretty
much all of that.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:48.740
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.740
[pause]

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.740
&gt;&gt;Rich: Ah, [unintelligible].

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:51.740
Looks like we [unintelligible]

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:52.740
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible]

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.740
[laughter]

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:54.740
&gt;&gt;Rich: Awesome.

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:55.740
&gt;&gt;Nick: OK, so getting back to this question
asked on the phone.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:59.760
So Reuben asks "I know that W3C specs the
devices API still unplugs.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:03.529
But I wonder if there ought to be any support
in Android two point two and two point three

00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:06.740
devices for those specs being fleshed out."

00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.410
So the device API if there is not [unintelligible]
is a browser.

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:15.030
Like APIs that are allowing access like the
camera and images and so on.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.850
Like there's an input site.

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:18.640
So my initial reaction is probably, no.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:20.060
Because that would require an update to the
browser.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.950
And the browser as you know it's part of the
system image of the device.

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:29.100
So we're not able to update that outside of
a firmware update.

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.450
So I would be very surprised to see that happen.

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:33.610
Unfortunately.

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:34.610
Maybe other browsers.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.470
Like, so I know Chrome is ICS onwards.

00:34:37.470 --> 00:34:40.480
But maybe some other browsers might be able
to offer support there.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:47.880
But now with this soft Android browser or
the web view, I don't think.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.720
&gt;&gt;Rich: Uh.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:50.720
Hm.

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.720
[pause]

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.720
Well.

00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.050
&gt;&gt;Nick: New attendees there.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.300
&gt;&gt;Rich: People flooding in now.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.300
Oren.

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:57.300
And Johannes.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.300
And Yosi, I can't find the trace.

00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.300
OK.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:00.300
Maybe the next Office Hours.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:01.300
We will be back next Wednesday at two pm.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.300
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, Yosi.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.250
That sounds like the kind of thing you should
probably place into stack overflow.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:08.520
Post, and then link to it in our Moderator.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.680
That sounds like the right way to attack this.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.440
&gt;&gt;Rich: Ooooh.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:18.090
Can Johannes ask a question regarding native
audio?

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:19.090
Anybody wanna hear?

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.090
&gt;&gt;Sparky: You can try.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.090
[laughter]

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:22.090
&gt;&gt;Rich: Native audio guy.

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:24.390
&gt;&gt;Roman: You might be better off looking to
the [unintelligible].

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:25.540
&gt;&gt;Rich: Lots of faces.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.540
&gt;&gt;Johannes: OK.

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.540
Hi guys.

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:28.540
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hi.

00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:29.540
You're gonna ask it anyway.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:30.540
[laughs]

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.790
&gt;&gt;Johannes: So this is a question I had for
a long time now.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:40.130
So basically your documentation says that
you support the open SL audio library for

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:45.070
3D audio and some stuff around that.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:52.680
But if I implement listener, sound listener
and a sound source, inside of open SL, and

00:35:52.680 --> 00:36:03.251
I try to assign a 3D space to that, I get
this ominous "error 12" which says "This feature

00:36:03.251 --> 00:36:07.260
is not supported" which is weird.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:11.090
Because your documentation says you support
3D audio.

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.490
But if you try to implement it, it's not working.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.840
&gt;&gt;Rich: Mm.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.890
That is the kind of question I would refer
to the expertise of stack overflow on—

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:26.920
&gt;&gt;Nick: I would say, if you can stay up for
the US Office Hours tonight, some guys from

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.820
the media team who would have written our
implementation are going to be joining our

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.820
US colleagues.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:34.530
So if you can come back in 8 hours time.

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:35.530
&gt;&gt;Rich: [laughs]

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:39.750
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's probably the best place to get
an answer for that question.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.260
&gt;&gt;Johannes: When is that exactly?

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.320
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's two p.m. Pacific time.

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.740
&gt;&gt;Rich: You can see it if you go to—

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.260
&gt;&gt;Nick: So eight hours from now.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.770
&gt;&gt;Rich: Uh, better to stalk google.com/live.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:53.770
&gt;&gt;Johannes: OK.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:54.770
Thank you.

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:56.970
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, well, sorry to [unintelligible]

00:36:56.970 --> 00:36:58.220
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sorry [unintelligible].

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.220
&gt;&gt;Johannes: Problem.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.160
Stack Overflow can't help either.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:03.540
&gt;&gt;Rich: No, I can see it in the Google groups.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.540
They have the same thing.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:05.700
"I tried to use [inaudible] LES.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.460
I get unsupported error 12."

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:12.790
Mick says, "It depends on which profile flags
the model it was compiled with."

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:16.790
So the fact that you get an unsupported error
probably means they didn't include the audio

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:18.230
effect from that device.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:19.230
Interesting.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.230
So yeah.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:21.230
Best to just ask the team this evening.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:22.230
&gt;&gt;Johannes: OK.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:23.230
Thank you.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:24.230
&gt;&gt;Rich: Or ask it in the Moderator.

00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:27.770
You can go through the developers.com link
to get to Moderator.

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:28.940
And you can just type into there.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.600
And then you can watch the video back tomorrow,
hope they'll answer it.

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.600
Al Sutton.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.930
Where did he come from.

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:34.930
[laughter]

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:35.930
&gt;&gt;Matt: There he is.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:36.930
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sneaky.

00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:38.930
&gt;&gt;Al: I'm sneaky when you're not looking,
Rich.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:39.930
[laughter]

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:43.960
&gt;&gt;Rich: So, Al has just posted the link in
the chat window on the left there to the show

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:44.960
for tonight's—

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.000
&gt;&gt;Nick: He's the Hangout ninja.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.470
&gt;&gt;Rich: Hangout Ninja Al Sutton has joined
in.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:51.470
[laughter]

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:52.470
I know.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.470
Yeah.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.920
We're having the low-level media team which
will help to figure that out.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.980
&gt;&gt;Nick: You're back home Al.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.190
I thought you were in London this morning.

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:02.180
&gt;&gt;Al: I got back about half an hour ago.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.180
&gt;&gt;Nick: Ah.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:09.240
&gt;&gt;Al: So I've been fighting Chrome which doesn't
do Hangouts on air, so took me a bit to get

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.240
in.

00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.240
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.240
Interesting.

00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:13.240
OK.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.800
&gt;&gt;Al: I've got a question for you guys if
you want one.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.800
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.920
Feel free to ask.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:23.420
&gt;&gt;Al: I've been working on an application
that basically turns the user's phone into

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:24.640
a game pad.

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:29.560
So you can connect to another device using
Bluetooth, and you can play on your tablet

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.960
and use your phone as a controller.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:36.090
What's the best way to handle user defined
layouts.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:41.170
Is it to use a canvas view or should I be
looking at using one of the layout managers?

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.960
And restricting users positions for buttons
and things like that to what the layout manager

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.520
can handle.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:52.200
&gt;&gt;Rich: So you wanna allow users to specify
where all the buttons are on the tablet screen?

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.200
&gt;&gt;Al: Absolutely.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.200
Yep.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:59.190
So if I wanna have the control pad thumb pad
on the left or the right, they can move it

00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:00.190
over.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.190
Things like that.

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:04.770
&gt;&gt;Alex: Speaking of a few apps that have user
defined layouts, I definitely prefer the canvas

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:06.680
approach.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:11.710
Because what you end up with when you try
to get things into the layout manager is invariably

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:13.380
a grid that you can draw buttons on.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.680
And it's just very limiting.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.060
So I've actually played around with a few
remote control apps.

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:21.820
Where you control your TV.

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:23.280
When you move buttons around.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.240
But the grid isn't very conducive.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.040
Especially if you're making a game pad.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.800
And you want to use familiar patterns.

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:33.640
Like maybe the little diamond and ADXY buttons
on the side of the d-pad.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.690
And these things don't work if you line them
up in a grid.

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:39.440
Or if they do they're spaced really far apart
and it would be really awkward.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:44.400
So speaking as a user, I would like your app
better if it used canvas.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:50.990
&gt;&gt;Roman: If you wanted to do a drag and drop
with a non-canvas.

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:54.270
Let's say you did something similar look in
Absolute Layout.

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:59.700
Like a custom layout that was effectively
an absolute layout, using things like x and

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.700
y coordinates.

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.160
As you're dragging to show real time updates,
some of these.

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.940
You'd have to basically do a layout pass.

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:06.940
Every single drag.

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:07.940
Right.

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.970
You'd have to read through your layout.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:12.280
Even if it's just within that view.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.650
Just within that view group.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:17.440
It may be pretty slow, I guess.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.920
So I think just the canvass is going to give
you more flexibility and less pain all together.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:27.720
&gt;&gt;Nick: it's like, well I find some of the
game which have like a d-pad input, the ones

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.140
I like the most are the ones which don't force
you to a particular position.

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:33.460
But they let you put your foot, your finger
down.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.450
It just centers on wherever you place your
finger.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:39.850
So I think the mad finger games like Shadow
Gun and Dead Trigger, right.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:43.700
And so if you've got to call it if you offer
something like that.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:47.500
So you know, you don't have a physical anchor
point to locate with your finger.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.950
Just letting it touchdown where you move relatively
from that would be kind of cool.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:51.950
But just my—

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:52.970
&gt;&gt;Al: I was thinking along those lines.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.660
One of those things that I've gotta take into
account is the application's already got a

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:00.000
window that's a feedback window from the game
itself.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.160
So if you're playing, say for example, a games
console connected to a TV that runs Android,

00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:09.320
the game itself can feed back information
to be displayed on the controller pad.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:14.990
So I'm trying to make sure that they can be
positioned where that information can still

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.990
be seen.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.050
So there might be some limitations.

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:20.220
But the idea of centering it on where you
push could be quite cool.

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:21.440
thanks Nick.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.660
&gt;&gt;Nick: Alright.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:24.480
&gt;&gt;Rich: Good question.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.700
Cheers Al.

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:30.320
A number of things popped into the Moderator
whilst we've been talking.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.160
&gt;&gt;Roman: "How should a sync provider behave
that syncs files or anything?

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:39.660
Not accessible using a content resolver."

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.490
I'm not sure I understand the question.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:43.500
&gt;&gt;Alex: But you delivered it so well.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.280
&gt;&gt;Rich: One [unintelligible] length.

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:47.510
&gt;&gt;Matt: In an Anglo-Saxon [unintelligible]

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:48.510
&gt;&gt;Sparky: [laughs]

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:50.270
&gt;&gt;Rich: How should a sync provider behave?

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:51.650
&gt;&gt;Johannes: I had another question.

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:52.740
If you need one.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.740
Maybe?

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:57.240
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK, we'll think about that one whilst
Johannes asks the next question.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.240
Go ahead.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:05.100
&gt;&gt;Johannes: OK so is it possible to override
the GSM stack for implementing your own phone

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.160
application?

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:10.770
Just not only a dialer but a complete phone?

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:18.780
Or sending for example GSM codes without getting
dialog box as a result?

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:25.150
&gt;&gt;Roman: The only access to the telephony
or-- you don't have any access really to the

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:26.150
telephony or the radio.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.180
Well you can use sieve, right?

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.540
I mean if you're—

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:32.840
&gt;&gt;Rich: Well, he wants to do that slash code
thing.

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:35.250
&gt;&gt;Alex: So he's actually asking about the
GSMs?

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:36.930
If you write your own Android ROM.

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:37.930
&gt;&gt;Rich: ROM.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:38.930
Yeah.

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:39.930
&gt;&gt;Al: Yeah.

00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.930
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sorry.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:41.930
That's like doing your own custom ROM.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:42.930
&gt;&gt;Johannes: OK.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:43.930
&gt;&gt;Rich: The ASP ROMs.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:44.930
That's gonna be a tricky thing.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.240
That's insecure.

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.320
&gt;&gt;Roman: How should a sync provider behave?

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.580
I'm still trying to parse this question.

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:54.650
How should a sync provider behave that syncs
files or anything not accessible.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.650
So maybe—

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.050
&gt;&gt;Alex: Maybe it syncs anything not accessible
in content resolver.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:06.150
&gt;&gt;Roman: Maybe it's trying to block the content
provider.

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.230
Or sync provider from being accessible by
other apps?

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:10.230
&gt;&gt;Matt: Yeah.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:11.230
&gt;&gt;Roman: uh.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:13.540
&gt;&gt;Nick: I think you can do anything, 'cause
like—

00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.370
&gt;&gt;Roman: 'cause export equals false.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:18.470
Will that even work?

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:21.690
So basically the sync provider is a service,
right?

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:22.690
It's a—

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:26.260
&gt;&gt;Al: I think what he's trying to ask is,
if you've got a sync provider that's trying

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:31.250
to synchronize something for your application
that you can't feed to it via a content provider,

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:33.440
is there a recommended way of doing it?

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.440
'Cause he's talking about files.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.990
But I know there's a method in content provider
of reading files.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:40.560
Is there one to write files as well?

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.260
&gt;&gt;Roman: I have no clue.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:47.220
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I think.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.910
&gt;&gt;Roman: So first of all, we're not talking
about sync adapters.

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.320
We're talking about sync providers?

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:55.420
&gt;&gt;Al: I think he's talking about sync adapters.

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.160
But I've not been able to come up with classes.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:03.010
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah, I don't know what a sync provider
is.

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.320
&gt;&gt;Nick: Because it performs sync method, right?

00:44:05.320 --> 00:44:06.320
Where you can do anything.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:12.060
&gt;&gt;Roman: So sync adapters are, the only correlation,
the only way in which sync adapters interact

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.370
with content providers is via the authority.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:15.820
Its' just a link right.

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:21.210
Sync adapters don't inherently have to even
use a provider at all.

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:25.380
Like, there's no API that's specific to sync
adapters.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:27.160
&gt;&gt;Nick: That's what I'm thinking.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.160
Yeah.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.570
So I think we should move on unless Markus
can give us a little bit more context.

00:44:32.570 --> 00:44:33.570
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:35.750
Not able to answer the question.

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:36.750
Oh.

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:37.750
Matthias.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:38.750
Hello.

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:39.750
Thanks for joining us today.

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:42.280
He says "Any news on this issue?"

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280
Oh that.

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.280
Code.com.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.760
"I'm getting bad reviews thanks to this issue.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.780
" Let's click on it.

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:52.790
It says "I have certain Android install locations
that internal only in my paid app.

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:55.160
The APK itself installs to data apps.

00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:01.290
Instead, however, Google play installs the
app to mount ASEC this causes a major problem

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:03.180
for my app, because it's primarily an Android
service.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.780
As the service is generated before ASEC is
mounted, it can't find my service and widget.

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:09.700
All associated accounts, in Google data.

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:14.720
&gt;&gt;Nick: it's a problem with codes and API.

00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.720
And it shifts internally.

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.720
It just doesn't shift—

00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.720
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.730
Where did the window go.

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:24.680
&gt;&gt;Nick: I guess, unfortunately this falls
under 'can't talk release dates' cause we

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.260
don't know them and they'll probably change.

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.890
&gt;&gt;Rich: But the news on the issue is we do
know about it.

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:33.800
We know what it's caused by, and its' being
worked on.

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:35.740
Sorry about that.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:36.740
[laughter]

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.250
&gt;&gt;Nick: Sorry we can't share anymore.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:41.250
[pause]

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:42.250
&gt;&gt;Rich: No.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.770
Generally they won't be.

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:46.060
That's fine.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:53.580
But, the Play Store, updates separate to Android.

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.340
And the Android families.

00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.310
So they can push updates out at any time they
want.

00:45:57.310 --> 00:45:59.000
So as soon as they fix it I'm sure they'll
push that out.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.620
Once it's tested and it'll all just start
working without you having to make changes

00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:03.960
to your app.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.740
&gt;&gt;Nick: I'm not sure about that.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:09.270
I think it might [chiv] up the install process.

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:10.330
&gt;&gt;Roman: Baggage manager?

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.220
&gt;&gt;Nick: Baggage manager actually installs
the same incorrect information on it.

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.220
But um--

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:20.240
&gt;&gt; Roman: The other good news is that in general,
if you look at Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.370
If you look at Gingerbread.

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:28.800
I mean the very first version that gets released
doesn't stick around for too long.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:33.390
So, Ice Cream Sandwich four point oh, point
one, four point oh, point two.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:36.200
They're not really sticking around so much.

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.880
Four point oh point three, four point oh point
four, they're getting a lot of traction.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.070
This is not an absolute statement by any means.

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:49.800
But just historically the very first version
of a major dessert name release hasn't really

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:51.370
stuck around for too long.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:53.590
Its immediate successor is really—

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.320
&gt;&gt;Rich: This is true.

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.420
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible]

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:57.510
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:58.530
&gt;&gt;Nick: The ad monitor [unintelligible].

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.870
&gt;&gt;Rich: Is there an update to an IO developers
reply to comment?

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.900
No there's no update on that either, sorry
Joe.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:04.900
[laughter]

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.160
&gt;&gt;Al: It is rolling out to more developers
though.

00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:10.530
I've talked to a few who've received it in
the last week.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:12.670
So it looks like it's more widely available.

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:13.670
&gt;&gt;Rich: OK.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:16.710
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I think the team's beta testing
it.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:17.850
So yeah.

00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:19.000
&gt;&gt;Roman: "Beeta".

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000
You Brits and beta.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.450
&gt;&gt;Rich: What are you, "bay-ta" testing it?

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:23.450
&gt;&gt;Roman: "Bay-ta."

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:24.450
&gt;&gt;Rich: "Bay-ta" testing.

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:25.450
[laughter]

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:28.480
&gt;&gt;Al: Don't forget to "bay-ta" wi' your data.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.910
That's how I always remember.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:31.830
&gt;&gt;Alex: You really watch the A beta.

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:32.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: "Bay-ta!"

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:33.970
Um.

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:40.170
NPerch is asking in the Moderator "Is there
an API for pulling all the application data

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:45.030
out of the Play Store?"

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:46.030
Nope.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:47.901
[laughter]
"What's the best way to have a—" This is

00:47:47.901 --> 00:47:51.300
from Nooki of [unintelligible].

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:56.640
"what's the best way to have a horizontal
scrolling list or grid on Android?

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.370
Since both list view and grid view are only
vertical?"

00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:00.490
&gt;&gt;Roman: Write your own.

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:01.960
&gt;&gt;Rich: Write your own.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.970
Use a view pager that's actually a view pager.

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:09.280
Works quite well for this, depending on how
big you're gonna have.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:11.570
&gt;&gt;Matt: What about the gallery?

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:12.570
&gt;&gt;Rich: Gallery is now deprecated.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:13.570
&gt;&gt;Matt: Is it?

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.570
Cool.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:15.570
&gt;&gt;Roman: Is it officially deprecated?

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:16.570
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Are we officially dedicated?

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:17.570
&gt;&gt;Roman: [unintelligible]

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:18.570
&gt;&gt;Nick: It's like that.

00:48:18.570 --> 00:48:19.570
[laughter]

00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:20.570
&gt;&gt;Alex: Look at that excitement.

00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:22.080
&gt;&gt;Roman: Gallery, yeah, gallery can work in
some cases.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:24.670
But the physics, the touch physics are all
screwed up.

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:25.890
&gt;&gt;Rich: Uh.

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:28.370
&gt;&gt;Alex: Could you just put a linear kind of
scroll in?

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:29.370
&gt;&gt;Matt: It could work.

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:30.370
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:31.370
You could use your horizontal scroll.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.880
The good thing about list view and [unintelligible]
view is that [unintelligible].

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:34.880
&gt;&gt;Nick: Just a sec.

00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.880
Right there.

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.880
And then down, down, down, down, and then—

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:39.000
&gt;&gt;Roman: [unintelligible] you have like a
10,000 item, for the scroll view.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Is it deprecated?

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
&gt;&gt;Rich: This class is deprecated.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yes!

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
&gt;&gt;Rich: [unintelligible]

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
&gt;&gt;Matt: [inaudible]

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.200
&gt;&gt;Rich: Other horizontally scroll widgets
include horizontal scroll, view, and view

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.210
pager from the support library.

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:50.500
&gt;&gt;Roman: So if you want like an actual horizontal
list view that does all the [unintelligible]

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.500
recycling—

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:52.500
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.500
&gt;&gt;Roman: We don't have one.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:54.500
But there are third party projects.

00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:55.500
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, just Google "horizontal list
view."

00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.500
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah, horizontal.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.500
&gt;&gt;Nick: Android.

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.500
there's a ton out there.

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.260
But I said View Pager gets you on the [unintelligible].

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:04.480
&gt;&gt;Roman: One other interesting thing about
View Pager.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:08.590
So View Pager also does, it doesn't do the
recycling, but it follows the adapter patterns.

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.390
So you can implement the recycling yourself.

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:11.890
Launch is not very complicated.

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:17.820
One thing I'll say is that in the recent versions
of the support library, I think as of R8 or

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:18.820
later.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:24.550
View Pager, actually Pager Adapter has this
new method called "get page width" which lets

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.160
you create pages that are not full width.

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:31.110
So you can create a page that is 25 percent
of the screen width.

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.340
And so you'll see four pages at a time.

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:37.620
Or a page that is 50 percent screen width,
so you'll see two at a time.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.080
And the touch physics work well there.

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.650
There's no inertial fling or anything like
that.

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:43.650
You guys are—

00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:44.650
&gt;&gt;Nick: On pages?

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:47.100
I see, you get full, next door, next door.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:48.100
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.960
Well actually you advance one page at a time
so you've got one, like—

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:53.160
&gt;&gt;Nick: So that you'd get like one to the
left.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.160
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.850
So you locate items one and two.

00:49:55.850 --> 00:49:58.500
And you go one more and you'd see items two
and three, not three and four.

00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.960
&gt;&gt;Nick: Could you have full width?

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.000
&gt;&gt;Roman: Well, actually, that's a good question.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.710
We'll have to check it out sometime.

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:08.270
&gt;&gt;Alex: So you've got, its View Pager so you
definitely, if it's a 10,000 item list you

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:09.270
can't just do a whoosh.

00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:10.340
&gt;&gt;Roman: [unintelligible] Right.

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:17.660
The other thing is, if you're quite fancy
with RUNDLL script a example which is called

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:20.980
carousel view, that's somewhere.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:27.050
Just search for "carousel example Android"
it'll show you how to do like a music, a Google

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:29.580
music style 3D carousel.

00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:33.650
Not so much horizontal as it is three dimensional.

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:40.160
But yeah, I don't know, it's, linked to Google
IO talk.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.160
[tablet music playing]

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.160
[laughter]

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.160
&gt;&gt;Roman: Last year.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.160
Somewhere last year.

00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.160
Right.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.160
&gt;&gt;Rich: Right.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.160
Those two versions would be rendered script
carousel.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.160
One of them is actually understandable and
quite boring.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.160
Or the one that's tricky and it's amazing.

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.160
'cause the sample code in there, the sample
code for run script has one version that may

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.160
be hard to understand.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:55.810
But the music player one I think is 20,000
lines of run script in one file.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:56.810
One large file.

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.850
&gt;&gt;Roman: It's meant to be like a flexible.

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:03.320
'Cause the [unintelligible] where the higher
level API, you just press the five basic things.

00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.320
Like.

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.660
&gt;&gt;Nick: They'll go to the RS files.

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:06.660
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.660
&gt;&gt;Nick: That'd be dragging them.

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:08.660
[laughter]

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.660
&gt;&gt; Roman: Unless you want your eyes [unintelligible]

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.660
[laughter]

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:11.660
&gt;&gt;Rich: That's OK.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:12.660
[laughter]

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:13.660
&gt;&gt;Matt: [unintelligible] your eyes?

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:14.660
[laughter]

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:15.660
&gt;&gt;Nick: Also, it's not worth learning [unintelligible]

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:16.660
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:17.660
&gt;&gt;Rich: Also—

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:18.660
[laughter]

00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:23.690
&gt;&gt;Nick: There was some chat going on on sidebar
about Google wire framing tools.

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:27.910
Which I know is one of Roman's favorite topics.

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:31.040
So I'd say, pencil and paper.

00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:33.170
Or fluid drawing.

00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:34.530
And the [unintelligible]

00:51:34.530 --> 00:51:35.940
&gt;&gt;Roman: We have official stencils.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.940
For OmniGraffle.

00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:38.660
That would be FireWorks.

00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:40.310
FireWorks is very good.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:45.270
If you wanna do interactive wire frames, like
where you can click on a button and actually

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:47.880
flip to the page that the button would be
to the left.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.220
&gt;&gt;Nick: [unintelligible] 'cause FireWorks
is so flaky.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.220
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.220
[laughter]

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:56.120
&gt;&gt;Roman: Also there's phototrap stencil, so
I mean, outside of the official stencils kit,

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:57.980
there are FireWorks, phototrap, OmniGraffle.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.960
If you were to use any other too.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:03.420
Pencil for Firefox, you mentioned.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.830
They just added a Android four point oh stencil
kit built in.

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:08.820
or just available for download.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:11.070
And Fluid UI also comes with that.

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:14.060
With and Android four point oh.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.060
So it's, yeah.

00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:16.060
&gt;&gt;Rich: So.

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:17.060
Uh.

00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:18.060
Questions flying in now.

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:19.060
We've got eight minutes left so I'm not sure
we're going to get through them all.

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:23.750
But Yosi, who is still working on his dialog,
his [unintelligible] or whatever, has asked,

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:26.440
is there a way of showing progress on a dialog?

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.680
[unintelligible] no.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.680
[unintelligible]

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:31.810
&gt;&gt;Roman: Oh, like as a window feature?

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:38.850
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah, the same was in the window feature,
just showing the web page loading progress

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:43.700
on the top of the dialog, the title or something
like.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.700
That.

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:45.744
&gt;&gt;Roman: You have to look at it yourself.

00:52:45.744 --> 00:52:48.200
So the window feature is specific to [inaudible]

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:53.690
&gt;&gt;Roman: Like for example, dialogs can't even
have action bars at all.

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:56.470
That's partly because of the, for the same
reason.

00:52:56.470 --> 00:52:58.200
So you'd have to just have a progress bar
or something.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:04.440
&gt;&gt;Yosi: So the best way to implement it is
to have a progress bar above the web view

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:08.700
and show the progress as you go along loading
the URL?

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:09.790
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:14.980
Um, in general, I mean, you're saying, web
view inside of a dialog.

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:17.150
And that's very kind of starting to scare
me.

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:18.150
[laughter]

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:20.430
&gt;&gt;Yosi: It's from the application web view.

00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:21.740
If you can see it.

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.740
I don't know.

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:23.740
I have the permissions done.

00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:35.130
Just showing the user, uh, I don't know if
you can see it or something.

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:36.430
[laughter]

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:41.010
&gt;&gt;Roman: So in general, don't be afraid of
full screen windows.

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:45.900
I mean, users don't-- users have awful memory
but not that awful.

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.900
Like, they're—

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:47.900
[laughter]

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:54.920
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah, I have a full window of the,
um, showing the progress bar and everything.

00:53:54.920 --> 00:54:02.740
But I think it's more flowing to the user
and more comprehensive to show when using

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:08.200
two panes, then clicking on the left pane
and showing the dialog.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:14.700
And then after selecting in dialog, or making
it the authentication, then the right pane

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:19.970
shows the content you want to go and fetch
from for the user.

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:21.010
&gt;&gt;Roman: OK.

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:26.050
&gt;&gt;Yosi: I think it's a better UI flow for
the user.

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:27.050
&gt;&gt;Roman: OK.

00:54:27.050 --> 00:54:30.070
Yeah, so in that case you are probably just
going to have to make your own progress bar.

00:54:30.070 --> 00:54:34.450
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, as Joe says in his the sidebar,
I would try linear, linear, linear layout

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:36.300
with the progress bar above the work you're
doing.

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.300
So.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.390
&gt;&gt;Roman: One thing is that the progress bar
has built in padding.

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:47.220
So there will be actually on ICS and even
Anycom, the tail end, or I guess the head

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.980
of the progress bar is actually a globe.

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:51.830
So it has some built in padding to account
for that.

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:55.680
So if you use a linear layout then your web
view will appear below the globe.

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:57.210
&gt;&gt;Nick: Maybe do a frame layout for it.

00:54:57.210 --> 00:54:58.210
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:01.400
You may wanna do a frame layout and have the
progress bar neatly, like the middle of the

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.420
progress bar aligned with the top edge of
the web view.

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:09.170
That's what Chrome and the built in browser
do.

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:10.470
&gt;&gt;Yosi: OK.

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:11.470
Thanks.

00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:15.020
&gt;&gt;Rich: I'm searching for [VoIP] now.

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:18.280
Jake knew what it was.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:20.140
It's a client for Android, right?

00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.140
&gt;&gt;Roman: Oh yeah.

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:22.140
&gt;&gt;Rich: Are you on the VoIP team there, Joe?

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:23.140
Oh, you can't talk, can you, sorry.

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:24.220
You'll have to do by hand signals.

00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:29.560
&gt;&gt;Nick: You can do thumbs up, thumbs down,
mime, [inaudible]

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:30.630
&gt;&gt;Rich: Oh.

00:55:30.630 --> 00:55:31.700
Nine [unintelligible]

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:34.900
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah, it's, it's, good [inaudible]

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:35.970
&gt;&gt;Rich: [inaudible]

00:55:35.970 --> 00:55:37.570
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Um.

00:55:37.570 --> 00:55:38.940
I've got a quick—

00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:39.940
&gt;&gt;Rich: [growls]

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:43.760
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Android question that I want to
ask.

00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:44.760
Um.

00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:46.930
Where can I find Google Wallet?

00:55:46.930 --> 00:55:49.290
I tried to find it.

00:55:49.290 --> 00:55:50.290
&gt;&gt;Rich: In America.

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:51.290
[laughter]

00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:52.290
&gt;&gt;Roman: [unintelligible]

00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:54.550
&gt;&gt;Rich: Now, we don't have Google Wallet.

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:55.550
Sorry.

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:56.550
&gt;&gt;Roman: [inaudible]

00:55:56.550 --> 00:55:57.550
[laughter]

00:55:57.550 --> 00:55:58.550
&gt;&gt;Alex: Why not?

00:55:58.550 --> 00:55:59.550
&gt;&gt;Rich: [unintelligible]

00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:00.550
&gt;&gt;Nick: Then on top of that, the carriers
and—

00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:03.080
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I'm asking because it's actually
started working in Israel.

00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:07.070
Some shops, some people actually manage to
pay with Google Wallet.

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:08.520
Which is quite funny.

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.520
[laughter]

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:13.150
&gt;&gt;Al: It's all based on MasterCard's PayPass
which is a global standard.

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:16.350
So you can do it in the UK as well in McDonalds
and places like that.

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:17.500
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Yeah, so.

00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:19.080
&gt;&gt;Al: What do you need to do?

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.580
&gt;&gt;Nick: [inaudible] and that's where you find
it.

00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.710
&gt;&gt;Al: If you can get hold of a Galaxy Nexus
or a device for which the stock firmware is

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:30.630
produced, you can put the US firmware from
the Google developer's site on it.

00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:34.250
Put a US SIM in the phone and you'll get full
working Google Wallet functionality.

00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:37.190
If it doesn't have a US SIM in, it won't work.

00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:39.110
&gt;&gt;Male #1: [laughs] Yeah.

00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:43.230
&gt;&gt;Al: --picked up from my trip to the States.

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:44.320
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.990
We tried it a few times on Google IO and found
out that you need to—

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:51.960
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I think [unintelligible] buying
his Gregg's Pasties with his Nexus 7.

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:52.970
[laughter]

00:56:52.970 --> 00:57:00.230
&gt;&gt;Male #1: But I tried it from the market
website.

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:01.230
Uh, you know the Play website.

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:07.859
Full website on the PC and I even faked my
IP so I can access it the US store and I didn't

00:57:07.859 --> 00:57:08.859
find it there.

00:57:08.859 --> 00:57:10.290
So I can only find it from a Galaxy Nexus?

00:57:10.290 --> 00:57:11.290
In—

00:57:11.290 --> 00:57:13.570
&gt;&gt;Nick: You want us to teach you how to hack
the Play Store so that—

00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:14.570
&gt;&gt;Male #1: No.

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:15.570
I'm not that [inaudible]

00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:16.570
[laughter]

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:19.790
&gt;&gt; Male #1: No, I said I didn't even find
it on there.

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:21.620
&gt;&gt;Rich: And that's the end of today's broadcast.

00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:22.620
[laughter]

00:57:22.620 --> 00:57:26.230
&gt;&gt;Roman: But IP isn't, I don't think IP is
the only signal we use to determine what the

00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:27.230
[inaudible]

00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:29.100
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yes, [unintelligible] different ones
out so he can just break the [inaudible]

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:31.640
&gt;&gt;Johannes: But isn't Wallet a system application?

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:35.400
So that is maybe the reason why it's not available
in the Play Store.

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:39.700
&gt;&gt;Al: It's available by the Play Store but
it's triggered off of the SIM inside the device.

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:45.080
So unless you've got a US carrier SIM in the
device, your chances of installing or being

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.790
useable would actually be none.

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:51.620
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah, but if you have a Nexus 7 tablet,
then you don't have a SIM.

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:55.770
So based on the location, the Play Store app
should work.

00:57:55.770 --> 00:58:00.070
&gt;&gt;Nick: Yeah, I was going to say, this isn't
an Android developer question.

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:01.070
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah.

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:02.070
Let's not—

00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:03.070
[laughter]

00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:05.190
&gt;&gt;Rich: I wonder if there's anything else.

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:06.340
&gt;&gt;Roman: Two minutes!

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.500
&gt;&gt;Rich: Two minutes.

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:12.670
Is anything, anyone in the Hangout have anything
they really wanna say in the last two minutes?

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:14.350
'cause thank you very much for all joining
us.

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:17.230
&gt;&gt;Yosi: First of all, thank you.

00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:19.440
And, one last question.

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:21.490
How can I get my app featured.

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:23.170
What is the best—

00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:24.170
[laughter]

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.170
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yes.

00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:26.950
We all have to drink now.

00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:32.370
If anyone asks that in a Hangout, we all have
to drink.

00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:33.370
[laughter]

00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:34.620
&gt;&gt;Rich: Someone asks that every single week.

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:35.620
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah.

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:36.620
I know.

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:37.620
I know.

00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.020
&gt;&gt;Al: Just so you can drink the double, how
do I get my Google Plus page verified?

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.020
[laughter]

00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:43.410
&gt;&gt;Nick: Uh, if you think you have a great
app, maybe submit it to the Friday Review.

00:58:43.410 --> 00:58:44.410
And—

00:58:44.410 --> 00:58:45.450
&gt;&gt;Roman: The Friday App Clinic.

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:46.450
&gt;&gt;Nick: Clinic.

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:47.450
My bad.

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:48.870
Have to rewire my brain.

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:49.870
&gt;&gt;Rich: Drink.

00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:50.870
[chuckles]

00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:53.270
&gt;&gt;Nick: So yeah, that's a good way to get
it in front of people.

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:54.270
Like always.

00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:57.960
Just like, how are you promoting it at the
moment?

00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:04.800
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Basically we're doing some campaigns
on different websites and different stores.

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.490
Like on Samsung store and the Amazon.

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:10.860
And so on and so on.

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:11.860
With affiliates.

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:15.890
And we want to see how to get our app featured
in the Play Store.

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:22.400
'cause that's the best way to get our app
be more visible.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:28.670
'cause we already have like six and a half
million downloads already.

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:29.670
&gt;&gt;Nick: Wow.

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:30.670
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah.

00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:31.670
And—

00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:32.670
&gt;&gt;Nick: What's the app?

00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:33.670
&gt;&gt;Alex: What' s the app called?

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:34.670
&gt;&gt;Yosi: OoVoo.

00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:35.670
&gt;&gt;Rich: What?

00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:36.670
OoVoo?

00:59:36.670 --> 00:59:37.670
Are you OoVoo?

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.000
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Is it the video player, uh, video
conferencing?

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.040
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah.

00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.130
&gt;&gt;Rich: Double-O, V, double-O?

00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:45.890
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Social video chat.

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:47.180
&gt;&gt;Rich: Sorry.

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:48.470
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:50.410
I know that.

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:52.280
&gt;&gt;Yosi: That's the one.

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:57.680
&gt;&gt;Al: Isn't' there a checklist of things people
should do to help it get featured?

00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.280
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Well we do know what not to not
do to not get not featured.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:02.450
Because that was at Google IO.

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:03.450
[laughter]

01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:07.970
&gt;&gt;Roman: There's a blog post by Natasha [ ] that
talks about your image guidelines.

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:10.450
Like your play listing guidelines.

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:12.160
Like your featured graphic.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.160
Your titles.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.880
Your descriptions.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.120
There are some things that are just very simple,
things to make sure you have.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:23.300
&gt;&gt;Alex: We don't actually offer a definitive
list of "do x, y, and z and you will get featured."

01:00:23.300 --> 01:00:27.110
Uh, but we provide a wealth of information
on things that will get you not featured.

01:00:27.110 --> 01:00:28.110
And.

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:29.770
&gt;&gt;Nick: Such as using an iPad layout.

01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:30.770
[laughter]

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:31.770
&gt;&gt;Alex: Right.

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:32.770
&gt;&gt;Yosi: [clears throat loudly]

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:33.770
[group laughs and comments]

01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:38.490
&gt;&gt;Alex: Also you need to clear before featuring
you.

01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:40.050
That's a consideration.

01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:44.470
So Dan Galpin and Ian Ni-Lewis gave a talk
at IO that was—

01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:46.470
&gt;&gt;Nick: Aimed at games.

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:47.790
I think it was.

01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:48.910
"Ten things every game developer should know."

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:49.910
Right?

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:50.910
&gt;&gt;Alex: Right.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:53.960
But a good chunk of that was things that will
get you not featured on Google Play.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.060
Also, like you said, Natasha [ ] post on,
what was it you said?

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:02.440
On like the resources that you use?

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.810
And like looking good in Google Play?

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:04.810
&gt;&gt;Sparky: Yeah.

01:01:04.810 --> 01:01:07.140
Like dimensions for your promotional graphics.

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.630
&gt;&gt;Nick: It was just talking about pitching
graphics.

01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:12.130
&gt;&gt;Alex: One mistake a lot of people do is
they upload smaller application graphics when

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:15.420
they're told they have to upload a larger
banner-size one.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.280
So they just blow up the first one.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.840
It's this huge blurry mess that we would never
put on the front page of Google Play.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.910
&gt;&gt;Nick: No, what's worse is they say "Hey,
it's 1024 pixels wide by 500 high."

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:27.580
&gt;&gt;Roman: Just take the screws out of our IDE.

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:31.580
&gt;&gt;Nick: Well they squish like tons of text
in there and then when we wanna feature the

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.380
application 'cause that's gonna get like shrunk
down from this big on the website to this

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.600
big on the phone.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.160
Like, it's just illegible.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160
So.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.180
&gt;&gt;Rich: Things like that.

01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:41.720
But I would say, look at your screenshots.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:47.320
That a little bit of application of our design
guidelines would certainly help any potential

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.320
featuring.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.320
&gt;&gt;Roman: Yeah.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.320
Definitely.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.470
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Yeah, I'm', we're doing a redesign
for all the app 'cause the main issue was,

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:56.390
before I got to Google was—

01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:58.560
&gt;&gt;Rich: yeah, maybe when that's ready.

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:05.050
&gt;&gt;Yosi: Most of the features from the iPhone,
in order to do a cross-platform remote.

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:10.290
You know when you want to do a fluid cross
platform from UI.

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:16.640
And when I came to Google, we started working
on the design guidelines and all that.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.020
And that's what we're doing right now.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:24.730
We're implementing a new version to be download,
to be published in the market in the next

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:26.660
few weeks.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.610
And that will be better design.

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:31.730
And hopefully the next version will be even
better.

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:32.730
&gt;&gt;Nick: So that sounds great.

01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:36.210
So once you have this new version kind of
launched, maybe you could time a big push

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:37.210
around that.

01:02:37.210 --> 01:02:42.610
So if you try and pick up some play in the
media, maybe get some adverting around the

01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:43.610
application.

01:02:43.610 --> 01:02:46.840
And then submit it to the Friday Clinic as
well and we can take a look at it.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.630
So if you try and time all the push around
your relaunch that could be a good time.

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:52.630
&gt;&gt;Yosi: OK.

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:53.630
Thank you.

01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:54.630
&gt;&gt;Rich: Alright.

01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:55.630
Well we've gone overtime.

01:02:55.630 --> 01:02:57.700
But thank you all very much for joining in
today.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:03:01.160
Those of you on YouTube as well who have been
watching the stream.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:04.020
Thanks for joining this massive crowd with
us.

01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:05.790
All six of us today.

01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:06.790
Here in London.

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:09.840
And we'll see you all again same time next
week.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.840
Cheers.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.100
[all say "Bye" and "Cheers"]
