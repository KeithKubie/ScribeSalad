Speaker 1:          00:10          Just, um, we're gonna install it and just want to remind you, uh, refresh your memory about what we were talking about before the break. So we were talking about, uh, first, um, the concept of strangers and kindness of strangers, right? Um, that, um, um, that Lena would be a recipient of. Um, and then we would harking about, um, the, um, about neighbors and what could come to us, um, from neighbors and not always good things. Um, and high tower is the recipient of the novel. Always good things coming from our neighbors, but high towers, we also know, um, it's very emphatic that in spite of what happens to him in spite of the beatings, um, and so on, um, that he is actually surrounded by two people. So it really takes a tremendous act of willpower, um,

Speaker 1:          01:14          to be able to say that. Um, and so this is the quote from hightower. They are good people. All that any man can hope for is to be permitted to live quietly among his fellows. Um, so it is a proposition statement that really is sort of thrown in our face and in the phase of all the things that have happened to him. Um, so today we'll, I like to do is to use race as the test case for house proposition. We all know that Joe Christmas, um, is someone who's racial identity is ambiguous. I would say from beginning to end. We don't really know for sure. Um, what his parentage, um, I mean, you know, we have some very, we have good guesses but we don't know for sure and we certainly don't know the genetic make up of someone like Joe Christmas. So in the, in that context, um, I think it's especially relevant to talk about some of the contemporary discussion of race.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Um, and um, and this is not even so new. I mean it was, came out in 2003, um, it was the special issues and to make American whether it raised exist and it makes a strong argument, um, that racism is leading in the sense that we look at the physical characteristics, the facial features of people, and we assume that res has a very solid existence that is real. Um, but actually the facial characteristics with the physical attributes do not always correspond to our genetic makeup. So you know, how people look. Hatchway um, it's not a very good way to tell us who they are are biologically. Um, and so the scientific argument, special issue or that essay is about the importance of thinking outside of the box of noticeable, of servable visible characteristics, um, to thinking about medical, you know, what would come into play in a medical situation if this is scientific American after all.

Speaker 1:          03:24          Um, so this is, this was back in 2003 and even earlier than that, I'm on the front cover of Time magazine is to face new phase of America. Um, and it's really about America becoming mixed race nation. Um, this is, um, and in find out his case, you know, I look at, you know, everyone, yeah, we're not quite often they can't really tell, you know, what background, uh, ethnic background people from, um, and that is the case. This is computer generated image. Um, and we don't really know. She's made up of the trays are many razors and so it's hard to tell, but just a very typical American face. Um, and around the same time a book came out by um, f James Davis called who is black ash like this. Um, it was quite an important but when it came out in 1992 to such an extent that and its 10th anniversary, PBS actually did the special program, um, title who is black and feature that book.

Speaker 1:          04:25          Um, and his argument is very, very hurt and um, to Faulkner's novel, um, we don't actually know, um, who is black and this novel. So it is a question that is not answer. Um, and it'll has not men today and struggle even at the end of the novel. And this is, um, um, image that, um, as the Tao use for her section and great section. I'm very happy to be there. Um, but this is, um, so I just borrow it from her. Um, and this is, uh, Ebony magazine, a quiz, um, 1952 again, but even back in 1952, um, people were realizing that if you look at people, you don't really know what race they are. Um, and so, you know, I think the most who are as they get a few wrong answers for that quiz. Um, so I think that all of this is just to set the stage for the ferry, um, complicated, um, and maybe not men to be resolve landscape that Faulkner is set up for us.

Speaker 1:          05:33          Um, and in light in August. Um, and so what I like to talk about today is the one Nager and of course, you know, that's the word that would have to be used because just as in the 50 is the word Negro, uh, was the standard term. Um, in the twenties and thirties, a nigger, whether have been the standard term. So it was not a racial slur. They use the word nigger. And, um, even though it wasn't necessarily a racial slur, it nonetheless was a charge appetite. Um, it always is, has carry excessive semantic burden, um, and because it carries excessive semantic good and, um, it also opens itself up to multiple users. So today we'll lock, look at the way that word is being used by different people in different contexts and for different purposes. So that will go down and let's change out. We'll be talking about all of this, um, and also spoken by other people.

Speaker 1:          06:37          Um, and also when the words spoken by the person himself. So, um, just noticed this microphone has a way of diminishing yourself. Um, so, um, the, these are the people that we'll be looking at who use the word nigger. Uh, first is, uh, Joe Brown and the the dietician a couple of times and then hide and then Bobby the waitress, and then join the burden. And then Joe Christmas himself, he uses the, what negative for himself. Um, but first let's talk, look at the way Joel Brown uses that word. Um, at this point to arise being questioned by the shower of rain. So, you know, we know that, um, the join his body has been discovered and know that the house has burned down. Um, and the sheriff is questioning, um, uh, Joe Brown and um, and there's $1,000, um, that is up for, you know, anyone who can help solve the case.

Speaker 1:          07:38          So Joe Brown is who have high hopes that he will be the one to get $2,000. But as the sheriff questions in more and more comes out, it seems as little less analyzed likely that the thousand dollars, we'll begin his own pocket. So He's getting desperate and that is when that word comes up because they said it was like he had been saving. He told them next [inaudible] time is like, he didn't know that ever come to a pinch is with this is um, Brian talent, my towel, like in head note that if it come to a pinch, this would save him, even if it was almost worse for a white man to knit what he would have to admit than to be accused of the murder itself as right. He said, he says, go on, accuse me accused. The white man is trying to help you with what he knows accused of white men and let the nigger go free accused to white, let them nigger run.

Speaker 1:          08:38          So this is the classic race card, you know, that we recognize so well and unfortunately it still has some currency. Um, and um, so he's playing the race card because he's really desperate. What is really interesting is how subtle there's portrayed. Even have someone like Joe Brown who is sold little saving grace to him. You know, this is a really someone who's supremely unlikable. Um, but even for someone who is supremely unlikable, Foglia nonetheless portrays him as someone who's not incapable of feeling the shame. Right? So it is shameful even for someone like Joe Brown to use the race car that you know, that this is when he is not, when there's nothing else he can do, he would do that. So he's not such a racist or such or whatever the, he is blind to what he's doing. And so I would say that even though this is Joe Brown doing one of the despicable things that he's capable of doing, um, in the very act of doing that, um, he recognizes completely that he is being despicable.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Um, so this is one kind of self contained usage, shameful, shameful, even to the person who was doing it. Um, and the next, uh, couple of usages or revolving around the Dietitian. Um, and we know that, that, um, Joe Christmas is, um, in the, in behind the curtains and watching this whole scene unfolding between, um, the dietician and her bowl and eating toothpaste and having no idea what's going on outside, but the Dietitian thinking that he knows everything. So he, she drags him out. Um, and, um, this is what Joe sees when she drags him out with phase you no longer smooth pink and white surrounded now by wild and disheveled hair, who's moved bands? Once Megan things candy, you low rat, then fear is, was his new logo rat despite, I mean you little nigger past it. Um, so at, she's never called it that before.

Speaker 1:          10:58          So is it at this moment of x, Rheem from ability on the part of the dietician that that would, would come rushing up. So this, it has some relation to the Joe Brown usage in the sense that this is the word that comes out, um, when, when, when your back is against the wall basically, you know, um, you, this is the thing that, that, that you fling at people. Um, but the Dietitian actually is more resourceful than um, Joe Brown. She last today is, I'm able to use that word in some other contexts. So this is the next and storm and after the word nigger coming out of the mouth of the Dietitian and she has something else to offer Joe Christmas and it's out fresh and upon it, they assume the dollar of voice when on Bush and tens fast, a whole dollar city. How was you could buy something to eat every day for a week.

Speaker 1:          12:07          And that's what of maybe I'll give you another one. You seem to see rent tubes of toothpaste, like word work and listen. Terrifying. His whole being coiled and were rich and passion. That revision. I don't want no more. He said, I don't never want to know more. He said he didn't need to look up to know what her face looked like. Now Tau, she's like, tell him your little negative asked of you nigger bastard. So this is the evolution of the Dietitian, um, that she's not so vulnerable now that she's actually on the verge of going on the offensive, but not quite because she'll just wants to make peace. Really. She has ones to have it cut a deal with Joe Tresona's is basically, um, and so what she doesn't understand is that he doesn't understand the concept of bribery. Um, Joe Prisma is really interesting. Um, in that way.

Speaker 1:          13:05          He doesn't always understand kindness, um, and even doesn't understand the next thing down. I think it was just bribery. Um, and so for him, if the silver dollar just means endless tubes of toothpaste and can be more, uh, that can be more repugnant to him. Um, but he knows enough to know that rejecting that silver dollar will actually be an automatic guarantee of the appearance of that worth from the Dietitian. So the pattern is beginning to develop first complete vulnerability on a pole or the Dietitian, um, then now of complete vulnerability, but of something her skin is being stolen and willingly by Joe Christmas, and that word comes up again. So it's just a killer of handy, uh, while involuntary, but, um, quite reflective and taught handy almost in his true Manto usage of that term. Um, and we'll move on now to come see the instrumental light usage.

Speaker 1:          14:16          Right? So with the dietician, they begins with a nonindustrial mental eyes, uh, involuntary usage. By the third time she, she uses that word. It is completely instrumental eyes and completely calculated. And as when the dietician goes to the matron of the orphanage and uses that word and they go one more time, how does she know about this? The dietician did not look away. I didn't, I have no idea at all. Of course I knew it didn't mean anything. When the other children called him a nigger nigger you consider the other children they have been calling him and they go over for years. Sometimes I think the children have a way of knowing things like wrong people, your and my age don't see it down to that little detail. People of your age, of your and my age, they actually are not the same age. So, um, when you have some of the using that kind of construction, you just know that they are who completely, you know, the highly manipulative and know exactly what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          15:20          Um, so that little giveaway to tell at the end, it's basically just the kind of a smore is just the icing on the cake of this racialization, this very deliberate, um, racialization of Geo prisoners in order to get them sent away from the off an edge. Um, so the dietician I would say is probably, um, you know, it's right up there in my mind along with Joel Graph, uh, in terms of unlikeability, uh, but she is better I think, um, at what she is doing and it's just so she was like six succeeds in, um, in pinning that adverts hat, uh, on Joel Christmas. Um, and so this is really the first thing that we should say about their habitat is that it is something that someone else can, it doesn't really rule from inside your, um, it is knowledge nanotech attribute about you as an attribution is not an internal genetic congenital attribute.

Speaker 1:          16:25          It is an attribution Dennis foisted upon you. Um, and that is what the dietician is doing right there. So, um, that's, that is the usage of the word nigger on one side of the spectrum, joke Brown. And that vision, and now we'll move on to the other and the spectrum when his sheer agony to use that look for. By the time the dietician uses the word last time, she was actually very good at what she's doing. It doesn't really touch her anymore. It's just completely distance yourself and therefore able to manipulate at work. But um, here is on the other side of the spectrum and someone who simply cannot have that distance from that word. And so it was an agonizing usage. And this comes out in the context of the conversation between, um, uh, between hightower and Byron and Byron, this telling him about this new development, about it burning down the house, join his body and so on.

Speaker 1:          17:30          Uh, but also about Christmas, Christmas about yesterday and Christmas, Christmas is on nigger about him and Brian yesterday [inaudible] I'd houses, it's always announce the Leighton Trilio [inaudible] bloom falling into silence without a sound, without any weight. He does not move for a moment longer. He does not move then the sales to come over his whole body as if it's paws. When mobile life phase features that shrinking and denial and baron sees that the still flattered big phase is done lists like with sweat, but his voice is light and calm. What about prisoners? And Brian, yesterday he said, so it is that other disparity between the bodily gesture, the facial expression, that bodily expression, um, high tower and the still control, lightness of tone is bad, is what gives the hideout away. Um, bad not only is the possibility of Joel Christmas being black now, not only is there the most terrifying of possibilities, but their sole terrify take really afford to her knowledge is gravity, right?

Speaker 1:          19:04          So it's not as that, it's just terrible, but he can't even men too. It is that double double combination that suggests just have rave. The situation is, um, because the high Mao and knows exactly what's going to happen. And once the question of race comes into play, there's probably just one outcome. Um, you know, he knows it from his own personal history, from what has happened to him, to his coat, um, and there was really nothing compared with this. So it's just a terrible scenario. Um, the endpoint of what she can already see and that's why he's behaving in this particular way. Um, but this is also a point, the kind of the division, the lightness or tone it and accomplish involuntary shrinking as well. And, and just just, um, just, just um, you know, just just kind of devastation that's kind of coming over, um, hide how it points to the doubleness of try talent.

Speaker 1:          20:05          Another thing is world. I'm talking about this as a slight digression, but thought that was really fairly emphatic about the two phases of Itel. Um, I think that sometimes we tend to see him too much as a victim, um, and certainly was hammered to him, um, and vices to think of him as just a victim of his neighbors violence, but fathers and felt it from beginning to end. The his two faced his face is this one go on and flabby. It is as though there were two phases, one imposed upon the other. Looking out from believe the Peo boss scouts rather by fringe agree here from behind the twin motionless glares or this battery goes down to the twin glares. Misbeck nickel until the earliest moment. We know that means coming off the children and reporters were taking a picture of him and they took a picture of him from the sign.

Speaker 1:          20:56          It looks like Satan, um, down to this moment. Um, when this lightness of tone is belied by the involuntary shrinking of his body, um, hide how it seems to be the meeting place for two contradictory impulses. Um, and so we can also say that, you know, metaphorically he is also the meeting place for the goodness of strangers and the brutality of your neighbors. He really is a kind of unresolved meeting place for those two cross Cameron's um, and so, but right now, right there, um, he's trying his best to trivialize that event right in and say that it really is nothing at RBS is of no consequence. Um, we'll, we'll get one coming now to Bali, the waitress, we look at one instance, another instance of someone trying to trivialize that that fact the possibility that joke would be black. So this is the two of them lying, lying in bed.

Speaker 1:          21:58          Um, and he makes this confession. I got some negative [inaudible] then she'd be publicly still with the different stillness. The heat in our seem to notice it. He laid peacefully to his hands, low up and down and flat. You're what you said? I think I got some negative blood on his hands. His eyes would close his hands go and see thing. I don't know. I believe I have, she did not move. She said the ones you're lying. Alright. He said not moving his hand, not seizing. I don't believe that who voice said in the darkness. Um, so you know, I think that the Foglight is going out of his way to make this a very peaceful scenario. So this is the equivalent of their likeness of tone that hide how has using, when he's facing the possibility, the joke prisoners is black and here Joe, Mrs Making that concession itself but really doesn't know.

Speaker 1:          23:03          Um, but all in emphasis here is on how peaceful the stain is. Just stroking her. He doesn't stop when he makes that confession. So it's as if nothing is happening. It wants to create the illusion that nothing is happening, but actually everything is happening, right? So the waitress bobbies reaction goes along with the pretense that this was really nothing she can completely, she's not going to believe in it. There's nothing to it. Um, but we also know that, that that takes a lot of willpower, that, that assertion. I don't believe it. Others not into it. You're just imagining it, all those statements as they take a lot of willpower to say and how official that the surgeon is becomes clear when something else happens. Um, and then body uses the word nigger at one more time. This time in a completely different tone of voice is, um, there's, there's much later when Joe has killed within his, killed his first foster father in the kitchen accidentally.

Speaker 1:          24:17          Um, and now he's going to see body one more time and now they know that they have to leave, that they're in big trouble. Um, so this is a moment of duress. The equivalent of the dietitians duress, the equivalent of Joe Brown's duress. And this is what body says under duress. It was very much like it had been in the schoolhouse. Someone holding her as she struggled and Sri for hair, wild who the joking and passing the phase, even her mouth and contrast their hair as still as a bad mouth in a death face pastor's son of a bitch getting made into a jam that always truly you like a white man, a white man. Perhaps John did not hear or not a screaming waitress. He told me himself he was nigger the son of a bitch. Me F worth for nothing. The negatives and the verbage that would get me in a jam with club Harper police.

Speaker 1:          25:18          Um, so this is um, this is not by design, it is involuntary usage, but it is to Helen that that's the word that all of us or at least every single one, every single character in light in August, which for that is the word that would come in voluntarily into our mouths when we are under duress. Um, it also says that no matter what good intentions we have or how much willpower we hope to bring to bear on a racialized situation, that that will power is always going to be an equal to the terrible wait semantic weight that comes with that words that every individual effort to lighten or trivialize that appetite area town to make light of it. It's going to fail. There's as Polly and now than possible meaning for worldwide in artists that this is an town of various people to make light of the phenomenon of race and are succeeding.

Speaker 1:          26:29          Um, so, um, this, um, the Bobby is, is in that sense not even, uh, especially interesting character on their own other than, um, as a kind of a dramatize and concentrated version of the suit, the involuntary reactions and involuntary usage of that word when we are ourselves under the rest, um, below these are really quite marginal, thicker hide. How isn't um, isn't all that marginal. But, um, he, uh, his reaction is in many ways is an entry point into his psychology, but there's one person for whom the word nigger is front and center. And, and in many ways, um, she is more extreme to be a generalized case. So, um, faculty uses join of burden, um, as a fairly atypical case of thinking for emotional response to the word nigger. Um, that is in many ways on the far end of the spectrum. The nonetheless refers on the medium on me and have that spectrum.

Speaker 1:          27:41          Um, but she has this very extreme notion of what the word nigger mean is, which is that it is an eternal curse. Um, and the context of which is the death of her grandfather and her half brother Calvin. Okay. So her grandfather and her half brother Calvin were killed by a white person. They were killed by, to torrid. So there's no forget that they will not kill by black girls and they were killed by way person. But this is the account that Joanne or with Gif of the reason why the two of them are killed. Oh, this is what her father says to her. Your grandfather and brother aligned. They're murdered now by one white man, but by the curse, which got put on the whole race before your grandfather or your brother or me or you ever thought of race, Dune and cause to be forever and ever a part of the weight reasons do and curse for us since remember that his doom and his clothes forever and never mind your mother's yours.

Speaker 1:          28:55          Even though you are a child, the curves of every white child that was born and that ever will be born now can escape it. This is about as thorough going occurs as could be. It's basically comprehensive cover all the bases covers every single member of the white race and it goes on for an eternity that occurs when there were go away. So why is it that when two white people are killed by another white person, that that is the case of the coast of the black race. That is a really interesting bit of logic, but um, doing his father and is firmly convinced that that is the case, that if they had not been blacks in this world, um, [inaudible] is true if they had not been blessing. And as well, the rand father and Calvin would not have been killed pastor Torres. So even though it seems like a strange kind of logic once you spell it out in that way, actually it is a strange when as truthful statement I think.

Speaker 1:          30:01          Um, and this was how Joanna Russ interpretation of that statement elaboration, um, on that image of eternal, of raised as an internal occurs on the bladder obviously, but also on the waste as well. And given her fathers with her father says [inaudible] uh, this is what she herself things. But after that I seen to see them relax for the first time, not as people but as a thing, a shallow in which I live, we lived or when people are other people. I've thought of all the children coming forever and never and into the world wait with the blast, shallow already falling upon them before they air to breath. And I seem to see the black shadow in the shape of a cross and they seemed like the white babies were struggling even before the two Braf to escape from the shower who was not only upon them but being leave them to flung up like the arms were flung up as if they were nailed to the cross.

Speaker 1:          31:09          I saw all of the little babies than would ever be in the world. The ones not yet even born a long line of them with upon spread on the black cross. So this is a modern interpretation of Christopher sick of, of, of the reason and high res being crucified. And it turns out that according to join her and her father, that the dynamics of race and the legacy of slavery is such that wise will be crucified apart the black cross for, for as long as they live for as long as they are human beings on earth. Susan extravagant claim. Um, but, um, and it's predicated on the notion, um, then in some sense, this is summary of our, that we're seeing so far, which is that the ratio appetite is in fact and habitat that offers which for him voluntarily when we are under arrest, right?

Speaker 1:          32:22          So it's almost a kind of psychological necessity for us to call someone the whack, um, that of us as human beings. And because our hours are under duress so much of the time, there's just no way to have weighing in uninjured as some of the time, uh, because they're such good chances for all of us to be under different. Yes. They also good chances for all of us to call someone back. Right? We're just need to, to make that kind of attribution, um, to someone. Um, and it's because of that basic human psychological need that the relations between the races so called races, even though the membership of each one, there's always going to be in flood, but the relation between the simple certain races, that relation is always going to be fraught, always going to be terrible relation. Um, and that's why according to Joe Hannah, the is not just as black shadow falling on white babies, but she actually go so far as to say that that shadow is underneath them as well.

Speaker 1:          33:33          It is an incredibly detailed all encompassing black challenge basically envelops. Everyone is on top of you, is underneath view, your arms has flung out and the follows the con, you know, the shape of your arms basically completely envelops every image of you. Um, there's no escape from that black coast. So this is a really incredible claim. Um, and I think that it's helpful in order to contextualize their claim to think about the burden genealogy. So this is, um, another, you know, this unsure father with the objective is kind of schematic, um, uh, summary. But this is what we have, um, that it starts off the Berlin genealogies does have for someone called the [inaudible] Burlington. It's changed to burden, uh, by Calvin burden, who has a Huguenot quit Protestant white from friends. Um, and then, um, Nathaniel burden to and his father with two ways, uh, the Mexican wife, um, or Joanna and why from New Hampshire who is joining this actual mother.

Speaker 1:          34:45          And then in Kelvin burden, his son, um, first son kill, buys a Torres around the grandfather and then a book. And so this is their, um, put in genealogy and we'll see that, um, two names are being repeated twice, right? So the name, the Fangio appears twice and they, Calvin appears twice. Definitely foreign of loves to play with names. So this is another instance of the non trivial play with names because we all know who Calvin is and he is everything to say about originally was thin and predestination. Um, John Calvin wreck, they're looking like someone who would make that kind of felt stigma about originals. Then, um, and this is his treaters, um, hell than institutes of the Christian division. Um, and this is what he says about original sin. Original sin therefore seems to be a hereditary depravity and corruption of our nature diffused into all the possible.

Speaker 1:          35:55          There's so push first makes us liable to cause. So it doesn't really actually take the reprehensible action of anyone for us to be liable to cause rough, um, that Ashley, we inherit them then pull. The thing is that it is hereditary. It is passed on from one generation to another without the full vision of a person upon which is visited and, uh, without even necessarily and the reprehensible action on the poet on whom a dad original sin it's visited. It simply, it's something that is passed on automatically from one generation to another. So this, um, this long standing tradition of thinking about an evil that we can escape, um, that we're just in, in voluntarily signed up, you know, onto the school legacy of evil and punishment of course. Um, and so this was one I would say, you know, this is Joanna's genealogy and this was also partly Faulkner's genealogy as well.

Speaker 1:          37:08          He's, when the sailing is a calendars based on very, very interesting, um, in this kind of thinking, of course that is transmitted across time, across generations. Um, but there's another party to this genealogy, um, that Daniel Hawthorne, we're rarely have seen how important Hawthorne is. And it turns out it really is the figure and was of longstanding relevance to fatten her up. So the hearth on Faulkner connection. Uh, we know that in the scholar leather, there's the revenant dems there of who convinced the devil tree with Hesta print. Um, and as a laid iron, just a reverence Whitfield who commits adultery with adding so that with feel, oh, and with your Ashlyn making a speech that sounds almost like themselves, a speech at the end of the sky, never. And, um, then we in light and artist named Nathaniel this resurrected one more time, it's almost as if fabulous just paying this kind of the, this lovely tribute to an author who's been very, very important to him.

Speaker 1:          38:16          Um, and so, um, given the fact that, um, that, that, that, that the whole, that connection is actually a connection, um, by way of the skull. The other, um, which is in some sense a novel, not just about sin, some kind of sin in passing, um, that nobody that, you know, demonstrate was only can shake off and maybe has drew can shake off either the sin that will stick to you and follow you wherever you go. Um, is not really just about that, but there's also about sexual depravity or sexual license to some extent, even though that is not representative at all, um, in the scout weather and not really represented in any ddos in both those novels, in both the scarlet letter and as I lay dying, um, the sexual licenses on the gesture that we know, the outcome of that, uh, of that elicit sexuality in the sense that we see has to a village of a dog pull in the sky letter and we see addys it legitimate son Joel, uh, in this also connection between Pearl and jewel as well.

Speaker 1:          39:33          Um, we see has to, as we see at is a legitimate son, Jude in SLA done. But in both those novels, um, the social license is not really represented, is not part of the novel in um, the light in August after we, um, we do see that sexual license front and center. Um, and what makes this even more complicated is that is mapped onto the platform of ways. So it is weird combination of uh, uh, believe in Calvin is original sin, comfortable with sexual wireless on their part of Joanne, that burden. Um, and that is when the word new row comes out. This is yet another device, sashes context for the use of the word Negro now. And then she put the Tris beneath so much rumps our grounds where he would find her a negative or with her clothing, have time to ribbons upon her in the whilst froze with an inflammation mania and Barney gleaming in the slow shifting from one to another of such informally you're writing attitudes and gestures as a Beardsley of the time of petroleum.

Speaker 1:          40:56          My hair dryer, she would be wild in the close feeling half dark without was with her wild here. And each strand of which we seem to come alive. Like October's tentacles, wow. Pant who really Negro, the Negro. So it might seem in comprehensible than someone like John and let her spends all the time trying to help blacks in the south who would is on a board of a dozen, uh, charities and schools. Black schools are basically if dedicated and her entire life to racial uplift should be doing this. Um, but I think that it actually is, I think as far as far as concern, this incredible sexual license actually goes hand in hand with a belief in Calvinist predestination, right? If you really believe that you are going to be stuck with the originals, then that that is going to be upon you, that black shadow is going to be upon you no matter what you do, then it really doesn't matter what you do is aware kind of of, of, of granting of lies.

Speaker 1:          42:05          And is that, you know, if all this, if you're going to be evil anyway, no matter what you do, that you might as well actually be evil and your conduct as well. Uh, it's something of that logic. Uh, but I don't even think that this is as large and complex that they, there's just for, is just the two sides, um, of Joanna. Um, and maybe that just as high tower has two phases. Joanna clearly has two phases and the whole tradition, the Calvinist tradition also has two phases. Um, and, and that is really foreclose a contribution to thinking about this particular card, uh, theology. Um, but what we also know that this is, that thought my tenants to stick in all kinds of weird details, um, into this. Otherwise, you know, kind of, um, just kind of food rest, um, description of centralizing some, the hydro, he also has kind of, we're kind of references to two other traditions.

Speaker 1:          43:07          One is, um, be late and the other is patrolling areas. So, um, this is be as laid, the famous illustrator [inaudible]. Um, there's a Salamay, um, showing human beings in this kind of very erotic and wow gestures. Um, there's, uh, another illustration for Oscar was, so, I mean, and, um, a full portfolios. Um, it, um, this is, uh, actually, uh, not quite a novel, sort of a beginning of a novel. Um, is about to, um, Petrolia is the writer as Taryn can. Um, it, the reason that is related to, um, to the Falkland novels of them, um, is that, especially in light in August, is that this novel early novel is about to foreigners with Greek sounding names and Coby is and gets in, in southern Italy, right? So this is the first instance of northerners going south and quite Yankees going themselves. And as I said, a bit but similar dynamics.

Speaker 1:          44:19          Um, and Joanna knows that and her father and the whole family knows that they're headed as Yankees and Cabo back business we've seen last time. So the whole dynamics of people from one region going south and being hated by the logos. Um, but in this case, there's this additional complication that this is a very coal, no going to the heart itself. And in some instances being heated up by that, uh, tropical environment, uh, but basically staying cold at heart. So this is, uh, the pendulum swing of Joanna from that incredible sexualizes to the other side. And she also, interestingly enough, she also uses the word Negro in that context. When she swings to the other side, she was sitting place still on the bed. Her hands on her land is still New England phase. It was still the face of a spinster prominently bond long, a little thin, almost men like in contrast to it who Lombardi was more originally in softly and more than ever though she said at home using detach, impose a full measure even to a bastard child.

Speaker 1:          45:46          I would like to see fathers in faces. Um, the sentence I think is really interesting that what is in the parenthesis, the still face, it has been in store and then the animal body. Um, and kind of perfect summary of the two size of Joanna. Um, and there's even for five new very ungainly syntax of deliberate syntax. Um, and then the last part of that, um, the Bastard Negro child and it is not accidental that there's, is the moment the Salish is invoking Calvin, I would like to see farther than it was fairs. And Calvin's Faitas is almost as if this is the Neil, the 20th century, in addition to the scar, that level in a new 20th century addition to long standing theology of cal. And the, this is what happened when you, when you, when you inherit from those two traditions, um, is that you both do good by, um, you know, by supposedly helping, uh, blogs.

Speaker 1:          46:50          But then you also, um, engage in this, uh, uncontrollable sexual orgy with that. Um, and the, the, the, the, um, the best and Negro child is, is, is this kind of also involuntary outcome of the Union of those two sides. Um, so, you know, as sort of easy to, it's the wild. Joanna is not going to be an easy person for German prisoners to deal with regularly. I, anyone, uh, with have hard time trying to negotiate, trying to deal with someone like that. Um, and Joe Christmases responds is lack this. Um, at this point in either wanted to go to school once in to study law with a black lawyer and wants to turn over all the lens of all the money that she has in. It's quite, it's not insignificant. Um, [inaudible] that all the money to him, and this is his response to school. His mouth said a negative school.

Speaker 1:          48:00          Me, yes, that you can go to Memphis, you can read them, bought in people's office. He would teach you long and about a lot in the office with a neighbor, lawyer. His mouth said yes. Then I would turn over all the business to you, all the money of it so that when you need money for yourself, you could, you will know how lawyers know how to do it. So he would be helping them out of darkness and number accused of loving you even if they found out. But a nigger in college and niggers lawyer, his voice had quiet, not even argumentative, just prompted there. We're not looking at one another and she had not looked up since he entered. Tell them, tell them niggers to them and they go it to, um, incident. Essentially, this is a moment when Joanna is boat, completely tone deaf.

Speaker 1:          48:52          Um, but also, uh, just really sad, you know, just incredibly sad person that, um, this is the best that she can do for him to choose to, a little embarrassed to. She's offered a bribe him as well, just trying to say, you know, I'm going to turn over all the money to you. Um, and it really doesn't matter if you study along, you know, the way how to use the money for, you know, for your own pleasure really. She's can really spread, goes up to say that word, but that's about as she wants to do the most for him. And she would not admit to it, she would not name what she's turning over to them. So all that your lips or the of those unfinished sentences, she was both tone deaf and bill also actually at the maximum point of, of goodwill and love, maybe even towards him wanting to do the most fan and his way of responding is, but being too holy.

Speaker 1:          49:50          Ironic about the work in there. So I think that the least and have the, about her as well. Um, so I think that we can say that when the word Nigger, um, is used in that context, it's also a moment of psychological, the rest. And maybe he just even can bear to knowledge the fact that she actually wants to do so much for him. You know, I think that that would be one way to read that that is actually not, um, a moment when there's no love fellow that, you know, that, that, that, that is, that romance is over, is not that, but then maybe it's too much. And that the way the key is responding to that is by being told is cynical, is a terrible in their eye about the whole thing. So the state is really open to any number of readings. Um, all we know that it is definitely not an innocent word when it's used by oneself that is asked which hodge, um, and is painful to use as when there's a tribute to oneself.
