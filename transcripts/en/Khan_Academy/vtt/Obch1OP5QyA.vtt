00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:01.956
Voiceover:Rewrite the following

00:00:01.956 --> 00:00:03.892
equation in logarithmic form.

00:00:03.892 --> 00:00:07.011
So they wrote 100 is equal to 10

00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:08.888
to the second power.

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:10.460
So if we wanna write the same

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.700
information, really, in logarithmic form,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.510
we could say that the power that I need

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.580
to raise 10 to to get
to 100 is equal to 2,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:33.627
or log base 10 of 100 is equal to 2.

00:00:33.627 --> 00:00:35.155
Notice these are equivalent statements.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:36.699
This is just in exponential form.

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.204
This is is logarithmic form.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.812
This is saying that the power I need

00:00:39.812 --> 00:00:43.099
to raise 10 to to get
to 100 is equal to 2.

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:44.304
Which is the same thing as saying

00:00:44.304 --> 00:00:46.757
that 10 to the 2nd power is 100.

00:00:46.757 --> 00:00:49.140
10 to the second power is 100.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.599
And the way that I specify the base

00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:52.367
is by doing this
underscore right over here.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.951
So underscore 10, log base 10 of 100

00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:56.528
is equal to 2.

00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:59.376
Here they ask us to rewrite the following

00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:01.598
equation in exponential form.

00:01:01.598 --> 00:01:04.447
So this is log base 5 of 1 over 125

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:06.168
is equal to negative 3.

00:01:06.168 --> 00:01:08.207
This is one way to
think about it is saying

00:01:08.207 --> 00:01:09.840
the power that I need to raise 5

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.472
to to get to 1 over 125
is equal to negative 3

00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:22.240
or that 5 to the negative 3 power is

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.496
equal to 1 over 125.

00:01:25.496 --> 00:01:27.583
And we can verify that this has formatted

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:28.263
it the right way.

00:01:28.263 --> 00:01:30.729
5 to the negative 3 power is 1 over 125.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.855
The exact same truth about the universe,

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:35.152
just in different forms.

00:01:35.152 --> 00:01:37.743
Logarithmic form and exponential form.

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:39.096
So let me check my answer

00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:40.032
and make sure I got it right.

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.610
And I did.
