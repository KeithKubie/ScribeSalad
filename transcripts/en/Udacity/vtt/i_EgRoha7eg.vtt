00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.570
The first order of business in this
level is downloading the course code and

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.400
ensuring your development
environment is up and running.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.890
Next, we'll learn how Live GDX gives
you access to some of the important

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.680
capabilities of whatever platform your
game is running on, including logging,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.260
graphics and file access.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.550
Then, we'll learn all about
drawing sprites and textures and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.610
the differences between those two terms.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.030
We'll also learn a few tricks,

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.370
such as creating a stretchy
sprite called a nine-patch.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.470
And combining multiple
sprites into animations.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.640
Finally, a big game with a lot of
sprites can run into problems trying to

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.400
load a ton of different files.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.880
So, we'll learn how to pack all of
our sprites into a giant image called

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.760
a texture atlas that we
can load all at once.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.460
But first, the course code.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.090
Let's go get it.
