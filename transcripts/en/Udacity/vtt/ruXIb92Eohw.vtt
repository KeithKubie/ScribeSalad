00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.106
So yeah, as far as

00:00:01.106 --> 00:00:01.637
[UNKNOWN]

00:00:01.637 --> 00:00:05.471
go, one thing that, again, with the computer game, you can do, your, your final

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:11.366
goal is whatever is on the screen. It's just a pretty picture, basically. you

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:16.640
can do anything you want with materials or lighting and so on. how AutoCAD, can

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.364
you contrast and compare as far as materials and lighting and so on andwhat,

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:22.550
how does that work in that?

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.326
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a lot of that varies on customer because there's still a lot of work that's

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:30.102
being done in 2D with lines and not necessarily a realistic view of, of what's

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:36.364
going on. But the precision is still required. We, we had one customer that use

00:00:36.364 --> 00:00:39.727
to print out boat hole designs at full scale, and then use, use that to

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:42.845
actually build his boat holes.

00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:43.897
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:43.897 --> 00:00:44.261
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:47.693
So it really varies when, when you're dealing with somebody who is working more

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:52.526
in, in a 3D environment, then, again, there are different levels. Sometimes you

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:55.646
want just sort of conceptual look for your design that you are going to present

00:00:55.646 --> 00:01:00.350
to a client to show them what it is you want to build. But then, at some point

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.197
you want to get a realistic fully rendered ray traced image, so we need to be

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:07.532
able to support that level also. So, it's really is a great variety of

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:10.586
visualizations that are required in the CAD product.
