00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.290
All of these examples, except the first one,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.550
would represent aneuploidy. The first one is exactly

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.910
how many chromosomes we have in our cells

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.310
normally, 46. All the other ones have one

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.370
more or less chromosome. It doesn't matter whether

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.760
it's an autosome or a sex chromosome, or

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.300
the combination. Three of chromosome 21 is referred

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.570
to as Down's Syndrome or trisomy 21. 45 chromosomes

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.000
total, just one X and no Y, X 0, is called Turner syndrome.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.830
And 47 chromosomes, we have two Xs and one Y, is called Klinefelter syndrome.
