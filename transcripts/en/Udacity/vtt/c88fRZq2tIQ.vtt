00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.130
A should be here and here. If the variabilities of each sample were smaller,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.330
then it's more likely that the population means would be significantly

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.480
different. But since the variabilities are large, then it looks like the null

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.735
hypothesis would be true. And in this case, the between-group variability is

00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:24.747
small. Which results in a smaller f statistic, in which case we would accept

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:29.922
the null. This one though, thought within group variability is small, and the

00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:36.290
between group variability is large relative to that. This is b. And here it

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.700
looks like the population means from one and two would not be significantly

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.630
different But 3 would be from both 1 and 2, that's d.
