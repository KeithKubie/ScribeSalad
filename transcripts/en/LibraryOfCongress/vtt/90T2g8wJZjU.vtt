00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress,
in Washington, DC.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.970 position:59%
&gt;&gt; So today's session is on the
teaching the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.600 position:56%
Primary sources can engage students
in developing a deeper understanding

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.390
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and its historical context.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.460 position:73%
Education experts, that's Stacie Moats and Anne
Savage, will guide you in considering audience,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.220
context, point of view, when
identifying primary sources

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.530 position:64%
to teach about the Civil Rights Movement.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.550 position:58%
So joining us, we have 2 very
special guests, we have Stacie Moats.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.620
Stacie, since joining the Library
of Congress in January 2008,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.490
she has worked on various
educational initiatives.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.320 position:61%
She is the Education Specialist for the
Library's Interpretive Programs office,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.640 position:70%
which develops on-site and online exhibitions
showcasing the Library's collections.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.490 position:63%
She now manages all exhibition-related
educational programming, including tours

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.280 position:70%
and public programs for visitors of all ages.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.240
Joining Stacie is Anne Savage.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.950 position:69%
She is an Educational Resource Specialist at
the Library of Congress, and she specializes

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.160 position:75%
in developing and delivering professional
development content and materials for educators.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:35.220 position:75%
A proponent of Project Zero's Visible Thinking,
she has integrated thinking strategies into many

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.320
of the Library's primary
source-based PD offerings.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.100 position:56%
Before coming to the Library in
2005, she was an elementary teacher,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.620 position:63%
and school-based technology
specialists in Fairfax County, Virginia.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.010
So without further ado, I'd like to
turn things over to Stacie Moats.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.300
Stacie.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.860
&gt;&gt; Well, it is really nice
to virtually meet all of you.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.840
And I just want to make sure to
say that, please, as we go through,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.530 position:69%
I'll be asking for your feedback, of course,
and please continue the conversation thread

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.090 position:56%
as we go through the various slides.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.800 position:63%
I won't be able to comment, of course,
on everything that folks are putting in,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.370
but we will have time for
question-and-answer at the end.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.330 position:67%
Okay, so you may be surprised to learn that
the Library develops exhibitions visited

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.810 position:63%
by more than 1 million people each year.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.700 position:64%
I'd like you to imagine for a minute that
you're planning to visit the Library here

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.510 position:64%
in Washington, DC, and just looking at
this graphic and title for an exhibition,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.190 position:56%
what would you expect to experience?

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.830 position:67%
And again, feel free to share your answers,
your responses in the chat box, please.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:03:01.110 position:72%
Photos, newspaper articles, videos, Tony says,
correspondence, demonstration posters, right,

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.130
personal accounts, it's all
different kinds of primary sources.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.820
LBJ, speeches by LBJ.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:26.960 position:63%
Any other individuals that come to mind?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.740
O'Connor. Okay, well, I wanted
to share with you a few photos

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.590 position:72%
that are taken directly inside the exhibition.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.020 position:61%
And as you all picked up on on display,
we have original primary sources

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.900 position:58%
that have witnessed history, whether
it's manuscripts, photographs, music,

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.200
film, and even a large 3-D object.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.950 position:63%
This is the actual flag flown by the
National Association for the Advancement

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.870 position:56%
of Colored People, or NAACP, as part
of its 1920 anti-lynching campaign.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.490 position:70%
And for this exhibition, Library
specialists carefully selected over 200 items

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.240 position:56%
and more than 70 audio-visual clips.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.150 position:69%
That sounds like a lot until you think about
the fact that they were taking selections,

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.700 position:61%
these primary resources, from more than
158 million items in our collections.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.590 position:58%
In the NAACP collection alone, I
believe there's over 3 million items,

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.980 position:66%
just to give you a sense of their project.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:33.550 position:70%
Now, this page from the online version of the
exhibition shows how in the online version

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.930 position:73%
as well, they present the primary and secondary
sources, that contextual information that goes

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.940 position:67%
with these manuscripts and everything else.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.370 position:69%
They present it chronologically in sections.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.060 position:66%
And is surprises a lot of visitors that
when they say a long struggle for freedom,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.230 position:70%
they really mean the long struggle for
freedom, starting with slavery in the 1600's,

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.530 position:67%
and continuing all the way through to the
impact of the Act in the 1960's and beyond.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.600 position:59%
And the selections for this exhibition
really highlight the story not only

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.140 position:66%
of this landmark civil rights legislation,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.580
but also base it within a
broader historical narrative.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.910 position:67%
And as teachers, in many ways, your process
of selecting primary sources for use

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:18.610 position:69%
with students is similar to that of a
specialist curating exhibition for visitors.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.880
And I'd like to take just a moment
to share what factors you consider

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:35.060 position:75%
when selecting primary sources, whether
teaching about civil rights or any topic really.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.910
Okay, reading level.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.620
Anne says age of student.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:47.040
Right, whether or not the primary
sources are engaging themselves.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.510 position:56%
Practicality, Sara says, good point.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:56.100 position:75%
And again, feel free to continue responding to
this question and going forward with the thread.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.430
But I'd just like to briefly
consider four key factors.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.410
First, audience.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.250 position:70%
For instance, is the content age-appropriate?

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.100
Would it draw my students
in for closer examination,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.340 position:61%
for questioning, further investigation?

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.900
Context, is there useful
videographic information available,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.980
especially about the source
or the publication date.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:29.730 position:70%
And within the item itself, will my
students be able to pick up contextual clues?

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.120
Certainly was it created during
the time or topic under study?

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:39.410 position:61%
In other words, is it a primary source?

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:47.320 position:75%
Perspective, certainly will the students be able
to identify perspective, and also considering,

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.990
is the item's purpose or target
audience easy to identify?

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:56.510 position:73%
And of course, we'd also probably want to think
about things like are other items available

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:04.470
that represent multiple points
of view for use with the item?

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:11.030 position:69%
Logistics, easy to skip over but certainly
important for us as teachers to think about.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.750 position:69%
So for a photograph, how clear is the image?

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.700
For a manuscript, will my
students be able to read the text?

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:23.180 position:67%
And things like certainly the copyright,
the right status, am I able to print copies

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:27.900 position:70%
or display the items for use in my classroom?

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:34.610 position:66%
Even before we begin the selection process
though for primary sources whether, again,

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.520 position:67%
about civil rights or any topic, of course,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.910
we're going to think about
our instructional use.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:45.080 position:70%
And as a teacher, you may have an essentially
question for a unit, in much the same way

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:57.230 position:56%
that a curator uses a big idea to
connect everything in an exhibition.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:03.900 position:64%
So before we look at a primary source
from the exhibition to start our practice

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.090 position:69%
of these selection factors, I just want to
add one more really important consideration.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:13.690 position:69%
When focusing on civil rights and addressing
related issues that race and social justice,

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.590
in my experience, it's essential
to reflect on your own identity.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.440
And so I've included a link here to
the website of teaching tolerance,

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.380 position:70%
a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.080 position:73%
They offer many free resources for learning how

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.700 position:61%
to effectively approach self-reflective
practice on identity.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.990 position:70%
So I just wanted to include that since we
won't have time to go in depth on that topic.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.820
Now, let's go ahead and apply
all these considerations

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.890
to an imaginary teaching scenario.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:09:06.040 position:70%
I'll give you some time to read this through.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:11.160 position:73%
Okay, and we're going to be considering an item
from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 exhibition.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.980
And again, keep in mind that we're
using this to introduce the unit,

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.090 position:69%
to spark interests, inspire student inquiry.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:21.160 position:58%
And it's been decided that your
students do not need prior knowledge.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:10:00.050 position:63%
And I'm going to show the item, and give
you about 30 seconds to look closely.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:05.480 position:59%
Okay, and to help inform our selection
process, certainly we would want

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.330 position:63%
to take a look at secondary information.

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.580
And here you have the text labeled,
the secondary source information,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:15.140 position:67%
that's displayed along with this photograph
in the online version of the exhibition.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:53.330 position:63%
So again, I'm going to give you a little
time to read through this labeled text.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:59.240 position:73%
Okay, and I wanted to point to as well that for
this particular item in the online exhibition,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.170
when you're live on the website
and you click that link,

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:05.940
it does take you to the items
in the graphic record.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.030 position:72%
Not available for everything, but for this
particular item it is, which is great because,

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:14.300
you know, right there you have some
important details also available

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.090 position:56%
to help with your selection process.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.800
So going back to our scenario,
and thinking about this

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:27.310 position:75%
for a seventh grade social studies class, again,
this is introducing the units and thinking

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:32.120 position:59%
about our essential question, would
we use this particular primary source?

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.690
Why or why not?

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.600 position:70%
And I would love to hear from all of you,
please type in your responses, your thoughts.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:45.920 position:70%
Thinking again about those factors of
audience, of perspective, context, logistics.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:05.870 position:61%
I hear, yes, because it got me thinking
about who flew that flag and why.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:11.970 position:58%
Rob notes, they need to know lynching
means, there's no prior knowledge.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.010
Sara writes, it's a powerful image.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.660
Students may be intrigued
as to why, when, who, what.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.170 position:72%
So again, which someone had mentioned earlier,
this idea of the hook to draw students

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.130 position:70%
into this topic of civil rights for our unit.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:40.060 position:64%
Mary notes that it is a simple
statement but still a question generator.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:53.710 position:72%
Okay, provocative image to generate questions.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.810
So I'm hearing from most folks that
this sounds like or this appears

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:02.880 position:69%
to be an item that you would consider using.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:09.530 position:64%
I can tell you that from taking students
of different ages through the exhibition,

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:14.580 position:58%
I have the other benefit of having to
flag itself, which is just enormous.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.050 position:58%
It's I believe six feet by nine feet.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:20.590
And so kind of impossible to miss.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.850
And in many cases, I have
the students, you know,

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:31.430 position:70%
especially since many don't have the prior
knowledge, talk with me about what they think

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:36.320 position:70%
that term lynched means and kind of taking
from their responses what they know and using

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.910 position:59%
that to guide my discussion with them,
depending on what's age-appropriate.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:45.310 position:66%
And also it's been a wonderful way to talk
with students to make those connections

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.350 position:64%
that are so important to their own lives.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:51.810 position:69%
Some of the students will say, for instance,
that, you know, they hadn't really thought

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:55.430
about the fact that in this time
period in American history, again,

00:13:55.430 --> 00:14:00.650 position:72%
thinking about the historic context, that, you
know, how else are they going to get the word

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:07.680
out about this violence and how
are they going to spread the word?

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.530 position:61%
And making some interesting comparisons
to what's happening in the news today,

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:17.280 position:61%
and how people use social media, for
instance, now to get their message out.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:24.240
And I see Rob has noticed a detail
here about the juxtaposition

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:33.290 position:61%
of the American flag in the background.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:36.490
Okay, so let's practice the
selection process again

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.890 position:75%
but this time thinking about your own classroom.

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:45.140 position:59%
We'll still keep with the timing, this
is going to be for an intro to a unit,

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.190
and our central question, how have
groups and individuals advocated

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.470
for their own freedom and equality.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:55.640
And again, thinking about whether
you would use this primary source

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.020 position:59%
in your classroom, and why or why not.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:07.080
Okay, so again, I'm going
to give you some time here,

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:37.210 position:72%
about 30 seconds, to really look at this item.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:43.230 position:64%
Okay, I'm going to now again give you
the text information that goes with this.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:49.640 position:69%
This is again the label, and in our online
exhibition, it's paired there with the item.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:16:31.040
So again, about 30 seconds just
to go ahead and read this through.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.170 position:75%
Okay, so again, reflecting on your own teaching,

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:40.210
if you could share what you
think about using this.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:17:00.040
Would you use it in your
classroom, why or why not?

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.210 position:59%
Rob comments that, yes, it covers your
historical significance succinctly,

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:08.930
also brings up the mass movement
and role of churches.

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:15.330 position:59%
So expanding students' understanding
from the beginning about the movement.

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:22.480 position:70%
Karen adds, yes, it shows the importance of
religion and the power of women speaking out.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.700 position:72%
Erin's noting that she's an identifiable
figure so it offers a connection for students.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:32.680 position:75%
And I'd like to comment on that, in that, before
entering the exhibition, much like I asked all

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.670 position:69%
of you to tell me what you expected to see
in this Civil Rights Act of 1964 exhibition,

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.820 position:64%
a lot of students when I asked what comes
to mind when they think of civil rights,

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:45.210
not surprisingly, you know,
Rosa Parks, Dr. King,

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.220 position:73%
some of the more familiar figures come to mind.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:52.870 position:67%
However, what they know about them tends
to be pretty limited in terms of, you know,

00:17:52.870 --> 00:18:00.090 position:56%
not going deep into their commitment
to advocacy or their personal lives.

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:05.480
Okay, I'm seeing many more
wonderful comments here.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:12.710
Questions about the fact that
it would humanize Rosa Parks,

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.880 position:73%
that demonstrates her role as a public speaker.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:20.860
Might be interesting to compare
her to activists today.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:26.210 position:70%
I love good music, that's a great that you
noticed there, and I'm going to forward ahead

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.630
so that we can go back to
looking at the item itself.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:36.870 position:56%
And again, Mary's comment about Rosa
Parks and her long-term commitment

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:43.740 position:59%
to the civil rights movement, not
just that one arrest that we think of,

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:50.170 position:63%
but truly this commitment to the
movement and her role in it as a leader.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.250 position:61%
Great, thank you all for your comments.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:04.150 position:63%
And again, I'd just like to return to my
experience guiding visitors of all ages

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.250 position:63%
and backgrounds through this exhibition.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:11.160 position:59%
And I chose these items for us to look
at because they have both proven to be

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:17.060 position:59%
so extremely powerful in talking about
not only the Civil Rights Act of 1964

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:22.150 position:59%
and the many individuals and groups
who contributed along the way to reach

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:31.180 position:73%
that landmark moment in US civil rights
legislation, but it's just been really powerful

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:35.080
to see how, for instance, the
flag expands their understanding

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:41.730 position:69%
of the civil rights movement going back, you
know, in this case with the flag, decades.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:48.930 position:69%
But again, further in the exhibition, back
to truly even before this country had begun.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:52.930
And then with one like this
item, this flyer, just again,

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:58.600 position:63%
expanding on some of these more familiar
figures and deepening our knowledge.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:10.240 position:70%
So just to reflect again on your own
teaching, what kinds of resources do you use?

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:15.030 position:66%
What do you think would help your students
develop a more complete understanding?

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:18.990 position:66%
Because again, in this case, we were
selecting primary sources that we use just

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:24.190
to introduce a unit, but certainly
having that contextual information

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:30.610 position:73%
and having additional primary sources with
multiple points of view, that help explain some

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.390
of that context, are all valuable.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:44.070
And I just would love to hear
from you about your own teaching.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:48.530 position:66%
Anne writes, oral histories, and in just
a moment here, we'll show how to find some

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.950
of the other resources available
from the Library's website,

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:57.150 position:59%
but certainly the Civil Rights History
Project is a fantastic resource

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:00.120
for oral histories relating
to the civil rights movement.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.160
Videos and lesson notes.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.650
Videos that show the history.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:06.890 position:67%
Debra's talking about her love for teaching

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.110
of primary sources especially
with objects and oral histories.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.860
That you, Debra.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.710 position:73%
The music is also another fantastic connection.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:28.050 position:73%
A lot of students, you know, depending on their
own interests, whether it's music or drawing,

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:32.960 position:75%
they get really pulled into some of the
recordings available from the Library's website,

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:41.080 position:70%
as well as some of the drafts or whether it's
a writing or incredible political cartoons,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.990 position:72%
for instance, that we have in the collections.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:53.050 position:64%
Ronnie mentions signs, and there is in
fact a sign from the Jim Crow era that is

00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:56.000 position:73%
in the exhibition, and again, available online.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.630
So as you hopefully explore
later, the exhibition

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.600
and the many other exhibitions
we have relating to this topic,

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.830 position:67%
you will come across some fantastic pieces.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:15.950 position:69%
Okay, so because I know we're short on time,
I'm going to just very briefly mention how

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.880 position:63%
to find the exhibitions from the Library
of Congress, because it is, to me,

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.370 position:70%
something really wonderful that the Library
does, which is to make our entire exhibition,

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:29.780 position:70%
you know, whether that's the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, or any of the other more than 100

00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:33.920
that we have, current and past
exhibitions that are available,

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:38.620 position:56%
that go down to the object level
online for everyone to use for free.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.890
So here's how you find it
from the main page, LOC.GOV,

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:45.220 position:73%
you just type exhibitions into that search box.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:51.910 position:58%
And when you're in your browser, if
you continue there to this next page,

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.050 position:70%
it takes you to the search results, and
you'll find exhibitions, Library of Congress.

00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:02.980 position:73%
And when you click on that again in your
browser, you'll come to this, LOC.GOV/exhibits,

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:06.280 position:66%
which is the homepage for our exhibitions.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:12.380 position:73%
And you'll see, again, current exhibitions are
listed, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.800
And to the left side, you'll see
all exhibitions, as I mentioned,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:22.230
more than 100 that are available
to us on any number of topics.

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:29.660
Again, here is the homepage for
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.340 position:56%
And I just want to point very
briefly to the learn more page here,

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:38.700 position:75%
where we have brought together a variety of
resources related to teaching about civil rights

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.250 position:58%
from the Library of Congress website.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:42.190
You see related exhibitions.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:45.990 position:59%
And I just in particular want to point
out this free idea book for educators.

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:50.150
This was a collaboration between
the Library of Congress in history,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.930
and it has not only unique
primary sources from the library,

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:58.900 position:70%
but also many wonderful teaching ideas for
how to talk about different titles of the Act

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:02.130
and its importance to our history.

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:06.810 position:61%
So again, just to kind of wrap up my
session before turning it over to Anne,

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:13.140 position:61%
I just want to mention again that, when
you are teaching about civil rights,

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.030
it's so important to have not
only the primary sources but a lot

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:21.270 position:66%
of that background information, of course,
like anything you're teaching about.

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:25.230
And so, to me, what is so wonderful
about the online exhibitions is

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.990
that the work has been done
for you, and it has been done

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:30.550 position:63%
by experts from the Library of Congress.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:35.750 position:63%
They've selected topics, again, from
our millions of items in the collections

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.550 position:73%
and they've paired them with expert commentary.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:42.350
So the research is there ready
for you and your students to use.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:48.500
Okay, so -- and I just noticed
a question here about UL's.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.060 position:69%
these are online for perpetuity essentially.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.990 position:59%
So they have committed to having these
exhibitions available and they live

00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:00.430
on past the time that they're
here at the Library.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.910
Okay, with that, I'm going
to turn things over to Anne,

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:10.260 position:69%
and she's going to share some more resources
from the Library about civil rights.

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.520 position:63%
Okay, as Stacie said, I'm going to share

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.730
with you several additional
civil rights related resources

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.700 position:63%
that are available on the teachers page.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.680
I'm going to be stepping through
the paths you can use later

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.410 position:56%
to get to each resource on your own.

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:32.550 position:73%
But at the very end of this session, we're also
going to provide you a list of links to all

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:35.750 position:61%
of these Library of Congress resources.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:42.250 position:72%
As you see these resources, as we flip through
this brief tour that I'm going to give you,

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:50.470 position:70%
please go ahead and share any ideas you have
in the chat box about how you might use them,

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:55.490 position:64%
whether you -- if you see something you
have used in your classroom, let us know.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.700
Or perhaps some ideas or questions.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.350
So keep the chat going.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:08.560
And let's start by showing you
how to get to the teachers page.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.660
Here is the Library's homepage.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:19.700 position:64%
The easiest way to get to it is to scroll
down if you need to and click on the link

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:23.180
to teachers that you see circled.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:27.800 position:69%
Once you go to the teachers page, one of the
first things you're going to see is that up

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:36.030 position:73%
at the top, we have highlighted in our carousel
of special things we want you to notice first,

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:40.070
the idea book for educators
that Stacie talked about.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:49.050 position:73%
And this will take you to a downloadable online
version of powerful resource, as Stacie said.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:58.780 position:63%
Something else you're going to find on
the teachers page is a link to our blog.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:10.010 position:69%
And from this blog, you're going to find a
number of resources related to civil rights.

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:21.860 position:64%
First of all, if you type in Civil Rights
Act into the search box at the top,

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:28.570
you will be able to find a number
of blog posts about civil rights.

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.020
The first one is shown here.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:36.680
This is one of several blog posts
about the webinars that we had

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.620 position:61%
in partnership with Teaching Tolerance.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.290
Stacie mentioned this group.

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:47.610 position:67%
There are four webinars online for you to
view, and they're all very powerful, again,

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.480
with Teaching Tolerance, part of
the Southern Poverty Law Center.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.500 position:58%
And you can listen to the recordings.

00:27:53.500 --> 00:28:01.280
Secondly, you'll find a series of
blog posts on the Civil Rights Act.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:09.070 position:56%
And I'm actually going to put a link
here for you to this particular one,

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:15.620 position:58%
because this is the main blog post
the will point you to the other ones.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:22.330 position:75%
And this will help you help your students
immerse themselves in several important sections

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:27.920 position:72%
of the Civil Rights Act, where they can use
primary sources to explore the aspects of life

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.310
under legal segregation, that
the Act was meant to improve.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:36.340
For instance, voting, education,
freedom to work,

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:41.390 position:61%
and one that students can really relate
to, the right to go where you want.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:45.670
So check out these blog posts.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:54.680
Moving along, if you look up at the
left-hand side, there is a menu,

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.730
and the next thing we will
go to is classroom materials.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:04.300 position:66%
And once you click on classroom materials,
you're going to find primary source sets.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:10.150
If you scroll down through this
list of primary source sets,

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:13.780 position:61%
you will find two of special interests.

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:21.560 position:72%
And of course, for those of you new to primary
source sets, these are sets of primary sources

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:25.520 position:75%
that we have preselected on many popular topics.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.360 position:73%
They're ready for use by you and your students.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:35.220 position:69%
Let's take a look at one of them, the
NAACP, "A Century in the Fight for Freedom."

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.530 position:64%
Here is where you can immerse your
students in the story of America's oldest

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:45.290 position:70%
and largest civil rights organization, told
through letters, photographs, maps, and more.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:51.050 position:69%
First thing you'll notice, at the top of the
page is the teachers guide written for you.

00:29:51.050 --> 00:29:58.830 position:66%
And here is where you will find historical
context and teaching suggestions related

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:04.530
to the items below that are
in the primary source set.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:08.300
You'll also see a link to
analysis tool and teaching guides.

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.730
I'll mention a little bit
more about these in a moment.

00:30:10.730 --> 00:30:13.270
And then of course, the primary
sources themselves.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:17.510
So if you take a look, this
just shows ten out of the set.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:27.350 position:59%
And for each one, we include a link to
the item in the Library's collections.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:32.090
We include a link to the
bibliographic information.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:36.290 position:73%
And also for those items that are visual items,

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:40.590
we've created a printable
PDF, an 8 1/2 by 11 size.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:45.670 position:56%
So that you can use these items
either on your computer, in the lab,

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:51.440 position:66%
or print them out if you need to, whatever
your situation is in your classroom.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:59.170 position:75%
You'll also want to check out our other primary
source set that's related, and this is Jim Crow.

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:05.480
Which is also available in
interactive e-book format.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.060
Okay, let's go back to the
teachers page for just a moment.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.350
And if you notice, there's
another link we'd like to share

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:18.210 position:61%
with you, called using primary sources.

00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:26.580
On this page, you will find a
number of things up in the top.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:30.640
Why use primary sources, which
is the page we're on now.

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.620
Citing primary sources, copyright.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:38.270
Finding primary sources, and then
teachers guide and analysis tool.

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.760
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Kathy.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:45.360 position:69%
Anne's experiencing some technical issues
with her sound, so I'm going to step in here

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:49.210
and show you around the teachers
guide and analysis tool.

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:55.780 position:64%
Here you'll see all these are hyperlinked
as well, so if you click on the screen,

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:59.420 position:70%
it will take you right to the teachers guide.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.960 position:61%
We've develop these with subject matter
experts from the Library and talking

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.420
and developing the teachers guide.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.970 position:73%
So it helps you with question prompts as you're
working with students with specific types

00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:18.240 position:64%
of materials, you can use these to get
students to observe question and reflect.

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:26.830
And next up, I want to share
with you over on the right side,

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:29.290 position:56%
you'll see professional development.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:35.550 position:73%
In addition to webinars like we're doing today,
we have done a series of webinars in the past.

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:42.800 position:58%
We also have online modules available
that you can use on your own.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:47.820
We have six different self-paced
modules, as well as materials.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:53.420 position:69%
All of our professional development material
we release and make available online.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:59.060
So you can get to those materials
through LOC.GOV teachers.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:04.980 position:69%
And then one other area that we want to make
sure that you know about is ask a librarian.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:11.440 position:63%
This is a fabulous resource, it's on
the top of every single page at LOC.GOV,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.520 position:61%
and you'll see that it just highlighted
at the top under ask a librarian.

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:23.740 position:72%
And I'm going to take you to that page, and
here is where you can ask reference librarians

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:30.100 position:75%
from around the institution specific questions
about resources that you might be searching for.

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:34.480 position:59%
There is an area specific for
teachers, which you'll see highlighted

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.450 position:75%
on your screen, and it's resources for teachers.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.200 position:67%
So we encourage you to use these resources.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.620 position:72%
And the expectation for the ask a librarian is

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.740
that within five business
days, you'll get a response.

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:54.670
So the more specific you
can be with information,

00:33:54.670 --> 00:34:00.390 position:59%
especially if your students are doing
research, the more specific you can be

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:04.800
in what you've been doing for
searching and finding materials,

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:10.360
the better off the librarians
will be able to help you.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.910
So anyway, I'm going to click --

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:22.900 position:63%
sorry, I'm going to move forward and see
if you have any questions or comments.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.780
We have about 10 minutes
for question-and-answer.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.360 position:70%
We have -- we'll see how Anne's mic is doing.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.860 position:64%
But we certainly have Stacie on the line.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:42.250 position:70%
So I do want to go back to one of the points,
and this is something I want to ask Stacie,

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:47.710 position:66%
because it was something that you all were
chatting about earlier in the program.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:54.770 position:61%
Which is using these primary sources
and stepping off on a unit or a lesson.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:35:00.620
And I wanted to see if Stacie had
any further suggestions for us.

00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:05.790 position:64%
&gt;&gt; My experience has just been that it
just really opens up just a time of a lot

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:14.630 position:66%
of curiosity from the students, because
they immediately recognize that, you know,

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:19.340
these are the actual pieces of
history, these are real people.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:25.810 position:72%
So, for instance, when you talk about Jim
Crow, and you talk about this legal separation

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:32.890 position:64%
of the races, you know, it's one thing to
talk about it, but to see an actual sign

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:38.940 position:66%
that was posted outside of a restaurant
that reads, and this is in the exhibition,

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:43.460
no dogs, no Negroes, no Mexicans.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:44.360
That is powerful.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:47.130
That is something for them
that just brings it home,

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:49.460
that we are talking about
the lives of real people.

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:53.770 position:56%
And same with, you know,
understanding that these are, again,

00:35:53.770 --> 00:36:00.010 position:69%
people who are making difficult choices, not
just once, but on a daily basis, you know,

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:04.730 position:56%
literally every moment of their
lives in terms of becoming advocates

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:08.100 position:58%
for freedom and equality and justice.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:13.250 position:73%
So John Lewis, I believe somebody had mentioned
John Lewis's name earlier in one of the chats.

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:17.460 position:72%
And we have two versions of the speech he gave

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.310
as the youngest speaker at
the March on Washington.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:24.420
And it just adds this human
element to understanding that,

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.500 position:61%
you know, again, these are real people.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:33.130 position:59%
So to see their typewritten notes
with, you know, comments, just, again,

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:38.510
reinforces this understanding that
it connects to their own lives

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:42.170 position:67%
and to what's happening in the world today.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Stacie, that's great.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:52.430 position:69%
One question that I would like to have you
address is, you work with the real materials

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:57.610 position:56%
in the exhibitions every single day,
and you talked about the stories

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:01.500 position:75%
of students interacting with the real materials.

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:07.290 position:66%
What about folks who can't always make it
to Washington, DC, what advice do you have

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:11.550 position:58%
for them and looking at real objects?

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:18.820 position:72%
&gt;&gt; I am a big believer in pairing not only
the digitized primary sources from the Library

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:24.030 position:58%
of Congress but pairing that with if
you can, field trips to local museums

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:26.730 position:70%
and other cultural institutions in your area,

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:30.530
so that your students can
appreciate the real stuff.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:36.100 position:73%
Because it's just in our digital culture, you
know, especially for some of our younger folks,

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:42.080 position:67%
it's sometimes hard to understand that, you
know, we have these originals that we have

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.750 position:67%
to preserve and take care of and, you know,

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.320
collect so that future generations
will have them.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:53.850 position:64%
And for them to think about how to go out
into their own communities and, you know,

00:37:53.850 --> 00:38:00.060 position:67%
perhaps interview some folks who have lived
through experiences in their communities,

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.820
whether civil rights or whatever
the topic may be.

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:06.640
But but capturing that history and
capturing their own experiences,

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:11.800 position:70%
whether it's through journaling or, you know,
even filming a video or something like that.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.630 position:63%
But that these materials are so precious
because they are our shared history.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:20.400
&gt;&gt; Great, thank you.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.310
Anne, I have a question from Nancy.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.670 position:69%
Do you have any tips for printing resources?

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:39.110 position:64%
&gt;&gt; Yes. First of all, if the item is
something that's in a primary source set,

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:45.450 position:61%
it will be easy for you to print if you
just click on the PDF version of it.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:48.720
So take a look at those first.

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:55.810 position:73%
And secondly, you may just find that if you
can go to an item, if you're looking at an item

00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:02.200 position:72%
in the collection, to enlarge it and try right
clicking on the enlarged version of the item.

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:10.680 position:75%
And often, your computer will have software that
will help you step through printing that out.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:15.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; If I could add in, for the
exhibitions, the online exhibitions,

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:22.090 position:70%
when you go to the object level and click on
the item, you know, whether it's a page from,

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:26.210 position:56%
you know, if it's a manuscript or if
it's a photograph, it will enlarge,

00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:30.330 position:56%
and then at the bottom of the
enlargement there is a print button,

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.870 position:58%
and you can just print it from there.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:35.340
&gt;&gt; Terrific, thank you.

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:37.100
And Nancy thanks you as well.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.460
Anne, I have a question.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:44.030 position:59%
Perhaps you can talk to folks a little
bit more about the work that you did

00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:48.620 position:67%
with Teaching Tolerance, you and Stacie, as
a matter of fact, with Teaching Tolerance

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.770
in your four-part webinar series.

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:53.010
&gt;&gt; Certainly.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:59.700 position:63%
And as I said earlier, I would recommend
you listening to some of those webinars.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:07.400 position:70%
I think the most important thing, for me
personally, in terms of working with teachers

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.090 position:61%
and students, was working with the kits

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:16.470
that the Teaching Tolerance
has put together for teachers.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:21.810 position:75%
And learning about suggested ways, for instance,

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:26.970
they have five suggested ways
of teaching civil rights.

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:32.440
And there all practical,
and they're all realistic.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:39.400
And they encourage you to help the
conversation happen and find ways

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.900
to help students feel safe enough
to talk about what's happening.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:51.070 position:70%
There is also a wonderful section on Teaching
Tolerance about nine essential areas, again,

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:56.030 position:67%
a way to help you think about, what are
the kinds of questions I want to be asking.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:41:01.310 position:56%
What are the kinds of -- what are
the areas I want to be sure to cover

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:06.540
so that I help students see
the complexity of the story.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:11.480 position:61%
And that might be the thing I would end
in my comment with is that I learned

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:17.460 position:59%
through Teaching Tolerance the
importance of telling a complex story.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.000
&gt;&gt; Terrific, thank you, Anne.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.580
Stacie, we have a question.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:27.040 position:72%
Have you seen any emotional reactions from
kids or adults as they go through the exhibit?

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.890
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:35.500 position:59%
It's, again, just it's kind of
incredible the connection between some

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:40.490
of these historic objects
and what's happening today.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:48.120 position:75%
And there was, well, of course, the flag, but in
particular, there was a group we had that came

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:53.690 position:56%
through and it was the day after the
shooting at the church, you know,

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.560
at which time people were killed.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:04.470 position:66%
And in one of the cases is an incredible
print of the founders of that same church,

00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:12.020 position:73%
and she encountered that in the section
that's, you know, speaking to the early history

00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:14.280 position:61%
of the civil rights movement, you know,

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:19.870 position:61%
really the roots of this long
struggle, just brought people to tears.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:26.700
And, you know, again, it's really
powerful to see how people respond

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:32.960
to the different objects and
how it sparks conversations.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:33.990
&gt;&gt; Terrific.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:39.650 position:66%
I want to personally thank Stacie and Anne
for their present presentations today.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.990
You guys did a great job.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:45.790 position:66%
And I want to thank all of you, the
audience, in sticking with us through some

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:48.470 position:59%
of the technical issues that we faced.

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:54.870 position:75%
But there is no better audience than an audience
full of educators, so we thank you very much,

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:58.950 position:67%
and we welcome your feedback at the survey.

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:03.350
And I'm going to end the
recording and end the meeting.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.420
Thank you very much.

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:11.520
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.870
Visit us at LOC.GOV.
