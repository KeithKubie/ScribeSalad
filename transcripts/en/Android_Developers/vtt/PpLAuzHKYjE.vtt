00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hello and welcome
back to the Friday

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.600
Games Review.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.100
I am Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.230
DAN GALPIN: And I'm
Dan Galpin.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.040
And we're going to be looking at
a bunch of Halloween games

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.860
as well as chatting, as we
always do, talking about the

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.990
technology behind games and how
we can make more awesome

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.980
games on Android.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: And, sad to say,
this is the final episode of

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.090
the Friday Games Review.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.090
We've both moved on.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.060
[LAUGHING]

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.300
DAN GALPIN: We've
both moved on.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.930
You know, at some point, you
gotta ask yourself, how much

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.140
beer am I going to
drink for my job?

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.370
And the answer is, a lot.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.380
And now--

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.350
DAN GALPIN: I think that part
will continue, though.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh,
you never know.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.700
Anyway, so today we're
drinking, again,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.220
Rogue Dead Guy Ale.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.740
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.770
IAN NI-LEWIS: Because it's
Halloweeny, and because this

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.910
show is dead.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.270
Now we're not going off
the air permanently.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.180
We're going to be back
at some point.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.300
I think Dan's going to be
headlining a new act, trying

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.070
to get something together
with maybe Colt

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.630
McAnlis or those guys.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.730
Basically, what's happened is
it used to be all about

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.630
Android with us.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.435
And now, Dan's sort of taken on
a role that is more global,

00:02:48.435 --> 00:02:51.620
a little bit more
cross-Google.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.880
And I think that as soon as he's
ready to talk about that,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.620
I think he's going to come back
with some cool stuff.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.070
DAN GALPIN: Basically, it means
that I could spend a lot

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.700
of time with Colt and with Todd
Kerpelman and a bunch of

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.640
other people here, and that's
going to be great.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.290
And I'm trying to encourage
them to wear

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.020
crazy hats as well.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.580
So we'll see.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.210
Hopefully we'll see more crazy
hats in the future.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.040
By the way, this hat is not just
a crazy hat with hair,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.010
which is partially in honor of
the amazing picture that was

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.570
put together by Daniel
Pham in response to

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.600
our fauxhawk comments--

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.950
Last week, we--

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.080
DAN GALPIN: Comments
from last week.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: We intimated that
perhaps Daniel Pham was

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.850
in New York and London
for the semiannual

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.700
fauxhawk fashion week.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.000
And apparently, Dan took
that the wrong way.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.370
DAN GALPIN: I think he took
it the right way.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: Not prepared
to come out as a

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.740
fauxhawk guy, I guess.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.115
anyway, he was kind enough
to put together this.

00:03:45.115 --> 00:03:46.365
Dan went--

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.100
DAN GALPIN: And it's something
like that.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.620
So speaking of stronger, so the
hat that I'm wearing, if

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.070
you can't tell, is actually a
San Francisco Giants hat.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.060
And no, I did not get to go and
attend the World Series.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.400
But I did stand outside of the
ballpark yesterday and watch

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.320
the end of the game.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.190
And it was kind of epic
just being there with

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.370
the cheering fans.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: You watched
the end of the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.000
game outside the ballpark?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.750
DAN GALPIN: On televisions
literally in the plaza in

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:33.700
front of the ballpark.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.060
And it was great because we had
about a 10-second delay.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.670
So when anything would happen in
the game that was awesome,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.160
we'd hear the cheers
from them.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.510
And then 10 seconds later, you'd
hear the cheers from us

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.580
all waiting outside in the less
than cheap standing area.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.390
But it was awesome and epic, and
it was exciting to see the

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.320
Giants go up 2-0, for
all those who are

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.360
Giants fans out there.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.240
And yeah, so this hat is
actually a SF Giants hat.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.910
But it also just kind of fits
with the fauxhawk theme we had

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.070
from last week.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, the
thing about your fauxhawk is,

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.970
it really didn't turn
into a fauxhawk.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.250
I mean, mine was--

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.810
I don't even know
what mine was.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.060
I think it was a--

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.400
so epic, it makes me want to put
you on the cover of a '70s

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.775
funk album.

00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:25.620
It's Doug Henning.

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.360
It's like, you are the '70s
magician, the groovy magician

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.060
of Android.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.870
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, something
like that.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: Bringing
mullets back.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.695
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:39.910
IAN NI-LEWIS: Can we see that
with the motion, Dan?

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.040
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, let's--

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.470
you mean this with the motion?

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.180
DANIEL PHAM: Yeah, do
you want to see--

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.170
DAN GALPIN: Or do you want
me to do the motion?

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:44.660
Oh, I see.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.590
Yeah, absolutely, with
the work that Ian has

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.560
put together to make--

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.525
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:05:48.525 --> 00:05:49.930
DAN GALPIN: --to make
me more epic.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.700
I don't think I could look
at myself that often.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.980
But I'll mention it
to my girlfriend.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.945
She might like it.

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:04.315
IAN NI-LEWIS: I wasn't
talking to you.

00:06:04.315 --> 00:06:04.680
DAN GALPIN: Oh.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: I was talking
to everyone out there in

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.970
Internet-land.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.820
DAN GALPIN: So, we do--

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.810
now last week, I challenged
you all to

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.830
nominate Halloweeny games.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.990
And of course, that
didn't happen.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.280
So instead, I'm going to
talk about a bunch

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.080
of Halloween games.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think it's
because there were like two

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.420
people watching, and one
of them was my wife.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.180
DAN GALPIN: Probably,
probably.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.900
Yeah.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.580
Yeah, you should have
nominated some

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.220
games, Ian's wife.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.200
But in all fairness, so
we are going to cover

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.980
some Halloween games.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.920
There was one game that's
sort of borderline.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.230
I also wanted to mention that
"Greedy Spiders" actually went

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:46.170
and got updated based
upon the comments we

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.000
made from last week.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: Rock on.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.740
DAN GALPIN: So thanks,
guys, for doing that.

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.620
I've definitely let the
Google Play team know.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.770
And as soon as they're out from
under the epic burden

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.200
they've been under in the last
week or so, hopefully we'll

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.510
see something happen with that
because it's a great game.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, it's worth
mentioning, too, the amazing

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.200
burden that these people
put themselves under

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.170
every holiday season.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.850
It's really, really difficult
to be a Google Play

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.070
merchandising guy in
any holiday season.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.400
So remember to get those updates
up two, three weeks

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.030
beforehand if you want
to be considered for

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.990
featuring at a holiday.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.890
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it's
totally brutal.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:28.800
It kind of works, though.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.840
Because as far as I can tell in
this country, Christmas is

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.960
now beginning in August.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.230
That was when I first saw the
Christmas merchandise showing

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:38.055
up in stores, was in August
of this year.

00:07:38.055 --> 00:07:38.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: What?

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.000
DAN GALPIN: I know

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.580
IAN NI-LEWIS: What store
had Christmas

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.290
merchandise in August?

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.690
DAN GALPIN: Costco, actually,
was like--

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.690
I was totally amazed.

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:43.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.390
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I know.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: I guess they
have to truck it in.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.980
DAN GALPIN: So in any case,
given that, having something

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.030
up two or three weeks before
the holiday actually is a

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.310
really good idea.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:57.570
If you are a game team, and you
are just trucking to get

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.560
something done the day before
the holiday, and then you want

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.410
the team to have time to look
at it, that's probably not

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:06.530
going to happen, especially when
the team is also trying

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.930
to prepare for an event that's
going to happen on Monday.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.390
So--

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.950
and not that we can talk about
what that event will be, other

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.320
than the playground is open.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.410
Isn't that what they
said about it?

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:17.971
IAN NI-LEWIS: Is that really
what we said? "The

00:08:17.971 --> 00:08:18.230
playground is open"?

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.220
DAN GALPIN: I think that's
what we said,

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.140
something like that.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wow,
how exciting.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.570
DAN GALPIN: I know, I know.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.820
Yeah, I'm looking forward to
that event actually happening

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:29.660
so that life can go back
to normal, right?

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:29.920
Yeah?

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.160
IAN NI-LEWIS: I hope so.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.350
DAN GALPIN: I hope so.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.830
Of course, then, with this
hair, who knows?

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.730
So I did look at a bunch
of games this week.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.929
The first one is "Gun Zombie
Halloween." Now, honestly, if

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:47.410
"Gun Zombie" by itself was not
Halloweeny enough, we have the

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.840
Gun Zombie Halloween edition.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Whoa.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.240
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.800
So just to show you--

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.835
IAN NI-LEWIS: So I think what
we want to do today is rate

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:59.520
games on A, how good they are
and B, how shamelessly they

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.950
chiseled in some sort
of Halloween theme--

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.340
DAN GALPIN: Yes.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: Whether or
not it fit, right?

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:04.060
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.780
And actually, most of the ones
I picked today really were

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.560
games that should have had
a Halloween theme.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.160
So I didn't look out
for the ones that

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.830
were shameless, like--

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:11.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: Did you get
"Clouds and Sheep"?

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.010
DAN GALPIN: I did not put
"Clouds and Sheep" Halloween

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:13.460
edition up there.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: But shoutout to
our buddies at HandyGames.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.910
DAN GALPIN: Dudes, awesome
job with that one.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.680
So this one here, your job is
to shoot things as they walk

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.400
towards you, thus eliminating
them from having to actually

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.670
have a view of anything
from the side,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.790
which is kind of epic.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.750
And basically, you shoot, you
reload, and then you have

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:35.300
these nice splash effects that
happen on the screen.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.080
It sort of makes me feel like
they used the engine from the

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:44.300
original "Wolfenstein 3D" here
in terms of complexity.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.170
But hey, it works.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.170
It's sort of 3D-ish.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.410
IAN NI-LEWIS: What's
your beef there?

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.770
DAN GALPIN: There's
no beef, no.

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.580
IAN NI-LEWIS: It looks good.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:53.830
DAN GALPIN: The game
is minimal beef.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.920
But that's kind of the problem,
also, is it's kind of

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.490
a lot of the same gameplay.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.680
My biggest complaint with this
is that if you're going to do

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.630
a game in which you're
interacting with a

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.310
touchscreen, and you have a
whole bunch of things that are

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.600
running towards you, I hate
actually having to move my gun

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.920
with a virtual joystick.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.480
At this point, I just want to
go tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:17.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, what's
up with that?

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.910
What is up with that,
seriously?

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:19.850
DAN GALPIN: I know, I now.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right?

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.810
DAN GALPIN: But I wanted to
mention it because it was

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.210
actually a nicely themed
Halloween game.

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.000
Let's go on to some
other stuff.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.690
Now this is "Zombiewood,"
which is the big--

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know,
let's take a break

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.030
and talk about Monday.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.900
Because that was epic.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.810
DAN GALPIN: Oh, this Monday?

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:35.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.840
So last Monday, we went down
to San Jose with the

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.930
HandyGames guys, who were
in from Germany, right?

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:41.150
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.725
And they had never really
watched much baseball.

00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:47.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, it turns
out that Viking dude had.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.960
DAN GALPIN: Oh, Viking
dude had.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.100
IAN NI-LEWIS: We don't actually
know their names.

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:49.540
We just know--

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:50.230
DAN GALPIN: That's Chris.

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:52.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: There's Viking
dude, Viking dude's brother--

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:52.870
DAN GALPIN: Marcus.

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:54.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: And
the accountant.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.980
DAN GALPIN: Oh, yeah,
I don't know him.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.230
He's the accountant.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.920
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's not
actually a description.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.640
That's a superpower, actually.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.090
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
it is, it is.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:11.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: So Viking
dude is telling me--

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:13.250
I sit down, and I'm like, well,
he probably doesn't

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:13.920
really like baseball.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.730
So I'm like, hey, show
me your game.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:17.470
And he's like, shut up, dude.

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:17.880
And I'm like--

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.710
DAN GALPIN: I'm watching
the game.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:20.780
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, you're
really into this.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.710
And he's like, yeah.

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.790
Because apparently, the bar
he likes to drink at is a

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.840
baseball bar.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.380
DAN GALPIN: Well, of course.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.510
IAN NI-LEWIS: And so you can't,
like, drink with those

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.450
people unless you
know baseball.

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.090
DAN GALPIN: Well, I will say
this bar, by the way--

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.636
IAN NI-LEWIS: The bar we were
in-- this is why I wanted to

00:11:34.636 --> 00:11:34.770
bring it up--

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.180
DAN GALPIN: Firehouse 1 down in
San Pedro Square, you have

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.020
the rocking beer collection.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.450
I mean, honestly.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: So they were
like, oh, we've got this

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.110
Belgian that's on special.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.290
I'm like, oh, I'll
try that, fully

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.760
expecting it to be terrible.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.400
A, it was a really good beer.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.410
Think Hoegaarden, but--

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:53.910
DAN GALPIN: Better.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:54.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: Less commercial.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:56.890
Just awesome.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.060
Second, they brought it to me
in a glass that, I kid you

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.020
not, was shaped like one of
those old-timey bicycle horns,

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:05.160
you know, with the
bulb and the--

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.920
DAN GALPIN: Hand-shaped
glass, clearly.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.460
You like that?

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right?

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.105
DAN GALPIN: And a stand.

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:11.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
a wooden stand.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.700
DAN GALPIN: Because otherwise
the glass would fall over,

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.690
that clearly came from the
origin of the beer.

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:21.630
So this was beer that was on
tap that was served in a

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:24.300
specialized mug the way they
would have in Belgium.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.330
And I have to say, big
thumbs up there.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
Not to mention all of the other
beer selections were

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.880
epic, including the Duchesse,
which is one of my--

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.150
IAN NI-LEWIS: Duchesse De
Bourgogne, yeah, one of our

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.050
favorite beers, absolutely.

00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:35.800
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
so it was epic.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:39.510
Not only that, it was an epic
game because the Giants kicked

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.780
some serious booty.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, they did.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.220
I don't know.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:42.700
Epic--

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.320
I mean, it was kind
of lopsided.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.880
DAN GALPIN: It was.

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.140
But the end of the game, the
rain pouring down, and they

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.290
had people on--

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:52.165
oh wait.

00:12:52.165 --> 00:12:53.640
That was the other
game, wasn't it?

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:55.380
Never mind.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.750
There was a lot of epicness
this week.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, you
remember, it was like the

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.540
rain, and then there was that
one dude, and then I think

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.270
Robert Redford hit a homer and
all the lights went out--

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.040
DAN GALPIN: No, actually, in all
seriousness, it was Monday

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.430
night, the rain was coming
down, it was

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.230
the end of the game.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:14.460
And yeah, it was truly, truly
epic to end that series.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway, thanks for
HandyGames for suggesting

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.280
that place.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:18.870
DAN GALPIN: Yes.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:20.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: Because it turned
out to be awesome.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.680
And it's like within walking
distance from my house.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.490
DAN GALPIN: Which
is a good thing.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which you can't
say about very many places,

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.840
both awesome and within
walking distance.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840
DAN GALPIN: The Pink Poodle's
was walking

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.500
distance of your house.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: I have no opinion
about the Pink Poodle.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:36.330
DAN GALPIN: Anyways,
all right.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.880
So this is "Zombiewood,"
by the way.

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.160
And it's a two-stick shooter.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.490
And as far as I can tell,
Gameloft made very, very

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.800
little effort to actually make
it run well on a Tegra 3,

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.980
which is kind of sad
because this is--

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's tough.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.410
I mean, like we've talked about
before, Tegra 3's kind

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.890
of the odd man out on some
of these things.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.630
It's a fully forward renderer,
which means that you've got to

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.490
sort your geometry.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.230
You've got to do all
the sort of PC

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:03.540
things, in terms of like--

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.960
DAN GALPIN: So in all fairness,
so before coming in

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.970
here, I actually put this
through PerfHUD.

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.070
And PerfHUD, for those
who don't know, is

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.880
NVIDIA's truly epic--

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.226
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, you put it
through PerfHUD, but you

00:14:13.226 --> 00:14:14.680
didn't bring it in here
to show everyone?

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.860
Did you bring enough for
the whole class?

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:16.400
DAN GALPIN: I-- definitely.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.380
So just to mention, PerfHUD
is NVIDIA's

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.375
awesome performance tool.

00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:21.950
It runs only on NVIDIA chips,
but you can actually go

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.440
through and honestly get an
amazing amount of information

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.720
about how your GL screens
are rendering.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.890
It really is an amazing,
amazing tool.

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.110
And I was able to discern
immediately that this app was

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:33.010
[? ridge ?] rendering.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.710
The first thing it puts up on
the screen is the background,

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.520
which you know is a bad sign.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:39.400
And it does--

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.230
A lot of people don't
realize this.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.420
I am shocked at how many people
don't realize this.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:50.570
There is one basic, basic lesson
that you all must learn

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:53.080
if you want your graphics
to be fast.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.000
And that is, you have a
background and/or skybox, they

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.540
get drawn last.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:04.240
Every single GPU ever will do
better if you draw your skybox

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.550
and background last.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.990
DAN GALPIN: Except for one.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.150
Except for one.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: Dude, what?

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.610
Which one?

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:10.960
DAN GALPIN: The Imagination
Technologies GPUs don't

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.550
fricking care.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.470
They actually draw just
as well either way.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK, I'm sorry.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.120
Everything will do at least
as well or better.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.760
DAN GALPIN: Ah, there we are.

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: I can't
believe you, man.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:22.800
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.740
So basically--

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:25.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually, no.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.150
They sort, but they
also Z reject.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.140
DAN GALPIN: They sort, but
the problem is they sort

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:31.010
everything.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:37.490
And so since it re-sorts it
after you send it to it, it

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.820
actually wastes just
as much time.

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.610
So you waste more CPU sorting
your geography.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:43.110
The thing about this game,
though, is it's isometric

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.480
projection, dudes.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.640
So there's very little sorting
that has to go on here.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:48.600
Objects are barely ever on
top of each other in

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.000
a meaningful way.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.890
The objects are always
on the background.

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:53.670
And none of these objects
have transparency--

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hey,
you know what?

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.940
DAN GALPIN: Translucency.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.420
You know why?

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: It doesn't
cost any CPU to

00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.380
draw your skybox last.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.360
That's not a sorting
operation.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.170
DAN GALPIN: No, that's
what I mean.

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:02.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's just
drawing your skybox and/or

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:02.585
background last.

00:16:02.585 --> 00:16:02.880
DAN GALPIN: This isn't
even a skybox.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.130
This is the floor.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:11.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: So there
is no cost to this.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.700
You would have to be stupid
to not do this.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.460
DAN GALPIN: Are you calling
Gameloft stupid?

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.080
Are you calling Gameloft
stupid?

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.570
Because you know, we don't do
that here on this show.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:23.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: I meant
everybody-- wait.

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:24.100
DAN GALPIN: OK, we do.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.196
IAN NI-LEWIS: Are you saying
like a carve-out or something?

00:16:27.196 --> 00:16:29.350
We call everybody stupid
on this show.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.490
DAN GALPIN: That's true,
especially us.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: Especially
ourselves.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.650
DAN GALPIN: Well said.

00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.690
So anyways, yeah, if you don't
mind the game running at about

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.430
10 frames a second, it's
actually pretty

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.850
fun on Nexus 7.

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.080
I'm hoping that we can convince
Gameloft to actually

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.030
do a little bit of geometry
sorting at some point.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:50.380
Obviously, this game came out
just before Halloween.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.010
They were probably just
rushing to try to

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.020
get it out the door.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.730
Congratulations for
simulshipping

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:55.830
it on multiple platforms.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.265
But now it's time to
actually make the

00:16:57.265 --> 00:16:58.400
Android version run better.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.250
It's just too slow.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.820
And honestly, I love these
kind of games.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.370
I love dual-stick
shooters, man.

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:07.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: And it's tough
because right now, Tegra has a

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.849
really large market
share for--

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.050
DAN GALPIN: People who
care about games.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: Large devices,
yeah, tablet devices.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:17.920
All right, so we made a joke
earlier about year of the

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.960
Android tablet, year of the
Linux desktop, whatever.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.150
But the truth is that Android
tablets have been gaining more

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.819
and more market share.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.960
Now it's true that
there's some--

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.670
the Galaxy Note, you could
probably call a tablet.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.420
DAN GALPIN: It's a fablet.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.170
It's kind of like the
fauxhawk, OK?

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.440
So, but--

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:40.820
DAN GALPIN: Well done.

00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
you took the words

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.150
right out of my mouth.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:45.390
DAN GALPIN: Well done, Daniel.

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:49.875
IAN NI-LEWIS: The point is a lot
of large devices use the

00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:51.240
Tegra 3 for whatever reason.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:57.610
And at this point, it's unwise
to ignore this chip.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:57.940
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.430
And honestly, the tools
are so good.

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.300
The thing is, no matter what
you think of the chip,

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.650
NVIDIA's tools are so, so
awesome at being able to spot

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:07.920
these things.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yep.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.940
Also, if you're a
game developer

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.190
with any kind of pedigree--

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:14.170
yes.

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:14.960
DAN GALPIN: Awesome.

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.830
There we are.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.020
DAN GALPIN: Speaking
of awesome--

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: If you've got
any kind of chops, you've

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.720
released some cool stuff on
any platform, NVIDIA will

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:29.480
often talk to you and give
you lots of help.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.210
They're really good at that.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:33.820
They have basically an army of
people like me and Dan, except

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.650
they know a lot more about
their particular chip.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.680
And they will do amazing
things for you.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:38.980
DAN GALPIN: You could
just say "know a lot

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:43.050
more." I'm OK with that.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:44.100
Actually, they don't have
an army of people

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:44.680
that know a lot more.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.940
They've got two or
three guys--

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.850
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.730
DAN GALPIN: There's the dude
from North Carolina--

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.791
Lars, you're awesome.

00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:54.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I think
we're just going to spend the

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.720
rest of the show giving
shoutouts to people.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.250
DAN GALPIN: That's right.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:02.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: Especially
our buddy in Austria.

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:05.156
I can't remember your YouTube
channel right now.

00:19:05.156 --> 00:19:07.730
And you're probably
not even watching.

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.530
But peace, brother.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.710
DANIEL PHAM: I think
his name is Marcus.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:11.920
IAN NI-LEWIS: You're right,
his name is Marcus.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.060
DAN GALPIN: His name is Marcus,
same as the brother

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.570
who is actually the
CTO of HandyGames.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:20.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: Viking dude?

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.360
DAN GALPIN: No, the brother
of Viking dude,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.344
Marcus, is the CTO.

00:19:24.344 --> 00:19:26.480
So yeah.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway, let's--

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:31.246
whoa, what happened?

00:19:31.246 --> 00:19:34.910
DAN GALPIN: So by the way, this
is to show, like, if you

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.010
ever had any question that Tegra
could do some pretty

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.950
awesome stuff, this water
is kind of killer.

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:44.720
My congratulations to the team
over at Madfinger for actually

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.760
making this water happen.

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:47.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, there is one
thing that's really nice

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.160
about forward rendering.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.320
And that's that you never have
to worry about a resolve.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.020
Everything's always
getting rendered.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.690
And if you need to take whatever
you've rendered and

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.720
use it in a different part
of the scene, that's

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.050
considerably faster.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.140
DAN GALPIN: My favorite
part is that.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:10.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: So actually, so we
were talking about the Mali

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.900
600 series last week.

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:20.300
And I seem to remember that they
are a deferred renderer,

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.040
but they do not sort geometry
before rendering.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.750
DAN GALPIN: That's correct.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:28.005
IAN NI-LEWIS: So will they also
benefit from CPU sorting,

00:20:28.005 --> 00:20:28.930
do you think?

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.380
DAN GALPIN: They absolutely
benefit from-- they actually--

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: They certainly
will benefit from drawing the

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:35.970
skybox last.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.384
Hello!

00:20:37.384 --> 00:20:39.490
No, seriously, I've been dealing
with this ever since I

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:41.510
was on the Xbox and Xbox 360.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:43.270
We'd do performance
reviews of people.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:45.530
And it's like, oh, wow.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.550
And these are like big games.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:51.050
I won't mention which company I
visited Edinborough to check

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:52.250
this out on.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:54.630
But for at least a few of
their builds, they were

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.400
drawing their nine-pass
skybox first.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.240
And the thing is, GPUs are
really, really good at

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.810
figuring out which pixels
are occluded, most GPUs.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.090
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: And that's
something that they can

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.470
completely optimize away.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.860
So if you've got a skybox and/or
background that is

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.970
occluded by masses of other
geometry, be it skyscrapers or

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:27.360
HUD or anything else, it would
behoove you to draw that last.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.450
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely
it would.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:33.780
IAN NI-LEWIS: And in addition,
that's another thing.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.630
Like if you draw an opaque HUD,
you should totally draw

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.260
that first.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:40.770
And you should totally make as
much of it opaque as possible.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.830
Now alpha-blended HUDs
look better.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:45.520
And I'm not going to tell
you to make your HUD

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.550
opaque for no reason.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:47.410
DAN GALPIN: Well, you
can easily make

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.740
part of the HUD opaque.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, yeah.

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.470
If you have any part of the HUD
that can be opaque, every

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.950
single pixel in there is another
pixel that you don't

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.590
have to calculate with
any shaders.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.080
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.110
So really, if you're going to
be super, super smart, take

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:03.150
all the opaque areas, make some
geometry for them, draw

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:06.690
those first, and then take all
the non-opaque regions and

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:07.750
draw them last.

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:09.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: Awesome.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:12.000
I just got a message on
my Amp'd Mobile phone.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.230
DAN GALPIN: Apparently, someone
has been watching

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:16.500
acceptable.tv.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.270
Get this phone.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.650
It's the only phone that
makes you happy.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.580
It's a Galaxy Nexus world.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.250
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I would
say this is not an

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:23.850
Amp'd Mobile phone.

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:24.330
But that's--

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.340
good shoutout there, though.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.050
So I showed off "Dead Trigger"
mostly because they added the

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.030
cool pumpkin zombies.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.570
And that was their
Halloween add.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:31.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's
pretty cool, yeah.

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:34.250
DAN GALPIN: And I like
the pumpkin zombies.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:38.020
So another game that came
out this week in the--

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hang
on, hang on.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.472
I need a refill.

00:22:40.472 --> 00:22:41.350
DAN GALPIN: Oh, another beer.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.430
DAN GALPIN: Oh, OK.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:43.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: You're
closer, dude.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:43.950
DAN GALPIN: I am, I am.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:44.670
All right.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.040
Why aren't you using
the mug, man?

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:46.925
IAN NI-LEWIS: I know, I know.

00:22:46.925 --> 00:22:48.155
DAN GALPIN: You brought
the mug all the way--

00:22:48.155 --> 00:22:49.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: Here's
the thing.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.280
No, give me the mug.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.584
Give me the mug.

00:22:53.584 --> 00:22:54.640
Because you're right.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.980
What an asshole thing to do.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.290
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.520
IAN NI-LEWIS: I didn't
say that.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:57.840
Anyway--

00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:58.710
DAN GALPIN: No, you didn't.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.290
But it's--

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.670
the show's getting cancelled
already, sir.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.380
But I still have my
job, I think.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.100
Anyway, so we're out
with HandyGames.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.520
They brought in these awesome
Franconian mugs.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.405
And we didn't drink out of them
because Dan forgot his

00:23:16.405 --> 00:23:19.040
because Dan is incredibly
lame.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.790
Notwithstanding the
fact that--

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:20.650
DAN GALPIN: I'm wearing
this hair.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: He brought a
massively awesome hat.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.000
That's pretty epic.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.370
Everything Dan does is epic.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.730
We've kind of come
to expect that.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:31.870
Anyway, so mug advertising game
that you probably can't

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.440
read, which is good because--

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.445
DAN GALPIN: "Epic
Battle Dude."

00:23:35.445 --> 00:23:37.140
IAN NI-LEWIS: Because they told
us to stop advertising

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:37.840
games on our show.

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:38.700
DAN GALPIN: Oh.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.400
Who did?

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:39.850
Wait.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:42.140
IAN NI-LEWIS: The Man.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.610
And when I say "The Man,"
I mean Billy.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:46.350
You know, it's funny, because
I asked Billy

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.330
to come on the show.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.600
And I'm like, would you at least
do a five-minute spot

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.020
disavowing all knowledge
of this show?

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:53.556
And he said no.

00:23:53.556 --> 00:23:53.940
DAN GALPIN: Aw.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, anyway--

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:57.500
DAN GALPIN: So this game
actually comes--

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.516
IAN NI-LEWIS: Ooh, it's our
favorite company, Yng.

00:23:59.516 --> 00:24:00.980
Yng!

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:05.960
DAN GALPIN: So this is "Zombie
Swipeout," which like many--

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.285
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh man, have
they trademarked that?

00:24:08.285 --> 00:24:13.130
Because I could see an entire
Swipeout dynasty.

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.540
DAN GALPIN: It's possible.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.280
And this game comes from their
team in Germany, which

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:19.410
actually does not do freemium
social games,

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:20.430
believe it or not.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.830
This is a game that is
actually-- well, like a lot of

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:24.336
other games--

00:24:24.336 --> 00:24:25.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: Whoa!

00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:26.640
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, so
your goal here--

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:27.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's
a lot of fru--

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:28.960
what is that?

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.480
DAN GALPIN: I'm trying to
kill zombies that are

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.360
jumping up in the air.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, but
what's the fruit?

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.520
DAN GALPIN: Oh, those
are coins.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.700
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh,
those are coins.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:35.710
They look like oranges to me.

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.900
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, no,
those are coins.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.730
They do look a lot
like oranges.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.350
The goal is to avoid killing
your friends--

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.780
your friend, in this case, who
looks like he should be killed

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:45.645
because he looks
really unhappy.

00:24:45.645 --> 00:24:47.500
But he's being chucked
up in the air among a

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.400
whole bunch of zombies.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.030
And to catch the coins.

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: Where's
your friend?

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.190
DAN GALPIN: Hold on.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.730
He'll be there.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:54.515
I'll swipe him eventually.

00:24:54.515 --> 00:24:55.330
There he is.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:55.750
See the guy?

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, dude.

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:58.810
That guy is such a tool.

00:24:58.810 --> 00:24:59.865
DAN GALPIN: I know, exactly.

00:24:59.865 --> 00:25:00.610
So you gotta--

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.370
IAN NI-LEWIS: Look at that
thing he's wearing, too.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.120
That's like a Marty McFly, "Back
to the Future" vest.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:06.760
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.450
Whoa, and there's multiples of
him because he's got clones.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:12.670
Anyways, this is a bizarre
game, by the way.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.720
But it's actually really
fun and well done.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.790
And so congratulations
to the team for that.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.820
And it actually, being that it
has actual zombies, and the

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.590
zombies are actually part of
the regular game, it's a

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.420
pretty good one to release
around Halloween.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.220
DAN GALPIN: So there we are.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: Good stuff.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:27.650
Wow.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:28.650
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:31.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: So yeah,
but here's the thing.

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.980
What does this add to, let's
say, some sort of Asian

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:38.930
martial arts style game
involving fruit?

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.350
DAN GALPIN: Well, it's a
slightly different game

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.270
design, but yes.

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.960
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well,
yeah, and it's OK.

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.780
I mean, there's lots of
first-person shooters.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:51.090
I'm sure there's lots of
ninja swiping games.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.690
But why would I get this?

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.170
DAN GALPIN: Well, my feeling was
if you're going to go all

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.600
the way and have zombies coming
at you, the whole point

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.430
of zombies is that they're
supposed to be coming at you.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, they're
supposed to coming at you at a

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.300
slow, terrible pace.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.200
DAN GALPIN: Or even
at a fast pace.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: I mean, you
can outrun them, but

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.752
they can't be stopped.

00:26:08.752 --> 00:26:09.810
They don't sleep.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:10.070
DAN GALPIN: Brains.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:13.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: They don't need
to eat except for brains.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.260
Basically, when you're in the
zombie apocalypse, that's the

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.250
terrifying thing, right?

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.500
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:21.940
IAN NI-LEWIS: --funny.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.340
DAN GALPIN: These are
cute zombies.

00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:24.550
That's the whole point.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.680
So I don't know why we were
killing them in the air.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.750
Their first game was
"ZombieSmash," which was a

00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:30.050
physics game.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:31.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: That was another
flying zombie game.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:32.300
DAN GALPIN: Flying
zombie game.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.095
So this is the sequel.

00:26:33.095 --> 00:26:35.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: Basically, these
guys love zombies in the air.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.010
I want to understand where
that comes from.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.690
Is this some sort of bizarre
German myth that I just am not

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.005
familiar with?

00:26:43.005 --> 00:26:45.760
Like when you find out that
Hansel and Gretel really died?

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.070
DAN GALPIN: Isn't it a German
director who made all those--

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.520
yeah, I don't know,
I don't know.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.915
It's a good point.

00:26:49.915 --> 00:26:52.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: A German director
made all those what?

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:54.020
DAN GALPIN: Oh, "Resident
Evil" films.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:54.610
Wasn't--

00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:56.180
IAN NI-LEWIS: Was it
a German director?

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:56.920
DAN GALPIN: I don't remember.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: It wasn't that
dude that hauled the steamboat

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.760
up the mountain, was it?

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.230
All right, anyway.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:04.760
DAN GALPIN: So that's
"Swipeout." We

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.470
really liked it.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.040
Or actually, I really
liked it.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.490
But yes, it is a lot like
another game in which one is

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.280
battling fruit.

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.500
So whether it makes more sense
to battle fruit or battle

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.710
zombies that are flying
through the air, you--

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:16.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Who tossed
them, too?

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.010
That's my question.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:18.910
Who tosses--

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:20.290
DAN GALPIN: Who is tossing
the zombies?

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:21.350
IAN NI-LEWIS: "Fruit Ninja"
I can understand because

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:27.630
obviously, it's your sensei
and/or Asian assistant tossing

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.230
stuff in the air so that
you can prove your

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.960
ninja skills, right?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.540
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely, right.

00:27:32.540 --> 00:27:33.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: This,
I don't know.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:36.270
DAN GALPIN: I have to admit that
the whole premise behind

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:40.060
this game does completely
escape me.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: I don't remember,
it used to be when

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.170
you got a game, you
got a box with it,

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:46.690
and there was a manual.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:48.910
And you would read the manual,
and it would explain this

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:52.030
whole story of why this pixel
hated this other pixel.

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.390
DAN GALPIN: You know, I feel
like when one should say that,

00:27:54.390 --> 00:28:00.190
I remember when games used to
come with a manual and a box.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:00.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, right.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.940
You know what?

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.840
Loading screens, uphill
both ways.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.360
DAN GALPIN: So speaking of
loading screens, I wanted to

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.940
show off "Nun Attack," which
also has a nice Halloween

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:11.570
theme, believe it or not.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:12.280
And "Nun Attack"--

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:15.270
IAN NI-LEWIS: This is nothing
compared to "Kung-Fu CB Mamas

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.470
on Wheels vs. the Motorcycle
Aztec Wrestling Nuns."

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.440
DAN GALPIN: What?

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.930
All right, hold on.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.130
I just want to restart this
from the beginning.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:24.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what I
don't understand is, "Nun

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:25.340
Attack," is this--

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.340
DAN GALPIN: So look.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.560
'Verifying resources." Why is
it verifying resources?

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.993
Because I put it into
the code sample.

00:28:31.993 --> 00:28:34.840
Gah, you don't have to verify
resources every single time

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:35.870
you run the game.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:37.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: Did you put
it into the code sample?

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.620
DAN GALPIN: I did.

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:39.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:39.380
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: Do you know
whose fault this is?

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:41.570
DAN GALPIN: Mine.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:42.950
Just the fact that
we're waiting all

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:43.680
this time, my fault.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.290
IAN NI-LEWIS: So if you've
ever been in a profession

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:49.902
where you write sample code of
any kind, one thing that you

00:28:49.902 --> 00:28:53.270
will note is that sample
code gets cut and

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.120
pasted all the time.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.100
It's so funny because
I literally--

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.720
DAN GALPIN: I'm glad that they
did change the UI, though.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: So at Microsoft,
we were in a position where we

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.670
often looked at other
people's code.

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:05.930
I would find samples
that I had written.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.830
And there were comments saying,
"This is sample code.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:12.250
Do not cut and paste this code,"
cut and pasted into

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.250
their code.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:17.430
I mean, that is how lazy
some developers are.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:18.780
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, so basically,
the answer is--

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.310
first of all, are you saying--

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:21.730
Did I say "lazy"?

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.162
I meant awesome.

00:29:23.162 --> 00:29:24.110
DAN GALPIN: Awesome!

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.930
Wait, put up the awesome.

00:29:24.930 --> 00:29:26.960
Come on, we need the awesome.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.645
So then it--

00:29:30.645 --> 00:29:31.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh yeah.

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:32.470
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.285
So--

00:29:33.285 --> 00:29:36.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: We do kind of need
like a psychedelic Dan

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.290
with like the word "awesome"--

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:39.430
there you go.

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:42.990
DAN GALPIN: So Frima actually
made one of favorite Android

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.150
games, which is a space
shooter for free.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.870
And the game was cool, but the
best part about it was the

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:50.410
epically silly story that they
put together for it.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.450
IAN NI-LEWIS: That was cool.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.540
By the way, I just want
to interrupt and--

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.610
do you realize that it took me
like 45 minutes to find those

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.900
damn Mandelbrot coordinates?

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.870
DAN GALPIN: [LAUGH], nice.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:02.000
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway,
go ahead.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.910
DAN GALPIN: So we appreciate
the time and effort you put

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:05.590
into this show.

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.430
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's a complete
waste of time, actually.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.360
DAN GALPIN: It is.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.970
But, you know, you
learn something.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:12.580
So this game is a game
in which you

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.950
control a squad of nuns.

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:18.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: Already
I'm sold.

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.250
DAN GALPIN: So the only thing
about this game is that I find

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:23.110
that most of the time, I--

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, that's cool.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.340
I like that art style.

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:26.650
DAN GALPIN: The art
style is awesome.

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:27.190
Most of the time--

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: And this
is actually--

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.450
I have to admit, this is another
thing that we're

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.890
starting to notice is
that even that pause

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.650
button, that's cool.

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.580
Just a lot a little--
and this is one

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:38.980
thing that's nice about--

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:42.730
we were actually in a meeting
earlier, not today, but a

00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:43.490
couple days ago.

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:45.920
And we were talking about what's
different between doing

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.770
apps and doing games.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:51.520
And a big piece of it is
games are so awesome.

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.580
On Android, you always get a
completely different set of

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.640
ideas and design things.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.740
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, it's
like going to--

00:30:58.740 --> 00:30:59.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's so cool.

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:01.070
DAN GALPIN: It's like a
designer's paradise.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:04.450
Design whatever you want,
as long as it's awesome.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:05.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: And that
was sort of this--

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:06.245
yeah.

00:31:06.245 --> 00:31:09.750
DAN GALPIN: And my hat is off,
by the way, to Frima's

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:11.240
designers on this one.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.010
They did a beautiful job
with the art style.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
it's so pretty.

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:14.930
What do you call that?

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:17.660
It's like, I don't know,
"Powerpuff Girls" meets "The

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:20.060
Addams Family." It's like
this bizarre emo

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.440
cartoon, and it's great.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.680
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, these
are seriously emo

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.610
nuns that are in this.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:25.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's a nun?

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:25.810
DAN GALPIN: That's a nun.

00:31:25.810 --> 00:31:26.150
Yeah, look at that.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.710
See the hot nun with
the habit?

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:28.780
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, man.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.280
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's like they
just invaded my nightmares.

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:39.530
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, so this is
the burly-ass boss nun here

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.460
who takes things out
with her shotgun.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: So she's
a tank nun?

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:43.890
DAN GALPIN: She's a tank nun.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:44.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.120
DAN GALPIN: You see there's
also different kinds of

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:46.520
characters.

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:48.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, what's
knife nun doing here?

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.250
DAN GALPIN: Knife nun is--

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.410
IAN NI-LEWIS: Kind of standing
back there, being eye candy?

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:52.600
What's going on there?

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.380
DAN GALPIN: She actually--

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:54.840
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think that's
actually a little bit

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.000
offensive to both nuns
and women as a whole.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.860
DAN GALPIN: What?

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: Just, you
know, the hot nun.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:02.270
DAN GALPIN: Why?

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.150
What's wrong with
nuns being hot?

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.832
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually, what I'm
wondering is, how did she

00:32:05.832 --> 00:32:07.090
get the eyepatch?

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:12.180
There she is in the act of
devoting her life to worship

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.550
and quiet contemplation.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.300
How did she lose an eye?

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.830
DAN GALPIN: You know, that's one
of the great mysteries of

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:18.700
this game, actually.

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:20.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: I get the feeling
that the nuns in this

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.700
game aren't real nuns.

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.740
DAN GALPIN: It's
very possible.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.620
They also like to hang around
in bikinis apparently.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:33.060
So they're a new kind
of kick-butt nun.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.600
Actually, nuns are pretty
kick-butt, by the way, in

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.450
general, just by
my experiences.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:39.285
Those are some serious
badass--

00:32:39.285 --> 00:32:39.540
IAN NI-LEWIS: Really?

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.812
Did you meet a lot of nuns
in Hebrew school?

00:32:42.812 --> 00:32:45.160
DAN GALPIN: [LAUGH],
I actually did not

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.270
go to Hebrew school.

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.730
But no--

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:49.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: What kind
of a half-Jew are you?

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.050
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.620
But I will say that--

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.490
oh, here we are.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:56.660
So the problem with this game
for me, by the way, is that

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:58.970
the game is actually well
thought out, but the controls

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:02.480
for the games are actually
mostly what I'm fighting.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.320
And the game tries to make
things easy for me.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.050
I say, I want to attack
that guy.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.070
And it continuously attacks.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.010
But I feel there's less visceral
pleasure in this.

00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.550
And it's still annoying.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.260
Because sometimes you're
dragging to say, I want to

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:19.400
attack this guy, and you miss,
and the nun just walks over.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:23.100
IAN NI-LEWIS: Ooh, yeah,
that's rough.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.660
DAN GALPIN: Or that guy just
doesn't get attacked because

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:26.450
he just happens to be
standing there.

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:28.490
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hang on, though,
I think we need to--

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.885
two, three, four, [SINGING]

00:33:29.885 --> 00:33:33.530
how do you solve a problem
like a skeleton?

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.390
DAN GALPIN: So I can also--
there's also special abilities

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.005
like I can make my nun
invisible there.

00:33:38.005 --> 00:33:40.610
So I can click on her, and
I can say, I want to go

00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:41.630
boom on this guy.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.530
Take out this gate.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:43.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: Gate?

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:45.140
Is that what we're calling it?

00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.770
DAN GALPIN: It is the gate.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.190
It is, I believe, some
sort of hell-gate or

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.980
something like that.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: Because that
resembles nothing

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.020
so much as a gate.

00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:53.530
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:58.480
So anyway, so that's
the basic game.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.100
The main issue with this game
that I had was that I kind of

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.830
my found myself fighting
the controls.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:03.560
On the other hand--

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.340
IAN NI-LEWIS: By the way, I
think we should pause and

00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:09.380
mention that our heads
are blocking a

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:10.880
massive amount of gameplay.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:11.429
DAN GALPIN: That's true.

00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:14.030
IAN NI-LEWIS: Also,
don't care.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.739
It's our last show.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:16.830
Deal with it.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.100
Rock on.

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.918
DAN GALPIN: Rock on.

00:34:19.918 --> 00:34:21.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:25.639
DAN GALPIN: So Ian, before the
show, said, Dan, take this

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:27.929
scene and sprinkle it liberally
throughout the show

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:29.340
wherever it's appropriate.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.520
We're going to call this
the Dan awesome scene.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.290
And so there--

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:34.679
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, Phamster
has done an amazing job.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:35.929
DAN GALPIN: As always.

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:42.620
So the main issues with "Nun
Attack" that I saw is I kind

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:47.540
of wanted to feel a little bit
more feedback when I actually

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.170
targeted someone.

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.350
Like I wanted it to make it
clear this nun was targeting

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.610
that character, and
I don't see that.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:54.300
And so there's lots of times
where the nun does something I

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:55.239
don't expect.

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:58.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: So yeah, you drag,
and it wasn't obvious

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:00.940
when you could finish
your drag.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:01.610
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:35:01.610 --> 00:35:02.080
And I really--

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:02.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: But why?

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:05.820
It seems like it would be so
obvious to just brighten that

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.760
character up or something.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:09.460
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, and that's
what I think needs to happen.

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:12.750
And also, once a character is
attacking someone, I want to

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.840
make it really obvious.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:16.640
Like I want a little picture
of the guy or a little

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.450
direction, a little line
saying that this one is

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.320
attacking that one.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.900
So there's a couple things I
think need to be done to make

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:22.460
the game better.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.740
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what I
think is a terrible idea?

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:23.950
DAN GALPIN: What?

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: Your picture
of a guy idea.

00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.180
I like mine better.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:27.280
DAN GALPIN: OK.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:30.220
And then "Nun Attack" also needs
to get rid of verifying

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.350
the download every
time you launch,

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:33.610
because that just sucks.

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:33.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.160
What is your dude doing?

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.960
I thought you were just--

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.645
are you actually doing a CRC
check on it or something?

00:35:39.645 --> 00:35:40.260
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.100
I wrote a little CRC checker.

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.580
And so it unzips the
entire file.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:45.870
IAN NI-LEWIS: That was literally
just to pad your

00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:47.076
resume, wasn't it?

00:35:47.076 --> 00:35:51.810
It was like, 2012, wrote
a CRC check.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:53.700
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, that was
pretty much-- well, it was

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.850
actually because when I was
developing it, I was making a

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.860
download resume function.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.180
And when I made the download
resume function, I wanted to

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.150
make sure that the
resumption--

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:08.810
the downloads were actually
getting done correctly.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:10.735
So of course, the first thing
I did was wrote a verifier

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:11.920
that would verify the CRCs.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:12.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: I love it.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.640
Dan wrote all of this over the
course of three months.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:22.050
Now that doesn't sound like much
except when you consider

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:25.460
that we'd promised to have it
done in three weeks and not

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.675
having it done delayed
the entire feature.

00:36:27.675 --> 00:36:30.100
DAN GALPIN: You know, you're
making me look bad here.

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:32.410
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what
makes you look great, though?

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:33.660
DAN GALPIN: This hat.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.130
IAN NI-LEWIS: And if you don't
go mullet on us, I don't know

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.680
what I'm gonna do.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:43.730
DAN GALPIN: Cancel the show.

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:46.470
So let's--

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, I'm telling
you, it's either mullet or--

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.780
alternate possibility--

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.800
shaved.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:55.170
DAN GALPIN: Shaved?

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:56.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: That
would be awesome,

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.480
especially with that beard.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.170
DAN GALPIN: Oh yeah.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:01.510
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm thinking
Kane from "Command and

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.430
Conquer."

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.150
DAN GALPIN: Yes, yes.

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:05.810
That would work.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:06.300
IAN NI-LEWIS: Let's face it.

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.590
Everything Dan does is epic.

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:09.330
DAN GALPIN: So this game was
actually one of the ones that

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.550
was nominated, just in
case you thought I

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:12.400
was going to ignore--

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:12.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, awesome.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:13.290
Who nominated it?

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:14.920
DAN GALPIN: I don't know.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Let's call
him nominator guy.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.860
Nominator guy, let's
see how you did.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.720
DAN GALPIN: The developer of the
game-- so this is a game

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.050
which looks like another game
that we actually saw.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:23.870
Your goal is to get--

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:24.510
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh man.

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:26.000
Is this a tilt game?

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.250
DAN GALPIN: It's a tilt game
where the goal is to get the--

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:29.990
in fact, it's just like a game
that used to, I think, have

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.110
sheep in it.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:32.440
But now it has ghosts in it.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:32.910
IAN NI-LEWIS: You
are kidding me.

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:34.050
DAN GALPIN: It is
the same game.

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:34.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: You
are kidding me.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:34.800
DAN GALPIN: Nope.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:37.120
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK, you know
what, nominator guy?

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.620
I began to suspect that
you have an ulterior

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.130
motive of some kind.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.240
DAN GALPIN: Well, I actually
like the burning ghosts rather

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:46.040
than the sheep, honestly.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:46.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: I would
have gone with

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:48.430
burning goats, but OK.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.990
DAN GALPIN: Goats.

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.710
Oh, and I've got to
avoid the fire.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.460
No, the fire, we bounce
off of the fire.

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.600
IAN NI-LEWIS: I can't
see a thing here.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.580
It's all fire and--

00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.070
you know.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.200
It's got a sort of spotlight
thing going on.

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.250
DAN GALPIN: So cool--

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:02.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: But
you know what?

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:03.370
OK, can I just say this?

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.010
DAN GALPIN: Box2D game,
yeah, yeah.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.148
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hang on.

00:38:06.148 --> 00:38:07.920
You think it's Box2d?

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.405
You think it's that complex?

00:38:09.405 --> 00:38:11.240
DAN GALPIN: It is Box2D because
it's using AndEngine.

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.375
So I'm pretty sure it's Box2D.

00:38:12.375 --> 00:38:13.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Eh, fair enough.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:14.980
No, but what I was--

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:15.826
eh, go ahead.

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:17.240
I don't care.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:20.670
DAN GALPIN: So first of all,
this guy actually, what I will

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.240
say, learned a lot from
professional game developers.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.410
Because professional
game developers do

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:25.340
exactly this thing.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.450
They take a game that's
based on sheep, and

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.460
they skin it for Halloween.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.230
And then they're like, look
at my game, everyone.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.460
I've got a Halloween game.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.990
Not that we know any developer
who would ever do

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:38.230
something like that.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.510
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:42.060
So when we say professional,
that's not necessarily a mark

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:43.820
of quality.

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.820
It just means they make money
from what they do.

00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:48.570
DAN GALPIN: Well, honestly,
if you can skin a game

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:51.010
successfully, and actually, I
think this works better than

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.470
the original sheep game.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.280
Because I never quite understood
why I was-- those

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:54.730
were sheep.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:56.150
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's a
really good point.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:57.355
Now the storyline is better.

00:38:57.355 --> 00:38:58.200
DAN GALPIN: It actually--

00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hang
on, hang on.

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:03.020
I just got a message on
my Amp'd Mobile phone.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.050
Let's see.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:05.350
DAN GALPIN: Hello.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:06.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh,
it's Googleween.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:11.380
DAN GALPIN: The Friday Games
Review has now become an ad

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.010
for acceptable.tv.

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:16.060
If you haven't seen
it, tune in.

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:16.510
All right.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:22.940
So anyways, great job in
skinning your game.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.980
IAN NI-LEWIS: But
you know what?

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:30.160
What a horrible job of skinning
your interactions.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:30.560
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: How many dialogues
have we see now that

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.790
have not been cool?

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:34.370
DAN GALPIN: I know.

00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:35.400
And it's sad.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:37.480
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I know it's
our system dialogue.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.740
But I'm going to go out
on a limb here.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.270
Yeah, let's just come
out of the closet.

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.830
Our system dialogues,
not cool.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:45.340
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
don't use them.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.030
Actually, as a general rule,
we tell developers, even in

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.300
apps, not to use our system
dialogues for almost anything.

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.480
Because the reality is, you
almost never want to stop the

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.640
user's progress in the middle of
something unless it's sort

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.050
of like, this action
will destroy all of

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:03.200
your data, you know.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.650
Would you really, really
want to do this?

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:07.490
Most of the time, if you're in
the middle of any kind of

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:10.160
progression, what you'd want to
see is a separate screen.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.630
You'd want to see a true
interstitial screen rather

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.650
than a dialogue, even
within apps.

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:16.880
Or you'd want to see it be a
part of the existing screen.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:21.190
In a game like this, what I want
to see is, take a look at

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:24.790
what happened with a game like
"Angry Birds," where you

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.360
actually see, yes, a dialogue.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.050
But it's really an interstitial
screen.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:31.640
It feels very, very much
part of the game.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.350
And you get to see a whole
bunch of stats

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:34.300
about how you did.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.380
And really, that would
be really nice.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.400
I actually want to know how
many times did the ghost

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.680
bounce off the wall.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.620
I want to know--

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.250
I don't know, anything about
the game that might be

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.710
interesting.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:44.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: Actually,
that's true.

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:48.490
I always love stats.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:52.390
Definitely, as I've been playing
a game, I don't know

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.815
if you've heard of it, little
bit of a new game for me,

00:40:54.815 --> 00:40:56.790
"Radiant Defense"--

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:59.150
DAN GALPIN: You're playing
"Radiant Defense"?

00:40:59.150 --> 00:40:59.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:00.560
DAN GALPIN: Holy moly.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.670
IAN NI-LEWIS: And I think to
myself, wow, it'd be really

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:04.920
cool if I could get the
stats on this tower.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:05.850
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, know
how much it's killed

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:08.060
and stuff like that.

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:08.740
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I like that.

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.150
That's a great idea.

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:13.160
So that was "DemonBall,"
by the way, which

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.800
was actually nominated.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.100
I want to send props out to
"Greedy Spiders" for making

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:19.620
those changes.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.100
I'm not to going to go through
the game because we're running

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.160
low on time.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: We are?

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.960
DAN GALPIN: Relatively, yeah.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.820
So there's a non-Halloween
game I just want to call

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.730
attention to because it comes
from Clapfoot, and I

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:31.930
absolutely really
love this game.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:32.842
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wait,
wait, wait.

00:41:32.842 --> 00:41:33.670
Who's Clapfoot again?

00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:36.260
DAN GALPIN: Clapfoot
made "Tank Hero."

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:36.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, OK.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.200
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, those guys.

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.680
So this is their take--

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's cool.

00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:41.670
That's good-looking.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:43.140
DAN GALPIN: This is their
take on a shooting game.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.680
And this is pretty cool
for a freemium

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.030
shooting game, actually.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.390
They mostly nailed it.

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: I totally like
that beginning scene.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:53.070
But now, what are we--

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:56.120
we're basically looking at
a generic side-scroller?

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.290
DAN GALPIN: Yes, it's a
generic side-scroller.

00:41:58.290 --> 00:42:00.000
IAN NI-LEWIS: But I like the
idea that they've got a

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.620
loadout screen and stuff.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:02.550
Can you actually--

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:04.430
is there any kind of
RPG element to it?

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.790
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.670
So basically, you slowly
build up your ship.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:09.870
Or you can buy things to make
your ship more awesome.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:10.150
IAN NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:11.340
DAN GALPIN: And as you go
through the levels, there

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.580
actually are four different
backgrounds in the game, and

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.770
you see them a lot, with lots
of different enemies that

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:19.110
slowly start coming.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:19.620
Each level--

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.780
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's the tough
thing about side-scrollers.

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.100
You really need a lot of art.

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:22.970
DAN GALPIN: You need
a lot of art.

00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:26.120
And so this game does not
have a lot of art.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:27.930
But it's actually really
fun on top of that.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:28.820
This is an hour--

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: I have to mention,
because this just

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.500
made me think of it,
so did you end

00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.950
up playing the "Zaxxon"?

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:35.850
DAN GALPIN: I did not.

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:37.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Didn't they end up
calling it "Zaxxon Escape"?

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.035
DAN GALPIN: It is, yeah.

00:42:38.035 --> 00:42:38.990
And it looks awesome.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:40.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, I gotta
give a shoutout to these

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:43.060
guys because they did some
interesting things.

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:47.580
Now of course, I'm sorry, name
of the studio because I'm

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.240
totally blanking on it.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.580
It's the same guys that did--

00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.620
DAN GALPIN: Free--

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:53.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: "SnowboardX,"
right?

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.450
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, what was it?

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:54.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: FreeRange.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:55.130
DAN GALPIN: FreeRange.

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.890
It was FreeRange.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:56.270
OK.

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:01.370
So FreeRange and our buddy
Wayne, Wayne Karo, your last

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:03.260
name sounds like corn syrup.

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.470
But anyway--

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:05.800
DAN GALPIN: He's a sweet guy.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:08.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, no, awesome
guy, totally awesome.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.000
I mean, the whole FreeRange
team, they've been in games

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:11.910
for a long, long time.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:12.280
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:12.650
IAN NI-LEWIS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.180
Tony Hawk, really cool stuff.

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.620
The snowboard game is great.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.600
But anyway, so they put
out this thing.

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.060
And obviously, it's interesting
because there's a

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:24.750
lot of games that you could
say are inspired by other

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.930
games, when what you really mean
is total ripoff of this

00:43:27.930 --> 00:43:29.390
other game.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:34.590
"Zaxxon Escape" is inspired by
"Temple Run" in the most

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.500
classic way, in that it is--

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:37.560
DAN GALPIN: It's true
inspiration.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:40.540
The game is heavily,
heavily different.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:40.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:43:40.900 --> 00:43:43.970
And it adds a third dimension.

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:47.100
It's like "Temple Run"
meets "Descent."

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.050
So really cool stuff.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:49.990
And they originally
showed it to us.

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.180
I think it was a
different name.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.140
And then they hooked up and Sega
and they got the "Zaxxon"

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:53.770
name on it, which--

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:54.195
DAN GALPIN: Shh!

00:43:54.195 --> 00:43:55.180
IAN NI-LEWIS: --was
absolutely cool.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.300
DAN GALPIN: It was designed
as Zaxxon.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:56.640
Shh.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: It was,
absolutely.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:00.150
Which I love.

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:02.675
I'm glad that they brought
that name back.

00:44:02.675 --> 00:44:03.910
That is some cool stuff.

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.870
DAN GALPIN: So "Zaxxon," I can
tell you, many years ago, I

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:08.700
actually owned a "Zaxxon"
stand-up.

00:44:11.330 --> 00:44:11.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: Wow.

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:12.890
DAN GALPIN: I know, I know.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: You're like
that kid in that one

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:17.130
Richard Pryor movie.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:18.630
You have everything.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:19.070
DAN GALPIN: No.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:23.120
But I did have a "Zaxxon"
stand-up, back when they came

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:23.750
down in price.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:27.030
You can get them
for about $300.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:29.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: He means $3,000.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:30.080
DAN GALPIN: Thank you.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:30.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know why?

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:31.770
DAN GALPIN: Thank you, thank
you, translator man.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:33.010
IAN NI-LEWIS: Dan is
phenomenally wealthy.

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:34.315
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, right.

00:44:34.315 --> 00:44:35.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: Come on--

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:37.960
houses, exactly, and a Prius.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.435
DAN GALPIN: Hey, all I can say
is that you drive a BMW.

00:44:40.435 --> 00:44:43.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: How did you
get a Prius, anyway?

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:49.790
BMWs, in San Jose, Silicon
Valley, dude, you find those

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:52.820
like on the side of
the road, man.

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.140
DAN GALPIN: Well, certainly once
their lease has run out.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:59.950
But yeah, no, this
is a lot of fun.

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:01.150
You can waste a lot of
time with this game.

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:02.190
And honestly, they did
a really, really

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.940
great job with it.

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:07.030
So good use of Android,
and I've been

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.150
really happy with it.

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:09.240
IAN NI-LEWIS: Cool, cool.

00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:09.910
DAN GALPIN: I wanted
to give a shoutout.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:13.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now I have to ask,
though, is that really

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.230
full resolution?

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:18.180
DAN GALPIN: That is, as far as
I can tell, full resolution.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:22.180
It's just that the artwork in
the back, the textures are a

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:22.750
little blurry.

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's
just the beer.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.220
DAN GALPIN: No, the textures
are blurry.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.280
You can see if you look at the
sharp lines around the

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.595
geometry, you can see that's
actually full resolution.

00:45:29.595 --> 00:45:30.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah,
I saw that.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.030
So it's really just
the backgrounds.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.740
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:34.410
IAN NI-LEWIS: So I guess
we're saying that's a

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:35.650
depth of field effect?

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:39.780
DAN GALPIN: No, it's just
low-resolution textures.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.045
IAN NI-LEWIS: This screen,
though, is really cool.

00:45:41.045 --> 00:45:41.840
I like this screen.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.850
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:43.930
That screen is awesome.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.590
It makes you think the game is
going to be perhaps a little

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.570
more epic than it actually is.

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:49.250
But I really love the game.

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:50.540
I thought they did a beautiful
job on it.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm sort of ready
to do my loadout into my

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.880
giant robot when I see
a screen like that.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.285
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, you're like,
[INAUDIBLE], exactly, exactly.

00:45:57.285 --> 00:45:59.460
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, that's
one thing we don't have enough

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.705
of is giant robot games.

00:46:00.705 --> 00:46:03.040
They're very difficult to
do on a touchscreen.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.156
DAN GALPIN: Yeah,
no, it's true.

00:46:04.156 --> 00:46:05.800
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, if
you're doing a giant robot

00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:08.520
game, though, let me know.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:08.925
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:46:08.925 --> 00:46:11.023
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know, I don't
know why you'd let me

00:46:11.023 --> 00:46:11.990
know, but what the hell.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.340
DAN GALPIN: So, and speaking
about letting us know, so I'm

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.610
not playing to take the
moderator down for this.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.340
Because you never know when
we'll actually do another

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.180
games review.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.430
We're not going to be doing them
weekly, that's for sure.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:22.970
And if we do them, we're
going to try to--

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:23.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know what?

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:24.880
We're going to do them
guerrilla style.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:28.510
One day, you'll be sitting in
your cafe in, I don't know.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:33.430
You know, wherever you live,
be it Singapore, be it

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:38.540
Bangladesh, be it London,
the fashionable side,

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:39.680
any of these places.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:43.040
Dan might just descend on you
and do a video game review.

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:44.740
DAN GALPIN: That is
a cue, Mr. Pham.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.530
IAN NI-LEWIS: If you live
anywhere in the continental

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:49.400
United States, apart
from New York?

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.320
DAN GALPIN: Was there anything
on the livestream, by the way?

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:51.930
IAN NI-LEWIS: Probably not.

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:52.406
DAN GALPIN: Let's take a look.

00:46:52.406 --> 00:46:53.260
Is there anything on
the livestream?

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:53.500
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:55.610
So let's take questions
from the audience.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:57.620
DAN GALPIN: Is there
an audience?

00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:59.440
IAN NI-LEWIS: I love how Dan's
like, oh man, we gotta get

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:00.180
through these games.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.210
No we don't.

00:47:01.210 --> 00:47:01.930
DAN GALPIN: We got through
all of them.

00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:04.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: What we've really
got to do is take

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.140
questions from the audience.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:06.990
DAN GALPIN: All right.

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.040
So questions from
the audience.

00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.090
DANIEL PHAM: People were
actually confused whether or

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:12.180
not this a Halloween-themed
show or not.

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.580
And it's probably because I
didn't bother to edit the

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.200
description or any
of the titles.

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.700
So sorry, guys.

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.005
IAN NI-LEWIS: Waiit.

00:47:19.005 --> 00:47:20.810
Yeah, it totally is Halloween.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:22.850
What's the matter?

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:24.120
You didn't edit what?

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.960
DANIEL PHAM: I didn't edit any
of the descriptions saying

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.970
that, oh, this is going to be
a Halloween-themed show.

00:47:27.970 --> 00:47:30.050
We haven't done a themed
Friday Games

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:31.330
Review in a long time.

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:31.855
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:47:31.855 --> 00:47:33.640
DAN GALPIN: We did announce it
on the last show, but that

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.020
doesn't mean anyone found out.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:35.560
So sorry about that.

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.080
IAN NI-LEWIS: And also, I seem
to remember that Dan spent

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.770
most of last week under the
influence of some pretty

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:44.540
amazing London substances.

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:45.446
So--

00:47:45.446 --> 00:47:46.990
DANIEL PHAM: That may
or may not be true.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:47.910
I cannot confirm
nor deny that.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:48.570
IAN NI-LEWIS: Right, right.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.130
DAN GALPIN: We're did you guys
stay in London, by the way?

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:51.480
DANIEL PHAM: I stayed
in the Grosvenor.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:53.260
DAN GALPIN: Oh, nice hotel.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.690
Very nice hotel.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:55.160
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I guess.

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.640
Anyway.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:59.210
DAN GALPIN: I miss the London
office and the truly amazing

00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:00.940
coffee lab that they
have up there.

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:01.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.380
We stayed in, what, Belgravia,
Belgrave House?

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.630
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, Belgrave
House, which is awesome, too.

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.720
IAN NI-LEWIS: When I worked
for Xbox, we'd stay at St

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.760
Martin's Lane, which is the
most epic hotel ever.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.110
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:12.310
IAN NI-LEWIS: We got some
deal there or something.

00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:15.320
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, I was gonna
say, our T and E is not as

00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.604
epic as what you guys had
with the Xbox, so--

00:48:19.604 --> 00:48:21.890
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well,
shit happens.

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:25.410
DAN GALPIN: So anything else
from the livestream that's

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:26.240
interesting?

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:29.042
DANIEL PHAM: Some people didn't
catch the first few

00:48:29.042 --> 00:48:31.531
minutes of the show and catch
on to the fact that this is

00:48:31.531 --> 00:48:33.790
going to be the last episode
for a while.

00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:37.400
So for those of you tuning in
right now, this is going to be

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:38.210
the last show.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:41.690
IAN NI-LEWIS: This is the final
show, final episode of

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:42.970
the Friday Games Review.

00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:44.550
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.760
Whatever happens with games,
we're still going to do--

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:47.520
we still care about games.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:48.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: No, we've
had a great run.

00:48:48.590 --> 00:48:53.730
I mean, over a year now, we've
been basically kicking back

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:57.070
about 2 o'clock in the
afternoon, helping ourselves

00:48:57.070 --> 00:49:01.260
to some beer that Google bought,
and just ripping into

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.850
some games.

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:04.210
After which--

00:49:04.210 --> 00:49:08.190
well, actually, what we used
to do was leave this studio

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:10.376
and go directly into another
meeting where we

00:49:10.376 --> 00:49:11.530
just ripped on games.

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:12.710
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:13.690
So--

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:17.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: Basically, people
grow, things become

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:20.300
more corporate, we add people
to the organization.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:22.920
And all of the sudden, it's
like, dude, getting drunk on a

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.310
Friday, is that really cool?

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:24.760
And I'm like, yeah.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.730
Well, OK, why don't you do
that on your own time?

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:29.850
I'm like, OK, fine.

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.420
DAN GALPIN: And actually, I
find that the more beer I

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.160
drink, the more I grow.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: In some
dimensions, yes.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:36.940
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:43.150
So yeah, we're going to be
doing more with games.

00:49:43.150 --> 00:49:45.810
And I think that for
us, there's a

00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:46.790
lot of exciting stuff.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.120
We want to get together with our
buddies over at Chrome and

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.605
on the web side of things.

00:49:50.605 --> 00:49:52.200
And as I said, I'm
really excited.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:54.170
You heard me sort of alluding
to this last week.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:56.160
But I'm really excited about
the new Chromebook.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.520
I think it has the potential
to be a game monster.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.240
And I want to see what
people do with it.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.840
So I'm sort of going to be
looking at that side

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.510
of things as well.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:08.350
But what I was going to
say is, keep throwing

00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:09.260
stuff in the moderator.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.680
You never know when we're going
to come back and do a

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.570
new games review.

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:14.240
It's just that we're not
doing it every week.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.590
And if we do it again, we're
going to try to make it

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:19.490
interesting and make it part of
a technically themed show.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:21.860
So it's going to be us sitting
here with a bunch of guys from

00:50:21.860 --> 00:50:25.200
NVIDIA going through PerfHUD or
us sitting here with some

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.420
guys from our graphics team,
talking about how best to

00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:32.930
utilize feature X and really try
to get into a little bit

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:33.560
more of the technical
discussion.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: That's really what
it came down to, right?

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:36.270
Dan and I are engineers.

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:39.830
We've been writing computer
software for years and years.

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:44.790
And we put this together to
start by just showcasing some

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:46.380
games that we liked.

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:48.910
But it turned out that a lot
of the things that we were

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.540
saying about games were
just universally true

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:52.510
over and over again.

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:53.470
We kind of got bored with it.

00:50:53.470 --> 00:50:56.410
And so we decided it would be
a lot more fun to do some

00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:57.140
technical stuff.

00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:59.210
And in the last couple weeks,
you've probably seen us geek

00:50:59.210 --> 00:51:01.990
out about GPUs and things like
that because Dan knows one

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.655
thing about GPUs, that they're
either tiled or not, and he

00:51:04.655 --> 00:51:07.700
has incredibly in-depth
knowledge about that one fact.

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:08.870
It's awesome.

00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:10.290
He's so cute.

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:12.460
But other than that--

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.330
DAN GALPIN: No, no, it's true.

00:51:13.330 --> 00:51:15.450
And actually, when I was
trying to look at the

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:18.080
"Zombiewood" shaders to see if
I could figure out anything

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.960
they were doing wrong, and
to be honest, I couldn't.

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.870
So I looked at it, and
I'm like, no, that

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:25.740
glClear even looks OK.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:29.560
IAN NI-LEWIS: So anyway, the
point being that I think this

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.890
one's run its course.

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:33.120
But we're going to be coming
back with something bigger and

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:34.130
better later.

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:35.390
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:37.760
And that does involve us
drinking more beer

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:38.700
between now and then.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think there will
probably be beer involved

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:42.720
because when is there not beer
involved with games.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.100
DAN GALPIN: That is true.

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:45.346
And you know, beer is
actually part of

00:51:45.346 --> 00:51:46.430
Google culture on Fridays.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:46.890
We do have--

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:47.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: That is true.

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:49.240
DAN GALPIN: TGIF [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.500
And that much is probably
not secret.

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.210
IAN NI-LEWIS: We just want to
give a shoutout to all the

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:56.700
people that have followed us for
a while now, Marcus, the

00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:59.280
Austrian dude, and the other
guys that hate on us in all

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:01.278
the comments and stuff
like that.

00:52:01.278 --> 00:52:02.670
DANIEL PHAM: Yeah, he actually
jumped into the comments and

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:03.090
said hi, so.

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:03.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: Hi dude.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:03.970
DAN GALPIN: Hey, Marcus.

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:04.550
Awesome.

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:07.160
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, and I'm
sorry that we never managed to

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.910
get that Austrian beer.

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.830
I couldn't find a place in
San Jose that sourced it.

00:52:11.830 --> 00:52:13.730
DAN GALPIN: I blame America
for that one, actually.

00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, probably.

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.240
Anyway, so yeah, we
love you guys.

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.960
We're really happy that
you all tuned in.

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.070
We've always had a really good
audience for this show.

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:27.070
It's actually been one of the
best shows that we've done on

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:28.140
Android Developers Live.

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:32.282
But it's just time to move
on and actually--

00:52:32.282 --> 00:52:33.960
OK, let me be perfectly
honest.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:35.470
The thing is that--

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:36.330
DAN GALPIN: What?

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:37.085
IAN NI-LEWIS: When Dan Pham--

00:52:37.085 --> 00:52:38.210
DAN GALPIN: When are
you not honest?

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:41.590
IAN NI-LEWIS: --sent in his
expense report for London,

00:52:41.590 --> 00:52:44.530
Andy Rubin actually
looked at it.

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:44.750
DAN GALPIN: Dude!

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:49.470
IAN NI-LEWIS: And Billy's like,
hey, yeah, right, we're

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:52.870
sending Dan to London for this
great Android video thing.

00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:55.180
And Andy's like, oh, maybe
I should watch that.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.890
And Billy's like,
you know what?

00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:58.460
We should shut down
the games review.

00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:03.190
DAN GALPIN: I think
that pretty much

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:05.010
sums it up right there.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:08.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: Anyway,
raise a glass guys.

00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:09.090
Cheers.

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:11.140
We've had a super great time.

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:14.230
Dan, let us know, is there
anything else that we should

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:18.020
be asking or answering
on the feed before we

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.470
sign the hell off?

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:20.810
DANIEL PHAM: There's absolutely
nothing worth

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:22.360
mentioning.

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:24.750
IAN NI-LEWIS: You hear that,
YouTube commenters?

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:27.450
Quit acting like YouTube
commenters.

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:28.760
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, exactly.

00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:31.890
So anyways, this is goodbye.

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:34.230
But we'll certainly be around.

00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:35.390
IAN NI-LEWIS: Watch
our Google+ feed.

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:39.740
Of course, we will continue to
be doing the App Clinic with

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:44.370
Reto Meier and myself on
Fridays, Android Design in

00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:48.610
Action on Tuesdays, something
on Wednesdays that I have no

00:53:48.610 --> 00:53:49.880
idea what it will be.

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:54.230
And Dan will be back at some
point doing something with

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.570
games, and it will be awesome.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:57.480
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:53:57.480 --> 00:53:58.410
DANIEL PHAM: And probably
his hat, too.

00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:59.330
One of his hats.

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:00.770
DAN GALPIN: Probably one
of my hats as well.

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:02.340
And you know, and perhaps I
might even come and make a

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.250
guest appearance on--

00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:04.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: You know,
actually, that's probably what

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:06.280
we should have mentioned is the
whole thing has run its

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.950
course because you have
run out of hats.

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:11.560
DAN GALPIN: There is an endless
supply of new hats

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.710
that can be acquired.

00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:16.220
But it's true, I did actually
have to go out and run out and

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:17.280
get this one last night.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:17.615
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:54:17.615 --> 00:54:21.580
Well, you can always reach us
through our Google+ stream,

00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:23.220
which you can get to at
developer.android.com/+.

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:31.650
And we look forward to
hearing from you.

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:34.680
Give a shoutout to +Ian
Ni-Lewis, +Dan Galpin if you

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.270
want to talk to us directly.

00:54:36.270 --> 00:54:39.370
Otherwise, just leave some
random comments, and somebody

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:41.380
will read them and respond.

00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.720
I can almost guarantee it.

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.000
DAN GALPIN: Yeah, we actually
have real humans

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.730
that look at this.

00:54:46.730 --> 00:54:48.090
IAN NI-LEWIS: So we've
reached the end.

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:52.410
I was going to buy some truly
epic beer today, but then I

00:54:52.410 --> 00:54:55.150
ran out of time, money,
and inclination.

00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:57.400
But Dead Guy Ale seems like
the right way to sign off.

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.210
DAN GALPIN: But you did make
the amazing Mandelbrot

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:01.630
background, so you're
completely forgiven.

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:02.190
IAN NI-LEWIS: There you go.

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:03.440
So all right.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:10.850
And Dan Galpin-- you know, the
very first episode, you were

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:11.850
like, oh, no man.

00:55:11.850 --> 00:55:13.290
I'm going to say my own name.

00:55:13.290 --> 00:55:14.850
I was like, "I'm Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.830
With me, as always, is Dan
Galpin." You were like, oh,

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:20.270
no, I'm going to say "Dan
Galpin." The very last

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:24.970
fricking minute of the show,
you can't step up.

00:55:24.970 --> 00:55:26.510
DAN GALPIN: As always,
I'm Dan Galpin.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:27.820
IAN NI-LEWIS: I'm
Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.520
DAN GALPIN: And that's
the way it was.

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:30.740
Cheers.

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:32.630
IAN NI-LEWIS: Android games.

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:33.830
DAN GALPIN: Cheers.

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:35.080
[LAUGHING].
