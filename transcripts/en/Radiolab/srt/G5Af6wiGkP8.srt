1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,930
Hey Leanne revamped,

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,040
there is no sheen. Leann? Yes,

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,080
he is Pronoun and element top right king,

4
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:15,350
the most noble guy.

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,100
If there was Shelia,

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,920
how fine, why lie?

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,540
She might be

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,033
[inaudible].

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,630
I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab and today

10
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:45,450
elements. Yeah,

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,450
I carried your oxygen and you walked
beside me through the lobby commenting on

12
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:53,790
the decor when you needed
to stop for breath.

13
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,870
Your hand ran light and steady

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,580
by the ocean of breath twice. I remember

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,610
I carried your oxygen. It was heavy.

16
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,340
A bleak alloy.

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,373
Wow.

18
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:15,823
Steel

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,460
[inaudible] this hour is a collaboration
with poets like the ones you heard and

20
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,500
really are more of musicians,

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,760
reporters and of course the
periodic table of elements.

22
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,043
Speaking of which

23
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,390
our producer Soren Wheeler,

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,280
who's sodium sparked brain conceived to
this entire show. He will lead us off.

25
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,370
So this one starts with a
story I heard from Jamie Lowe.

26
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,650
She's a writer in Brooklyn and at the
heart of this story is this particular 24

27
00:01:51,651 --> 00:01:56,510
hour period in Jamie's life that
um, she is uneasy about have,

28
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,000
let's just set it up for one second.
So what are we about to watch?

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,260
I'm not actually exactly sure where
it starts, but we're about to watch,

30
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:06,020
I think the night before Valentine's Day,

31
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:10,880
2001 I eventually convinced her to sit
down with producer Latif Nasser and sort

32
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,730
of just walk us through the
tape. Go for it. You're,

33
00:02:13,731 --> 00:02:17,150
you're in control there with
the spacebar. All right.

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,210
Yeah. Mine your honor. [inaudible] Jamie.

35
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,020
Hey Jamie. Mike.

36
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,670
It's nighttime. Uh, Jamie
and her friend Mike,

37
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:29,730
he's the one filming there outside his
apartment in Brooklyn and the cameras

38
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:32,880
pointed at a bunch of high school
students who were just walking by.

39
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,340
So what's the deal?
Tell say you want to be

40
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,350
an actress, right? Yeah. Tell
me you need to, I love that.

41
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,390
Good for you. So yeah.
Really? Yeah. That's so cool.

42
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,410
It's by any other name would
smell as sweet. Yeah. Is My enemy

43
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,530
Montague. What's Montague? It is nor
hand, nor foot, nor on north face,

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,810
nor any other part belongs to the man.

45
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,180
I'm like egging them on to recite
it. Retain that dear perfection,

46
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,150
which she owes with that, that
title, everyone you adopt a name.

47
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:07,984
And for the name,

48
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,080
which is no part of the take all my
sisters in a part of that same screaming

49
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,390
babies. So wait, camera eventually turns
to Jamie. She's sitting on the stoop,

50
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,330
a huge curly hair, wide eyes,

51
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,770
and she starts to sing the
kids a song. It does. You know,

52
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,800
cause I can't see,

53
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,180
I was pretty convinced that I was
like a great singer and rapper.

54
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,980
She likes sounded real voice.
Good reviews. Sing a lot in. No,

55
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,650
never. I am not as anger. I just started
thinking like that. I don't know.

56
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:49,720
What was it like? Well
one of the audio drapes,

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,020
it was fun to watch people react or
she made people personally happy.

58
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,620
Whoever she wanted. She would.

59
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:58,870
We went to flea markets and she would
talk to people and she would pull this

60
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,600
spark out of them. It, it just
felt like New York loved her.

61
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,020
That's Mike Ryan Guy
Holding the camera. Yes.

62
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,120
He'd only met Jamie just
three weeks earlier.

63
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,540
Not long after we moved to New York
and they pretty much instantly became

64
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:14,020
friends. She was so positive.

65
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,180
As I recall. She's talking to
some little kids on a stoop,

66
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:23,680
but then that next four or
five hours was pretty defining.

67
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,950
Yeah. By Cameron, my friends,
they cut to Mike's apartment.

68
00:04:28,951 --> 00:04:33,600
I think you're just walking
around and Umbra and open dress,

69
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,660
sparkly red bra and plastic bag,

70
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,890
plastic bag on the stomach. Belly dancing.

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,640
You might have to shield your
eyes, but okay. There we go.

72
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,150
That's four hours.

73
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,570
That's my case. Sleeping. Oh boy. Okay.

74
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,290
Combining. It's
Valentine's Day, 2001 okay.

75
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,430
That's Kumquats and Avocados.

76
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:06,431
The kumquats I picked with my grandpa
and then come Quechee hope three or four

77
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:10,270
days ago. That's kind of true.
There's three breakfast bows.

78
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,840
What is all that stuff? Cutting
board. Cut Up power bars

79
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,570
from the President I gave
you at tightening the cup
of wine that we're going to

80
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:22,410
drink and a cup of wine. Of course
it's seven 40 in the morning,

81
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,240
so do you need a nap or anything at
noon or do you just keep [inaudible] oh,

82
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:30,870
here's a dollar. Keep
pouring my ink. Sure. Jamie,

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,500
what's going to happen today? Today I'm
going to contact him to face to debate.

84
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,380
Core of Bush. Neda or rock
10 Fidel Castro. Yeah.

85
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,700
He's an amazing man. [inaudible] okay.

86
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,460
I'm going to have to be about
any about anything, right?

87
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,280
I didn't think that those
scientists, this one. Yeah.

88
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,100
Were you, what were meaning that

89
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,941
literally,

90
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:03,941
that you were going to go on
MTV and debate Gore v Bush
and then that is exactly

91
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:07,250
what I had in mind for the day.
I thought it was make-believe.

92
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,840
It seemed harmless.

93
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,650
It just didn't occur to me that what I
was seeing with somebody who had deviated

94
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,160
substantially from who they wanted to do.

95
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,150
It's changed the world. Jesus Christ.

96
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,120
Eventually Mike got up, had to go to work.

97
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:26,560
Jamie took off for a while and then later
that day she showed up at his office

98
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,610
and at first everything seemed sort of
fine, but within 20 minutes she said,

99
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:34,240
hey, tell you what, can we
go to the roof really fast?

100
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,193
What?

101
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,150
And that immediately

102
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,590
we got me uncomfortable. Yeah.

103
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,490
So, okay, over pants,
flo wrap around skirt.

104
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,590
We are now going to the roof and
you ready to be blown out your feet?

105
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,640
You can hear, he is done.

106
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,490
Like the day has been insane.
This isn't the end of that day.

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,050
Snowy seventh avenue rooftop.

108
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,350
What you, what does this
anything, what is that

109
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,593
piece of yarn?

110
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,670
Mr Mike? Brian

111
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,340
tonight can after work

112
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:36,883
at five

113
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,340
on top of the world at
the World Trade Center

114
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,740
by wireline. Yeah.

115
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,850
If you want tonight set up

116
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,263
January,

117
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,170
that's when at that point he
was like done. We're done.

118
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,760
Wow. Eh? Yeah. I mean,

119
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,650
yeah, that's when it, it hit me that, um,

120
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,300
there is no way that any of this
reflects what she would actually want.

121
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,590
I don't know if delusional is a kind
word here and if it's not, I apologize.

122
00:08:20,591 --> 00:08:25,000
But if she's delusional enough to
think that we should get married,

123
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,550
is she delusional enough
to think she can fly?

124
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,410
Will she be distraught when
I say no, no. And will she,

125
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:36,220
would she jump? And so I
lowered the camera and I said,

126
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,590
I'm afraid of heights and I want
to go downstairs immediately.

127
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,850
And I felt for the first time
just fear. And I called her,

128
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,270
I believe I called her mother
first. Uh, leann. And I just said,

129
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,210
my name is Mike. I'm a
friend of Jamie's and um, I,

130
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,130
I think she may be going through something
and I don't know what I'm dealing

131
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:55,500
with. I'm in over my head here.

132
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,670
When Mike called, I, uh,

133
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,990
I just got on a red eye that
night. That's Leanne Lantos,

134
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,853
Jamie's mom.

135
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,950
It was my job to get her to go back to
her therapist so that we could get some

136
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,950
medication in her for the end. This
episode was not entirely a surprise.

137
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:18,240
It had happened once before when Jamie
was in high school. At that time,

138
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,110
she was not sleeping at night,
spinning around the room,

139
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:27,111
talking nonstop about how she had to
save Central America from disaster.

140
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,270
During the first episode,

141
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:34,470
Jamie ended up at a place called the
neuropsychiatric institute at UCLA and she

142
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:38,490
ended up being treated by this guy, Dr
Mark de Antonio. He's a psychiatrist.

143
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,380
She was in a very acute,
manic, psychotic state.

144
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,470
I remember being sort of tackled by
nurses to actually take my meds because I

145
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:54,420
refused to. We didn't know if we would
ever see our Jamie again. You know,

146
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:59,160
that was, that was the scariest part.
Everyone around me I think was really,

147
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:02,310
really worried that I wouldn't come back.

148
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,570
But you did come back and
it's what brought her back.

149
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,230
That is actually the reason I
got so interested in this story.

150
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,590
So shortly after she was admitted, uh,

151
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,710
Dr Dantonio told Jamie's parents we know
what this is and we know how to treat

152
00:10:15,711 --> 00:10:20,240
it. And he said, she's the
classic case of, of bipolar. I,

153
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:22,520
there was no question and I'm,

154
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,970
the drug of choice is lithium,

155
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,160
which is not even a
drug, but just this salt.

156
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,680
And he's explained to us, um, you
know, that she would need to, um,

157
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,460
take three tablets of lithium,

158
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,380
three tablets of this salt and it
could bring her back when it works.

159
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,880
It's just remarkable.

160
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,920
Do you have memories of like what
it was like to come back like that,

161
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,930
what you were thinking
or what it felt like?

162
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,750
That's really hard to describe.

163
00:10:55,751 --> 00:11:00,430
It's a little bit of like
a slow realization of,

164
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,860
uh, of like, oh, that was a weird
thing that I did a week ago. Like,

165
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,210
why did I do that

166
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,880
the first time she was actually lucid
and coming back to herself again.

167
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,380
The first words out of
her mouth were, mom,

168
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,940
it's not me.

169
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,790
And I just, that just killed me.

170
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,260
[inaudible]

171
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,340
within a few weeks it was like the
incident never happened. So bizarre.

172
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,580
I mean I felt like here was this thing
that's assault that I get to just take

173
00:11:36,941 --> 00:11:40,830
three of a day and and that
was it. Totally normal,

174
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,390
no side effects, no issues.

175
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,410
She went off to college and just
like flourish and it was great.

176
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,400
Things were good for a long time and
then after about six years she said,

177
00:11:51,401 --> 00:11:54,160
you know, I've been on this pill
for six years, had no problems.

178
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,380
I'd like to go off it.

179
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,010
Why don't we try to go off gradually
than about a month after she was totally

180
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:04,840
off lithium whack in Mike's
apartment up all night.

181
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,460
You were so tired just a minute ago.
That's cause he told me I had to leave,

182
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:13,560
but now I'm still here. I thought,
oh totally manic episode all over

183
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,960
because I am whatever
you say I am. That's it.

184
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,320
One of the things that kind of makes
lithium that affected lithium has so

185
00:12:22,321 --> 00:12:23,010
spooky,

186
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:26,760
and you hear this from a lot of people
that have taken lithium to treat bipolar,

187
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,240
is that lithium itself is so

188
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,050
simple. Lithium is an element, right?

189
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:38,770
It's a single atom. This has been
Lilly, he's a writer, runs a story,

190
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:39,604
collider podcast.

191
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,730
He's had some personal experience with
psychiatric drugs and he's written about

192
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:44,950
lithium. That to me was fascinating,

193
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,510
but that a single Adam can
change what we think of,

194
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:53,170
of who we are. I mean, it's not even,
not just Adam, it's Adam number three,

195
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,120
the third element in the table. It's
one of the simplest Adam's right?

196
00:12:58,121 --> 00:13:01,300
So we have, it's just three protons,
four neutrons, three electrons.

197
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:04,000
That's a pretty simple in that
matter. I mean, it doesn't get much.

198
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,600
It really is. This had never struck me
when I was on Lexapro or Wellbutrin,

199
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:10,150
which was the other one they put me
on. You know, if you look at them,

200
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,730
they look like what you expect a
pharmaceutical drug to look like.

201
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:16,430
There's a ring of carbon atoms and
some other things stuck on it and they,

202
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:20,410
they look like these big complex
molecules and you're like, Oh yeah, I'm,

203
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:24,250
I'm complex. My brand is complex. It
takes this complicated thing to change it.

204
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:28,240
And then you're confronted
with just this Adam,

205
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,190
it was found by accident that
it works. You've just, yeah,

206
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,650
it's not complicated to make,

207
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,600
it's just a salt that you distill out
and yet it has this profound effect.

208
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,610
The other thing I know about lithium
that is, that is profoundly weird,

209
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,590
is that you're not just saying my mind,

210
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,480
my personality is being
changed by an Adam.

211
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,440
It's been changed by an Adam that was
created directly in the Business Bank

212
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:56,930
itself. So you have this,
Adam formed in the big bang,

213
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,640
goes through whatever it does,
winding path to come onto the earth,

214
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,690
gets dug up, turned into
a pill given to someone.

215
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,110
And that changes their
affect in the world.

216
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,570
And that to me is just,

217
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:16,060
it's this profound reminder that the,

218
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,300
the forces that shape everything in the
universe are the same as the forces that

219
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:24,260
are shaping who we are. And what
we do and what our identity is.

220
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,750
It's possible that these forces shaped
not just the people with bipolar

221
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:29,231
disorder,

222
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:32,920
but all of us think it was a woman ended
up talking to a clinical psychiatrist

223
00:14:32,921 --> 00:14:37,870
and a fellow who told me about these
studies, huge epidemiologic studies.

224
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,530
The biggest one I think was in Japan.
One was in Austria, one was in Greece,

225
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,560
famous one in Texas in which they looked
at communities that different levels of

226
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:50,710
lithium with them in the water
supply and we're talking about tiny,

227
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,000
tiny amounts, micrograms.

228
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,600
Those are a thousandth of
the amount in a milligram.

229
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,400
If you think of like a pill of lithium,

230
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,070
well we're talking about
amounts like 10000th of a pill,

231
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,700
like that's the amount that we're dealing
with here and these studies found by

232
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:08,480
and large in towns that had a tiny
bit more lithium in the water.

233
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,670
Suicide rates were lower in some
cases, as much as 30% I should say.

234
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,630
The Texas study,

235
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:19,631
which is astonishing also shows that
the towns that have the highest lithium

236
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:25,040
level have lower felonies, thefts,

237
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,730
rapes, and these are reputable,
published studies. Nope.

238
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,360
These studies are only
showing us correlations,

239
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:36,410
but there does at least seem to be some
kind of connection and may be if there

240
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:38,540
is a distinction, what
the hell is it doing?

241
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,070
Do they know why it works in the
brain? Like do they know what it does?

242
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,180
Well essentially no, it's
still kind of a mystery.

243
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,590
But here's a Marc de
Antonio's theory. He says,

244
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:55,780
we know that bipolar disorder involves
a defect in a certain part of the brain.

245
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,810
It's an area of the brain that
has to do with controlling mood.

246
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:06,010
So believe it or not, there's neurons
in the brain that keep your mood.

247
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,420
Even these neurons,

248
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:11,710
they do their job by sort of passing
electricity back and forth and that

249
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:14,650
electricity is carried by sodium ions.

250
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,960
So the whole system is
pretty much based on sodium.

251
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,370
Lithium is very similar to sodium,
so if you have lithium in the brain,

252
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:23,680
the neurons will use that to communicate.

253
00:16:23,681 --> 00:16:27,070
They'll send lithium ions back and
forth. And here's what's interesting.

254
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,910
Lithium works just like
sodium, but not as well.

255
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Lithium is similar enough in
properties that it can be an a posture,

256
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,090
but whatever it does, it just doesn't
work as well. That's the key. He says,

257
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,190
so then this area of the brain,

258
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,370
the defective area of the brain that
makes these moods flip on and off so

259
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:52,150
intensely doesn't work as well
and that stops a bipolar episode.

260
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,480
That's so interesting that maybe it's
sluggishness is what makes it good. Yup.

261
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,220
Yup.

262
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:01,210
Although he says that same trick where
it can be a sort of sodium imposter but

263
00:17:01,211 --> 00:17:05,530
slower that can also cause the
issues. Slight tremors in your hand.

264
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,250
You can have nausea, they
can affect the kidneys,

265
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,750
the balance of sodium.

266
00:17:10,751 --> 00:17:15,280
Your body is regulated partially
through the kidneys and somehow lithium

267
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,790
replacing it can be toxic to the kidneys,

268
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,540
which actually brings us back to Jamie.

269
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:25,040
After that episode in New
York with Mike and the video,

270
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:27,590
she went back on lithium
and again, she was fine.

271
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:31,850
In fact for the last 16 years
she's been completely normal.

272
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:36,590
But then a couple months ago I
went to a new primary physician,

273
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:39,590
mostly because I'm lazy and I didn't want
to go to the upper west side to see my

274
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,490
other doctor.

275
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:44,930
And this doctor basically took
my blood pressure and was like,

276
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:47,180
you're gonna die. You
need to go to the Er.

277
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:50,340
It turns out her kidneys were
failing and so she suddenly

278
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:55,340
had to make this choice that I could sort
of just stay on lithium and you know,

279
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,760
go to dialysis and get a transplant or
that I had to switch and that now would

280
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:07,290
be when I would switch that I had enough
function left that I could you you

281
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,350
have, you are in the middle of
that decision now you feel like,

282
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,990
or do you feel like it's decided?
I think I'm going to switch.

283
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,640
I think I made that decision.

284
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,470
It's just that every psychiatrist in New
York leaves for August because I don't

285
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:23,130
know why, but they all disappear
for August, all of August.

286
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:27,720
And Mine said you should probably
wait to switch until I come back.

287
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:33,180
But I, I feel like I have a
good group of people around me.

288
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:36,450
I have a solid job. I,

289
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:40,590
it's terrifying to court mania,

290
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,660
but I also feel like there are a lot of
effective drugs and that one of them is

291
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:50,250
going to work. They won't be as cool as
lithium though. Depakote sounds like.

292
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:54,140
Oh God. Bra.

293
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,500
You're on Deborah. As she was
in the middle of that decision,

294
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:02,310
Jamie did one last thing. She
actually took a trip to Bolivia,

295
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,650
which is where much of the
world's lithium comes from.

296
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,860
There's this place you can go and
literally see these massive salt flats,

297
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:13,890
which are just covered in mountains
of lithium. I just wanted to see them.

298
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:18,870
I wanted to experience them. I
wanted to be near them. So I went,

299
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,300
uh,

300
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,040
it just looks like a hallucination.

301
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:29,960
It looks like somebody could not have
conceived of this landscape. You know,

302
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:34,961
you have red lakes and you have flocks
of flamingos and this like long salty

303
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:42,440
expands that goes on for
ever. Like it's just huge.

304
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:47,120
It's enormous. Do you go up to a
pile and put your hand on it? Yeah.

305
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:47,850
You can.

306
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,260
You stand on it and you jump
off the pile and like, yeah,

307
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:54,080
I was makings kind of with the [inaudible]

308
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,740
no [inaudible]

309
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,320
and it was awesome.

310
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,140
I know I have to go off
of it, but I really am.

311
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,460
I mean gratitude is like
not even the word. It's,

312
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,550
I feel like this thing allows me to be me.

313
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,230
It doesn't define me,

314
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:21,970
but it allows for, you know,

315
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,970
functionality and that
sounds kind of Wonky,

316
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:29,971
but it's like every day I get to
work and it's because of that,

317
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,370
like everything, you know, I'm just,

318
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:37,630
I'm grateful to it for it
service. I feel like it's, yeah.

319
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,220
Done.

320
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,860
It's done a lot for,

321
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,103
for me.

322
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:48,070
It worked so hard to get to
me too. From the Big Bang to

323
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,903
now.

324
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,050
Uh, [inaudible]

325
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,020
produce your store on wheeler? No,
Soren is made of elements though,

326
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:14,370
not of lithium, which we should say only
some of which was made in the big bang.

327
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,180
Some of it was also made ne Supernova
and we'll have one of those coming up.

328
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:22,680
Special thanks to Ben Lilly and
Harrington. Kay Redfield Jamison,

329
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,480
Steve Lo and of course Jamie Lo.

330
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,110
Jamie working on a book about
her experiences with bipolar.

331
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:30,060
It will be called grand delusions.

332
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,480
This is a song from the band Sylvan.

333
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:41,770
So we played them the last story in
progress and they wrote a song about it.

334
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,453
Jen,

335
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,900
do the last thing.

336
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,373
Um,

337
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,830
come phones to me.

338
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,050
Compression scale.

339
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,943
Wow.

340
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,640
It's not me.

341
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,050
Slamdance faster,

342
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,473
faster.

343
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,893
[inaudible]

344
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,943
Diane

345
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:37,690
[inaudible] came home

346
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,220
[inaudible]

347
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,460
that was Sylvan Esso with Jamie Song.

348
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,000
Do you want to talk? Bang.

349
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,510
Hydrogen was there at zero hundred hours
in the coke colored velodrome of dark

350
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:07,840
matter gases, checking gases at Infinitum,

351
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,730
chartreuse Flair, then a
deafening birth ions of cosmos.

352
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,620
Cartwheeling Pink, red,
yellow, green, purple, blue,

353
00:25:17,621 --> 00:25:22,510
black and the spear of
night. First I was a star,

354
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:27,820
then a stain of water,
then a kindergartner.

355
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,780
These poems, by the way, come from the
two events that we held in New York City.

356
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,720
We went to a emotive fruition,

357
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:41,860
which is a wonderful organization run
by Thomas Dooley, who is himself a poet.

358
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:45,220
He summoned poets from all around the
metropolitan area and for two nights they

359
00:25:45,221 --> 00:25:48,760
came to the Bell House in
Brooklyn Botanic lab in Manhattan.

360
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,260
And so far we have heard hydrogen by
Sarah Salah, red by Ramsey for our gala,

361
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,250
helium by Christine Kintana. Read
by Junius, Abbott Pratt. And uh,

362
00:25:57,251 --> 00:26:01,030
I carried your oxygen a poem by David
McLaughlin, read by Sam Breslin. Right.

363
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:04,560
So next up I'm going to give you three
claps. I don't know if you need that,

364
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:05,394
but just

365
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,550
just in case you need to sync it.
There you go. Good TV guy. Okay,

366
00:26:11,551 --> 00:26:15,690
so a while back we ended up talking to
a guy named Derek Muller who makes a

367
00:26:15,691 --> 00:26:17,540
youtube channel called
[inaudible] awesome,

368
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,700
super popular channel about
science and engineering.

369
00:26:20,701 --> 00:26:23,700
And we called him because he's
making a documentary about uranium.

370
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,050
And we got to talking about what happens
when you take two protons or neutrons

371
00:26:28,051 --> 00:26:32,050
and you just whack put
them together. Yeah, it's,

372
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,060
it's absolutely nuts.

373
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:38,390
And that led to this really interesting
conversation about the beginning of all

374
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:42,870
elements. I mean, I feel like a little
bit of backstory is worth saying.

375
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,190
One

376
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,990
really important thing to know is that
combining nuclei gives you energy.

377
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,440
He says when you slam two particles
together, they get squished.

378
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,540
And in the squishing,
they lose a little mass.

379
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,050
That mass gets emitted as energy.

380
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,980
This is equals MC squared. That's
what's happening in the sun right now.

381
00:27:01,981 --> 00:27:06,180
So the sun is taking protons, individual
protons and smashing them together,

382
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:10,260
combining them. And that gives
you energy. The energy of the sun,

383
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,250
their last mass is the sunlight
that we Baskin, it was mass.

384
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,750
I have never thought of light as as former
mass. Yeah, that's what a star does.

385
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:22,350
He says it smashes little Adams like
hydrogen together to make bigger.

386
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,580
Adam's like helium and then bigger Adams
like carbon and then even bigger atoms

387
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:31,560
like oxygen and every little collision
it's doing generates some energy which

388
00:27:31,561 --> 00:27:32,580
keeps the star going.

389
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,350
Stars live by this process
of sticking nuclei together,

390
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,880
going from smaller nuclei, making
bigger nuclei. The heavier the star,

391
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,020
the more the smashing and bashing they
can do in their core and the bigger and

392
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:49,260
bigger nuclei they can
form. But there are limits.

393
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,350
[inaudible]

394
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:56,320
6 million years ago that there was this
star giant star whey they got in our son

395
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:59,730
and uh, it was just doing
its thing, taken Adams and

396
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,180
smashing them together. Combining.

397
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,800
It's taken hydrogen
atoms and making helium,

398
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,790
taking helium Adams and
making carbon, making oxygen,

399
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,800
and as it's smashing all
these nuclei together,

400
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:18,330
it's releasing energy and getting
bigger and bigger and bigger. But then

401
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:25,270
there comes a point where sticking nuclei
together no longer gives you energy.

402
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,580
In that point is element number 26 iron.

403
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:34,720
Once you formed iron, if you're a star,
that's the end of life as you know it

404
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,560
because iron iron is incredibly stable,

405
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,800
one of the most stable
nuclei in the universe.

406
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,470
It's protons are tightly packed in there
and so you can't force any more energy

407
00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:51,830
out of them,

408
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,630
which means you have a core which is
no longer going to give you energy.

409
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,200
You can't cook up anything higher
than, than the iron. That's it.

410
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,920
But what happens to the star? Does it
just become a big punk? What happens is

411
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,340
[inaudible]

412
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,820
everything starts to collapse.
Gravity takes over. That's the thing.

413
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,890
A star maintains its size by the fact
that there's all this energy going out to

414
00:29:15,891 --> 00:29:20,060
this dead iron core starts pulling
everything back in and at this point,

415
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,260
all of that stuff which is headed inwards,
aluminum, oxygen, carbon, magnesium,

416
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,180
silicon starts rubbing against each
other and it starts getting real hot and

417
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:32,690
real dense, and all of a sudden you get

418
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:36,563
the supernova.

419
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,060
That was the most pathetic
supernova explosion. Can you put

420
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,540
in a sound effect to make that
sound bath? To put it in the Mexico?

421
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:46,030
It is actually our specialty.

422
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:50,350
So even though we know there are no
sounds in space for the purposes of your

423
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:51,910
enjoyment, we present to you

424
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,420
the Supernova. So here's the beauty of it.

425
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:02,370
Here's the beauty of the Supernova in the
ridiculous excesses of energy that are

426
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:06,270
there in the Supernova, right? In
that ridiculously huge explosion,

427
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,590
the biggest in the universe.

428
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,000
There is so much energy there that
actually what happens is you form these

429
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:16,590
nuclei, which would not form
under any other conditions.

430
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,800
You know, iron hits
carbon to form Germanium,

431
00:30:19,801 --> 00:30:22,560
silicon hits oxygen to form titanium.

432
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:26,280
You start to get all of these bigger
elements, including like gold,

433
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,890
including the gold in your wedding ring.

434
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,280
They need that extreme ridiculous
excess of energy to form and then

435
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,010
it's done.

436
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,440
And what are you left with? You're
left with a giant field of debris.

437
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,243
Okay.

438
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,380
Ah, there's carbon, there's oxygen,
there's iron, there's silicon,

439
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:51,970
there's hydrogen, there's helium.

440
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,080
And it starts to clump
together due to gravity.

441
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,640
And the center of that, uh,

442
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:03,660
which clumps together is our sun is mostly
hydrogen and helium and it's like 99%

443
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:08,350
of all the mass in our solar
system. And then the other chunks,

444
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:10,630
other bits and pieces start
to clump together as well.

445
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,430
They have a bit more angular momentum.

446
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:15,360
So they're spinning around the outside
and those are your planetesimals,

447
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:16,570
your early planets and,

448
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,200
and that is eventually how you
get the earth and all of us

449
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,070
[inaudible] [inaudible]

450
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,881
this is where we caught you.

451
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:29,450
So you're saying this is the birth of
everything past iron. Yeah, exactly.

452
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,990
Exactly. It feels like an 80 but I
think I get it for the very first time.

453
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,650
So Post Supernova, like in the,
in the milliseconds post souvenir,

454
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,610
you have lots. You have the whole periodic
table hurling through space. Yeah,

455
00:31:40,611 --> 00:31:42,260
you do. You really do.

456
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:51,900
[inaudible]

457
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:56,490
you can find Derek Muller most days
on his youtube channel. Avera Tassian,

458
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:01,290
his documentary, uranium twisting. The
Dragon's tail will soon appear on PBS.

459
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,200
It has already in fact appeared as
even though already appeared on PBS.

460
00:32:04,201 --> 00:32:08,790
And for some crazy reason it passed me
by coming up a story that will make you

461
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:13,260
wish the Cold War wasn't over. Not
me, not me. I'm, I'm happy it's over.
