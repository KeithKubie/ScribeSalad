00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.290
The Beatles’ 1967 hit “Strawberry Fields
Forever” has long been considered one of

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.360
the greatest pop songs ever recorded.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.840
Released in February of that year as a double
A side single along with Penny Lane, the song

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.480
peaked at number eight on the US Billboard
charts (The Turtles’ “Happy Together”

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.689
was number one that week).

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.329
In 2011, Rolling Stone named it the band’s
third greatest song and the 76th greatest

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.119
song ever.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.710
Written by John Lennon, it’s a true masterpiece,
but what it isn’t is a song about fields

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.710
full of strawberries.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:37.710
Reading the lyrics, it’s clear that the
song isn’t as happy-go-lucky as the melody

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.710
might suggest.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.710
The song is more about Lennon’s insecurities
and his tough childhood.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.710
The title of the song refers to the Salvation
Army-ran girl’s orphanage – dreamily called

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.710
“Strawberry Field” – that Lennon lived
near growing up in Liverpool.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.710
Here’s the real story behind the song “Strawberry
Fields Forever.”

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.710
The Beatles were going through a rough patch
when they all splintered off in the summer

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.329
of 1966, immediately following what would
be their last US live performance at San Francisco’s

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.519
Candlestick Park.

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.160
The Fab Four would eventually reunite for
six more albums (and one legendary, unannounced

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.700
rooftop live performance), but that wasn’t
known in the summer of ‘66.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.340
For his part, Lennon made his way to Almería,
Spain to star in the black comedy How I Won

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.340
the War.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.629
With long waits between shooting scenes, Lennon
had plenty of time to write.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.100
In six weeks, he had a working version of
the song that would come to define the Beatles’

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.180
second act.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.730
John Lennon’s childhood wasn’t particularly
happy.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.430
When he was a baby, his banjo-playing father
Alf was rarely home and often away at sea

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.430
as a merchant.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.140
Tired of his travels, John’s mother Julia
fell in love with another man and got pregnant

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.790
with John’s half-sister.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.320
This caused a tremendous rift in the Lennon
family with Julia’s sister Mimi calling

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.700
social services twice on her own sister for
raising John in, what she called, an unfit

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.700
home.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.590
Eventually, social services handed John’s
care over to Aunt Mimi and he spent a large

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.810
portion of his childhood at his Aunt’s suburban
Liverpool home in a town called Woolton – the

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.270
house is now part of UK’s National Trust
as a museum.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.950
John’s relationships with his parents after
that were tragic.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.790
He wouldn’t see his father again for over
two decades.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.980
John’s mother was hit and killed by a speeding
car while crossing a road when John was only

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.980
17.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.870
According to Cynthia Lennon, John’s first
wife, while Aunt Mimi did care for John, “she

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.970
was not a woman for cuddles and praise.”

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.990
Ruling with an iron fist, John was expected
to be obedient, well-behaved and groomed.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.209
Later, biographers would write that he had
a hard time making friends.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.159
It’s little wonder that young John Lennon
had a rebellious streak and would often go

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:27.359
in secret to play in the gardens of his next
door neighbor – the girl’s orphanage Strawberry

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.359
Field.

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.859
StrawberryfieldThe history of Strawberry Field
dates back to 1870, when the property was

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.469
owned by a wealthy English ship owner named
George Warren.

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.819
On the site, he built a giant gothic mansion
that was in line with England’s Victorian-era,

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.969
complete with a iron wrought gate, gardens
and flowers.

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:48.389
In 1927, another wealthy ship magnate named
Alexander C. Mitchell purchased the mansion

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:49.389
and property.

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.390
Seven years later, Mitchell’s widow sold
it to the Salvation Army.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.579
On July 7, 1936, the home was opened as a
orphanage for up to forty girls.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.359
Two decades later, boys would be allowed in,
but throughout most of John’s childhood,

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.909
Strawberry Field was an all-girls’ orphanage.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:11.069
Years later, interviews would reveal the influence
this foreboding, mysterious place had on Lennon’s

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.069
writing.

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.189
In a 1968 Rolling Stone interview, Lennon
said that he was trying to write about Liverpool

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.530
and had “visions of Strawberry Fields…

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.890
Because Strawberry Fields is just anywhere
you want to go.”

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.279
(Note that the song title is “Strawberry
Fields,” but the actual place is called

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:29.560
“Strawberry Field.”

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.530
Lennon would later admit that this was a stylistic
choice- “Fields” simply sounded better

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.639
than “Field.”)

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:40.359
Lennon also often alluded to how Strawberry
Field was representative of his childhood,

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.379
on the outside foreboding but once he climbed
over that wall, full of wildflowers and secretive

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:46.379
gardens.

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.310
It’s also thought that he greatly identified
with the orphans who lived there, considering

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.189
that he felt abandoned by his parents.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.879
In 1980, he explained his childhood thinking,
“There was something wrong with me, I thought,

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.450
because I seemed to see things other people
didn’t see.”

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.489
When John Lennon brought the song back to
the band in November of 1966, it was met with

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.489
awe.

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.709
Engineer Geoff Emerick recalled to Rolling
Stone that fateful moment, “There was a

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.579
moment of stunned silence, broken by Paul,
who in a quiet, respectful tone said simply,

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.310
‘That is absolutely brilliant.’”

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.420
Over about a month, the band tinkered and
recorded the song.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.110
It is widely thought of as the most complicated
recording the Beatles ever did.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.080
When it was released in February of 1967,
it was exactly what McCartney said when he

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.020
first heard the song John Lennon named after
a Liverpool girl’s orphanage – brilliant.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.330
Today, Strawberry Field is in a state of disrepair
despite continuing to be a tourist attraction

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.389
for Beatle fanatics.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.020
In 2005, after nearly 70 years as an orphanage,
it closed down and all the remaining children

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.050
were transferred to foster families.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.340
While many of the original buildings and structures
were torn down in the 1970s, a few still remained

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.930
including the iconic red Victorian-era Strawberry
Field gates – until 2001.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.729
The gates, which dated back to Warren, were
put into storage and replaced with replicas,

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:07.650
leaving many fans (and tour guides, who rely
on Beatle-related income) upset.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.879
Plans were announced in 2014 to turn the site
into “a training centre for people with

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:16.800
learning difficulties” along with a museum
and artifacts dedicated to the influence this

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.229
place had on the Beatles and John Lennon.

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:37.240
However, as of this writing, Strawberry Field
remains abandoned and mostly decrepit.
