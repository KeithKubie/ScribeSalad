00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:03.949
well there's always the experiments that

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959
well there's always the experiments that
 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.690
well there's always the experiments that
you do his child I was actually not some

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700
you do his child I was actually not some
 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.249
you do his child I was actually not some
sort of a child prodigy by any stretch

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259
sort of a child prodigy by any stretch
 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.070
sort of a child prodigy by any stretch
like we were you know my mom was always

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080
like we were you know my mom was always
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.419
like we were you know my mom was always
helping us a science fair project like

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
helping us a science fair project like
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.070
helping us a science fair project like
the week before you know there's always

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080
the week before you know there's always
 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.379
the week before you know there's always
that kind of we were a little bit yeah

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
that kind of we were a little bit yeah
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.760
that kind of we were a little bit yeah
so that was a little hodgepodge I can't

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770
so that was a little hodgepodge I can't
 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.830
so that was a little hodgepodge I can't
say you can actually have a you know so

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840
say you can actually have a you know so
 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.689
say you can actually have a you know so
I'm living proof that you can be a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699
I'm living proof that you can be a
 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.939
I'm living proof that you can be a
terrible young scientist and still have

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949
terrible young scientist and still have
 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.070
terrible young scientist and still have
a career I but and so I think when I got

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
a career I but and so I think when I got
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.929
a career I but and so I think when I got
to college was the first time I've ever

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
to college was the first time I've ever
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.350
to college was the first time I've ever
really done I mean yeah so we live one

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
really done I mean yeah so we live one
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.580
really done I mean yeah so we live one
we weren't American so we didn't really

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
we weren't American so we didn't really
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.690
we weren't American so we didn't really
know a lot about like all these like

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
know a lot about like all these like
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.610
know a lot about like all these like
summer programs and fancy things that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620
summer programs and fancy things that
 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.080
summer programs and fancy things that
you could do to get like an early start

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090
you could do to get like an early start
 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.869
you could do to get like an early start
and where did I and I was pretty

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
and where did I and I was pretty
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.010
and where did I and I was pretty
clueless like I'm the kind of person

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
clueless like I'm the kind of person
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.680
clueless like I'm the kind of person
that instead of thinking oh I can you

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
that instead of thinking oh I can you
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.420
that instead of thinking oh I can you
know skip grades I was just like how am

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
know skip grades I was just like how am
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.100
know skip grades I was just like how am
I gonna get a hundred and everything and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
I gonna get a hundred and everything and
 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990
I gonna get a hundred and everything and
do you know like as i was working within

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
do you know like as i was working within
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.819
do you know like as i was working within
my confines which i think is good like

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
my confines which i think is good like
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.100
my confines which i think is good like
sometimes if you think too far like

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
sometimes if you think too far like
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.299
sometimes if you think too far like
three steps ahead you don't really

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
three steps ahead you don't really
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.889
three steps ahead you don't really
appreciate what you have but i think my

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
appreciate what you have but i think my
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.689
appreciate what you have but i think my
whole education was about doing what I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699
whole education was about doing what I
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.560
whole education was about doing what I
could at the time um but so all of that

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
could at the time um but so all of that
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.630
could at the time um but so all of that
as backdrop I had never really even

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640
as backdrop I had never really even
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.609
as backdrop I had never really even
known like what a lab was until I got to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
known like what a lab was until I got to
 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.149
known like what a lab was until I got to
college like really and early on in my

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
college like really and early on in my
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.429
college like really and early on in my
freshman year I joined David bartels

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
freshman year I joined David bartels
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.710
freshman year I joined David bartels
group and David Martel is one of the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
group and David Martel is one of the
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.830
group and David Martel is one of the
world's leading you know when the is a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
world's leading you know when the is a
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.219
world's leading you know when the is a
you know pioneer of RNA and

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
you know pioneer of RNA and
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.080
you know pioneer of RNA and
understanding sort of micrornas and how

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
understanding sort of micrornas and how
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.719
understanding sort of micrornas and how
they work so he's tremendous and yeah

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
they work so he's tremendous and yeah
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.880
they work so he's tremendous and yeah
and it was I was his second person in

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890
and it was I was his second person in
 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.010
and it was I was his second person in
his lab so he just started at MIT he had

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
his lab so he just started at MIT he had
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.050
his lab so he just started at MIT he had
a spectacular technician and then he had

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060
a spectacular technician and then he had
 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.749
a spectacular technician and then he had
me and I was I was not good i mean i

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759
me and I was I was not good i mean i
 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:36.800
me and I was I was not good i mean i
just picked at the picked up for the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
just picked at the picked up for the
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.359
just picked at the picked up for the
first time and if you know anything

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
first time and if you know anything
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.130
first time and if you know anything
about RNA work it's very difficult

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
about RNA work it's very difficult
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.499
about RNA work it's very difficult
because RNA is not nearly as stable as

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509
because RNA is not nearly as stable as
 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.840
because RNA is not nearly as stable as
DNA and so you can contaminate it really

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
DNA and so you can contaminate it really
 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.330
DNA and so you can contaminate it really
easily you can you know affect it really

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
easily you can you know affect it really
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.770
easily you can you know affect it really
easy you can be working with an artifact

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
easy you can be working with an artifact
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.950
easy you can be working with an artifact
and so it was a really good training and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960
and so it was a really good training and
 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.639
and so it was a really good training and
I I like applaud David for his patience

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
I I like applaud David for his patience
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.020
I I like applaud David for his patience
and working with me and I think there's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
and working with me and I think there's
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580
and working with me and I think there's
a lot of times where he was like you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
a lot of times where he was like you
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.709
a lot of times where he was like you
sure you know I think yeah I just was so

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
sure you know I think yeah I just was so
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.870
sure you know I think yeah I just was so
tenacious I just kind of kept going back

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880
tenacious I just kind of kept going back
 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.730
tenacious I just kind of kept going back
I think he was hoping at one one day I

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
I think he was hoping at one one day I
 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.350
I think he was hoping at one one day I
would be like I don't need to do this

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360
would be like I don't need to do this
 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.180
would be like I don't need to do this
anymore but I stayed with him for all

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
anymore but I stayed with him for all
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.350
anymore but I stayed with him for all
four years of college and so for me it

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
four years of college and so for me it
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.670
four years of college and so for me it
was great because

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
was great because
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.920
was great because
after doing RNA as an undergraduate with

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
after doing RNA as an undergraduate with
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.750
after doing RNA as an undergraduate with
no experience everything after that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
no experience everything after that
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.360
no experience everything after that
became very easy so DNA was just like

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370
became very easy so DNA was just like
 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.949
became very easy so DNA was just like
you know I could just do it blindfolded

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959
you know I could just do it blindfolded
 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.509
you know I could just do it blindfolded
and still make it work which was great

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519
and still make it work which was great
 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.649
and still make it work which was great
but it was definitely a interesting slow

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659
but it was definitely a interesting slow
 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:34.869
but it was definitely a interesting slow
start I think now the best days I mean I

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879
start I think now the best days I mean I
 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.129
start I think now the best days I mean I
there's a lot of great days I think a

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139
there's a lot of great days I think a
 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:39.170
there's a lot of great days I think a
lot of great days in the lab often come

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180
lot of great days in the lab often come
 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.629
lot of great days in the lab often come
with working with people so I have one

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639
with working with people so I have one
 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.160
with working with people so I have one
student Patrick Borelli I worked with

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170
student Patrick Borelli I worked with
 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.869
student Patrick Borelli I worked with
for the last few years he's sort of he

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879
for the last few years he's sort of he
 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.849
for the last few years he's sort of he
was my an undergraduate I worked with as

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859
was my an undergraduate I worked with as
 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.729
was my an undergraduate I worked with as
a postdoc and some of the best days were

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739
a postdoc and some of the best days were
 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.460
a postdoc and some of the best days were
just the two of us sitting together in a

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470
just the two of us sitting together in a
 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.520
just the two of us sitting together in a
room you know going back and forth like

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530
room you know going back and forth like
 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.110
room you know going back and forth like
you know he was he's a computer science

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120
you know he was he's a computer science
 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.030
you know he was he's a computer science
physics made a major but with a big

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040
physics made a major but with a big
 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.319
physics made a major but with a big
computer science training so he was

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329
computer science training so he was
 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.819
computer science training so he was
doing a lot of the more rigorous

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829
doing a lot of the more rigorous
 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.740
doing a lot of the more rigorous
programming we needed to do and I was

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750
programming we needed to do and I was
 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.869
programming we needed to do and I was
doing a lot of the analysis so we'd go

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879
doing a lot of the analysis so we'd go
 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.000
doing a lot of the analysis so we'd go
back and forth and this most recent

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010
back and forth and this most recent
 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.559
back and forth and this most recent
paper that we did where we talked about

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569
paper that we did where we talked about
 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.209
paper that we did where we talked about
last fever and the hair and sweatin Asia

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219
last fever and the hair and sweatin Asia
 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.129
last fever and the hair and sweatin Asia
and all sorts of things we're developing

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139
and all sorts of things we're developing
 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.830
and all sorts of things we're developing
a lot of tests and I think this six week

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840
a lot of tests and I think this six week
 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.140
a lot of tests and I think this six week
period where Patrick came from you know

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150
period where Patrick came from you know
