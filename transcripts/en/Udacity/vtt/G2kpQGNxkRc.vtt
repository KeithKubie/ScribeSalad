00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.960
Once you've identified
your top few advantages,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.100
there are a few frameworks
you can use to outline them.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.280
We're going to use a grid to map all
your competitors on one slide and

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.870
position you as the leader.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.800
You're going to create something
like this for your final project.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.900
Let's start by focusing on two
things that you really excel at.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.130
These are your competitive advantages.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.220
We'll use these to label
the two axes of the grid.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.990
And we want you to place
your main competitors here.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.410
But again, you'll be positioned as
the leader, right in this area.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.080
These competitive advantages
can be price versus value,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.710
or you can write a specific
value to your customer.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.130
Maybe think of something
that your potential users or

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.040
investors would be really,
really interested in, or excited about.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.830
So we'll have to name our
two axes accordingly.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.660
So if it's price,
it will be low price and high price.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.950
Now let's say our value is innovation.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.195
We can have high innovation and
low innovation.

00:00:55.195 --> 00:00:57.181
Or you can choose something else.

00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:59.760
So for specific and generic,
let's talk about this.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.700
For Embarkment we started to realize
that the general market was a bit

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.550
crowded.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.078
So we needed to find a unique value to
differentiate our app from, let's say,

00:01:08.078 --> 00:01:08.908
a dog kennel.

00:01:08.908 --> 00:01:11.703
So we decided to focus
on a niche market.

00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:16.290
And go the same idea, but only for
fancy dogs with the most refined tastes.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.520
We're going to offer high end services.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.720
We'll only accept sitters who have
nice homes and nice backyards.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.054
Those sitters must take the dogs
on multiple walks a day.

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:30.175
And the sitters must only offer
the highest quality food and care for

00:01:30.175 --> 00:01:30.834
the dogs.

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:35.729
For the more refined of Embarkment, we
chose a grid that includes one axis for

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.620
quality, let's change that now.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.370
One axis for quality, so
we have high quality and low quality,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.870
and we're going to keep the specific and
generic axis.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.450
So now that we have our grid,
we're going to choose competitors from

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.250
the product form category, so
these are our direct competitors.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.150
And we might also find a few
other relevant competitors.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.830
So we have the local kennel,
which is pretty generic.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.780
And the quality's not great, but

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.490
sometimes they're associated with vets,
so that's good.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.690
Then we have The Dog House, which is
more specific because they only take

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.400
dogs, but they're not as specific as we
are, and the quality's not super great.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.540
The don't really vet their sitters.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.930
Then we have Doggie Vacay,
which they are pretty good quality but

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.290
they're not as specific as we are.

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.770
And finally we have Rover,
who also has great quality,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.500
but they're more generic than we are.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.840
So notice that we're here in
the top right-hand quadrant.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.150
This is the best place to be, and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.820
it really sets us apart from
all of our other competitors.
