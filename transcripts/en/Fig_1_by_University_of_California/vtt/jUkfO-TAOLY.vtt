00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.220
The Dr. Seuss collection is really
what Ted Geisel

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.250
(otherwise known as Dr. Seuss)

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.269
kept in his own home and his own collection.  Green
Eggs and Ham was the book

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.100
that he was dared to use only 50 words.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.130
He usually started out with something
that he calls the "bone pile"

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.500
where he began to work on

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.230
the words and how the rhyme might fit
together

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.230
and then in this particular volume he's
got the color

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.860
overlays for the book and the colors that
he's going to want in the final stages.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.079
They will shoot from the black and white
sketch

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.149
and then the printer knows what colors

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.410
to do and what percentages. You can see
the difference here just on the overlay

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.730
were here it's a hundred percent yellow

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.050
and forty percent yellow. And also adding
little notes to himself as he goes along.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.890
"White inside the hambone, always" and then this
is another one where you can see

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.410
the black and white sketch and the story

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.480
I could not would not on a boat I will
not will not

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.280
with a goat

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.530
