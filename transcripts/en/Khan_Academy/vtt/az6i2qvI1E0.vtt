00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.702
- [Instructor] In other videos,
we've already talked about

00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:04.279
the difference between
distance and displacement.

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.182
And we also saw what it meant

00:00:06.182 --> 00:00:08.750
to plot position versus time.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.384
What we're gonna do in this video

00:00:10.384 --> 00:00:12.045
is use all of those skills.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.095
We're going to look at
position versus time graphs,

00:00:15.095 --> 00:00:17.831
and use them in order to
figure out displacement

00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:20.176
and distance traveled.

00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:21.446
So this first question says,

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:24.190
a 3.2 kilogram iguana runs back and forth

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.862
along the ground.

00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:28.432
The following graph shows
the horizontal position

00:00:28.432 --> 00:00:31.637
of the iguana in meters over time.

00:00:31.637 --> 00:00:32.470
The first question is

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.752
what is the displacement
of the iguana between

00:00:34.752 --> 00:00:38.117
zero seconds and five seconds?

00:00:38.117 --> 00:00:39.583
So, be very careful.

00:00:39.583 --> 00:00:42.542
It's not saying between zero
seconds and six seconds.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:45.116
It's saying between zero
seconds and five seconds.

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:48.343
So pause the video, and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:52.479
Well, displacement is just
your change in position.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:53.758
And sign matters.

00:00:53.758 --> 00:00:55.461
We care about direction.

00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:57.806
So it's going to be your final position

00:00:57.806 --> 00:01:00.590
minus your initial position.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.814
Well, what is your final position?

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:04.607
Well, we're not talking about the final,

00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:07.720
the last time that we have on the graph.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.447
Here our final is going
to be at 5 seconds.

00:01:10.447 --> 00:01:14.881
So our final position is
at a positive six meters.

00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:18.094
So our final position
is positive six meters.

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:20.711
And from that you're gonna
subtract our initial position,

00:01:20.711 --> 00:01:24.314
where our initial position
was at negative two meters.

00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:25.719
Negative two meters.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.121
And so this is going to be equal to

00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:31.121
six minus negative two
is positive eight meters.

00:01:32.227 --> 00:01:34.069
So one way to think about it is

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.761
net this iguana, shifts eight meters

00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:39.460
in the positive direction.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.093
And if we think positive
direction is, say, to the right,

00:01:42.093 --> 00:01:44.375
it would be eight meters to the right.

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.431
We could draw a number line here.

00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:48.151
So if we, it's sometimes confusing

00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:49.946
'cause we're talking about
the horizontal direction,

00:01:49.946 --> 00:01:51.935
but we're plotting
position vertically here.

00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:53.736
But we could take the same number line

00:01:53.736 --> 00:01:55.158
and make it horizontal.

00:01:55.158 --> 00:01:58.439
And you'd have negative
six, and negative four,

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.797
negative two, zero,

00:02:00.797 --> 00:02:04.970
two, four, six, eight.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.649
And so what's happening here

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.795
is the iguana is starting at negative two,

00:02:10.795 --> 00:02:12.676
and then over the next three seconds,

00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:14.676
it goes to positive six.

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:20.627
It goes over here, and so it
shifts to the right by eight.

00:02:20.627 --> 00:02:21.939
And that's what we saw right over there.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.354
Six minus negative two is eight.

00:02:25.354 --> 00:02:28.293
Now what about the distance
traveled by the iguana

00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:30.641
over that same time period?

00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:33.204
Pause the video, and see
if you can figure it out.

00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:36.713
Well, the distance is the
total length traveled.

00:02:36.713 --> 00:02:38.738
The total path length.

00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:41.403
But once again, it went from negative two

00:02:41.403 --> 00:02:44.596
all the way to positive six
over the first three seconds,

00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:46.416
and then it just stays there.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.470
So if we think about distance,

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.326
we're actually going
to get the same result.

00:02:50.326 --> 00:02:53.070
Even though we don't care
about direction here,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.808
we just care about the magnitude,

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:56.062
we still get the same thing.

00:02:56.062 --> 00:02:58.261
It traveled eight meters.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:02:59.912
So it travels eight meters.

00:02:59.912 --> 00:03:03.528
So we're gonna get the exact same result.

00:03:03.528 --> 00:03:05.345
Now what would be interesting is the thing

00:03:05.345 --> 00:03:07.335
what would be different if
instead of five seconds,

00:03:07.335 --> 00:03:09.606
if this said six seconds?

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.216
If this was between zero and six seconds?

00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:14.078
Well, then for displacement, we'd say,

00:03:14.078 --> 00:03:18.130
hey, look, we went plus
eight, but then we're gonna go

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.375
another negative six.

00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:23.298
So this right over here,

00:03:23.298 --> 00:03:24.615
lemme make that,

00:03:24.615 --> 00:03:27.560
you're gonna go another negative six,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.884
and so you actually have,

00:03:29.884 --> 00:03:31.895
you'd have the plus eight minus six.

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:35.287
So if you did it for all
the way to the sixth second,

00:03:35.287 --> 00:03:38.435
then your displacement is
going to be plus two meters.

00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:40.771
You have the eight, and
then you subtract the six.

00:03:40.771 --> 00:03:42.243
Another way top think about it is

00:03:42.243 --> 00:03:43.947
you would finish at zero.

00:03:43.947 --> 00:03:46.211
You started at negative two.

00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:49.600
Zero minus negative two is two.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.760
If you wanted to think about the distance

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.611
between zero seconds and six seconds,

00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:57.185
well, you would have this eight meters.

00:03:57.185 --> 00:03:58.857
And then, you would go,

00:03:58.857 --> 00:04:01.516
even though you're going back to zero.

00:04:01.516 --> 00:04:05.266
So you're going back to
zero right over here.

00:04:06.481 --> 00:04:07.661
Six meters.

00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:09.073
You wouldn't subtract it

00:04:09.073 --> 00:04:11.056
because the total path,
you traveled eight meters

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:13.545
to the right and then
six meters to the left.

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:14.864
And so you would add 'em.

00:04:14.864 --> 00:04:16.666
So if you said over the first six seconds,

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:17.883
instead of the first five seconds,

00:04:17.883 --> 00:04:20.490
this would be 14 meters.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.893
Let me make that clear again.

00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:23.639
Displacement and distance,

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.063
in both cases, you have plus
eight over that first leg,

00:04:27.063 --> 00:04:28.222
I guess you could say.

00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:30.279
And then when we talk about displacement,

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.062
we subtract it 'cause we're
now moving to the left.

00:04:33.062 --> 00:04:35.558
We move to the left by six.

00:04:35.558 --> 00:04:38.344
So in the case of displacement,
you subtract the six,

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:41.296
and you have a net displacement

00:04:41.296 --> 00:04:43.818
of plus two.

00:04:43.818 --> 00:04:46.328
But distance, the total path traveled,

00:04:46.328 --> 00:04:47.719
you have the eight to the right,

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:49.187
and then six to the left.

00:04:49.187 --> 00:04:52.362
Which gives you a total
path traveled of 14.

00:04:52.362 --> 00:04:54.945
Let's do one more example here.

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.049
A 2.7 kilogram armadillo

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:01.945
rolls in a straight line in the desert.

00:05:01.945 --> 00:05:04.281
The following graph shows
the horizontal position

00:05:04.281 --> 00:05:05.156
in the...

00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:06.577
The horizontal position of the armadillo

00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:08.673
in meters over time.

00:05:08.673 --> 00:05:09.726
And so let's think about the same thing.

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.750
Over the first 24 seconds,

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.336
let's go all the way to the 24th second.

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:18.049
Let's think about what the displacement is

00:05:18.049 --> 00:05:20.282
and what the distance traveled is.

00:05:20.282 --> 00:05:21.689
So, first pause this video,

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.121
and see if you can figure
out the displacement

00:05:24.121 --> 00:05:27.881
over the first 24 seconds.

00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:30.601
Well, this is going to
be our final position

00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:32.615
minus our starting position.

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:35.982
Our final position, we're at zero meters.

00:05:35.982 --> 00:05:39.006
Our starting position,
we were at time zero,

00:05:39.006 --> 00:05:40.839
we were at six meters.

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:44.759
All right, lemme just
write the numbers down.

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.344
So it is negative six.

00:05:46.344 --> 00:05:47.792
Let me say that one more time.

00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:52.256
At time 24, notice our
vertical coordinate.

00:05:52.256 --> 00:05:55.003
We are in a position of zero.

00:05:55.003 --> 00:05:56.573
That's where that came from.

00:05:56.573 --> 00:05:58.977
When we started, at time zero,

00:05:58.977 --> 00:06:01.169
our position was right over here.

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.813
So our final, minus our
starting, is negative six.

00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:05.927
And you could also see that.

00:06:05.927 --> 00:06:07.653
If you just look along this line,

00:06:07.653 --> 00:06:11.805
we shifted from positive six to zero,

00:06:11.805 --> 00:06:14.537
which would be a shift of six to the left

00:06:14.537 --> 00:06:16.002
if you made this horizontal.

00:06:16.002 --> 00:06:18.386
Or a displacement of negative six.

00:06:18.386 --> 00:06:20.275
Lemme draw this on a horizontal line

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:23.575
just to make this a little bit more clear.

00:06:23.575 --> 00:06:26.857
So if you have zero, four, oh...

00:06:26.857 --> 00:06:31.504
Zero, three,

00:06:31.504 --> 00:06:34.175
six, nine,

00:06:34.175 --> 00:06:37.940
12, 15, so on and so forth.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:42.357
We are starting at six,
do that purple color.

00:06:42.357 --> 00:06:43.837
We're starting at six,

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:45.566
we do a bunch of stuff in between,

00:06:45.566 --> 00:06:49.439
but then we end up after
24 seconds at zero.

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.742
So our shift,

00:06:50.742 --> 00:06:54.854
we went six to the left.

00:06:54.854 --> 00:06:57.087
Or we have a displacement of negative six.

00:06:57.087 --> 00:07:00.474
Zero minus six is negative six.

00:07:00.474 --> 00:07:03.666
So now let's try to figure out distance.

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:06.183
Pause the video, and
figure out the distance

00:07:06.183 --> 00:07:10.266
that this armadillo travels
over this 24 seconds.

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.839
So, this is interesting.

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:15.038
So it's right here.

00:07:15.038 --> 00:07:17.646
It starts off at position of six.

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:18.610
So let me do it right here.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.833
It starts off at position of six.

00:07:19.833 --> 00:07:23.024
It stays there for the
first eight seconds.

00:07:23.024 --> 00:07:25.960
Then, from the eighth
second to the 16th second,

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.127
it's position increases
by nine to get to 15.

00:07:31.011 --> 00:07:32.731
So it does this.

00:07:32.731 --> 00:07:33.898
It goes to 15.

00:07:34.803 --> 00:07:37.270
So this is going to be plus.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.372
This is going to be plus nine.

00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:43.924
And then, on the 16th second,

00:07:43.924 --> 00:07:47.720
it goes from 15 back to zero.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.762
So it goes from 15

00:07:49.762 --> 00:07:53.901
back to zero.

00:07:53.901 --> 00:07:55.567
If we're thinking about displacement,

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:57.381
we would write a minus 15 here,

00:07:57.381 --> 00:08:00.729
and then we would net these
out to get to a negative six.

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:02.849
But we're thinking about distance.

00:08:02.849 --> 00:08:05.601
So we want, we think
about the absolute value

00:08:05.601 --> 00:08:08.592
of the various parts of the path traveled.

00:08:08.592 --> 00:08:10.048
So all of these are gonna be positive.

00:08:10.048 --> 00:08:12.280
We just say, hey, what
is the total journey?

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.026
So this is gonna be plus 15.

00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:15.763
We just care about the
length of these arrows,

00:08:15.763 --> 00:08:17.371
not the direction.

00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:21.783
And so, nine plus 15 is 24.

00:08:21.783 --> 00:08:22.646
So this is interesting.

00:08:22.646 --> 00:08:26.783
Even though the armadillo
traveled a total of 24 meters,

00:08:26.783 --> 00:08:29.384
its entire path was 24 meters long.

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:31.958
Its net shift, its displacement,

00:08:31.958 --> 00:08:36.144
is six meters to the left.

00:08:36.144 --> 00:08:38.344
And this is another thing to emphasize.

00:08:38.344 --> 00:08:40.004
This negative number,

00:08:40.004 --> 00:08:42.736
this is implying direction.

00:08:42.736 --> 00:08:45.366
It's saying, if we're
look at this number line,

00:08:45.366 --> 00:08:46.874
it's saying to the left.

00:08:46.874 --> 00:08:49.110
Even if it was a positive six,
because we're talking about

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.060
displacement, it would imply,

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.971
positive would mean to the right.

00:08:52.971 --> 00:08:54.957
Distance doesn't tell you about direction.

00:08:54.957 --> 00:08:57.683
It just tells you the absolute magnitude

00:08:57.683 --> 00:09:00.171
of the total distance traveled,

00:09:00.171 --> 00:09:02.421
or the length of the path.
