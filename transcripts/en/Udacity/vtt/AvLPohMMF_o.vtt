00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.650
It's been difficult to identify quote, mood genes,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.960
for traits like bipolar disorder for two main

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.510
reasons. The first is that bipolar disorder is

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.090
more of a collection of syndromes, rather than

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.190
a specific condition. There's no single diagnostic test

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.820
or biomarker that allows us to delineate the

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.220
trait. And heterogeneity in the trait itself, makes

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.310
it more difficult to identify coherent genetic correlations.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.370
And the second reason is that bipolar disorder may be

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.320
caused by a very large number of genetic factors that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.880
interact among themselves, and with the environment. And this means

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.650
that any given SNV that might explain part of the trait.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.930
Would require a huge population to find it and that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.000
same SNV would only account for a small amount of the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.020
overall genetic risk. Until we have more precise information, patients

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.320
and families are going to have to deal with the best technology

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.440
that we have available. And we could all do

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.165
a better job at understanding how bipolar disorder develops.
