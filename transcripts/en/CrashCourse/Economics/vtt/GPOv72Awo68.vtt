00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.889
Jacob: Welcome to Crash Course Economics.
My name is Jacob Clifford.

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.989
Adrienne: And I'm Adrienne Hill. And today
we're going to do something a little different.

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:13.100
We're going to explore one moment in history
in depth. We're going to talk about how the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.580
2008 Financial Crisis happened and the government
response to it in the United States.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.880
Jacob: So let's get started.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:27.280
[Theme Music]

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.120
Jacob: The 2008 Financial Crisis was a big
deal. Ben Bernanke said it could have resulted

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.059
in a 1930s style global financial and economic
meltdown with catastrophic implications. But

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.480
what happened? Why did it happen? And why
aren't we all huddled around burning trash

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.129
cans forming a raiding party to go steal gas
from other tribes in the wasteland?

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.739
By the way, if you're actually doing that,
you probably didn't hear we survived the financial

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.420
crisis. Things got better. Seriously. Put
down your crossbows.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.699
Adrienne: To explain what happened, first
we have to do a quick explainer about mortgages.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.379
And you might already know this, but basically
someone that wants to buy a house will often

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.899
borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars from
a bank. In return, the bank gets a piece of

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.290
paper, called a mortgage.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.190
Every month, the homeowner has to pay back
a portion of the principle, plus interest,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.690
to whomever holds the piece of paper. If they
stop paying, that's called a default. And

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.480
whomever holds that piece of paper gets the
house.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.360
The reason I'm saying whomever holds the paper,
rather than the bank, is because the bank,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.770
the original lender, often sells that mortgage
to some third party. And the reason I say

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.570
often is because this happens all the time.
I've had my house for nine months, and three

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.680
different banks have had the mortgage.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.780
Traditionally, it was pretty hard to get a
mortgage if you had bad credit or didn't have

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.850
a steady job. Lenders just didn't want to
take the risk that you might "default" on

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.690
your loan, but all that started to change
in the 2000s.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.260
And before we go further, a quick aside here.
The story gets complicated fast, and it's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.420
a fascinating story. But we're trying to keep
it relatively simple. So, I've asked Stan if

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.660
we could put some additional resources in the YouTube
description. And Stan said "Yes." Thanks Stan!

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.580
Anyway, back to our story. In the 2000s, investors
in the U.S. and abroad looking for a low risk,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.719
high return investment started throwing their
money at the U.S. housing market. The thinking

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:15.439
was they could get a better return from the
interest rates home owners paid on mortgages,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.360
than they could by investing in things like Treasury
Bonds, which were paying very, very low interest.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.680
But big money, global investors didn't want
to just buy up my mortgage, and Stan's mortgage.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.069
It's too much hassle to deal with us as individuals.
I mean, we're pains. Instead, they bought

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.760
investments called mortgage backed-securities.
Mortgage backed-securities are created when

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.389
large financial institutions securitize mortgages.
Basically, they buy up thousands of individual

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.769
mortgages, bundle them together, and sell
shares of that pool to investors.

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.380
Investors gobbled these mortgage backed-securities
up. Again, they paid a higher rate of return

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.939
than investors could get in other places and
they looked like really safe bets. For one,

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.489
home prices were going up and up. So lenders
thought, worse case scenario, the borrower

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.560
defaults on the mortgage, we can just sell
the house for more money.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.069
At the same time, credit ratings agencies
were telling investors these mortgage backed-securities

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.150
were safe investments. They gave a lot of
these mortgage backed-securities AAA Ratings--the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.610
best of the best. And back when mortgages
were only for borrowers with good credit,

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.710
mortgage debt was a good investment.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.550
Anyway, investors were desperate to buy more
and more and more of these securities. So,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.220
lenders did their best to help create more
of them. But to create more of them, they

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.599
needed more mortgages. So lenders loosened
their standards and made loans to people with

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.959
low income and poor credit. You'll hear these
called sub-prime mortgages.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.639
Eventually, some institutions even started
using what are called predatory ending practices

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:48.249
to generate mortgages. They made loans without
verifying income and offered absurd, adjustable

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:53.809
rate mortgages with payments people could afford
at first, but quickly ballooned beyond their means.

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:58.920
But these new sub-prime lending practices
were brand new. That meant credit agencies

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.939
could still point to historical data that
indicated mortgage debt was a safe bet. But

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.169
it wasn't. These investments were becoming
less and less safe all the time. But investors

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.949
trusted the ratings, and kept
pouring in their money.

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:17.060
Traders also started selling an even riskier
product, called collateralized debt obligations,

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.900
or CDOs. And again, some of these investments
were given the highest credit ratings from

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.760
the ratings agencies, even though many of
them were made up of these incredibly risky loans.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.880
While, the investors and traders and bankers
were throwing money into the U.S. housing

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:37.120
market, the U.S. price of homes was going
up and up and up. The new lax lending requirements

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.889
and low interest rates drove housing prices
higher, which only made the mortgage backed

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.990
securities and CDOs seem like an even better
investment. If the borrowers defaulted, the

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.080
bank would still have this super valuable house, right?
No. Wrong. Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.400
Actually, let's go to the Housing Bubble.
You remember bubbles, right? Rapid increases,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.120
driven by irrational decisions. Well, this
was a bubble, and bubbles have an annoying

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.220
tendency to burst. And this one did. People
just couldn't pay for their incredibly expensive

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.960
houses, or keep up with their ballooning mortgage
payments.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.360
Borrowers started defaulting, which put more
houses back on the market for sale. But there

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.850
weren't buyers. So supply was up, demand was
down, and home prices started collapsing.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.920
As prices fell, some borrowers suddenly had
a mortgage for way more than their home was

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:32.040
currently worth. Some stopped paying. That
led to more defaults, pushing prices down further.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:37.520
As this was happening, the big financial institutions
stopped buying sub-prime mortgages and sub-prime

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.140
lenders were getting stuck with bad loans.
By 2007, some really big lenders had declared

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.900
bankruptcy. The problems spread to the big
investors, who'd poured money into these mortgage

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.780
backed securities and CDOs. And they started
losing money on their investments. A bunch

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.700
of money. But wait. There's more.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.820
There was another financial instrument that
financial institutions had on their books

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.800
that exacerbated all of these problems--unregulated,
over-the-counter derivatives, including something

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.920
called credit default swaps, that were basically
sold as insurance against mortgage backed securities.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.449
Does AIG ring a bell? It sold tens of millions
of dollars of these insurance policies, without

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.259
money to back them up when things went wrong.
And as we mentioned, things went terribly

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:26.679
wrong. These credit default swaps were also
turned into other securities -- that essentially allowed

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.500
traders to bet huge amounts of money on whether
the values of mortgage securities would go up or down.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.220
All these bets, these financial instruments,
resulted in an incredibly complicated web

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.000
of assets, liabilities, and risks. So that
when things went bad, they went bad for the

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.060
entire financial system. Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.660
Some major financial players declared bankruptcy,
like Lehman Brothers. Others were forced into

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.320
mergers, or needed to be bailed out by the
government. No one knew exactly how bad the

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.150
balance sheets at some of these financial
institutions really were--these complicated,

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.950
unregulated assets made it hard to tell.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:08.900
Panic set in. Trading and the credit markets
froze. The stock market crashed. And the U.S.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.370
economy suddenly found itself in a disastrous
recession.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.719
Jacob: So what did the government do? Well,
it did a lot. The Federal Reserve stepped

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:19.539
in and offered to make emergency loans to
banks. The idea was to prevent fundamentally

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:23.180
sound banks from collapsing just because their
lenders were panicking. The government enacted

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.969
a program called TARP, the troubled assets
relief program, and which the rest of us call

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:31.650
the bank bailout. This initially earmarked
$700 billion to shore up the banks. It actually

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.410
ended up spending $250 billion bailing out
the banks, and was later expanded to help

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.550
auto makers, AIG, and homeowners.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.550
In combination with lending by The Fed, this
helped stop the cascade of panic in the financial

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.640
system. The treasury also conducted stress
tests on the largest Wall Street banks. Government

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:50.479
accountants swarmed over bank balance sheets
and publicly announced which ones were sound

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:53.879
and which ones needed to raise more money.
This eliminated some of the uncertainties

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.120
that had paralyzed lending among institutions.

00:07:56.129 --> 00:08:02.329
Congress also passed a huge stimulus package
in January 2009. This pumped over $800 billion

00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:06.209
into the economy, through new spending and
tax cuts. This helped slow the free fall of

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:07.960
spending, output and employment.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:13.740
Adrienne: In 2010, Congress passed a financial
reform, called the Dodd-Frank law. It took

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:19.210
steps to increase transparency and prevent
banks from taking on so much risk. Dodd-Frank

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:24.199
did a lot of things. It set up a consumer
protection bureau to reduce predatory lending.

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:29.620
It required that financial derivatives be
traded in exchanges that all market participants

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:36.080
can observe. And it put mechanisms in place for
large banks to fail in a controlled predictable manor.

00:08:36.089 --> 00:08:41.419
But, there's no consensus on whether this
regulation is enough to prevent future crises.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:45.790
Jacob: So, what have we learned from all this?
Well, one key factor that led to the 2008

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.510
financial crisis was perverse incentives.
A perverse incentive is when a policy ends

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:53.580
up having a negative effect, opposite of what
was intended. Like, mortgages brokers got bonuses

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.320
for lending out more money, but that encouraged
them to make risky loans, which hurt profits in the end.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.360
That leads us to moral hazard. This is when
one person takes on more risk, because someone

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.700
else bears the burden of that risk. Banks and lenders
were willing to lend to sub-prime borrowers because

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.920
they planned to sell mortgages to somebody else.
Everyone thought they could pass the risk up the line.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.529
The phrase "too big to fail" is a perfect example
of moral hazard. If banks know that they're

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:19.400
going to be bailed out by the government, they
have incentive to make risky, or perhaps unwise bets.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.800
Former Fed Chairman, Alan Greenspan
summed it up really nicely when he said,

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.860
"If they're too big to fail, they're too big."

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.300
Adrienne: When something terrible happens,
people naturally look for someone to blame.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:34.399
In the case of the 2008 financial crisis,
no one had to look very far because the blame

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:37.479
and the pain was spread throughout
the U.S. economy.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:42.840
The government failed to regulate and supervise
the financial system. To quote the bi-partisan,

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.380
financial crisis inquiry commission report,
"the sentries were not at their posts, in

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.760
no small part due to the widely accepted faith
in the self-correcting nature of the markets,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.460
and the ability of financial institutions
to effectively police themselves."

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:02.120
The report placed some of the blame on the
years of deregulation in the financial industry.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.680
And blamed regulators themselves for not doing
more. The financial industry failed. Everyone

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.540
in the system was borrowing too much money
and taking too much risk, from the big financial

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.940
institutions to individual borrowers. The
institutions were taking on huge debt loads

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:24.040
to invest in risky assets. And huge numbers of home
owners were taking on mortgages they couldn't afford.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.420
But the thing to remember about this massive
systemic failure, is that it happened in a

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:34.290
system made up of humans, with human failing.
Some didn't understand what was happening.

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:40.490
Some willfully ignored the problems. And some
were simply unethical, motivated by the massive

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.060
amounts of money involved.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.589
I think we should give the last word today
to the financial crisis inquiry commission

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:52.669
report. To paraphrase Shakespeare, they wrote,
"The fault lies not in the stars, but in us."

00:10:52.669 --> 00:10:53.969
Thanks for watching.
