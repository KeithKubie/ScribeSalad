(electronic music)

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.140
- Welcome to a conversation with history,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.520
I'm Harry Kreisler of the
Institute of International Studies

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.440
Our guest today is Michael Warner

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.509
who is the Knox professor of
English and American Studies

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:46.500
at Yale University, he was chairman

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.750
of the English department of Yale from...

00:00:51.628 --> 00:00:56.628
2008 to 2014, he is the 2018
Tanner Lecturer at Berkeley.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.100
Michael, welcome to Berkeley.
- Thank you.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.800
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.650
- In the mountains of North Carolina.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.203
In a small town in a
Pentecostalist family.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.470
- Aha, and looking back,
how did your parents shape

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.973
your thinking about the world?

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.000
- Well, it's...

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.220
It's an early experience in
a kind of counterculture,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.533
I suppose you might say.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.270
But also the world of...

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.170
Pentecostalism in the
mountains in those days

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.100
was a very intense one,
but it was also a very...

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.420
Reading focused one, and as
I got a lot of acquaintance

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.440
with the Bible and a lot of
familiarity with theological

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.240
argument and that's
really the training ground

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.520
for my intellectual life.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.520
- And was the whole family very religious?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.260
Did you talk about religious
issues at the dinner table?

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.650
- Oh, Lord yes, and my mother...

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.800
I grew up with my mother
because she was divorced

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.210
and she had three marriages,
each of which was more unhappy

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.270
than the one before, the
more unhappy she got,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.220
the more deep she went into
the world of faith healing

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.728
and Pentecostalism,

00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:18.728
so it was an inescapable
element of the environment,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.970
there were Bible studies
several times a week

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.700
and prayer meetings and
she would speak in tongues

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.110
while vacuuming the
carpet so it was constant.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.750
- Now in your work there is a recognition

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.750
and an acceptance of the
emotional element often

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:39.805
in writing and speaking
and public discourse.

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:43.721
Is this the root of that?

00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:44.970
- I'm sure I learned it there, absolutely.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.423
- And so then where did, what
was your public education

00:02:49.423 --> 00:02:51.523
like, or did you go to a religious school?

00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:55.290
- Well, I was sent to a religious school,

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.710
Orrel Roberts University.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.031
Which was the only university
that was really acceptable

00:02:59.031 --> 00:03:02.430
to the family and...

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.930
And so it was quite a
while before I joined the,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.240
what we would think of
the mainstream of secular

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.820
intellectual life, that didn't really come

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.160
til graduate school.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.940
- And this undergraduate...

00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:19.440
Study at Orrel, is that
primarily Biblical study,

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.563
or do they offer secular courses?

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.100
- Well, there is no philosophy department.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.260
If you want to study philosophy, you do so

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.690
in the theology department

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.264
and fortunately I found a very sympathetic

00:03:32.264 --> 00:03:35.940
and protective teacher who
was an English professor

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.340
and that sent me on the
path toward English.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.340
- And was this an awakening
that occurred over time?

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.310
- Oh yeah.
- Over time.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.339
- Oh yeah, the decompression
process was slow

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:55.292
and moved by stages because
I also had to deal with being

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:59.190
queer and it's not an easy
environment to do that in.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.670
You would get thrown out
of course if it were open

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.130
or suspected even, so...

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.590
Yes, it took a long time
to make all the adjustments

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.364
to secular life and queer identity.

00:04:11.364 --> 00:04:16.364
- And so, after the
Orrel Roberts experience,

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.110
you basically said, well,
I'm gonna pursue my studies

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.140
but I'm gonna move to the secular world.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.130
Tell us a little bit
about that transition.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.710
it doesn't sound like it's an easy one.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.700
- No, it wasn't easy
because one of the things

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.670
about growing up in a religious subculture

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.090
is that you don't feel entitled to...

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.710
First class education, no
one ever mentioned to me

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.320
that I could have gone
to a place like Berkeley.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.490
It was kind of unthinkable.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.963
So first of all, just
figuring out what is the map

00:04:49.963 --> 00:04:54.550
of institutions outside that
world, that I could attend

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.430
was a challenge, my father
had gone to the University

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.285
of Wisconsin, so that was
a kind of easy default path

00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:02.407
and I did a master's degree there

00:05:02.407 --> 00:05:05.490
and while I was studying at
the University of Wisconsin

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.570
I realized that everyone there
was reading all this exciting

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.839
new work that was coming
out of John Hopkins,

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:15.811
so somehow I decided, I
gathered up the courage

00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:18.010
to apply to Johns Hopkins
and that's really the event

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.930
that changed my life,
that steered me in a whole

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.170
new direction.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.120
- And what did you do
your dissertation on?

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.520
- On 18th century American literature.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.609
It became my first book.

00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:35.609
I got interested in how
print, the world of print,

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.810
seemed by the 19th century to
already be taken for granted

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.534
by people as the real
matrix of social life.

00:05:44.534 --> 00:05:49.170
So I began wondering how that came to be,

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.962
when did that happen, when
did that come to be the case

00:05:51.962 --> 00:05:56.803
and pushed my studies backward
into the colonial period.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.320
- I like to ask my guests...

00:06:00.332 --> 00:06:05.332
What are the skills and
temperament required for

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:09.500
the scholarship or the work that they do?

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.500
You are a social critic,
a literary critic, what...

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.500
Do you see in retrospect as
the skillset that goes with

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.630
these vocations?

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.380
- Well, I guess my understanding
of that changes over time

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.890
as the surrounding world changes.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.960
I realize now that...

00:06:33.931 --> 00:06:37.010
That world of Bible study that I came from

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.410
had trained me in very intense
sustained concentration

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.860
on a text and that I think
is something that's rarer

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.830
and rarer as people read
more and more from screens

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.663
and in a distracted state.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.940
So I feel lucky to have
grown up in that culture

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.870
of the word, in intense
investment in the word

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.732
and the willingness to
spend a long amount of time

00:07:06.732 --> 00:07:08.960
with a page.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.480
So that's one thing, but the intensity of,

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.070
you used the word emotional,
I'd say the full body,

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.190
full spectrum intensity
of that world also...

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.630
Disposed me to think about
how language circulates

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.580
in the world and the full range of effects

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.503
that it creates in a social life.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.573
- And what about temperament?

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.483
- Well...

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.690
There's a kind of polemical
disposition in that religious

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.973
subculture that I guess carried
over into academic life.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.680
This was a world in
which churches regularly

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.600
went through schisms of various kinds.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.740
We were always picking up
and moving to another church

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.150
because the preacher
seemed not quite orthodox

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:01.729
on a certain point or
we became less orthodox

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:04.620
on a certain point or something like that.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.620
So the primacy of argument
and the strong feeling

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.480
that went with argument was I
guess something that carried

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.290
over into intellectual life,
although I've also learned to

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.833
not cast people into hell
for disagreeing with me.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.680
- It's interesting because
you grew up in an enclosed

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.380
environment, so to speak,
and then you moved to

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.960
the larger secular world.
- Exactly.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.960
- Now in your work, there is
a focus on marginal groups.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.170
- Yes.
- On outsiders.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.150
- Yes.
- On the integrity

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.450
of those groups.
- Yes.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.766
- On the extent to which they can affect

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:56.590
social transformation
in the larger society,

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.030
so these...
- Absolutely.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:04.030
- Various experiences were
a kind of training, I guess,

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:09.070
for the focus that your
intellectual life would take.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.748
- Absolutely, I am keenly
sensitive to the tendency

00:09:12.748 --> 00:09:17.748
to foreclose the world of the acceptable

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.620
and create various margins or boundaries

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.790
and whenever I perceive
that there is someone

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.550
outside the boundary of the
normal or the acceptable,

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.700
my ears go up and I want
to learn more about that

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.433
and I think there is a kind of,

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.220
for many of us who have
been through a formative

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.640
experience like that, there's
a kind of translatability

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.160
between one kind of counterculture
sensibility and another

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.640
Once you are willing, once
you have the experience

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.170
of being willing to stand
outside the mainstream

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.410
and you know that you'll
survive and you know

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.610
that you'll find other
people who are likeminded...

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.900
It opens you to other formations like that

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:04.493
and you are less willing
to play the blackmail

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.893
if you like of normal life.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.310
- And by blackmail of normal
life in the sense that...

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:19.140
Normal life wants to put you
in a certain way of thinking.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.920
- Yes, right, exactly.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.100
Well, not just way of thinking,

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.480
but whole mode of comportment,

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.410
the whole set of priorities
for what are your life goals

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.863
and what's acceptable behavior
of various kinds, yeah.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.330
- Your first book, which
I guess came out of your

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:42.410
dissertation, was letters
of the republic, publication

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.480
and the public sphere
in 18th century America.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:50.970
Help us understand your
contribution there.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:53.760
In other words, it was known that...

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.600
An important change occurred
in the various kinds

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:04.630
of journals, letters and
newsletters that were coming

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.530
into being before the time
of the revolution and after.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.713
- Yes, in fact the going
theory at the time was

00:11:14.713 --> 00:11:16.780
that this was just the natural consequence

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.890
of print technology.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:21.300
There was a very important book

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.900
by Elizabeth Eisenstein
called the Printing Press

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.900
Is an Agent of Change and so it was...

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.670
A well accepted area of
inquiry, how did printing

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.273
change culture, it seemed
to me that that way

00:11:35.273 --> 00:11:38.700
of telling the story
was too one directional

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.420
or one dimensional, that...

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:44.250
Before it was possible for
print to really change much

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:46.920
in social life, you had to
have a certain perception

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.590
of print, a certain way
of using print and because

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:55.050
I was working in literary
study, this seemed like

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:57.323
a natural thing to think about.

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:00.620
It was also probably important

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.950
that I was working in
colonial American literature,

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.060
which is a...

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.510
Funny little byway in
English studies because

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:11.270
the colonial period in American literature

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:13.250
doesn't have major novelists.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.510
The American novel
doesn't start until after

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:19.620
the revolution, it
doesn't have major poets

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:22.930
of, like, Wordsworth or Milton so...

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:27.440
What does colonial
American literature mean?

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.850
Usually ended up meaning
people who were writing things

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.220
for purposes other than
literary consumption,

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.840
Benjamin Franklin, for
example, so the field kind of

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.344
lent itself readily to
someone who wanted to look at

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:44.660
a wide range of uses of
print and think about

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:47.493
what is the standing of
a text in the culture.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.820
- And it's here that you
begin to develop your theories

00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:58.033
of public and counterpublic.

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.530
- Yeah.
- Especially the notion

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.530
of how a new public came into being.

00:13:06.825 --> 00:13:07.828
- Yeah.

00:13:07.828 --> 00:13:09.400
- And it's not as you just said,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.810
just that print changed everything.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.810
It was rather the audience contributing

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.010
to what print could be.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:20.843
- Exactly.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.100
And therefore new ways
of writing and publishing

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.620
to reach an audience
like that, the concept

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.830
of the public, which
we now take for granted

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:31.540
as part of our social world really emerged

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.788
at the very beginning of the 18th century

00:13:33.788 --> 00:13:38.460
and so that was a very
striking fact to me.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:41.320
It was trying to understand
that or trying to understand

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.130
what are the different
practices of writing

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.410
and publication that go with that concept,

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.947
that make that concept
seem natural or that

00:13:48.947 --> 00:13:53.370
follow from the availability
of that concept?

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:55.170
That's what I wanted to think about.

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:00.650
At the time, the pathbreaking
work of Jorgan Habermas

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:04.503
on the public sphere was still
untranslated into English.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:08.520
I had to read it, I don't read
German, so I had to read it

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.780
in a French translation,
the English translation

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.780
came out in the late 80s and...

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:21.430
I had groped my way toward a
lot of the same perceptions

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:26.133
or the same themes, so
it was, in retrospect,

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:30.530
the right moment in history
to be thinking about that.

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.100
- And the picture that
emerges in your book,

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.220
I'm trying to come up with a term,

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.410
it's the...

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:45.398
Written word and its
relation to its audience

00:14:45.398 --> 00:14:50.398
is almost like a very good
seminar with discussion.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.470
So that the people who are
reading are also engaging and

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:05.350
feeding into the creation of a community.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:08.330
- Well, that's the theory.
- Yeah, that's the theory.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.110
- Now in fact, the concept
of the public derived from

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.440
broadcast modes of
publication, which don't have

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.730
that closed circle of
community discussion at all.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:23.940
In fact, they succeed to the
degree that they sell more

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.415
copies, get more distribution than...

00:15:28.415 --> 00:15:30.800
The responses come back.
- Right.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.240
- So it's asymmetrical.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.540
Broadcast publication is
crucially asymmetrical,

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:39.980
it's the whole structure.
- But in your book,

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.430
as you come to terms with the public,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.070
it's very different from the
public as we know it today.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.390
- Oh, of course, yes,
because broadcast media

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:49.890
were really all that there were then

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.040
and there was no such
thing as social media.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.873
- Right.

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:57.058
- But that's another subject,
is how it's changed today,

00:15:57.058 --> 00:16:01.806
but in the world dominated
by broadcast printing

00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:05.262
and later by broadcast electronic media,

00:16:05.262 --> 00:16:09.690
asymmetry is very important
and so in order for it to

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.761
really look like the
culture of a democracy,

00:16:12.761 --> 00:16:17.460
sometimes the response had to be faked.

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:20.983
Letters to the editor were
often written by the editors.

00:16:20.983 --> 00:16:25.393
It was important for it to look
like a two way conversation

00:16:25.393 --> 00:16:29.150
even when the interests of
the publishers was often in

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.720
maximizing the imbalance.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:36.720
- So then your theory as
it emerges in the book

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:42.540
is really about a
possibility, the implications

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:45.350
of what was really going on.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:49.410
- Yes, so there are
several key things I think

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.240
to understanding the way
media works in this kind of

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:56.550
modern society and one is
that there is an imaginary

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.308
uptake of what the social
world is, that is you

00:16:59.308 --> 00:17:04.120
look at a printed object and you are,

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.110
without even knowing that
you make this assumption,

00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:10.760
you are assuming that
countless strangers are

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.591
also looking at the same thing.

00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:15.222
- We're talking about the colonial period.

00:17:15.222 --> 00:17:17.110
- The colonial period but
also the contemporary period

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:19.032
when we're looking at broadcast media.

00:17:19.032 --> 00:17:19.865
- Okay.

00:17:19.865 --> 00:17:24.854
- So the background awareness
of all those unseen strangers

00:17:24.854 --> 00:17:29.130
is a key part of how the
whole phenomenon works.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.980
It's not just that you
read a book that was copied

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:35.880
by a scribe in your monastery
and only three people

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.840
have read it, or, you know, if
that's what the situation is

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.460
you're not dealing with a
public in the modern sense.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:45.970
So there's an imaginary
uptake about what the nature

00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:50.770
of the social world is and
that gives a special prominence

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:53.590
to the coexistence of strangers.

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:57.128
I think this has been the
great theme of all the work

00:17:57.128 --> 00:18:01.946
I've done on publics, is the
primacy of stranger sociability

00:18:01.946 --> 00:18:06.946
in the forms of modern life and
that's really transformative

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.108
and it's not something that people notice

00:18:09.108 --> 00:18:12.880
because it is so much at
the level of their imaginary

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.600
uptake, their background assumptions about

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.580
how language circulates in the world.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.720
So strangers come to have a
different importance to us.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.140
They're not just foreigners
who happen to be traveling

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.766
through your village,
they're not just people away

00:18:28.766 --> 00:18:31.240
off somewhere that you don't
have anything to do with,

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.630
they can be intimately
involved in your world and

00:18:36.486 --> 00:18:39.070
of course nationalism is one expression of

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:41.830
how people can imagine
themselves as being related

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:45.310
to strangers, but all
kinds of public debates

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:49.146
and social movements and
counter movements are formed by

00:18:49.146 --> 00:18:51.320
people's willingness
to think of themselves

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.290
as coinvolved with strangers.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.730
- And what then becomes important
in this early period is...

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:04.890
The discourse involved
ideas of citizen autonomy,

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:11.030
republicanism, so they
become the vehicle for

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:15.440
a common language that is
the basis of our democracy.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.400
- Exactly, so if you are
suddenly finding yourself

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.919
in a world where you are
writing to an audience

00:19:21.919 --> 00:19:26.919
of strangers, how do you
understand the difference between

00:19:27.369 --> 00:19:31.310
who you are as someone
speaking to strangers

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:32.850
and who you are in the rest of your life?

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:35.077
That difference can be pretty marked.

00:19:35.077 --> 00:19:38.960
And in the 18th century,
there's a language

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.080
of political thought called
republicanism in which

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:48.840
the fate of the republic is
in the hands of the people

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.170
who have enough virtue
to put the common good

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.905
above their own private
good, so this language of

00:19:54.905 --> 00:19:59.040
the common as opposed to the private was

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.320
what enabled people to speak to strangers

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.820
in this broadcast environment in that way.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:09.820
- And does the recognition
of a world of strangers

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:15.047
then legitimize the
conversation in some way?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.090
- Absolutely, and also shapes it, so...

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.810
You are speaking to strangers in the cases

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.700
that we're talking about
in a public sphere,

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.070
you are speaking to
strangers whom you imagine

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.970
as your contemporaries
and whom you imagine as

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:34.508
coinvolved in the life of your society.

00:20:34.508 --> 00:20:37.820
And that shapes things in a lot of ways.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.092
It means that your sense of
history is organized around

00:20:42.092 --> 00:20:46.680
the rhythms of publication
and reception and answering

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.830
dialogs in public debate, so...

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:55.830
It became habitual for people
to think of print or public

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:58.660
language as...

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:01.490
Positioned on a timeline of the present.

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:05.530
Again, in contrast to the
reading of a manuscript

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:09.910
that might have been lying
around for decades or centuries

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.063
without losing any of its urgency,

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:16.457
things became contemporary
and newspapers, of course,

00:21:16.457 --> 00:21:18.020
are the greatest marker of that.

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.070
They carry their date on the front page

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.010
and they circulate in
a very short timeframe.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.264
- Why was Benjamin Franklin
such a pivotal figure

00:21:27.264 --> 00:21:30.740
in this transformation?

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:34.120
- Well, I think, the obvious
answer, the short answer

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.125
is because he was a printer.

00:21:36.125 --> 00:21:41.125
And he was an extremely astute
printer who realized that

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:43.310
the business he was in...

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.600
Was transformative.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.850
And he had encounters

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:52.715
early in his life that set that imprint.

00:21:52.715 --> 00:21:57.200
He was an apprentice in his
brother's print workshop

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.256
when his brother got into
trouble with the authorities

00:22:00.256 --> 00:22:03.730
and his newspaper was
briefly printed over his name

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.853
as a sort of ruse to get
around the censorship.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:13.490
So he understood early on that
printing was a kind of rival

00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:17.370
to traditional forms of authority

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:21.420
and that you could
appeal to strangers in...

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:25.080
A persona, under a
pseudonym or anonymously

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.100
and thus veil yourself.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.980
And make that separation
between the common good

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:35.330
and your private life very
sharp by not even appearing

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:37.030
in your own name.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.580
Most of what Benjamin
Franklin wrote, he did not

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.130
except for his correspondence,
he did not write

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.580
under his own name and that I think

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.200
was a transformative recognition.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.340
He was ahead of the curve
on how public discourse

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.023
was going to work in the modern world.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:02.350
- This case study is one in which the...

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.080
Focus is on the emergence of a public

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.070
and it's a new public.
- Yeah.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:16.790
- So there is social transformation by...

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:20.660
What in the beginning must
have been a marginal group

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:24.863
but which in effect changed the world.

00:23:24.863 --> 00:23:26.570
- Yes.
- And the world became,

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:31.570
so this may be the ideal that...

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:37.130
Is missing in other, your later
works where you're focused

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:41.820
on the marginal, protecting the integrity

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:46.050
of the marginal groups
and you see that as a way

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.520
of potentially transforming the whole.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.670
- Yes, that's true,
although the other thing

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.430
to be said there is that the
dynamics are not unrelated,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.263
that is...

00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:00.180
When you get a counterformation,

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.880
a social movement for example,

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.900
it is formed through the
same kinds of stranger

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.818
sociability as the dominant
public and has the same...

00:24:10.818 --> 00:24:14.133
Contemporaneity, the same
relation to a social emergence

00:24:14.133 --> 00:24:16.790
that the dominant public has, so...

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:22.290
One of the points that I
make in the essay on publics

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.230
and counterpublics is
that counterpublics are

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.190
publics too, and they're
formed by the same

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.170
media infrastructures,
it's not just that you have

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:32.600
local communities of dissent.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.380
You have communities of
dissent that have the same

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.942
dynamics of public formation

00:24:37.942 --> 00:24:40.563
that we see in the dominant culture.

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:42.763
- But...

00:24:42.763 --> 00:24:47.763
It is the case that the ability of the...

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:55.500
Marginal groups to transform the whole...

00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:01.470
That capacity is not one
that is as easily realizable.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.613
- That's right, exactly, yes.

00:25:06.472 --> 00:25:07.305
- Right, okay.

00:25:07.305 --> 00:25:12.305
So your insights that
emerge in the first book

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.500
is really an ideal, not
subsequently as easily realizable.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.100
- That's right, well...

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.440
That's also been a theme in...

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.630
In a variety of inquiries into this topic.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.990
Habermas himself famously argued that the

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:35.450
public sphere was a kind of
ideal in the 18th century

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:39.123
that was betrayed by modern
societies in the 19th century.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:43.400
When public media
increasingly became vehicles

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.700
of advertising so that the
public would be in a sense

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.130
sold to the advertisers
as a potential audience

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:54.110
for consumption and so on
and liberal editors agreed

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.110
to draw certain boundaries
around the sphere

00:25:57.110 --> 00:26:01.880
of acceptable discussion,
so even there in Habermas

00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.983
and this was a book that was
written in German in the 60s,

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.290
there was a strong emphasis
on the way the ideal

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:12.260
had never fully been realized, in fact,

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:16.300
Habermas was working on
the Frankfurt School's idea

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.590
of imminent critique,
that what you needed to do

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.440
in order to criticize
bourgeois society was not

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.870
bring to bear on it
extraneous criteria of value

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.650
but judge it by its own ideals.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.560
Hold it to its own best version of itself

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.960
and the best version of
liberal bourgeois society

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.611
is that in the ideal of the public sphere,

00:26:37.611 --> 00:26:42.316
as a place where people
can argue or contribute

00:26:42.316 --> 00:26:46.120
representations of the good
life from any point of view

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.304
whatsoever, in fact it
doesn't work that way

00:26:48.304 --> 00:26:53.010
but imagining that it
might turns out to be

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.423
a powerful way of seeing one
of the limits of this society.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:02.950
- In your book, which I
think takes its title from

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:07.330
the essay you just talked about, Publics

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.083
and Counterpublics,

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.850
you talk a lot about...

00:27:13.966 --> 00:27:17.810
The emergence of counterpublics, that is,

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:21.132
and tell us a little about counterpublics

00:27:21.132 --> 00:27:24.926
and how they are in a way like publics

00:27:24.926 --> 00:27:27.350
but in some ways different.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:30.410
- Well, the impetus for
this came from thinking

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:33.090
about social movements
in the 20th century,

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:35.470
the women's movement, the gay movement,

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.980
civil rights movement,
how are those publics?

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:43.980
And this was a much debated topic once

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.876
Habermas's book got
translated into English

00:27:46.876 --> 00:27:50.799
and I realized that once you
started thinking about it,

00:27:50.799 --> 00:27:54.970
the existence of counterpublics
goes all the way back

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.630
to the emergence of the
concept of the public.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.670
It was no sooner imagined
that strangers could be

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:06.290
organized this way than
people began to imagine...

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.720
Rival or excluded groups
organizing themselves

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.040
in the same way and in
fact, by my current research

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.860
is about how early
evangelicalism can be understood

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:19.650
as a kind of counterpublic.

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:24.650
Evangelicalism that emerged
in the 18th century is...

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.210
Significantly distinguished
from previous versions

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:32.340
of Protestantism by its
willingness to preach to strangers.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.443
And by the aggressive use of public media.

00:28:37.349 --> 00:28:40.697
And so the Protestant
religion got reoriented around

00:28:40.697 --> 00:28:45.110
the language of conversion
that allowed people to think of

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:49.610
address to strangers as the
primary mode of religiosity

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:53.183
so in that sense, evangelicalism is a...

00:28:53.183 --> 00:28:58.100
Strong example of the new
mentality of the public sphere.

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:02.950
However, it was also combative
and it understood itself

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.680
as trying to call people out
of the, what it understood

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.023
as the dominant culture.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.880
Didn't have the language of the secular

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:15.660
to name that dominant
culture, but that language

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:20.330
grew out of this conflict, so
you have an interesting split

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:24.970
emerging in the 18th century
between the increasingly

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:28.513
secular world of the political public,

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.620
Benjamin Franklin again
being a key example,

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.230
and the counterformation of...

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:39.137
People who saw the same public
media as an opportunity for

00:29:39.137 --> 00:29:41.643
conversionsistic outreach.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:46.520
- You make a great deal of the fact that

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:51.620
these countercultures have the potential

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:53.710
because of the way they're using the media

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:58.550
and they're addressing strangers
to transform the whole,

00:29:58.550 --> 00:29:59.823
basically.
- Yes.

00:29:59.823 --> 00:30:04.130
- So there is an emphasis on...

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:09.130
Media but also how the
media in different hands

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.980
becomes something different.

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:17.890
This theory is very applicable
to what's going on now

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.490
and I want to draw that
out of you in a way.

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:23.960
In other words, social
media of the electronic

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.960
and internet kind is new, and
what we've witnessed recently

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.260
is the...

00:30:32.846 --> 00:30:35.179
Emergence of a counterpublic

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.110
that has many of the characteristics

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.690
that you describe in your--

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:43.550
- You're thinking of the
alt right for example.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.790
- Yeah, yeah, the alt
right, and let me just quote

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:49.420
something that you say
here, public discourse

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.290
says not only, that is for this...

00:30:53.895 --> 00:30:56.820
Counterpublic, let the public exist.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.020
But let it have this character.

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:02.690
Speak this way, see the world in this way.

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:06.000
It then goes in search of confirmation

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.940
that such a public exists
with greater or less success

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.720
being further attempts to
cite, circulate and realize

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.613
the world understanding it articulates.

00:31:18.894 --> 00:31:22.250
- Yeah, well, okay, so you
can see how the alt right

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:26.250
is a version of that because
in that world it's understood

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.285
that American means person like us,

00:31:29.285 --> 00:31:31.450
so this is a way that...

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:37.540
This is a bit of a paradox
and it's a complication that

00:31:38.572 --> 00:31:41.600
counterpublics very often
think of themselves as...

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:46.167
Publics in waiting, that
is to say as striving to be

00:31:46.167 --> 00:31:50.020
the dominant public and as
giving voice to what they think

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.600
should be the dominant public

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.120
and this is a really good example

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:55.809
because the alt right of course knows

00:31:55.809 --> 00:31:59.453
that it's embattled and in a way minor.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:02.350
But...

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:03.882
Also...

00:32:03.882 --> 00:32:07.210
Aspires to be the dominant public itself

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:10.710
and that contradiction
is visible everywhere

00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:14.680
so people will speak
with rage and resentment

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.930
and hostility that marks their awareness

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.970
of being marginal.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:22.730
At the same time they will
act as though all good

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:24.890
Americans already agree with us

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.970
and so they're trying
to realize their version

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:31.533
of what it means to be a
member of the American public.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:37.580
- How have their actions as
a counter, if we look at them

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:42.660
as a counterpublic, how
have they changed the media,

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:46.660
the new electronic media
which they have seized on

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.980
to build up their base?

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.550
- Well, it might be
better to put the question

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.094
the other way around.
- Okay.

00:32:51.094 --> 00:32:54.410
- Because they've realized
that we inhabit different

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:57.160
media ecology now and...

00:32:58.216 --> 00:33:00.070
The publics and counterpublics
essay came out in 2002.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.883
We didn't have social media then.

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:07.290
But I did already understand
that something was changing

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.050
with the availability of the internet

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:14.050
because that rhythm of
contemporaneity that allows us

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:17.370
to know where we stand in
history with all these other

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.870
strangers who stand with us in history

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.230
was beginning to shift.

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.870
So instead of weekly
newspapers or daily newspapers,

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:27.680
you suddenly had 24/7 access of websites.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:31.070
And that sense of time
has continued to evolve

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.210
in social media.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:37.230
But more profoundly I think
the social media break,

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.420
the broadcast model that's always been

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.142
the underpinning of our sense of a public

00:33:42.142 --> 00:33:45.330
so rather than sending...

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:50.593
Material out as far and wide
from one point as you can,

00:33:51.698 --> 00:33:56.180
in the late 20th century,
for example, we had three

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:59.090
broadcast networks that really
dominated everybody's sense

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:02.810
of what the news was, suddenly
you've got as many points

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:06.650
of origin as there are people and...

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.620
People imagine the texture
of their public world more

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.113
in terms of networks
than in terms of publics.

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.540
And that has fractured

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.150
the language of the public

00:34:19.150 --> 00:34:20.647
in a really profound way

00:34:20.647 --> 00:34:23.723
and I don't think anyone knows
quite how to handle that.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:28.470
Broadcast media still
exists and so we still have

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:30.220
the sense that there is
something like the national

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:33.730
public out there, but you can see from...

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.110
You can see from polling numbers,

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.410
from the persistence of a very
large percentage of America

00:34:41.410 --> 00:34:44.400
that seems quite immune to the news

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:48.540
that the rest of America's absorbing,

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:53.040
that the public no longer
exists, if it ever did

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.483
as a single sutured space.

00:34:56.416 --> 00:35:00.080
- And this undoubtedly
contributes to the fragmentation

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:01.100
of American politics.

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.360
- Well, absolutely.
- Yeah.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.080
- Yes, absolutely and
therefore too, the...

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:12.070
Strength of resentment, because...

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.900
I think all parties are quite exasperated

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.570
by their inability to reach this putative

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:20.683
national public.

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:26.640
- And what do you see as
the long term implications

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.023
of this, is it just
continued fragmentation?

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.600
- That's the fear, of course.
- Yeah.

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.640
- One has no idea, I mean,
one couldn't really have

00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.823
predicted this state of
affairs 20 years ago,

00:35:40.511 --> 00:35:42.240
so who knows how this
media ecology will evolve,

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:45.841
but I think it's quite
scary in its implications.

00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:50.841
So much of what we understand
as democracy or as self

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.530
governance has to do with the
ability of a world of media

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.770
to hold itself together and to...

00:35:58.745 --> 00:36:03.745
Be a space of mutual respect
and mutual accommodation,

00:36:03.787 --> 00:36:07.973
that when we no longer believe
that that space exists,

00:36:07.973 --> 00:36:12.880
you have all kinds of very
scary opportunities for

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.863
fascistic and other kinds
of politics to emerge.

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:20.130
- Let's talk a little now about your book

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:24.550
The Trouble With Normal, a book that is

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:29.550
most known for its
criticism of gay marriage.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.030
And again, this book was
written in the 1990s, I think.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:36.450
- That's right, when the idea of marriage

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:39.040
was still a controversial
one within the gay movement

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:43.800
and did not yet seem to
be an inevitable future.

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.870
There was a lot of
argument among gay people

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.810
about whether this was the
right priority for the movement

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:51.930
or whether it was the be all
and end all of the movement

00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.603
as some people were proposing.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.370
- Two ideas that struck me in that book

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:01.280
and there are many there,
one is the extent to which

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.280
the institution of marriage
was a sector of privilege,

00:37:07.513 --> 00:37:11.620
that excludes those who are not married

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.750
and talk a little about
that because it's a set

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:18.730
of privileges, rights
to custody of children,

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:22.850
rights to inheritance, and all,

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:25.490
medical coverage at that time.

00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:28.830
Talk a little about that
because that's very important.

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:31.260
- Well, it is, in the popular imagination,

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:34.250
marriage is just one thing,
it's a kind of recognition

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.713
of a loving relationship.

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:39.165
And that's the way it was
being sold to gay people.

00:37:39.165 --> 00:37:42.180
We have love just the
way straight people do,

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.130
why shouldn't it be
recognized just the way

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.030
straight people's love was recognized?

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:50.170
Well, fine, except that
marriage isn't exactly that.

00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:52.530
You can have marriage without
love and you can have love

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.700
without marriage and so
that didn't seem like

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:57.240
a very satisfactory
account of what marriage is

00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:59.542
and when you started to look into it

00:37:59.542 --> 00:38:04.542
you realize that marriage
is an enormous bundle

00:38:04.543 --> 00:38:09.543
of different privileges and obligations.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.130
You get your spouse...

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.910
Has special access to medical
care and to death rights

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.610
and to disposition of the
body and hospital visitation

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:24.610
and childcare and all kinds
of other things that...

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.330
We just take for granted
as a single package,

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:29.600
but that hasn't always been the case

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.830
and it isn't always the
case in other legal systems

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:36.450
like the French legal
system, so I wanted to just

00:38:36.450 --> 00:38:41.140
drive a little space
between the language of love

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.020
and recognition and the
actual politics of what...

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.500
On the ground happens
when people get married

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.660
because it seemed to me that
gay people who had lived

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:54.102
without this institution for a long time

00:38:54.102 --> 00:38:57.070
had developed their own
patterns of intimacy

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.810
and their own patterns of social life

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:00.978
and their own patterns of mutual care,

00:39:00.978 --> 00:39:04.705
especially after the AIDS crisis,
it was a very robust world

00:39:04.705 --> 00:39:09.440
of mutual care and it
seemed that it was suddenly

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.040
being shoehorned into this model around

00:39:14.063 --> 00:39:17.740
the monogamous couple and...

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:22.240
We weren't thinking creatively
about other ways that

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.591
those rights and obligations
might be distributed

00:39:25.591 --> 00:39:29.400
among your intimacies, why not...

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:33.540
Think about experiments in
this form, like the French

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.833
were doing at the time?

00:39:36.793 --> 00:39:40.161
And I thought that language
about how marriage is just love

00:39:40.161 --> 00:39:43.795
was what was preventing
people from thinking about

00:39:43.795 --> 00:39:45.483
other possibilities.

00:39:47.740 --> 00:39:50.400
- And the second point
that emerges is the...

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.289
Extent to which the...

00:39:55.289 --> 00:39:56.622
Counterpublic...

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.650
Represents...

00:40:03.102 --> 00:40:07.737
Variations in the way
people relate to each other.

00:40:08.757 --> 00:40:09.650
- That's right.
- Which...

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:13.910
Has an integrity of its own and...

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.000
Should be respected and importantly...

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
By letting gays marry, you
threaten that integrity

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.230
by coopting people into marriage.

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:31.700
- Well, that's certainly one
of the, part of the potential

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:35.440
and it depends not just
on the legal institution.

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.530
Because people can want
that legal institution

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:39.934
for all kinds of reasons, you
know, if you have a partner

00:40:39.934 --> 00:40:44.934
and you're facing sickness
and death together,

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:50.110
marriage is a very useful tool
for protecting you from...

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.313
You know, homophobic families or whatever.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.530
But to the degree that gay
people began to internalize

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:03.530
the idea that all we want as
gay people is to be accepted

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:07.484
into the mainstream and be
married just like straight people

00:41:07.484 --> 00:41:12.484
they foreclosed all the
richness of public intimacies

00:41:13.715 --> 00:41:17.410
in the gay world, they
foreclosed all the work

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:19.880
of experimentation that
queer people had been doing

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.970
for generations.

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:24.180
And I worried about that

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.455
especially because in the queer world,

00:41:27.455 --> 00:41:30.280
memory is very fragile.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.210
You don't learn from your
parents how the gay world

00:41:34.210 --> 00:41:37.150
is structured, so there's
not a whole lot of

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:40.720
intergenerational transfer,
and it seemed to me

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.950
especially...

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.870
Dangerous that the...

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:49.114
Language of marriage would
just colonize the imagination

00:41:49.114 --> 00:41:52.840
of younger gay people,
they would come of age

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.325
thinking, oh, yes, this is the experience,

00:41:55.325 --> 00:41:58.580
this is the goal that
validates my experience

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:00.320
as a gay person, is marriage.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.324
In fact, I think that has
happened for a certain stratum

00:42:03.324 --> 00:42:04.613
in the gay world.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.530
Fortunately, I think there's
also been a counter movement,

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:12.160
that is that a lot of
younger people coming of age

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.080
have been disillusioned by that language

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:18.680
and have seen its shallowness
and its falseness.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:22.220
The trans movement has
been really powerful

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.020
in reawakening people
to all the exclusions

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.770
that are performed by
traditional gender identity

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:31.020
and marriage and so I think there is a...

00:42:32.823 --> 00:42:34.180
Very powerful...

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.960
Movement in...

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.980
Gay life against the narrowing
that marriage represented

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:43.300
at the same time that
marriage can be a step

00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.390
towards other kinds of recognitions.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:48.660
I think it only works
that way if people refuse

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:52.563
the narrowing through which
marriage was sold to us.

00:42:53.908 --> 00:42:55.658
- Two very different groups, the...

00:42:56.902 --> 00:43:00.670
Queer community on the one hand,
the alt right on the other.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:04.360
And in both cases, you
have counterpublics dealing

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:08.343
with the public, what
is your thinking about

00:43:08.343 --> 00:43:13.180
the dynamic between
counterpublics and publics

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:18.050
because sometimes we may
want a greater realization

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.570
and sometimes we may not.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.320
- Oh, absolutely so there's...

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.170
There's always a kind of oscillation.

00:43:25.004 --> 00:43:26.690
This is the dynamic of
history and politics

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:30.289
in a society like ours,
is when is your public...

00:43:30.289 --> 00:43:33.376
Trying to be the dominant public?

00:43:33.376 --> 00:43:37.450
And when is it withdrawing?

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:42.450
And in a sense embracing
the barriers that exclude it

00:43:43.208 --> 00:43:46.793
in order to create a
space of experimentation?

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:50.349
And I think both dynamics are important

00:43:50.349 --> 00:43:53.055
and both dynamics have been
there in every movement,

00:43:53.055 --> 00:43:55.379
including those evangelicals
I was talking about earlier

00:43:55.379 --> 00:43:56.810
because you can see in
evangelicals a constant

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.350
oscillation between the idea of...

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.960
Drawing apart from the
mainstream society in order

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.600
to create this better,
reformed more Christian

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.640
way of life and insisting
that they represent

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.070
the Christian nation that's
been there all along.

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:14.550
I think just about every
counterpublic does that

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:19.550
to some degree or another
and so queer life has been,

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:24.410
in many ways, really
enabled by its marginality,

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:28.980
by its exclusion from the
open space of inspection

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.833
and surveillance and whatnot
that goes with being public.

00:44:32.871 --> 00:44:37.060
- As I think about your
intellectual odyssey,

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:42.060
it seems that your evangelical beginnings

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:46.740
your movement to the secular
world, then into the...

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.740
History of the colonial
period, that there is a...

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.400
There is a...

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:58.400
Training ground for
perception of these dynamics.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:00.155
Is that a fair assessment?

00:45:00.155 --> 00:45:03.010
- I think that's accurate, although

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:06.823
these continuities only become
clear to me in retrospect.

00:45:06.823 --> 00:45:10.208
It never is obvious at the time.

00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:14.780
I have been very fortunate
in my life to be able

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:17.740
to move from one topic
of inquiry to another

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:21.837
and reinvent my expertise such as it is.

00:45:21.837 --> 00:45:25.540
You know, many people
in the academic world

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:28.938
find a subspecialty and
go into it and own it

00:45:28.938 --> 00:45:31.630
for the entirety of their careers

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:33.553
I have not been that kind of person.

00:45:34.968 --> 00:45:36.800
I've always been attracted to those...

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.260
Topics or areas of
inquiry that no discipline

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.930
seems to own and no one seems
to have a good language for

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:45.170
so the public sphere.

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:46.763
When I started working on that,

00:45:47.876 --> 00:45:49.794
what was that, was that political science,

00:45:49.794 --> 00:45:51.820
was it literary study, was it history?

00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:54.800
Was it philosophy, it
was all of those, and

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:59.550
secularism, later on,
in my life or queerness.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:03.800
What discipline owned those topics and...

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.040
Those are the ones that
always seemed really exciting

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:10.240
to me and so I have experienced
myself at those moments

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.730
as leaping from one...

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:16.250
To another in a way that
required radical reeducation.

00:46:16.250 --> 00:46:17.800
I've had to go off and...

00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.520
Learn whole new bodies of work each time

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.530
and then it turns out I've been
working on the same problem

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.370
all along. (laughs)

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:31.370
- So if I were trying to
understand you better...

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:34.823
Is it fair to say you
are a social libertarian?

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:39.090
- Oh, I wouldn't use the
language of libertarian, no,

00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:40.180
because that...

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:45.850
Presupposes that individual
freedom is the...

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:48.162
Foundational building block of everything.

00:46:48.162 --> 00:46:51.230
I have a very strong
communitarian side, if you want

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.370
to think in terms of those oppositions.

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:56.840
I have always been interested in the way,

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.890
what counts to us as a meaningful freedom

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.840
is conditioned on our
participation in a life world

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.130
of others, and...

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.180
Queer life is a really
great example of that.

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:12.180
You can't really get very
far being gay or being queer

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.840
just by declaring your
personal liberty to be so.

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.050
You have to find other
people and you have to find

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.210
other people on a shared
mode of sociability

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:23.440
that allows you to be
gay or queer or whatever

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:26.990
in a way that will prove
to be satisfying to you.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:28.540
And it's always a process of...

00:47:29.772 --> 00:47:32.100
Mutual discovery and mutual elaboration.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.897
So I think that...

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.670
I think this is the backbone
of the counter public concept

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:43.470
is that it is a life world of...

00:47:44.637 --> 00:47:46.870
A life world transacted
among strangers, really.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.010
That is the enabling
condition for anything

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:51.680
that would count as personal freedom.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.630
- Your Tanner lectures
here will be put online

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:59.630
in audio form, but my sense
from hearing your first lecture

00:47:59.764 --> 00:48:04.764
is that you're struggling
to find a counterpublic

00:48:06.877 --> 00:48:11.290
with regard to climate change
and the environmental movement

00:48:12.607 --> 00:48:15.550
but there is a concern
about its co-optation.

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:19.200
- Exactly, yes, right, so
in one way, it feels like

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:23.072
the gay marriage issue all
over again, and has strong

00:48:23.072 --> 00:48:26.670
personal connections for
me because the particular

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:29.070
corner of the queer world
that I have the strongest

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.870
affinity to is a...

00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:35.080
Network of radical fairies
that's built around

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.520
a system of communes, that
is, these are intentional

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.284
communities that date
from the off grid movement

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:43.007
of the 60s and 70s.

00:48:43.007 --> 00:48:47.440
- And the off grid refers to
the grid, not the electric grid

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.131
- Yes, the electric
power grid, so there is,

00:48:49.131 --> 00:48:52.970
the radical fairy world is a
really remarkable convergence

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:56.510
between, if you like, gay life

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:58.690
and the back to the land movement.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:00.740
It's been around since

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.880
one of the founders of the gay movement

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:06.880
is a man named Harry Hay
who got dissatisfied with...

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:11.320
Mainstream organizing and
tried to steer gay life

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:16.320
toward this radically utopian
back to the land vision.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.503
Now that was a long time ago,
but many of these communes

00:49:20.503 --> 00:49:25.503
still exist and are organized
around ways of thinking

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:30.510
of community and experimentation that...

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:32.663
Off grid movement really sheltered, so.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.140
When I look around now at climate change

00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:37.980
and the importance of
the electrical power grid

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.100
to dealing with climate
change, I'm realizing

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:43.990
that there was a strong vision of...

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:48.740
What infrastructure ought
to be for a livable society,

00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:52.880
what the grid represented,
how it wasn't exactly

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:57.479
the livable infrastructure
of a good society.

00:49:57.479 --> 00:50:00.727
That that movement
developed in the 60s and 70s

00:50:00.727 --> 00:50:04.410
and is now really increasingly forgotten

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:07.530
and foreclosed by the
necessity of reforming

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:09.830
the grid for climate change,

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:12.850
so I have taken up this
project partly as a way

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:15.506
of thinking about where
is this world headed

00:50:15.506 --> 00:50:18.340
in the age of climate change?

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.980
What does it mean to be
alive at this moment?

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:25.010
But also, more particularly,
what can be retrieved

00:50:25.010 --> 00:50:28.800
from that tradition of contrarian thought?

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.630
- One final question and
a brief answer if you can

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:34.090
'cause we're nearing the end of our time.

00:50:34.090 --> 00:50:37.780
If our audience watches
this and they become attuned

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.697
to the notion of publics
and counterpublics,

00:50:41.697 --> 00:50:45.254
is there something they
should think about,

00:50:45.254 --> 00:50:50.254
what should they bring to
the focus on the conflict

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:53.830
between counterpublics and publics?

00:50:53.830 --> 00:50:58.580
Is it liberal humanistic
values that help you

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.000
evaluate...

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:05.730
What a counterpublic has to contribute?

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:08.070
- Well, I suppose that's
true, and many of my friends

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:09.933
think that liberal is a bad word.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.480
On the other hand, when Martha
Nusbaum reviewed my book

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:17.610
she called me the queer
John Stewart Mills,

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:21.130
so I guess I ought to own the label.

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:25.680
I think that liberalism is a kind of...

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:28.320
Problematic term because everyone thinks

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.980
they know what it is and
it's in fact a very fractious

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.437
and developing tradition
that can mean quite a lot

00:51:35.437 --> 00:51:37.990
of different things, most people I know

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:41.000
who think of themselves as left critics

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.670
of liberalism nevertheless

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:45.210
have a lot of the principal values

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:48.040
of liberalism, like the harm principle.

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:53.040
And so I suppose yes, I do
have some central commitments

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:56.620
that I can recognize as being
part of the liberal tradition.

00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:01.620
However, I am also trying
to be aware, constantly,

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:06.160
of what's excluded and
what are usually set

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:08.400
as the boundaries of acceptable behavior

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.020
in a liberal public sphere.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.870
- Well, on that note,
Michael I want to thank you

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:17.012
very much for coming
to the Berkeley campus.

00:52:17.012 --> 00:52:18.895
- Well, thank you.
- And taking the time

00:52:18.895 --> 00:52:19.895
to be on our program.

00:52:19.895 --> 00:52:21.310
- It's been a pleasure.
- And thank you very much

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:24.673
for joining us for this
conversation with history.

00:52:25.635 --> 00:52:28.552
