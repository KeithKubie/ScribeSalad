00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.350
All right, so
this seems like a good time to stop and

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.090
ask ourselves what have we learned?

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.770
&gt;&gt; Oh, you're asking me?

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:06.890
&gt;&gt; I am indeed, I'm sorry.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.000
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's not a problem,
I think I know the answer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.570
So the first thing is we
relearned everything we learned

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.410
from the MDP lessons from before.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.400
So, we learned all
about Scooby Doo MDPs.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.630
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I don't think
that's a kind of MDP.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.250
&gt;&gt; It is now.
We should write a paper, quick.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.110
&gt;&gt; And so that included things like
what are states, and transitions, and

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.570
rewards, and so forth, right?

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.680
&gt;&gt; Right, I think.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.380
&gt;&gt; Anything else?

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.000
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we learned
a bunch of new things.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.395
So for me,
I learned all about Q functions

00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:39.160
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.280
&gt;&gt; I learned about continuations And,

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.600
in general, when I think about that,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.050
I really learned about what
the Bellman Equations,

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.550
as opposed to equation,
are really trying to capture for you.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.350
Even more than we did when we
talked about that with MDPs.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.155
&gt;&gt; Alright, so deeper understanding of
the Bellman Equation and how it relates

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:00.020
the rewards in this infinite
sequence of rewards to each other.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.070
Yeah, that's sort of
what I was going for.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think that's a lot.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.140
And I think I learned
that notation matters.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.671
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay.

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:09.710
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; No,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.010
remember we talked about
the reward in the Scooby Doo MDP.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.360
We talked about R is a function of S.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.410
And when we talked about Q functions and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.150
C functions in the Bellman equations,
we went to R being S of a.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.500
And even though we had mentioned
before that they were mathematically

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.700
equivalent, it turns out,
just like sometimes thinking about Q,

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.480
sometimes thinking about C might be
better than thinking about V or U.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.843
It turns out that sometimes thinking
about R of S of a, Is better than

00:01:36.843 --> 00:01:40.620
thinking about R of S, even if they
really are mathematically equivalent.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.180
&gt;&gt; And in some sense it
doesn't matter though, right,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.065
because we actually were able
to do similar things with the R,

00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:46.580
S as we are with the R, S, a.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.160
&gt;&gt; True, although, you know what,
that's not really notation, right?

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.240
Notation is used doing V instead of U.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.290
This is really a representation.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.370
&gt;&gt; Ooh.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.780
Representation matters.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I think that's
actually a pretty important lesson.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.430
And when I think about some of the other
things that we know about reinforcement

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.180
learning, the representation is
going to make a huge difference.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.750
&gt;&gt; I think that's right.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.930
I think that's a good lesson for
I want to say AI in general, but

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.919
certainly machine learning.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.055
&gt;&gt; Okay, well that seemed like
a profound point to end on.

00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:13.180
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.500
So we'll pick it up with
reinforcement learning next time.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.140
&gt;&gt; Done.
Let's do that.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.360
Have a good time, Michael.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.860
&gt;&gt; You too.
&gt;&gt; Bye.
