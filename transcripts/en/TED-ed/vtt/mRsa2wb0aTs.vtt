00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:08.455
Since the dawn of humanity,

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:13.876
an estimated 100.8 billion
people have lived and died,

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:19.236
a number that increases by about
.8% of the world's population each year.

00:00:19.236 --> 00:00:22.456
What happens to all 
of those people's bodies after they die

00:00:22.456 --> 00:00:26.715
and will the planet eventually
run out of burial space?

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:28.506
When a person's heart stops beating,

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:32.656
the body passes through several
stages before it begins decomposing.

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:34.287
Within minutes after death,

00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:37.966
the blood begins settling in
the lower-most parts of the body.

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.005
Usually eight to twelve hours later,

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:46.084
the skin in those areas is discolored
by livor mortis, or post-mortem stain.

00:00:46.084 --> 00:00:49.896
And while at the moment of death
the body's muscles relax completely

00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:52.677
in a condition called primary flaccidity,

00:00:52.677 --> 00:00:58.247
they stiffen about two to six hours later
in what's known as rigor mortis.

00:00:58.247 --> 00:01:00.377
This stiffening spreads 
through the muscles,

00:01:00.377 --> 00:01:05.587
and its speed can be affected by age,
gender, and the surrounding environment.

00:01:05.587 --> 00:01:07.588
The body also changes temperature,

00:01:07.588 --> 00:01:10.897
usually cooling off 
to match its environment.

00:01:10.897 --> 00:01:13.055
Next comes decomposition,

00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:17.238
the process by which bacteria and insects
break apart the body.

00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:20.277
Many factors affect 
the rate of decomposition.

00:01:20.277 --> 00:01:24.797
There is, however, a basic guide of the
effect of the environment on decompositon

00:01:24.797 --> 00:01:26.758
called Casper's Law.

00:01:26.758 --> 00:01:28.967
It says that if all other 
factors are equal,

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:35.198
a body exposed to air decomposes twice
as fast as one immersed in water

00:01:35.198 --> 00:01:39.322
and eight times as fast 
as one buried in earth.

00:01:39.322 --> 00:01:43.554
Soil acidity also greatly 
affects bone preservation.

00:01:43.554 --> 00:01:46.981
High-acidity soils with 
a pH of less than 5.3

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.658
will rapidly decompose bone,

00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:54.739
whereas in a neutral or basic soil
with a pH of 7 or more,

00:01:54.739 --> 00:01:59.685
a skeleton can remain in relatively
good condition for centuries.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:04.088
Different cultures throughout history have
developed unique approaches to burials.

00:02:04.088 --> 00:02:06.720
As far back as 
the first Neanderthal burials,

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.100
death was accompanied by rituals,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.418
like the positioning, coloring,
or decorating of corpses.

00:02:13.418 --> 00:02:17.002
Traditional Christian burials decorate
the body in dress,

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.460
while in traditional Islam,

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.940
a body is wrapped in a piece 
of ritual fabric

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.059
with the face oriented toward Mecca.

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.023
Traditional Hindus ceremonially burn
the body,

00:02:27.023 --> 00:02:31.270
and Zoroastrians, followers of one of the
oldest monotheistic religions,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.643
traditionally place bodies atop a tower
to expose them to the Sun

00:02:35.643 --> 00:02:38.004
and scavenging birds.`

00:02:38.004 --> 00:02:42.247
Before the Industrial Revolution,
burials were simple and accessible.

00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:47.191
These days, with suitable burial land
running out in high-population areas,

00:02:47.191 --> 00:02:50.290
purchasing private gravesites
can be costly,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.047
and many people can't afford
simple burials.

00:02:53.047 --> 00:02:56.862
Even cremation, the second most common
burial practice in the world,

00:02:56.862 --> 00:02:59.209
comes with a high cost.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.392
As for the question 
of running out of space,

00:03:01.392 --> 00:03:04.302
the issue isn't so much about total land
in the world

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:08.788
as it is that large populations cluster
together within cities.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.977
Most of the big cities in the world

00:03:10.977 --> 00:03:14.570
may run out of suitable burial grounds
within a century.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.390
For London, it's even sooner.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.883
That may happen by 2035.

00:03:18.883 --> 00:03:21.842
So are there alternatives
to traditional burials

00:03:21.842 --> 00:03:24.392
that might help with the space issue?

00:03:24.392 --> 00:03:29.341
In some countries, skyscraper cemeteries
enable vertical burials.

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:32.853
Some options focus on the body's
relationship with the environment.

00:03:32.853 --> 00:03:37.793
Promession, for example, freeze-dries
and pulverizes the body,

00:03:37.793 --> 00:03:40.342
creating a powder 
that can turn into compost

00:03:40.342 --> 00:03:43.311
when mixed with oxygen and water.

00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:46.458
There are also green burials that use
special materials,

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:48.651
such as biodegradable caskets,

00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:50.542
urns that sprout trees,

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:53.802
and burial suits that grow mushrooms.

00:03:53.802 --> 00:03:57.442
Eternal reefs take that concept
to the depths of the ocean

00:03:57.442 --> 00:04:03.433
using a mixture of ashes and cement
to create marine habitats for sea life.

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:06.552
Death is an inevitable part
of the human condition,

00:04:06.552 --> 00:04:10.483
but how we treat bodies and burials
continues to evolve.

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:12.392
We may each have different spiritual,

00:04:12.392 --> 00:04:13.373
religious,

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:15.943
or practical approaches to dying,

00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:18.533
but the ever-increasing demand
for burial space

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:20.692
might give us a push to be creative

00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:24.663
about where our bodies go
after the final stages of life.
