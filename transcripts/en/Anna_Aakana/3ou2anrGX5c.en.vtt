00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
I can get caught up in trying to be better

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.380
at everything.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:03.980
 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.440
--at anything, really.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.860
Hey, how have you been?

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.660
Hey.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.560
Ah, I'm good.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.000
Actually, I just showed my teacher my dissertation and she--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.560
I'm sorry.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.020
I'm so sorry.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.980
That was such a shitty greeting on my part.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.040
Do you mind if we just, uh,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.120
rewind and start over?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.820
Uh...

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.320
Okay?

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.820
Okay. Okay.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.920
*clears throat*

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.420
*takes deep breath*

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.160
Hi! How've you been?

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.900
I'm good.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.900
As I was saying...

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.840
I turned in my dissertation and--

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.640
Oh my God.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.140
Oh.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.680
My.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.580
Freaking God.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.080
I don't know what's wrong with me today.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.920
Um.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.920
I didn't believe that at all.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.260
Did you believe it? Was it believable?

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Do you mind if I just do it one more time?

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.940
Just like.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.460
Yeah. Quit.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.960
Another take.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.840
Okay. Cool cool cool.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.320
*vocal exercises*

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.180
...Okay?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.960
I'm obviously a huge advocate

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.000
of self improvement.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.140
Over the last seven years,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.640
I've made 400 videos

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.620
and the majority of those

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.120
have been devoted to becoming

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.640
a better version of yourself.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.120
Whether it's physical tricks

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.680
to increasing confidence

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.680
or promoting emotional vulnerability

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.680
or encouraging radical honesty.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.180
I have always been on the side that 
if you can do better, you should do better.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.020
What the hell is this, Bob?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.000
What?

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.980
This form.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.260
Why did you do this?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.080
Look at the name space.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.240
Now look at the address space.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.000
Bob.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.340
I really need you to take your job as form-maker seriously.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.800
People already hate filling out forms.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.920
If you give them this impossible shit

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.300
they're gonna lose their minds.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.480
No one even knows who makes

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.840
all the forms they fill out.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.040
I know, Bob.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.860
I know.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.560
And I want the satisfaction of knowing

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.700
that all over the world

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.640
people are filling out forms with smiles on their faces

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.880
because they have adequate line space

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.620
for the corresponding prompt.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.940
Damn it, Bob.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.600
We have a thankless job in a corporate-run world,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.360
but that doesn't mean we have to give up!

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.420
No!

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.400
That means we are only accountable to ourselves.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.780
That means the only way to bring purpose

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.480
and life into our meaningless, mundane existence

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920
is to have a work ethic that we're proud of.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.400
It means having the BEST DAMN FORMS

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.500
we can possibly create!

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.920
Be the ART that we pour our HEARTS and MINDS into!

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.700
Um.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.620
Okay.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.340
I-I'm sorry. I'll do it again.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.680
That's more like it, Bob.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.900
That's more

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.480
God damn

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.980
like it.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.600
And though I love self improvement as a tool

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800
it's something that can be utilized incorrectly

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.960
if you're taking it to incredible extremes.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.260
Like if you are trying to strive for unattainable perfection.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.560
You will be my magnum opus murder.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.760
*muffled*

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.340
Yes!

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.160
When you assume there's something inherently broken in yourself.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.980
I mean is it me?

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.880
You know I keep trying to do such beautiful works of art

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.220
and it just comes out looking like a total mess.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.720
*sobs*

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.640
*sobs*

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.380
Maybe I'm just not meant to be an artist.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.220
Or when you don't make a realistic distinction between what you can and can't control.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.160
You know just once I want a murder without so much blood. You know?

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.660
I always used to think that any form of self acceptance was being lazy or being complacent.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.420
And that if I wasn't growing, I was just remaining stagnant.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.920
But self acceptance is just having that distinction

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.700
between the things you can and can't control and really accepting what you can't.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.160
It's about loving the flaws that make you unique and being really okay with

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.440
where you are at in the process of growth.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.880
It's a very delicate balance, and I don't have it figured out all the time.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.740
But I'm really, really working on having more self acceptance in my life.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.800
I've been very extreme on the self improvement side, and I've kind of realized lately how unhealthy that can be.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.440
So trying to be really okay and at peace with where I am in the moment in growing.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.540
But what about you?

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.660
Let me know if you struggle with the balance of these two

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.860
or if you don't have either of them

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.060
or if you tend to lean one way or the other.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.660
I'm Anna Akana.
