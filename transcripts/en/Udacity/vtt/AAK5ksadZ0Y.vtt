00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.680
In the abstract version of the bank account application,

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.920
each time we wanted to know the bank balance,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.400
we had to add up all the previous deposits and withdrawals.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.970
And if you've done any kind of implementation out there,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.650
you know that that screams for having some kind of temporary variable that holds

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.880
the intermediate results so you don't have add those all up every time.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.820
So let's add that in as refinement to our to our spec.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.010
That is we're going to add another level of refinement,

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.180
in which we're going to implement this particular optimization.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.690
Okay, that will reduce the number of computation that we had to do,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.130
at the expense of adding this temporary variable in.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.210
For the class model itself, there's just one additional line.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.310
And this is in the attribute box, and

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.270
it adds in a variable called runningTotal, which is an integer.
