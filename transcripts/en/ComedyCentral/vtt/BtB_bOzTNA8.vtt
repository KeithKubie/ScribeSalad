00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.402
All right, my deal,

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.404
follow the queen,
follow her all around.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.674
All right, who's ready
for some wings?

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.109
Oh!
Come on, man.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.443
Thanks, baby.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.678
There's a queen right there.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:12.912
You're the best, Mrs. H.

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.014
You guys are the best.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.048
You rule, babe.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:16.282
All right.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.784
Dude, she is so great.

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:18.952
I am so lucky.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:20.820
Speaking of lucky,

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:22.489
you know that girl I told
you about from my office?

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:24.190
Well, we went out for drinks

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:26.126
and then she took me back
to her place.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:27.727
How was it?

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.929
Let's just say,
she's flexible.

00:00:30.096 --> 00:00:31.297
Nice.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.099
About butt stuff.

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:34.334
(all)
Oh!

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.236
Nice dude.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.271
That takes me back,
takes me back.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.839
A few weeks ago,

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.775
the kids were at
their Gran-gran's

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.844
and my wife was so down
to (bleep),

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.980
I mean, she's like,
practically begging me,

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:48.615
so I grab my wife's hair,

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.617
I bend her over
this credenza, right?

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.552
I'm like, so deep in (bleep),
I'm like, "Who's your husband?

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.120
Who's your husband?"

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:55.055
What's the matter
with you, man?

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.389
What?

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:57.624
That's your wife, man, okay?

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.225
That's not cool, okay?

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:00.326
We all went to college
with her,

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:01.828
we're friends.

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:03.730
That's, like, sick.
Sick.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:04.998
Oh, I thought we were all kind
of sharing some stories.

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.566
You're a degenerate, man.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.334
All right, all right,
anyway.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.903
I had a little incident
with that waitress

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.071
over at Padigan's
the other night.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.038
Oh, oh, hot Tracy?

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:13.373
Boom.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.008
How did you do that?

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:16.876
She comes up to me
and she's like,

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.645
"Can you help me carry
this box into the office?"

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:20.346
Yeah, right?

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.681
What happened next?

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:22.982
I'll help you move your box.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.018
Exactly, right?

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:27.187
So I go into the office
with her, next thing I know,

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.556
she's pulling on
my parking brake

00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:31.791
like we're at the top
of Lombard Street.

00:01:31.958 --> 00:01:32.959
Wow, wow, wow.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:34.060
What about the tits?

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:36.196
As advertised.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.964
Yes, yes!

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.666
It's always the best
when you don't expect it.

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:41.434
I remember there was
this girl in college,

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.002
and I totally thought
she was gonna put me

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:44.671
in the friend zone, right?

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:46.673
Well, we're hanging out,
all of a sudden,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.775
top comes off,
she's riding me,

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.844
I'm rock (bleep) like a hammer.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.713
And I'm like,
"I wanna marry this woman!"

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.649
I can't believe it's been
14 years.

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.384
That is so gross, Rob,
why are you doing this?

00:01:58.551 --> 00:01:59.686
Nobody tells wife stories.

00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:01.588
What are you, a psychopath?

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.123
Come on, man, she cooks us
Christmas dinner every year.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.858
She's Mrs. Christmas to us.

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.226
Hope you guys don't mind.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.061
I used four different cheeses.

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:09.596
You shouldn't have.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:11.231
God bless you, honey.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:12.532
All right,
you guys good on beers?

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:13.800
Yeah, we're great on beers.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.435
You rock, Amy!

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:16.769
These nachos are insane,
by the way.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.171
You know what else is insane?

00:02:18.338 --> 00:02:19.639
We don't wanna hear it!

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:20.740
Jesus!

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.075
Shut your face.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.710
This is a story about a woman

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.846
who I am totally
not married to, okay?

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:28.314
Go on.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.349
All right.

00:02:29.516 --> 00:02:30.917
Thank you.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.852
We had just come out
of H&amp;R Block,

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.854
and she's all turned on
'cause we're gonna get,

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:36.122
like, a sick return.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:37.790
And she can buy this purse

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:39.459
she's been talking about
forever, right?

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:40.693
And she wants to bang
right in the back

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.428
of our pre-owned Subaru.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.030
What are you doing, Rob?

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:45.331
What are you doing?

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:47.100
We know it's your wife, Rob.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:48.601
Its just--
I feel like vomiting right now.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.336
H&amp;R Block?

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:51.971
You guys, I have to be able
to share stories

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:53.773
about the woman I love, okay?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.175
I can't help it
that she's my wife, okay?

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.276
She inspires me.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.111
She is my world.

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.979
I just thought 'cause
you're my friends, I could--

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:02.382
I could share some of our
romantic things with you.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.250
All right, all right, man,
all right, all right.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:05.985
Who's ready for the finale?

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:08.054
Chocolate chip cookies!

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.522
That could not
have come sooner.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.257
You're the best, Mrs. H.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:12.659
All right, if nobody needs
anything else,

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.227
honey, I'm gonna head upstairs.

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.628
Start lubing up
so you can blast

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:17.463
my dirt (bleep) with your thumb

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.299
while you lobster-hand me
in the (bleep), okay?

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.501
Seriously, I want you
to (bleep) that mud pit

00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.603
'til I make a pig noise.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.471
And then you can (bleep) on
my (bleep) while I call my mom.

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:27.173
Muah.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.142
Okay. You guys are always
welcome here.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:33.913
I guess I should eat up.
