00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.340
Good evening, friends.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.390
I'm Homi Bhabha.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.970
I direct the Mahindra Humanities
Center here at Harvard.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.290
And it's a great pleasure to
invite you and welcome you

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.810
to one of our Writers Speak
sessions for this semester.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.720
Writers Speak is a platform of
the Humanities Center very ably

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:40.330
headed by my dear, beloved
friend Claire Messud.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:48.340
Who is professor of the practice
of writing and is a wonderful--

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.770
and I say this without
any prejudice whatsoever--

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:58.660
wonderful, reflective,
beautiful novelist.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.760
And it's been one of the
great pleasures of my tenure

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.740
as director of the Center
to work with Claire

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.070
on a number of occasions.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.900
It is actually a
tribute to Claire,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.180
that since she started working
with us to set up the Writers

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.940
Speak series, she
has chosen writers

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.570
to come to the campus who
effortlessly represent

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:43.970
a large variety of communities,
ethnicities, and cultures.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.120
There has been no forced
identitarian agenda here.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.840
She has just chosen writers who
she thought were significant.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.880
We've discussed them.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.810
And she's brought them.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.886
And that has really enriched
the archive of our thinking

00:02:02.886 --> 00:02:04.010
about contemporary writing.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.480
So often the discussion is
about bringing writers of color

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.420
or bringing writers
who lack all color.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.670
But Claire has a
fabulous instinct

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.950
of bringing great writers,
fascinating writers.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.990
And as it happens,
they have come

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.940
from almost every continent
and many countries.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.250
And they're writers
of all colors.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.920
In fact, the slightly tinged
lilac ones were my favorite.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.900
So Claire, thank you very much
for this great Catholic vision

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.270
of what writing today is about
and where the voices come from.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.230
And in fact, tomorrow,
Richard Price, Edison Julio,

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.410
and Michelle Kwo accompanied
by Claire Messud,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:03.410
will be in Emerson 2 1 0 at 6:00
PM speaking to a panel titled,

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.690
"The Words to Say It, Teaching
and Writing and Incarceration."

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.380
Please welcome my friend
and colleague Claire Messud.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.140
Thank you, Homi.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.580
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.260
It's my great pleasure to
introduce Richard this evening

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.860
and to be in conversation.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.180
And, yes, as Homi
mentioned, there

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.960
are a number of events
around Richard's visit

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.440
and also the visit
of Lorraine Adams.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.530
And tomorrow, the
six o'clock panel

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.200
will be upstairs involving
also Edison Julio and Michelle

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.080
Kwo in a discussion
about teaching writing

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.720
and incarceration.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.830
I hope you can make it.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.600
Now I need my glasses.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.280
I was saying to
somebody, I don't

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.610
know how many of you are
familiar with Fawlty Towers,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.760
but this week I am a little bit
like somebody in Fawlty Towers.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.170
I put on one hat and then
I move into another room

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.216
I put on another hat.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.310
Next thing, I'll be wearing a
kimono one offering massages,

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.810
whatever.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.320
As Michiko Kakutani wrote
in her New York Times

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.410
review of Richard Price's
most recent novel, The Whites,

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.720
"Mr. Price has a knack
for using detective

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.240
work the way John Le
Carre has used spy stories

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.400
and tradecraft as a
framework on which

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.460
to build complex
human investigations

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.220
into the human soul."

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.390
Richard Price is the
author of nine novels,

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.020
including The Wanderers,
Clockers, Freedomland,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.030
Lush Life, and The Whites.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.040
He's also an
acclaimed scriptwriter

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.440
for both film and television,
whose credits include

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.000
The Color of Money,
1986, Ransom, 1996,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.260
the series The Wire, 2002, and
last year's Emmy nominated HBO

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.090
series, The Night Of.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.060
His new show, currently on
air on HBO, is The Deuce.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.480
He's also a frequent contributor
to the Moth Radio Hour,

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.470
where you can hear him telling
great stories in his own voice.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.300
Richard Price,
likened by Walter Kern

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.610
to Raymond Chandler
and Saul Bellow,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.310
is revered for his
extraordinary ear for dialogue.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.800
Or as James Wood put it
in his review of Lush

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.950
Life, "for his wonderful
mind for dialogue,

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.920
and for his unsurpassed ability
to portray his native New York

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.960
in its infinite diversity."

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.660
His influence over what we now
think of as stellar dialogue

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.710
is so strong and so pervasive
that young readers and viewers

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.660
might be forgiven for
failing to appreciate

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.640
Price's profound originality.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.500
He changed our understanding.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.320
And now we think of his
dialogue as the standard

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.902
that we all try to meet.

00:05:41.902 --> 00:05:44.360
As Michael Connelly wrote in
his New York Times Book Review

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.510
of The Whites, it is,
quote, "a work of reportage

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.550
as much as it is
a work of fiction.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.420
That's what makes it important.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.090
It tells it like it is.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.190
It provides insight
and knowledge,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.010
both rare qualities in the
killing fields of the crime

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.540
novel."

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.790
Frequently using the police
or crime novel as a frame,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.850
Price has explored large social
issues from the crack epidemic

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.430
to the changed economy of New
York City in the first decade

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.250
of this century, from the
intricacies of family histories

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.160
and dynamics in The Whites
to the psychological toll

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.770
of incarceration
in The Night Of.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.440
His work is suffused with
a near Shakespearean verbal

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.250
inventiveness.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.140
Or is it attentiveness?

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.530
A sense of life's absurdity and
humor, a surprising tenderness

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.120
for the foibles
and vulnerabilities

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.490
of his characters, and
an amazing accuracy

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.950
when it comes to human
behavior, from the smallest

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.350
gestures on up.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.060
Writing good fiction is
like being a safecracker.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.110
A writer is listening
for the tiniest clicks.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.720
No writer listens better
than Richard Price.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.510
And no writer better transforms
that deceptively humble

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.260
activity in superlative
compelling storytelling.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.200
He takes narratives with which
we're familiar and returns them

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.000
to us each time as something
illuminating and surprising,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.050
enacting Ezra Pound's
exhortation to make it new.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.310
It is a privilege
and a great pleasure

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.800
to welcome Richard Price.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.558
Thank you.

00:07:03.558 --> 00:07:07.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.740
Thank you for that introduction.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.840
That was a privilege.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.420
Thank you.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.920
So Richard will
read, but we thought

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.610
we may chat a little first.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.110
Yeah.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.740
A tad.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:21.180
A tad, a tad bit.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.590
One thing I wondered about,
because we talked about it

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.300
in my class, in
one of my classes,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:42.390
if you took the dead
bodies out of your fiction

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.330
you would win every prize.

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.574
And so, I don't know if
that's ever occurred to you.

00:07:50.574 --> 00:07:52.490
But that was something
we were thinking about.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:55.170
We were thinking
that actually what

00:07:55.170 --> 00:08:03.250
you do in writing
American society is

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.520
of have such a high level.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.370
And you do get a lot of acclaim.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.770
But I feel as though, I don't
know if you get the big prizes.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:14.741
Do you know what I'm saying?

00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:15.240
Yeah.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.790
Oh, yeah.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.800
And I wondered if
that was a choice?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.590
Whether you thought, this is
what I want to write about

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.270
and this is the way I do it.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:33.059
I was wondering, how the
elements of genre, if you will,

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.480
are important to
you as a writer?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.840
They're convenient and
they're a pain in the ass.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.780
Because the minute you
use the word "genre,"

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.240
a genre has rules.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.810
And in the crime,
mystery genre, you

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:52.470
have a hero, or an
anti-hero more likely.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.730
You have a bad guy, or a
group of bad guys, good, bad.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.300
You show off that
nobody's really all good

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.870
or really all bad a little bit.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:02.640
But there are rules.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.750
You can't walk out of there
without justice served.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:12.210
And you're like
moody Marlboro man,

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:17.520
half Nordic, half
Chandleresque guy

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.600
with the busted Venetian blinds
and the bottle of old overcoat

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.010
whiskey in his bottom drawer.

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:26.490
I'll be honest.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.460
My first book that I would
say I reported was Clockers.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.690
And I was working on
that from 1988 to 19--

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:40.860
it came out in '92.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:46.590
I had written four
books, which are based

00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:49.870
on my own human experience.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.400
But I was 32.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.090
I didn't have all
that much to say.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.230
And I just felt like I
wrote myself into a corner.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.830
And through a number
of circumstances,

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:06.090
I found myself more in the
world than I had ever been.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.540
I was haunted by
my own bad cocaine

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.600
habit of the early '80s.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:18.360
I wound up teaching at a day
top village, which is sort

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.890
of a residential drug center.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:27.590
Pro bono teaching
fiction writing to kids.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:33.120
And I found myself, after having
written a movie, Sea of Love,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.640
it came out in '86
with Al Pacino,

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.430
I found myself in
the company of cops.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.270
And being with cops--

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:45.490
there's no judgment, good,
bad, or indifferent--

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.230
the stuff you're allowed
to see of the world

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:57.150
when you're with cops really
pulled me out of my inner,

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.670
I wonder as I wander books.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:04.060
And I became addicted to
going out into the field,

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:09.790
so to speak, and finding a
story larger than myself.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.630
I loved it.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.440
I just loved it so
much that I really

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.130
wanted to write stories
not about me but--

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:21.690
everything, every novel
is an autobiography.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.280
I think crossword
puzzles, you'll

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:25.560
find autobiography in
there from the person

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.350
who made up the clues.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.270
I figured, there's
enough of me just

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:32.940
having a narrative voice here.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.540
And I also found, as
my landscapes in books

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:42.500
became more and more
panoramic, like in Lush Life

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.940
it was about Lower
East Siders live

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.980
not in the days of
[INAUDIBLE] sleep

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:53.490
but in the days of
post-crack yuppification.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.430
And all the worlds
involved in it--

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.730
there were seven
separate planets.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.850
And I didn't want to
write a travelogue.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.110
And then I realized, if you
follow criminal investigation,

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:09.360
it provides you with
a spine that you

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.870
can ride to a very complex
landscape, like a white horse.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.010
Because criminal
investigations are orderly.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.030
This happens, they're
chronological.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.980
They makes sense.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.661
If you talk to
this person, well,

00:12:21.661 --> 00:12:23.160
if you talk to this
person, then you

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.990
need to talk to that person.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:28.140
And that person might be a
Fujinese Chinese person walking

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.050
by, that person might
be an entrepreneur

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:36.990
circa the early 2000s
opening up a hip restaurant.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.760
The third person
might be a woman

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.460
who lives in a housing
project around the corner.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:47.490
Fourth person might be an
old Talmudic scholar davening

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:51.450
on the Lower East Side.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:57.090
And I just got addicted
to taking on landscapes

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:00.720
and using the cleanness of
a criminal investigation.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.860
And like I said, I didn't
like or dislike cops.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.960
Cops are like people.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.130
They even are people.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:15.540
They're like people.

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.800
I'm joking.

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.310
I'm not a police buff.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.450
I don't automatically take
the police point of view

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:28.380
in dramatic situations.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.710
You can't count on me
to back up your opinion

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.110
just because I write about.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.140
And what happens is, I
just love that stuff.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.400
And I just love using
that wherever I go.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.420
So there's bodies in
it, and there's crime.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:50.970
But I don't want to
protest too much,

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.330
but how many great novels had
crimes in them as their basis?

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.930
Not to compare
myself with anybody.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.020
Let's start with Dreiser.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.350
Sorry, I said I
wouldn't do that.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:09.000
Then all of a sudden, you've got
a reputation as a crime writer.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.770
And I went, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.820
That's not it.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.780
I don't feel like I am.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.620
But I feel like I have to
step away from that just

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:22.170
to write myself as not a
genre writer, which I never

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:22.860
felt I was.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.800
When you say, step away,
in what way step away?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.662
Step away from crime
and punishment.

00:14:28.662 --> 00:14:30.120
You mean in your
work, or just in--

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.260
In my work, in my writing.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.480
But that means stepping
away from something I love.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:40.560
I really have a blast
writing crime and punishment.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.650
And you've got to like
what you're writing.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.950
It's like it's like a marriage.

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:48.510
And you shouldn't
marry this individual

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.540
because it'll be good for you,
like oatmeal is good for you.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.020
So it's a big compromise
between my fun

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.740
and but I don't want
to get seduced into it.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.070
I want to show people
that I can write.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.310
So the minute you start thinking
about readers as opposed

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.060
to yourself, you get
lost in the woods.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:12.180
And you can't figure out,
what do I really want to do.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.050
Time is tight.

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.120
I'm 67.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.170
It's not like I have 50
years of writing ahead of me.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.440
So it's complicated.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.680
I'm wrestling with
this every day.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.050
If you've never felt--

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:27.280
I wanted to put to you
because many years ago,

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:32.550
the writer [INAUDIBLE] said
to me-- it wasn't just me,

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.340
it was in a room full of
people, but whatever--

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.230
he said, you can make
up the characters

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.870
or you can make up the plot,
but you can't make up both.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.576
And I think a lot about that.

00:15:42.576 --> 00:15:43.950
And I think, do
I agree with him?

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.324
I don't know if
I agree with him.

00:15:45.324 --> 00:15:51.360
But it's certainly true
that any work of fiction

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:54.030
is a balance between
freedom and constraint.

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.794
And when you say
that having a crime

00:15:57.794 --> 00:15:59.460
gives you a sort of
white horse that you

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:04.160
can ride through a landscape
it gives you a structure,

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.580
it gives you constraint.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:09.820
And if those constraints are
in fact liberating for you--

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.510
you've written novels, as I
said in the introduction, that

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.500
are actually about all these
very different bigger social

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:18.510
issues.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:23.500
There may happen to
be corpses in them

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.520
or investigations in them.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.980
But it hasn't stopped you
writing about anything.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.190
Why would you step away from it?

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:40.230
Because of what you just said.

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:45.142
If it wasn't for bodies
I might be regarded more.

00:16:45.142 --> 00:16:45.975
But you are regard--

00:16:45.975 --> 00:16:46.760
I feel you are.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.090
Well, that's a problem with me.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.511
It's like, stay with yourself.

00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:52.260
But they're saying
this and this about me.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.135
Well, I'll show them.

00:16:53.135 --> 00:16:54.510
And that's where
you get screwed,

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.575
where you screw yourself.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:06.839
I'm the type of person that
reviews are dangerous to me.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:08.550
Much less so than ever before.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.440
But I'm easily influenced.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.099
Like in third grade,
it'd be, well, he just

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:17.959
follows this crowd.

00:17:17.959 --> 00:17:19.584
I'd really like to
see little Richard--

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.470
it's a struggle every day.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:30.180
Part of the struggle is
you have to really enjoy

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.960
what you're doing to do it.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.070
And I write about
certain people.

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.560
And this is going to sound
bizarre, and very unliterary,

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.280
but I write about the
people I write about

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.660
because I can make
them funny, not

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.680
to sacrifice to the
complexity of their humanity.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:54.900
I know how to make working
class urban people.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.260
I know how to write
about urban underdog.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.940
I know how to write about cops.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:05.250
I know how to write about
put together families

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.915
on a certain level of society.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.730
I just love being
able to freedom,

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:14.970
to make the dialogue fly.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.160
Humor doesn't come
out of it ha, ha.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.344
Humor comes out of
sheer recognition.

00:18:19.344 --> 00:18:21.510
And it's a surprise when
you find yourself grinning,

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.650
like I knew that.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.104
I didn't know I knew
that until I read that.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.520
But once I read
that, I recognized

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.900
I knew that all along.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:32.430
So for me, it's
the beauty of hope,

00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:35.700
people being able to
recognize certain elements

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.500
of their personality
and their situation.

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.190
I don't know how to make
patent engineers funny.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.814
I don't know how to make
corporate lawyers funny.

00:18:43.814 --> 00:18:45.730
I don't know how to make
brain surgeons funny.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.030
Well, you should write about
a higher level of society

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.710
because then it would show you
have this big span, blah, blah.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:55.710
I just have to have fun.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.751
If I'm not having fun
nobody's going to have fun.

00:18:57.751 --> 00:18:59.440
If I don't enjoy
writing this nobody's

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.930
going to enjoy reading this.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:01.470
I hear you.

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:02.210
Life is short.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.710
I agree.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.650
You've said before that
place is a character for you.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.200
And that your start with place.

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:18.010
Or that place is one of
the fundamental elements.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:28.050
And I wonder, given the sort of
breadth and range of, in a way,

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:32.040
thematically of the subjects
that you've written about,

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.350
whether you choose
a place with it--

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.750
Did you choose,
say, for Lush Life,

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.880
did you choose the Lower
East Side because of the--

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.650
Every place is a choice.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:46.230
Because let's say you have
three key characters in a story.

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:49.260
One of those
characters is location.

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.690
I'd like to know
going into the book

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.540
at least I have one of
my characters down cold.

00:19:54.540 --> 00:20:00.450
So I will always write
about urban environments.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:05.430
Look, if I grew up by the
sea I'd be writing sea books.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.320
If I grew up in the
mountains it would all

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.220
take place in the mountains.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.560
If I grew up in the Great
Plains, et cetera, et cetera.

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.370
I grew up in the
city, and I love it.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.960
For all the anxiety
and hair pulling

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:24.780
that goes through making a
book from beginning to end,

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:26.880
you got to love
what you're doing.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.730
You got to love the people
you're writing about,

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.450
even if whatever
you making them,

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:39.370
blacker than black in
terms of devil souls,

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.280
you've got to love
them in some way.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.050
And I've got to love my world.

00:20:44.050 --> 00:20:45.420
And I got to love my people.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:50.689
When I was younger before--

00:20:50.689 --> 00:20:52.980
when I was writing my first
four books I was in my 20s.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.370
They're very deep books.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:58.870
Not.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.925
I started feeling, well,
I don't want to reputation

00:21:02.925 --> 00:21:06.380
as this d'ese, d'em,
d'ose dialogue writer.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.430
I'm going to show them.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:10.350
I'm going to write about
the Spanish Armada.

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:13.260
And I'm going to do it so, wow,
he can write about anything.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.670
Never happened.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.390
I was probably drunk
at the time, but--

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.070
It's all about love.

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:25.830
I'm sounding like
a broken record.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.260
But it's a long haul, a book.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.670
It's like getting married.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.000
You got to love the
hell out of the person

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.840
that you're joining with
for a number of years.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:42.990
There are lots of things
I want to ask you.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.940
But maybe, what about
starting with dialogue.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.510
And to what extent is
that just something

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:54.000
you can do in your sleep?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.550
To what extent is that something
that you work at relentlessly?

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:05.460
To what extent is it actually
just reported speech?

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:13.841
Listen, I always liked making
up people talking to each other.

00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:15.340
I remember when I
was six years old,

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.050
there was a girl I had
a crush on, first grade.

00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.930
And I would never talk to
her in a billion years.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:26.070
But I would I would lay in
bed before I went to sleep,

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:29.800
and she was being attacked
by a space monster.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:32.430
And she was going,
help, Richard, help.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:33.610
And I'd go, I'll save you.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.130
But then I would
have a big dialogue

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.710
with the space monster.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.470
Don't you touch
Freida Jankolowitz.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:41.200
I will touch anybody I want.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.070
No.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.300
We'd start arguing.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.370
And Freida would go, Hello.

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:46.980
I'm drifting out in space.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.360
I just get so caught up.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.310
And I would say this and
the monster would say that.

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:54.150
So it's just this intuitive
thing that I just liked.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:03.340
And I was intimidated by
Warner's English Grammar

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.410
Handbook.

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:07.840
It was the bane
of my adolescence.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:11.020
And I just had an ear.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.990
Like some people have--

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:19.060
always compared
to being a runner.

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:20.920
You can't teach anybody.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.350
People run fast or they don't.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.610
You can fine tune, you can
shave a second or two at best

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:29.800
off their times.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.410
But you can't teach
someone to run fast.

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.174
And with dialogue, you
just have to have an ear.

00:23:36.174 --> 00:23:38.090
That's the one thing,
the one gift I was given

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:40.470
is I have an ear.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.146
I remember, it was actual
creative writing class

00:23:44.146 --> 00:23:44.770
in high school.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.560
Nobody had a creative
writing class at that point.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.720
And I had to write a story.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.760
And I tried to make people real.

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:58.120
And I used the word "damn,"
Like god damn, or damn.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.170
And the paper came back
to me and was hemorrhaging

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.980
red from the English teacher.

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.860
This is not necessary to
use language like this.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.680
I always loved the profane.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.810
I always loved the music.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:17.620
That somehow I could put
music into dialogue in a way

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.480
that, I don't know
what to compare it to.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.730
It was like jazz for me.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:25.230
Yeah.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:33.100
My whole rhythm came out of--

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.260
Lorraine Adams, who
spoke earlier today,

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:37.970
has heard this a billion times
because we lived together.

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:41.720
She's my wife and
I'm her husband.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.430
And so she hears me,
oh, god that one again.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.935
The way I found my voice--

00:24:46.935 --> 00:24:49.060
and finding your voice is
the most important thing,

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.010
I think, for novels.

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:54.720
Because your narrative voice
is a close cousin to dialogue.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.920
How intimate is the narrator
going to get to the characters?

00:24:57.920 --> 00:24:59.380
How vernacular is
it going to be?

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.010
Lorraine called it a
close third person.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:05.530
And that's pretty
much what it is.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.810
And I tried to find my voice.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:12.760
And when I was in high school
in the Bronx I always liked

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.960
social realism because
I don't know anybody

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.970
in Jane Austen's world,
I don't know anybody

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:20.540
in John Steinbeck's world.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.805
So it's not just like English.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.770
I don't know anybody
in Dickens world.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:31.600
But when I started reading
James Baldwin, Richard

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:38.590
Wright, a couple
of other people,

00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:41.590
James T. Farrell, Studs Lonigan,
people that were writing

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:49.780
about things I walk on and I see
and I breathe, I found myself.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.240
And it taught me
that my experience is

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.254
valid grounds for literature.

00:25:54.254 --> 00:25:55.420
That was a big breakthrough.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.020
However--

00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.270
And that was in high school?

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.200
Yeah.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:04.210
However, the problem was with
social realist novelists,

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.420
for the most part,
some of the names

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.330
I have given you
excluded from this,

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:13.990
is that's writing
to make a point.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:17.740
And it's like sawing wood.

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:22.300
One fact, another fact,
somebody makes a statement

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:28.814
that's proving the point or
the social humanitarian point

00:26:28.814 --> 00:26:30.230
that the author
is trying to make.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:31.420
There's no magic in it.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.850
It was just like taking
dull photographs.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:36.364
But I clung to that
because I recognized, oh, I

00:26:36.364 --> 00:26:37.030
know that world.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.710
So, yeah.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:45.280
Then I read a book that probably
very few people in this room

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.225
have read.

00:26:46.225 --> 00:26:48.489
It's called Last
Exit to Brooklyn.

00:26:48.489 --> 00:26:50.530
And it was by a writer
who's a Beat writer, named

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:52.210
Hubert Selby.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:55.180
Hubert Selby also wrote about--

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.970
no, wait, god, am I that boring?

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:03.580
Selby also wrote
about the streets.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.840
He wrote about Brooklyn, Red
Hook part of Brooklyn, I think,

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.180
or Bay Ridge, somewhere.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.620
But he was a child of the Beat.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.500
He was a Beat.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:18.610
He was he was a bebop
artist with words.

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.520
So he wrote about the same thing
but he had this like rhythm,

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.280
this like de-de-te-da,
de-de-te-da.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.710
And he just lifted
all the concrete out

00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:30.970
of the cement of
a social realist.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.260
It was like he was
playing an instrument.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:39.700
And I found a way not to write
like I was using a hammer

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.510
and tongs.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:43.600
I was using a saxophone.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:48.370
And so when I found my voice
like that, it was so intimate

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:51.100
and there was no line
between dialogue and prose.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.800
And it just lifted
me off the ground

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.990
and really allowed me
to get into my dialogue

00:27:55.990 --> 00:28:02.410
and not worry too much, in
a way to tell a full story.

00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:03.099
So--

00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:04.890
I don't even think I
answered the question.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.380
Well, you did.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:08.640
Now I'm curious.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.290
Where along the
line did you say,

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.470
this is what I'm going to do?

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:20.340
Somewhere between the
space monster dialogue

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.360
in your bed at night and--

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:25.670
When I was eight.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.540
Early.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.490
Fantasy wise, when I was eight.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.950
Realistic wise, not
until I graduated college

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.830
and had a choice.

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:36.960
My grandfather was a
factory worker in Brooklyn.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.770
Sorry, you got to
hear all this stuff.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.770
My grandfather was a
factory worker in Brooklyn.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.600
He was a Russian immigrant.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.042
And like every Jew in Russia,
he was studying to be a rabbi.

00:28:47.042 --> 00:28:48.750
I don't think just
one person from Russia

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.190
who came over that
was Jewish who

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.440
wasn't studying to be a rabbi.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.350
Anyway, he was foreman in
a chrome plating factory.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.670
But he was very literate.

00:28:56.670 --> 00:28:59.730
He read the Russians in Russian.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:03.510
And he came over
and he was he was

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:07.280
an actor and a stagehand with
the Lower East Side Yiddish

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.210
Theater.

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.180
And he would write poems.

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:14.370
And they would be published
in this mimeographed thing

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:19.380
for the Brooklyn
YMHA, which is this--

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:22.890
but there would be poems on
that would be mimeographed

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.450
like this, and it's stapled.

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:28.739
And it had huge circulation,
I think, 40, 50 copies.

00:29:28.739 --> 00:29:30.280
And I just remember,
when I was eight

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.840
seeing my grandfather's poem.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.780
Even at eight, after--

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.910
well, that was kind of
corny there, gramps.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:41.640
But nonetheless, it had
his name at the bottom.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.690
And my father revered
my grandfather.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:47.440
It was his father.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.440
Yeah, his father.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.470
And I looked at my father
looking at my grandfather.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.810
I said, I want some
of that look too.

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.560
So I decided it was going
to be writer right then.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.432
But it was always a fantasy.

00:30:00.432 --> 00:30:01.890
When you get older
you want to have

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:03.530
a specialty, like
the best dancer,

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:06.830
or the best hair,
the math brain.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:10.950
And I just wanted to be
known as the writer, which

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:13.860
involved pinching my nose
in a library at a table

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.930
where there was a
couple of girls.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.950
And I went like this hoping
some of them would come up to me

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:21.450
and say, are you suffering?

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:22.580
Never happened.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.390
But my nose really
did get narrower.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.130
I went to Cornell.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:29.640
I got a degree in
labor relations.

00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.110
But I took all my electives
in creative writing.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:36.180
And I really, really
wanted to be a writer.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:39.300
And my father said, look, you
can write in your spare time.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.670
It could be like your hobby.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:45.100
But once you have a serious job
you can write on the weekends.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.850
And then came time,
what are you going

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:48.394
to do for graduate school?

00:30:48.394 --> 00:30:50.310
And so I applied to
every-- including Harvard.

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:53.290
I got for MAT in teaching.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:57.100
That lasted about six minutes.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:02.310
And the one Master of Fine Arts
school I got into was Columbia.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.330
And I felt like I
had no right to go.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.846
I was working class.

00:31:05.846 --> 00:31:07.220
I felt like I had
no right to go.

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:10.710
My father had a
little hosiery store.

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:16.410
And he got so exasperated by me
Hamleting all across the floor,

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:17.550
I don't know what to do.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.910
And my father finally
said, oh, Jesus Christ,

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.941
go to your stupid
creative writing program.

00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:24.690
If it doesn't work
out, two years from now

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.340
you'll go to law
school, big deal.

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.720
I just remember saying
literally, gee, dad, you

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.090
mean it?

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.810
Boom.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.740
And once I went
to graduate school

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:43.050
it was great because
I was surrounded

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:47.210
by 12 people around a seminar
table about once a week.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:51.330
And all 12 of those people,
none of them went to law school.

00:31:51.330 --> 00:31:52.320
We're all here.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.450
None of them were premed.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:57.350
none of them went
to business school.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.580
Meanwhile, everybody's
friends from college

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.780
were now on their
way with a real job.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.450
And the worst thing
in the world when

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.820
you're a young writer,
even if you're determined,

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.002
is somebody saying--

00:32:10.002 --> 00:32:11.960
say your a writer, and
somebody says, oh, well,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.880
what have you written?

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.890
Well, I'm working on this
Spanish Armada novel,

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.720
but I'm waiting
for my translator.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:24.500
I want to put it in
17th century Spanish

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.859
and I don't know Spanish.

00:32:26.859 --> 00:32:28.650
Instead of saying,
well, what do you write?

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:32.550
I could say, well, I'm in the
Master of Fine Arts program

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.485
at Columbia.

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:39.060
It puts your ego on hold and
it gave you at least two years

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.135
where you weren't mortified
by wanting to be a writer.

00:32:42.135 --> 00:32:43.010
And I got very lucky.

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.830
I published a book
when I was 24.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:49.810
So were you still in
the program when you--

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.855
This is the other thing
that's really embarrassing.

00:32:52.855 --> 00:32:53.730
I was in the program.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.300
I left for a year to go to
Stanford because they had

00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.180
a little fellowship
which Columbia didn't.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.440
Which they still have?

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.100
Yeah.

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.700
I got a $1,500 fellowship,
which at that time,

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.680
you're in the money.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.305
That's cabbage.

00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:14.700
And I came back from Columbia.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.490
I was taking a class or
two, finishing a seminar,

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.920
and I published my first
novel, The Wanderers.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.540
Then everybody hated you.

00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.710
Well--

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.120
No?

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.860
Probably.

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:30.840
But I refused to
quit the program.

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.680
And I published another novel,
and I was still in the program.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.251
And it's driving
everybody batshit.

00:33:36.251 --> 00:33:38.250
And people said, what,
are you making fun of us?

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:39.390
The teachers hated me.

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.750
Richard Yates was my teacher.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:46.290
And in when he did the roll
call he said, who's Price?

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.660
Oh, you're a billion
dollar bonus baby.

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.010
What I finally
realized, the reason

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.740
why I stayed in that
program because I

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:59.110
wanted a master's
degree in fine arts.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.490
I was the first person ever
go to college in my family.

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.120
And I wasn't even
thinking about it.

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.410
I wanted that MFA
because I was going

00:34:07.410 --> 00:34:13.310
to have checks printed on top it
would say, Richard Price, MFA.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:18.780
I was just a working class
thing that I didn't even

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.760
recognize until years
after I finally graduated.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.639
Did you have the checks printed?

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.140
No.

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:26.889
It's not too late.

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:28.920
[INAUDIBLE] a friend who
put PhD on his checks.

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:32.520
It's not too late.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.757
You still could.

00:34:34.757 --> 00:34:35.340
Yeah, I guess.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.190
By the time you
were at university

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:46.560
you knew you wanted
to go straight--

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.639
the story is you wanted to go
straight on and be a writer.

00:34:49.639 --> 00:34:54.929
And when you wrote
The Wanderers,

00:34:54.929 --> 00:34:57.900
because the official
story is that you wrote

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:01.050
one chapter, as it were,
that was then published in,

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:01.970
Halpern published in--

00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:02.470
In Antaeus.

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:03.630
In Antaeus.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:04.500
The class hated it.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:08.790
And Dan Halpern, who became
the head of the writing

00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:10.670
program for a while--

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:13.110
and he was a very well
known and well regarded

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.720
editor, has his own
imprimatur at HarperCollins.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.880
Echo.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.120
Echo.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.740
He came up to me--
the class hated it

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:25.800
because the first
chapter of The Wanderers

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.910
was about an all-out gang
war between an Italian gang

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:31.400
and a black gang.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:35.050
And I had the Italians win.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:38.660
It was the most politically
incorrect thing to do.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.510
And teacher was
a psychopath, who

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:45.400
hated the fact that he had
to teach these people half

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:45.900
his age.

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.880
Was this Richard Yates
or somebody else?

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.290
Yeah, Richard-- no, no, no.

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.900
It was W.B. Yeats.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.010
No.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:53.870
I don't want to say his name.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:59.850
But he was the nastiest person,
and charismatic, very funny.

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:05.760
So you really didn't realize
you have internal injuries

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.570
until you went home.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:12.270
But he led this
wolf pack on this,

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.685
and everybody trashed
it in the class.

00:36:14.685 --> 00:36:17.550
And it was the first thing I
ever read in a writing program.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.300
I can't hardly remember how
I felt. I was like startled

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.930
and I believed everything.

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:29.250
I also felt like, oh, well.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:33.870
And at the end of the
class, Dan Halpern,

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.562
who's taken a fiction
class just because he

00:36:36.562 --> 00:36:38.520
knew he was going to be
an administrator and he

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.603
wanted to see how the whole
writing program worked

00:36:40.603 --> 00:36:41.630
and all the seminars.

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:46.620
He'd come up to me and he
said, I want to publish.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.140
I have a magazine and I
want to publish that story.

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.047
I said, how much?

00:36:50.047 --> 00:36:50.880
I didn't even blink.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.590
I said, how much?

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:55.340
And he looked at me
and he said, well,

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.702
it's a literary quarterly.

00:36:56.702 --> 00:36:57.910
We don't have a lot of money.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:00.640
We don't pay anybody.

00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.800
I went, oh.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.650
I thought when I said how
much, I thought how much do I

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.300
have to pay for him to publish?

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:11.040
He said, well, you will
get seven free copies.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:13.377
OK.

00:37:13.377 --> 00:37:14.460
And I couldn't believe it.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:16.140
That was my first class.

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:21.030
But it reminded me, Paul
Schrader, filmmaker,

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.710
once had a movie that opened
at the Locarno Film Festival.

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.150
The Locarno Film Festival has
the largest outdoor screen

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:29.225
in the world.

00:37:29.225 --> 00:37:30.975
And the film was The
Comfort of Strangers.

00:37:30.975 --> 00:37:34.670
It was based on an
Ian McEwan book.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.160
And I said, wow, how did it go?

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:43.060
He said, well, they started
booing in the opening credits

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.600
and they never stopped until
the screen went dark an hour

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.010
and a half later.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.740
I said, oh, my god,
how did you feel?

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:52.530
He said, I felt they were wrong.

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:53.820
I wasn't that bulletproof.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:57.180
But there is a little
part of me that went--

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.230
In the workshop?

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.689
Not a very little
part of me that went--

00:38:00.689 --> 00:38:02.230
But it's important
to have that part.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.270
Anybody wants to be anything
in the arts as a career,

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:11.580
you need insane confidence.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:20.520
Because it's a
loser's option of,

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.320
some day I'm going
to be driving a cab

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.410
but I'm really a novelist.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:30.090
But at least I'm making
a good $150 a week

00:38:30.090 --> 00:38:32.700
while I write this
novel for 10 years.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.370
You really got to
believe in yourself

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:40.800
to put up with all the
crap that you have to do.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:45.030
The most precious thing
a writer can buy is time.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:49.290
But I don't know, if didn't
get published so young,

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:51.750
if it took 10 more years
to publish my first book,

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.780
I don't know if I would
have had the stamina.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.460
I think I was very
lucky to publish

00:38:56.460 --> 00:39:00.690
early simply because
with my upbringing,

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:02.190
I don't know if I could take it.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.410
Visiting my Cornell
roommates, one guy

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:11.970
is now vice president
at some pudding company,

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.680
or another guy is--

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.130
What's a pudding company?

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:19.800
The Jell-O pudding, and
Cosby was his client.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.660
Young Cosby.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.980
Pudding Pops.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:27.320
But people were
doing real things.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.815
And I don't know
if I could have--

00:39:28.815 --> 00:39:31.140
I would have avoided
every one of them.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:32.580
I would've been so--

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.620
oh, Price, you still
writing that book?

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:36.530
How's it going?

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:37.800
Well, I'm flying in my taxi.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:44.060
that Harry Chapin song.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:50.070
I wanted to be some
kind of like a pilot.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.260
I was driving a
taxi but he still

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:54.570
get so high when he's stoned.

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:55.379
It's like that.

00:39:55.379 --> 00:39:56.670
I didn't want to be like this--

00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:58.150
You didn't want to be that guy.

00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.650
Yeah.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.512
I just--

00:39:59.512 --> 00:40:00.660
No.

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:06.770
So then how did writing for
film, how did that come about?

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:10.440
And how is that
different for you?

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.650
Well, it's very different.

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:14.940
I've done a lot of film.

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.510
And now I'm doing a lot of TV.

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:23.220
And the difference is, when you
write a novel, it's all yours.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.790
Every decision, every
word, every comma is yours.

00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:30.280
When you're working
on a TV show,

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.250
it's a collaborative medium.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:36.880
And you're just one
of a number of people.

00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:39.690
So you write the script.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:43.146
And they're going to change the
script for expediency's sake,

00:40:43.146 --> 00:40:45.270
or the budget's too big,
or we lost the main actor.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.770
We have another
actor but he doesn't

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:50.370
want to play this type
of guy, change the guy.

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:55.740
So you write the script,
but as I said ad nauseam,

00:40:55.740 --> 00:41:00.424
it's not a building,
it's a blueprint.

00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:02.340
The building is not going
to be the blueprint.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.881
The building is
going to be building,

00:41:03.881 --> 00:41:06.120
depending on what kind of
materials they can get,

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.330
how the economy goes, well, we
can't afford all these windows.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:17.110
So when you write a movie,
no matter how good it is,

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.170
it's never the
movie that's made,

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.440
and because you don't
have any control over it.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.800
You're the first one in and
everybody lands on top of you

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.600
in the decision making process.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:36.920
And so you could be Shakespeare,
if they had movies back then.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.892
And you got this great story
about this boy and this girl,

00:41:41.892 --> 00:41:43.850
they go crazy for each
other, blah, blah, blah.

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:45.900
The families are fighting.

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.970
And that's great.

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:49.620
But you know what?

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:53.780
Steven Segal wants to
play the Capulet boss.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.180
We got a good shot at getting
Brando for the Montague.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.390
And these kids, I know
they're supposed to be 13,

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:04.260
but there's this 22-year-old
hot actress named Amber Heard.

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:09.240
And we really think she
would help the movie.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.960
And, well, Denzel
wants to play Romeo.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.830
So we've got to really
age up these characters.

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:17.920
It's going to happen.

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:20.130
It's not your choice.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:21.300
You're at the mercy.

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:27.030
So when a movie or a TV
show is a big success,

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:31.020
and somebody comes to you
and says, I loved your movie.

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:33.570
I feel like they're
congratulating

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.650
eight people between me and
them because it wasn't my movie,

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:39.660
it was my script.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.080
And for a sense of pride and
a sense of really wanting

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:47.990
to be an artist unfettered
by compromise, unfortunately,

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.485
[INAUDIBLE] it's novels.

00:42:50.485 --> 00:42:50.985
Right.

00:42:50.985 --> 00:42:51.818
You got the freedom.

00:42:51.818 --> 00:42:58.660
And bluntly, honestly
speaking, you can make money.

00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:00.180
There's no such
thing as free money.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.960
But you can make money
doing the other stuff.

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:08.380
And sometimes if you get good
at it, it can be like crack.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:13.470
You get so addicted to the
pace, especially with TV.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:17.590
You write something, bang,
two weeks later it's on.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:19.990
When you're writing
a novel you could

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:24.730
have cobwebs going from
your forehead to the paper.

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:27.830
It would be like that
Dickensian birthday cake.

00:43:27.830 --> 00:43:30.300
And nobody would know.

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:34.180
Hey, see Price around?

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.610
I think he died.

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:39.250
No, no, no, he's
working on a novel.

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:43.070
So you get addicted
just metabolically.

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:48.280
And frankly, writing a novel
is so freaking isolating.

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:54.610
That's one of the other reasons
why I love reporting the novel.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.110
That was my social
life, hanging out

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:59.850
with all these
psychopaths and people.

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:01.930
At least I was
talking to somebody

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:05.190
instead of sitting in my room
all day like I was in a garret.

00:44:07.729 --> 00:44:09.520
When you're making a
movie it's like you're

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:13.060
dealing with people,
you're dealing with people.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:18.880
It was like antivenom
for isolation.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.530
It has nothing to do with
the ultimate finished product

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:22.030
of the art.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:31.920
What's hard for me to come
to terms with is writing

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:33.640
is what I do.

00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.630
It's a calling, but
it's not my entire life.

00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:37.740
And the older I get--

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:45.245
I was pretty unhappily
in a domestic situation.

00:44:45.245 --> 00:44:48.870
I had two kids I loved.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:54.110
But I just felt very not where I
was supposed to be in my heart.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:57.240
Not with the kids,
but with the person

00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.940
I was married to in the world
that we found ourselves in.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:06.480
One of the superficial but--

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:10.590
so all of my self-esteem and
all my sense of satisfaction,

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:12.630
when I wasn't dealing
with my children,

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.270
was tied up in the
reception of my books.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:17.790
And my books became
life or death for me

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:20.220
in a very unhealthy way.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:23.050
So my life has changed.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.190
And I feel like, yeah, I love
to write, I'll always write.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:30.540
But my life is so much
more than writing.

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:34.560
It's not like if I don't
write today I'll die.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.160
If I open up a paper and
there's a review of something

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.810
I live and die by that review.

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:41.574
I don't feel it anymore.

00:45:41.574 --> 00:45:42.990
It's not like I
don't give a damn,

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:45.630
but I kind of don't give a damn.

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:46.980
That's great.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:50.630
But that goes back to
what you were saying,

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:53.457
the Paul Schrader moment.

00:45:53.457 --> 00:45:55.040
In a way, that's
where you want to be.

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:57.745
I just feel if people
like it I'm happy.

00:45:57.745 --> 00:46:02.400
If people don't like
it I'm not not happy.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.430
I'm sort of unhappy.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.560
I said, it's too bad evolution
hasn't allowed humans

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.080
to live 400 years because
it takes about 380 years

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.750
to figure this shit out.

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:21.870
I'm having one of these, oh,
now I'm going a high get it.

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.422
Everything is in
its proper place.

00:46:25.422 --> 00:46:26.880
[INAUDIBLE] believes
in we're going

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:32.490
to be cryogenically frozen, like
Walt Disney and Ted Williams.

00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:35.250
And we're going to come
back fresher and stronger

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:36.360
but with all our wisdom.

00:46:39.072 --> 00:46:40.410
I don't know.

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:44.970
I'm just going to play
it minute by minute.

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:48.390
I'm wondering, would you be
willing to read a little for us

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.890
now?

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.170
Maybe.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:50.670
OK.

00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:51.419
I'm going to read.

00:46:51.419 --> 00:46:53.490
What I discovered,
unfortunately and unhappily,

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:56.850
is I love to read,
I love to read more

00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:58.980
than people love to listen.

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:02.100
So I'm going to read
something pretty short.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.030
That's paradoxical,
or contradictory.

00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:10.054
That's contradictory.

00:47:10.054 --> 00:47:11.470
That's like a Marx
Brothers thing.

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:13.350
Why a pair of ducks?

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:14.640
Sorry.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.580
Innuendo.

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:20.010
Husband comes in
the door, I go out--

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.330
I got that all messed up.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:23.741
Your husband leaves,
I go innuendo.

00:47:23.741 --> 00:47:24.240
Sorry.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.552
Never mind.

00:47:25.552 --> 00:47:27.045
Oh, that was really tedious.

00:47:27.045 --> 00:47:29.610
So sorry.

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:32.390
Speak, oh tablet.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:33.420
OK.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.380
This is from the
end of The Whites.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:41.100
I also learned, never read
a passage that involves

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:44.190
two people, more than two
people because nobody knows who

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:45.880
the hell is talking about who.

00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.910
And it takes a
year to set it up.

00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:50.437
And people have completely
forgot to set up.

00:47:50.437 --> 00:47:52.270
As you're reading, you
see people doing this

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:54.507
with their phones.

00:47:54.507 --> 00:47:56.340
Oh, look, I've got a
new friend on Facebook.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:02.010
This is from the end of--

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.365
and it's basically
a funeral oration.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:11.520
One of the main
characters in The Whites

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.970
is a retired detective
named John Pavlicek.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:18.180
And Pavlicek was
a very powerful--

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:20.310
is a very powerful presence.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:25.050
He is kind of a natural leader
of any group of individuals

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.460
he's with.

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.410
And Pavlicek is now retired.

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:31.590
He's made a lot of money.

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:36.330
And he had a son who
was a total screw

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:37.890
up when he was a teenager.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:41.220
And then he finally started
straightening himself out.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.190
And then he found
out he was diagnosed

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:49.320
as having a leukemia at 21
that normally people get

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.450
when they're in their late 60s.

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:52.320
And he dies.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:58.537
And his name is John, Jr.

00:48:58.537 --> 00:49:00.870
And I'm going to leave out
as much description as I can.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.690
So it's a whole bunch
of cops at this funeral.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:13.700
And I'm going to
refer to the dead son.

00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.310
"Junior had apparently
had been utterly

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.980
indifferent to the notion
of any kind of god.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:21.320
And so Pavlicek, no
Bible beater himself,

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:24.320
passed on having any kind
of religious celebrant.

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.950
And instead, turned the program
over to his son's friends, who

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:30.950
served up a half a dozen
well-spoken homages,

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:33.740
an acoustical duet
on "I'll Fly Away,"

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.740
and a teary solo of
"Angels Among Us,"

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.470
sung by a young woman who had
been the closest thing Junior

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:43.040
had had to a girlfriend in
the last year of his life.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.170
When the woman
returned to his seat

00:49:45.170 --> 00:49:48.950
a retired detective from Bronx
homicide not on the program

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.830
spontaneously got up and
sang and a cappella version

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:54.320
of Eric Clapton's
"Tears in Heaven,"

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.310
which had half the room
weeping like babies.

00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:03.800
And I'm jumping.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:08.150
"It ended with the old
African-American father

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:17.150
of the funeral director
doing a soft gospel singing

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:19.900
in his reedy voice.

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:22.110
He was seeing
singing seemingly--

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:27.050
sorry-- he was seemingly singing
directly to Junior's father

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:31.880
as he closed out the concert
with "The Battle is Not Yours."

00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:33.080
And then it was this time.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:35.760
Pavlicek rising
from the front row,

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.721
giving his back to the
room as the silently

00:50:37.721 --> 00:50:38.720
leaned over the coffin."

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.445
This is one of the observers.

00:50:43.445 --> 00:50:45.920
"Billy could hear him
whispering something to his son

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.860
but too indistinctly
for anyone to make out.

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.860
Then finally, turning to the
assembled, the expression

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.500
on his face near homicidal.

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.870
'I don't know if anybody
came here to celebrate John,

00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:59.930
Jr.'s life, but I
certainly didn't,' he said,

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:03.170
gripping the podium as
if he wanted to crush it.

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:04.580
'I am here before you.

00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:07.910
I am here among you to rage and
curse god for the arbitrarily

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:09.740
murdering fuck that he is.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:12.170
Not that I'm the first
parent ever to feel that way.

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:16.070
And to grant myself at least one
afternoon where suicide would

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:19.370
be logistically difficult.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:22.430
You know, you read the
papers after a young man

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:23.690
dies in this city.

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:25.520
Someone's always
saying, he was just

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:27.320
starting to get
his life together.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.750
He was just talking about
going back to school,

00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:32.660
getting his GED,
getting a job, talking

00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.790
about being a real
father to his daughter,

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:36.820
talking about getting
away from the hood,

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:39.530
about enlisting, about
marrying his fiance.

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:43.580
He was just about to do this,
he was just about to do that.

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:45.650
All these justs,
whether they were true

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:48.830
or not, because they
all died young and just

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:50.090
was all they had.

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.330
Tomorrow was all they had.

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:54.560
And the same could
be said for my boy.

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.240
He was just about to
finish his schooling.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:52:00.230
He was just about to find
his own way in the world,

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:02.570
just about to show
me the man that now,

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:04.580
now he'll never get to be.

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:07.190
The man that over the years
would have null and voided

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:12.770
every hardship, every heartache
I've ever endured in my life.

00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:14.930
You want to hear what
a great kid he was?

00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:18.500
How his heart was pure gold,
how he loved life, loved people,

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.330
loved the challenge,
all that boilerplate

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:22.020
et cetera, et cetera.

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.020
Well, those of you who
want to hear all of that,

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.400
consider it said.

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:29.161
The fact of the matter is was
that he was just about to be

00:52:29.161 --> 00:52:33.090
and now he's not.

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:36.360
There's some people in this
room right now,' Pavlicek said,

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:40.140
'who gave 20 years or more
to the job, myself included.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.170
We've seen it, all
handled it all.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:43.890
And when a young
person dies, we've

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.290
all walked up the stairs,
knocked on the doors

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:50.430
and delivered the news, between
us, to an army of parents.

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.320
We've caught them on
their way to the floor,

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.990
carried them into the bedroom
or living room, then gone

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:57.420
into their kitchens
and brought them water.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:02.490
Over the years, an ocean of
water, glass by glass by glass.

00:53:02.490 --> 00:53:04.410
And so, after all
of that, we think

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:06.900
we understand what it
must feel like to be

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:08.350
one of those parents.

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:09.390
But we don't.

00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:10.920
We can't.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.480
I still can't.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:13.680
But I'm getting there.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.639
Thank you for coming.'"

00:53:14.639 --> 00:53:16.471
I feel like I'm saying
that to the audience.

00:53:16.471 --> 00:53:17.445
Thank you for--

00:53:17.445 --> 00:53:19.610
It's just short.

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:21.794
I guess pretty corny after that.

00:53:21.794 --> 00:53:22.710
I just a voices thing.

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:31.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:35.790
So this novel, The Whites,
you published initially

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:36.970
under a pseudonym.

00:53:36.970 --> 00:53:41.790
See, that's where the
problem gets deeper.

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:43.290
I need money.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:45.260
And my agent, Lynn Nesbit--

00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:47.010
I didn't want to write
anymore screenplays

00:53:47.010 --> 00:53:49.640
because they became--

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.790
all anybody wanted was
a Marvel hero adaption.

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:55.070
They weren't even
interest in DC Comics.

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:58.520
And here I am in my
late 50s, early 60s,

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:06.600
and I'm auditioning to write the
screenplay about the Platinum

00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:08.955
Neuromancer, the
Turquoise Surfer.

00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:13.350
I'm too old for Marvel comics.

00:54:13.350 --> 00:54:19.030
But the executives I
was having to pitch to--

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:21.260
this is another word I hate--

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:25.405
were all younger
than my daughters.

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:30.600
It is humiliating.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.990
I would say, well, I think the
blind nut's action, the Surfer

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:36.600
with the guy with the
telescope in his head,

00:54:36.600 --> 00:54:40.390
I think he should-- and then,
here comes Farto, the villain.

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:42.630
You know his super power.

00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:45.470
And they go, wow, it's great,
writing down everything I said.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:49.556
And at the end of the thing,
at the end of the spiel,

00:54:49.556 --> 00:54:50.930
I'd give them all
my ideas, and i

00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:53.138
can hear the scritching of
pencils on the other side,

00:54:53.138 --> 00:54:59.055
writing down every iota of
thought I had on the subject.

00:54:59.055 --> 00:55:00.555
And at the end of
this I was winded.

00:55:00.555 --> 00:55:01.795
It was like an hour.

00:55:01.795 --> 00:55:04.820
I was going, whoo, it
is fantastic, fantastic.

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:05.411
Oh, fuck it.

00:55:05.411 --> 00:55:05.910
Who cares?

00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:07.210
I got a job.

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:10.080
And he said, we
should really get him

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.690
on the phone with Mitch.

00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:13.110
Who the hell's Mitch?

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.770
It's their boss.

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:16.410
They have no power
to say yes or no.

00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:19.111
They only have the power
to say no or maybe.

00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:20.360
Wow, you got to talk to Mitch.

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:21.693
So I've got to set up for Mitch.

00:55:21.693 --> 00:55:24.690
I talk another hour on the
phone with Mitch a week later.

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:27.660
Mitch is going,
brilliant, brilliant.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.710
I heard you were a genius, but
here it is in living color.

00:55:31.710 --> 00:55:33.390
And I want to tell
you something.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:36.740
You just know, you
need to talk to Sarah.

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.450
And we go up the
pike, and up the pike.

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:44.740
And here I am, dancing like a
marionette with a busted string

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:46.830
to these children.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:52.570
And I went all way up
the chain to Allison.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:58.290
And it turns out they gave the
gig to somebody else, who never

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:03.720
written a screenplay
before, was 24 years old,

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:06.990
and would do whatever they said
for a fraction of the price.

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.740
I said, that's it.

00:56:10.595 --> 00:56:12.220
You asked me what
time it is and you're

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:14.972
going to have the whole history
of Bolivar watch factory.

00:56:14.972 --> 00:56:16.930
So I'm go into Lynn
Nesbit, my agent, and said,

00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:18.300
I'm losing my mind.

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.760
I'm really behind in my bills.

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.134
And she says,
well, why don't you

00:56:21.134 --> 00:56:25.020
write a novel under a
pseudonym, like John Banville

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:28.320
and Benjamin Black?

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:33.090
There was this wave of like,
Hi, it's me, but it's not me.

00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:35.430
I'm going to have more fun.

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:37.350
And so I said, I can
get you as much money

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:39.900
as you would get
for a screenplay.

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:40.860
I said, great.

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:42.662
I'll do it.

00:56:42.662 --> 00:56:44.370
So I figured out some
kind of crime book.

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:46.580
That was going to be The Whites.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:50.040
And she said, oh, by the way, if
it takes more than three months

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.360
to write this thing
it's not worth it.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:55.530
I said, got it.

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:58.540
Cut to four years later.

00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:00.690
The Whites, the end.

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:05.470
My pants fell off, I'm more
bald on this side of my head

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:08.070
from pulling my hair out.

00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:10.710
How do you write down--

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:12.870
you write the way you write.

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:14.920
No, write stupider.

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.930
Write gliber-er-er.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:19.770
And you just write
the way you write.

00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:24.660
And so that was one
hell of a three-month--

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:26.880
So the book came out.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:30.600
And I thought it was a
quote, unquote "genre book."

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:34.410
And so I really wanted
to keep the pen name

00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:39.600
because I didn't
want this book to be

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:46.050
judged in comparison with
one of my more serious books.

00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:46.800
I didn't want to--

00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:51.102
How did it feel
different to you?

00:57:51.102 --> 00:57:51.810
I'm just curious.

00:57:51.810 --> 00:57:52.680
Because it's--

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:55.580
Because it followed the rules.

00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:59.100
That thing of all genres
is that there are rules.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.570
And if you break
the rules people

00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:01.945
don't know what
the hell this is.

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:03.600
They don't know what
to call the book.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:09.990
Is it a thriller, is it a
philosophical meditation

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:11.380
on human mortality?

00:58:13.930 --> 00:58:14.760
So I said fine.

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.350
It was part of the easy part.

00:58:16.350 --> 00:58:18.030
This has to happen.

00:58:18.030 --> 00:58:21.210
But how do you write
less complex characters?

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:28.680
If you don't believe in
good guys and bad guys,

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.100
if what you cherish--

00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.620
like every novelist
should cherish

00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:36.290
is the gray not the
black or the white,

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:40.060
but the complexity of
every biped on earth.

00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:45.910
But I was worried
that because it

00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:49.600
fit the conventions
and the genre,

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:52.060
let me keep the pen name.

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.040
It's just like a--

00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.004
but everybody knew it was me.

00:58:56.004 --> 00:58:57.670
So it was like pulling,
I actually said,

00:58:57.670 --> 00:59:00.500
pulling a rabbit
out of a glass hat.

00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:01.000
Here he is.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.850
Don't tell anybody.

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:07.160
[INAUDIBLE] So it is ridiculous.

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.430
Because it said in
the reviews even.

00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:11.450
Well, what happened is
I'd start reading reviews

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:15.140
and it was like, whoa,
hey, it's a good book.

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:18.640
I said, hmm, why
did I ever put it--

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:20.170
But it's a lesser book.

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:21.930
I honestly think
it's a lesser book.

00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:26.530
As good as it might be, and
just as good as it was received,

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:30.790
well as it was received, I
think it's a lesser book.

00:59:30.790 --> 00:59:35.200
Because it's about solving, aha,
they're the guys that did it.

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:42.850
Crime is the only
genre where the reader

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:45.340
is in competition
with the writer

00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:47.890
because they want to
outsmart the writer.

00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:51.040
And I don't know the difference
between that and word jumbles

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:55.420
or Friday New York
Times crossword puzzles.

00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:59.447
It's supposed to be you
just surrendered to a book.

00:59:59.447 --> 01:00:01.030
I feel like I
surrendered to this book

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:02.350
as I surrendered to the others.

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:07.150
And it's true that it's plotted.

01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:11.140
I you think about a crime novel,
it's got to have a revelation.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.640
And I hate revelations.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.930
And I hate answers.

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:21.030
Because life is open ended.

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.925
There are no answers.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:30.040
The crime genre requires
if not immortal answers,

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.070
solutions to the mystery.

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:36.820
And hopefully, you got
there before the reader did.

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:41.339
And it's just no way
to run an airline.

01:00:41.339 --> 01:00:42.880
Who the hell wants
to write like that

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:45.160
when the whole world
is out there in all

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:49.900
it's unanswerableness?

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:50.700
Yeah.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:53.700
But humanly, the characters
are there and all

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:55.290
their unanswerableness.

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:57.960
I try.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:04.530
But the point is, this time I
really went right to the genre.

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:08.340
And that's why it was more of
like, I killed myself on it,

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.129
but it was more like,
well, what I do now?

01:01:11.129 --> 01:01:12.420
And you consult the guide book.

01:01:15.331 --> 01:01:17.830
In a minute we'll open it up
to questions from the audience.

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:19.820
But I just wanted
to ask you also

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:23.685
about The Night Of,
which you are not just

01:01:23.685 --> 01:01:28.330
the main writer of,
but also a producer.

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:31.390
So it's your project,
it was your project--

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.890
Yeah.

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:32.931
I wrote all the episodes.

01:01:32.931 --> 01:01:36.600
In a way completely
differently perhaps

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.550
from some of your
other television.

01:01:38.550 --> 01:01:42.810
Yes and no because
the co-creator

01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.820
was also the director.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.560
So things will get changed.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.770
He had more power than I did.

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:50.560
So he's not only changing
things on the set,

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.620
determining on
circumstances, but he's

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.570
changing things because
he's also a writer,

01:01:54.570 --> 01:01:56.100
he's a screenwriter.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.770
So the worst thing in
the world is for a writer

01:01:58.770 --> 01:02:01.917
to write for a writer
because they're never going

01:02:01.917 --> 01:02:03.000
to respect what you wrote.

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:08.160
And things happen.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.080
I can see the
character a certain way

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:12.690
but he wants to
cast someone that's

01:02:12.690 --> 01:02:15.300
going to play an
entirely opposite way.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:16.590
And it's his decision.

01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:21.180
It's better to hire this
individual and let her

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.940
or him do his thing.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.180
It will serve the
story so much better.

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:27.150
I mean, I love what you
wrote, but now we're

01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:30.420
dealing with putting
flesh on the page.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.260
Yeah, it was mine.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:39.700
But there's always this
element of like no, no, no, no

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:42.040
what do you do, what did you do?

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.380
But then there is
also stuff that you

01:02:44.380 --> 01:02:45.780
didn't write that's in there.

01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:47.910
And you'll go, wow,
he really nailed that.

01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:50.070
I don't even touch that.

01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:52.770
So it's a give and take.

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:56.280
At best it's a give and take.

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:58.890
At worst it's all take.

01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:03.040
And you go home with
elephant ears inside out,

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.510
feeling angry and I'll never do
that again, till the next time.

01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:10.950
I realized that
there was a thing way

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:14.220
back that I wanted to ask you.

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:16.860
There were two paths in a wood.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:23.320
And it was about research,
and how you do your research.

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:28.320
And you said, it was an
excuse to spend all this time

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.810
with people.

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:35.370
But it involves calling
people up and going--

01:03:35.370 --> 01:03:40.940
Sometimes the things
you see in here,

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.750
the most non sequitorious
things you hear,

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:49.650
and the most
meaningless gestures,

01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:53.350
it's like heroine of insight.

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:56.610
And I don't do
research, I hang out.

01:04:03.450 --> 01:04:06.780
I'm not going to go
back to my own life.

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:12.390
Like somebody once said,
a lot of post-World War II

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.390
American fiction is vaguely
unhappy in Connecticut.

01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:17.630
I was vaguely
unhappy in the Bronx.

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:18.630
I don't want to do that.

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:22.430
I don't want to write about
myself, except how I filter in

01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:23.460
through my sensibility.

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:29.380
I had notebooks,
I had notebooks.

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:31.550
I'd scribble this down,
scribble that down.

01:04:31.550 --> 01:04:33.840
There would be a
pile like Rain Man.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.340
And I never look
at the notebooks

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.880
because I figured
whatever I remember

01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.250
is the important things.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.940
If I don't remember
it, looking up

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:49.510
my indecipherable
handwriting is going--

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:50.010
Right.

01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:50.760
What's the point?

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.960
OK, what did the guy say?

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:55.200
Because I don't know if
this word is gosh or damn.

01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:00.510
You go out there
and you don't even

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:03.040
know what you're looking for.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.850
I don't go out there with a
hit list of questions or goals.

01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:10.140
I go out there just to
be with these people.

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:18.476
You think it was a nothing
day or a real waste of time.

01:05:18.476 --> 01:05:19.850
And then 4 o'clock
in the morning

01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:24.750
you shoot upright in bed
and you go, oh, my god.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:27.220
What do he say?

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:31.960
And all of a sudden, it glink,
glink, glink, glink, glink.

01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:34.800
And I love it.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.620
I just love hanging.

01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:39.270
It's part of writing.

01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:41.040
Like I said, once
again, it's not

01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:45.240
like you have a goal of
like these big game animals

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:46.040
you want a bag.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:48.850
You're just going out
there to see what happens.

01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:51.400
The danger of that is
because it's so addicting

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:57.980
and for me it was so much fun,
I feel like I'm a student,

01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.070
I'm a perpetual student.

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:04.990
And just talking to anybody
on the street in any situation

01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:06.550
I feel like I'm learning.

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:10.300
I know this sounds a little
goody, goody, but it's true.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:16.120
The danger is you can get
so addicted to this game

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.530
that you forget to write.

01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:26.120
It's like trying to drink
the ocean with a colander.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.570
There's just too
much world out there.

01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:32.680
And it's really hard to stop.

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.890
I remember, when I was two years
on the street for Clockers,

01:06:35.890 --> 01:06:39.910
my editor said, well,
that's great, that's great.

01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:41.500
I tell them all
this amazing stuff.

01:06:41.500 --> 01:06:43.374
And he said, well, let
me ask you a question.

01:06:43.374 --> 01:06:46.050
What's the first
sentence of the book?

01:06:46.050 --> 01:06:47.695
And I immediately
had a speech defect.

01:06:47.695 --> 01:06:49.820
Well, I don't know enough
about the welfare system.

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:52.630
I don't know about
the public defender.

01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:53.590
Just start writing.

01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:01.030
You're a lifeguard who's
a little bit afraid of sea

01:07:01.030 --> 01:07:06.260
creatures so you make it so
musclebound with experience

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.940
that you can't swim.

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:09.520
Just stop, stop.

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:13.090
Stop pumping iron, stop
filling up notebooks.

01:07:13.090 --> 01:07:13.760
Just write.

01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:17.455
Anybody can go out and observe.

01:07:21.296 --> 01:07:22.670
It's like taking
in all his life,

01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:30.820
and now you got to shape it
into some baggy but logical

01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:35.950
beholding of a world, where
everything out there is

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:38.890
like chaos and pinballs.

01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:42.850
And so the art is
taking all that stuff

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:46.090
and molding it into a story.

01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:53.830
And the most dangerous thing you
can do, that I ever done is I

01:07:53.830 --> 01:07:55.570
start writing.

01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:58.780
Never, ever go back
out on the street.

01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.670
Guaranteed somebody
is going to say

01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:02.890
something that's going to
make you doubt everything

01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:04.900
you've ever known.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:06.430
It's fine, you're fine.

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:08.830
Get away, get away
before it's too late.

01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:12.010
So you're writing and then
you start talking to somebody.

01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:14.724
And it's so dangerous.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.140
Like in seventh
grade science they

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:18.460
try to teach you about
super saturation.

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.060
So they have beaker water.

01:08:23.029 --> 01:08:23.800
It's clear water.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.640
And then they drop something
in, it turns violet.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.370
That's what going out there--
all of a sudden it's clear

01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:31.300
water.

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:35.229
You go out there one time
too many and it's ink.

01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:36.670
And you can't see.

01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:39.729
You lose all your confidence.

01:08:39.729 --> 01:08:42.840
It's like being bold but being
fragile too because you've

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:43.870
got to protect yourself.

01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:48.932
Thank you.

01:08:48.932 --> 01:08:50.390
I'm wondering, I'm
thinking that we

01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:52.550
should see if people
in the audience

01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:54.770
would like to ask
a question or two.

01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:58.744
I just want to say before people
ask questions, ask a question.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.080
It's happened once too often.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.609
People get up and they
have something to say.

01:09:07.609 --> 01:09:10.790
At which point, after
10, 15 minutes, you go,

01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:12.222
what's the question?

01:09:12.222 --> 01:09:14.180
And then they ask some
question that they never

01:09:14.180 --> 01:09:17.689
meant to ask just to
couch it as a question.

01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:19.880
It makes everybody
a captive audience.

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.300
So I would love
to take questions.

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:25.286
Yes.

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.751
[INAUDIBLE]

01:09:27.751 --> 01:09:28.250
I'm sorry.

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:28.749
Hang on.

01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:30.400
There's a mic coming.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:31.350
Hi.

01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:32.850
First of all, thanks
for being here.

01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:33.560
I appreciate it.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.359
You talk about how your
approach to writing

01:09:35.359 --> 01:09:37.760
changes when you're writing
for the screen as opposed

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:41.676
to when you're writing
for a novel, for a page.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:43.300
The question was,
what's the difference

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:47.520
in writing on the page,
screen writing and novel?

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.450
Novels have language, sentences.

01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:52.160
Novels have prose.

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.950
Screenplays have no prose.

01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:57.920
They are like telegrams
to the director.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.900
This guy does this,
she says that.

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.530
He does this, she does that.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.120
End of scene.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:03.740
Next scene.

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:07.520
Two sentences set up
the location, the move.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.630
OK.

01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:09.350
Boy.

01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:10.160
Blah, blah, blah.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.540
Girl. blah-de-blah-de-blah-blah.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.039
Boy.

01:10:12.039 --> 01:10:15.210
Blah-de-blah.

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:17.790
They start throwing kitchen
appliances at each other.

01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:18.370
Cut.

01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:18.950
Next scene.

01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:20.180
Exterior, night.

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.630
Interior, day.

01:10:21.630 --> 01:10:23.820
Blup, blup, blup.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.365
It's like Post-It notes.

01:10:27.365 --> 01:10:34.524
[INAUDIBLE] development.

01:10:34.524 --> 01:10:36.440
I guess my question was
more development wise,

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:39.560
if I can use that term, which
comes from TV and film making.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.420
When you're going
into conceptualizing,

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:44.120
developing a screenplay
versus conceptualizing

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.370
and developing a book.

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:48.920
I guess your approach to
plotting and to structure

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.260
in that way rather
than the actual writing

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.730
of a scene versus--

01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:57.710
Well, I think what happens is
the difference in consciousness

01:10:57.710 --> 01:10:59.930
is the clock.

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:02.990
When you're writing a novel
there's no narrative clock.

01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:09.170
When you're writing a script,
or a television pilot,

01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:11.940
if you go over say an hour
and 50 minutes you're dead.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:18.620
If you go over 55
minutes you're dead.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:22.600
So you're writing with
one eye on the clock.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.450
He wants page 40.

01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:27.980
So you have to be exactly
conscious of where

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:32.600
you are vis-a-vis the length
of the project you're writing.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:41.240
Novels, you could write
a 9,000-page book.

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.720
The only requirement is that
it's compelling and readable

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.110
and says something.

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:51.154
And you could be more amorphous
when you're writing novels

01:11:51.154 --> 01:11:53.570
because you can have two people
sitting on a bench talking

01:11:53.570 --> 01:11:55.410
for 20 pages.

01:11:55.410 --> 01:11:57.620
And once again, the
conversation, all it has,

01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.680
the conversation has to be
scintillating or interesting

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:01.790
at least.

01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:08.642
You can't do that for
film because it's not

01:12:08.642 --> 01:12:09.350
a written medium.

01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:10.460
It's a visual medium.

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:12.320
It's a two-M dimensional medium.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.660
You hear and you see.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.390
Like I said, there's no
I wonder as I wander.

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:20.240
In writing a script, you
have to know your story.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.300
And there's no room for, gee.

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:25.430
You have to know
before you start,

01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:30.650
because you're in such a
small phone booth, exactly

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:32.630
what the story is.

01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:37.700
Because you can't wander off
after 20 pages and decide

01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:40.796
you don't like your main
character in the screenplay.

01:12:40.796 --> 01:12:41.420
He'll kill you.

01:12:44.150 --> 01:12:46.070
A novel, some people
just write novels

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:49.040
from sentence to sentence,
see where it takes them.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.080
But time is money,
and there's a lot

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:52.670
of people waiting for a script.

01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:57.020
And it's got to be
tight, crisp, and go

01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:00.030
where it's going up front.

01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:03.715
And that's all the
difference in the world.

01:13:03.715 --> 01:13:04.450
Thank you.

01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:15.284
It feels as though
the script writing

01:13:15.284 --> 01:13:17.210
has more restrictions on you.

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:19.790
I just think, do
you feel as if you

01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:22.460
can get your narrative
voice into a character's

01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:23.960
mouth, or not?

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.310
Oh, I can.

01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:29.660
But once again, it's my voice.

01:13:29.660 --> 01:13:32.690
But who knows what the ultimate
interpretation that the actor

01:13:32.690 --> 01:13:35.120
will have or who
the actor will be?

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.210
Or what the director wants,
what the studio wants?

01:13:38.210 --> 01:13:39.170
That's what I'm saying.

01:13:39.170 --> 01:13:43.040
You're the first person in and
everybody piles on top of you.

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:48.200
And at the end of
the day, you're

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:53.030
lucky if you feel you
recognize half of what

01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:54.810
you wrote in the final product.

01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:57.770
But if you know that going
in you're OK with that?

01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:02.090
Well, like I said, no
such thing as free money.

01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:05.724
You to make money, this
is what you got to do.

01:14:05.724 --> 01:14:06.390
We were joking--

01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:07.300
Is it painful, though?

01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:07.800
Hmm?

01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.690
Is it painful, or do
you just get past that--

01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:11.420
It used to be painful
when I was younger

01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:14.900
because I was so excited
about working in movies

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:18.894
and working with people
that I've watched since I

01:14:18.894 --> 01:14:20.300
was a teenager on screen.

01:14:23.224 --> 01:14:24.890
The older I get, I'm
more philosophical.

01:14:24.890 --> 01:14:26.840
This is what I do for money.

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:30.230
Because my name is on it
I'll do the best I can do.

01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:32.240
But I know the lay of the land.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.250
I'm not going to get
my knickers in a twist.

01:14:34.250 --> 01:14:37.350
This is what
they're going to do.

01:14:37.350 --> 01:14:39.800
And I have an
agreement with myself.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.275
If this happened to me--

01:14:41.275 --> 01:14:44.540
because movies, you can write
the best thing in the world.

01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:47.780
But they have a
change of studio heads

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:50.320
and there's a whole new
slate all of sudden.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:53.870
When I did something
for CBS, they

01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:55.430
decided halfway
through the series,

01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:57.540
CBS does not want
to dramas anymore.

01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.150
Dramas aren't making it.

01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:01.160
Every drama has to be
converted to action.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.490
What am I, like
Hopalong Cassidy?

01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:09.470
I mean, it's like, Jesus.

01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:11.530
You don't want me
to write action.

01:15:11.530 --> 01:15:15.532
You can't tell me mid-stream
more bells than whistles.

01:15:15.532 --> 01:15:17.990
I'm not going to give you bells
and whistles to begin with.

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:23.550
I forgot the question.

01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:24.980
Am I good with that?

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:27.140
I realize, I want
certain things in life.

01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:30.260
I want things in
life for my family.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.780
I want things in
life for myself.

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:35.120
I want to enjoy myself.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.350
Everything's a compromise.

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:39.020
If I want certain things
there are certain things

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:39.910
I have to do.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.540
It's still writing.

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.060
Whatever I write, no matter
how much I complain, and nobody

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:47.450
feels sorry for that poor little
rich girl, but no matter how

01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:49.880
much I complain
I'm still writing.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:52.130
I'm getting paid for writing.

01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:54.770
It might not be what
I would like to write,

01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:58.480
but I'll make it into
something I want it write.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.650
It's called first draft.

01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:01.970
After that it's hell.

01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:04.900
I mean first draft of a script.

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:05.400
Yes.

01:16:08.376 --> 01:16:09.368
Somebody.

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.640
I was wondering if you could
describe how your reading has

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.390
changed over time.

01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:19.970
Because I know that
you mentioned that once

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:22.340
you discovered more New York
and urban centric writers

01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:24.020
that you really
found your voice.

01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:27.530
But now that maybe you
have a better sense

01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:29.540
of what your voice
is than you did then,

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:33.627
if your reading has expanded
to like other perspectives.

01:16:33.627 --> 01:16:34.710
And if that's maybe like--

01:16:34.710 --> 01:16:37.370
Has my reading broadened?

01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:40.610
Yeah, it has because I
don't need them anymore.

01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:44.390
I'm the one that the ones
coming up read, in that sense.

01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:49.220
If you're looking for somebody
that reminds you of you,

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.670
if you were like me, I'm
the guy, among others.

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:57.680
My reading has
always been eclectic.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:01.190
Not all reading is
for inspiration.

01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:04.640
It's because you love to read.

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:10.070
When I'm reading to find
myself, that's more hunting.

01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:14.161
I'm not hunting anymore,
I'm reading for pleasure.

01:17:14.161 --> 01:17:14.660
What?

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.590
So what are you reading?

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:17.856
What am I reading?

01:17:17.856 --> 01:17:19.194
Sorry, I didn't--

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.350
Is that Spanish Armada there?

01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:29.660
I read a hot book
about Sir Francis Drake

01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:31.920
and didn't decide
to follow up on it.

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.170
I don't know what I'm reading.

01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:34.310
I'm reading everything.

01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:42.230
Because of ebooks, if you have
a really good cup of coffee,

01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:48.201
or god forbid, 5 milligrams of
Adderall, and you go to Amazon,

01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:49.700
you're going to
wind up buying seven

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:52.560
books in about seven minutes.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.680
You're going to read maybe one.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.640
You're going to read maybe a
couple of pages of another one.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:17:59.720
And you're going to
look at the other five

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.280
and say, why the
hell did I buy this?

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:02.029
What's this about?

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:09.119
Ebooks has ruined
my concentration.

01:18:09.119 --> 01:18:10.410
There's so much I want to read.

01:18:13.984 --> 01:18:15.150
I could be reading anything.

01:18:15.150 --> 01:18:16.800
But I'm also reading
four other books,

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.591
and I'll probably never
finish any of them.

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:23.070
There's a sadness also.

01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:24.840
Is that, when you
get older you realize

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:27.000
you're never going
to read the writers

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.350
you always meant to read.

01:18:28.350 --> 01:18:31.770
You're never going to a lot
of the writers you always

01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:34.690
meant to read because you
don't want to read them.

01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:38.970
Your rhythm, your metabolism.

01:18:38.970 --> 01:18:42.750
There are certain books you love
when you're 20, in your 20s.

01:18:42.750 --> 01:18:44.940
And it's like learning
a foreign language.

01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:50.920
Your brain is open to this
book at this time in your life.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:53.580
And as you get older,
I know what I like,

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:54.780
I know what I want.

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:57.930
I know what makes me curious.

01:18:57.930 --> 01:19:01.290
So god help me, I'll
probably never read

01:19:01.290 --> 01:19:03.230
the Mayor of Casterbridge.

01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:06.510
I'll never read a
million books that I'm

01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:08.510
embarrassed to say
I haven't read.

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:11.220
I want to, but time is short.

01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:13.240
There are a lot of
books out there.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:16.840
And it's kind of like
a depressing thought.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:17.992
Yes.

01:19:17.992 --> 01:19:21.630
[INAUDIBLE] Price, Claire
mentioned John Le Carre.

01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:25.320
I wonder if you could
name a few other writers,

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:28.010
who like you, have kind
of walked with a genre

01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:31.620
and yet gone outside
it wildly too?

01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:34.140
Basically, are there writers
in that particular genre?

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:35.530
No, not in that
particular genre,

01:19:35.530 --> 01:19:36.738
but writers like you who've--

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:37.650
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:43.710
Writers like you who really have
a tricky and great relationship

01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:46.940
with genre and have gone
beyond it in great ways.

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.750
I'd say Le Carre's one,
and you're another.

01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:50.340
Are there others, do you think?

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:51.270
I'm sure there are.

01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:53.561
I can't think of any right
now, but I'm sure there are.

01:19:56.130 --> 01:20:00.615
Listen, Joseph Conrad
wrote spy books.

01:20:00.615 --> 01:20:02.240
If you want to think
about, Dostoyevsky

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.210
wrote probably one of the
best murder mysteries,

01:20:06.210 --> 01:20:09.060
although you know up front who
did it, which is what I prefer.

01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:14.880
Look at the science fiction
being written by Doris--

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:17.490
there are people
that use genres,

01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:19.050
but they're using genres.

01:20:19.050 --> 01:20:23.280
It's not like they're dyed in
the wool, loyal card carrying

01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:25.080
members of that genre.

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:28.680
Would you call Cormac
McCarthy a Western writer?

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.960
You

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:33.060
Well, speaking more
narrowly, what about writers

01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:37.710
working as you do with
police and dead bodies,

01:20:37.710 --> 01:20:40.890
and yet writing these
novels that transcend.

01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:42.960
Are there others?

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:48.870
All I can say is there are a
lot of people in the crime genre

01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:52.770
that are really great
writing crime genre.

01:20:52.770 --> 01:20:56.010
But they're writing crime genre.

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.550
I don't know too
many crime writers

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:04.470
who bust out of the corral.

01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:08.250
The thing about crime
writing is you can't

01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:12.360
remember who did what to what.

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.530
I might read The Big Sleep
or Farewell, My Lovely

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:18.600
or The Maltese Falcon.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:20.550
Who cares who did what to what?

01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:28.960
You read crime for the narrative
voice and for the atmosphere.

01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:34.310
And for creating a
memorable central character

01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:37.110
and evoking a time and a place.

01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:39.088
Everything else is popcorn.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:44.310
Many questions.

01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:45.931
Sir at the back.

01:21:45.931 --> 01:21:46.430
Yes.

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.280
Hi.

01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.180
Thanks.

01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:55.280
Could you speak a little
bit about the role

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.900
that drugs play in
the writing process,

01:21:57.900 --> 01:21:59.150
if they play a role for you?

01:21:59.150 --> 01:21:59.671
In drugs?

01:21:59.671 --> 01:22:00.170
Drugs.

01:22:00.170 --> 01:22:03.170
Like you mentioned
cocaine briefly, Adderall.

01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:05.000
I'm wondering if
that's something

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.730
that does play a role
in the writing process

01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:09.770
in terms of creativity
or otherwise?

01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:15.800
Even William Burroughs
said he's never

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:21.920
written any a damn page
that was any good on drugs.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:25.760
Apologies to Thomas De Quincy.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:30.440
I think drugs are the
enemy of real creativity.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:33.830
Not to sound like a
moralizer, but I'm

01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:35.760
haunted by my own
experience with drugs.

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.680
But when I try to
write on that--

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:40.070
Adderall, I do take
Adderall because sometimes I

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:42.120
just feel like I don't
want to write about.

01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.661
But with Adderall,
it'll just give me

01:22:43.661 --> 01:22:44.730
a little bit of a boost.

01:22:44.730 --> 01:22:49.100
And so when I open it I get
lost in working really fast.

01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:53.000
But my writing is
haunted by drugs

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.310
because of my own experience.

01:22:55.310 --> 01:22:59.270
Clockers, I was
just sniffing coke,

01:22:59.270 --> 01:23:04.070
like party coke when
crack came along.

01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:07.040
I finally figured out
how to make cocaine

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:10.490
affordable to poor people.

01:23:10.490 --> 01:23:12.370
And it was 10 times deadlier.

01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:14.150
This cocaine is god's
way of telling you

01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:16.310
you're making too much money.

01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:19.130
But this is not coke.

01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:22.430
I was so haunted by my
own years on cocaine,

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:25.820
when crack became
a phenomena, and it

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:30.170
is the quintessence
of not the end

01:23:30.170 --> 01:23:34.640
of the world in a white rock.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.850
You couldn't read the sports
pages back in the late '80s

01:23:38.850 --> 01:23:44.170
where crack-- even you'd
say, well, Yankees 4 crack 3.

01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:47.600
Crack had just drafted
a new crack head.

01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.690
It was pervasive.

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:50.150
And it just haunted me.

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:54.470
And that drove me
to write Clockers.

01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:57.414
Like I said,
autobiography seeps in.

01:23:57.414 --> 01:23:59.580
I'll tell you my experience
trying to write on coke.

01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:06.560
Quite bluntly, I
was 30 years old.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:09.230
I do like to get me started.

01:24:09.230 --> 01:24:11.743
I do a line, I'd write a
line, I'd write a paragraph.

01:24:11.743 --> 01:24:13.470
I'd go, that's a
great paragraph.

01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:15.170
Let's celebrate.

01:24:17.970 --> 01:24:19.000
Write two more lines.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.720
That was a great two more lines.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.770
Anybody up for a boop?

01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:25.350
Write one line.

01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:26.150
All right.

01:24:26.150 --> 01:24:28.130
Those are great three words.

01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:29.630
Let's have a bump.

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:38.150
And pretty soon, I started
out allegedly snorting coke

01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:39.640
in order to write.

01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:45.410
And then it got so horribly
perverted I was writing

01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:47.720
as an excuse to do coke.

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:51.790
And at one point I'm
working on something.

01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:55.580
I had 100 pages and
each page was great.

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:58.730
But each page was
for a different book.

01:24:58.730 --> 01:25:01.730
So it made no sense.

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.620
It was too.

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:06.825
It's like an oscillating
beer sign by the jukebox.

01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:15.710
Listen, there are
serious drugs that

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:20.990
need to be taken by people who
are suffering from stuff that

01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:25.100
makes them drop down a hole that
nobody can understand if they

01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.500
haven't had that malady.

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:31.550
[INAUDIBLE] that type of
drugs, recreational drugs.

01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:32.340
Alcohol?

01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:33.180
Nope.

01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:39.080
You can't do any of that stuff
and keep a coherent flowing

01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.790
mind.

01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:43.990
And that's been my experience.

01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.705
That's it.

01:25:44.705 --> 01:25:46.580
I wouldn't even go for
a second cup of coffee

01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:49.550
because I'll just buy
seven more books on ebooks,

01:25:49.550 --> 01:25:50.550
instead of writing.

01:25:50.550 --> 01:25:53.570
Now I've got 14 books
I'll never read.

01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:55.910
Maybe one last question.

01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:58.240
Sir here in the front.

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:00.630
Actually do you--
no, sir, go ahead.

01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:05.480
Do you have any examples
of scripts you've written

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:10.580
and there's a big change either
like there was a great change,

01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:13.690
or like, oh, my god, I
can't believe I did that?

01:26:13.690 --> 01:26:15.020
Could you be more specific?

01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.220
I'm not quite--

01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.060
Like if you wrote a script,
and then it got produced,

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:20.899
let's say.

01:26:20.899 --> 01:26:21.440
I don't know.

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:25.030
Was Color of Money was the
protagonist a 12-year-old girl

01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:26.600
originally, or
something like that?

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.290
No.

01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:28.100
No.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.260
That's screenwriting.

01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:33.620
And TV writing is all business.

01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:37.670
You don't have the whim, you
don't have the power of whimsy

01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:41.630
to change your
mind because you're

01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:45.160
getting paid by people who
are creating a product.

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:46.690
And they know the
reason why you're

01:26:46.690 --> 01:26:48.571
writing it is that
they gave it thumbs up.

01:26:48.571 --> 01:26:49.570
Yeah, this sounds great.

01:26:49.570 --> 01:26:50.550
Go do it.

01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:52.180
And you can't come
in, you know, I

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.120
decided that
12-year-old girl, she

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.680
should be a 400-year-old
man from another planet.

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:00.400
It works so much better.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.530
They're going to look
at you and you're done.

01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:04.630
You can't do that.

01:27:04.630 --> 01:27:08.580
Whereas, there are some
great stories about writers

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:13.340
who started out doing one
thing and halfway through

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:17.830
they switch from a
car to an airplane.

01:27:17.830 --> 01:27:23.020
I had a writing teacher, who was
a mid-century British novelist,

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:26.440
Alan Sillitoe, who wrote The
Loneliness of the Long Distance

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:31.090
Runner, and Saturday
Night and Sunday Morning.

01:27:31.090 --> 01:27:34.150
And some of these
books were part

01:27:34.150 --> 01:27:38.880
of the black and white British
cinema of the late '50s

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:41.210
and early '60s,

01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:48.220
And when he was writing Saturday
Night and Sunday Morning,

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:52.420
Richard Harris played
the main character.

01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:57.230
He said, the main character
that he intended was a sailor.

01:27:57.230 --> 01:28:01.030
And he comes into a bar, I
think it was in Nottingham.

01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:06.430
So he comes into the bar and he
challenges any of these factory

01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:07.720
lugs to a drink off.

01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:09.440
I can drink any man
under the table.

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:12.280
He said, well, now I have
to create a character

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.500
to take up the challenge.

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.430
So he starts writing.

01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:18.810
These guys are drinking and
talking, and this and that.

01:28:18.810 --> 01:28:21.520
All of a sudden, he
realizes, he likes this guy

01:28:21.520 --> 01:28:23.240
a lot better than the sailor.

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.920
So he finished the
scene by having

01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.670
the sailor pass out
and get dragged out

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:29.590
of the pub and the book.

01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:33.135
And it became about the guy
that took up the challenge.

01:28:33.135 --> 01:28:34.510
But you can do
that with a novel.

01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:35.860
It's yours.

01:28:35.860 --> 01:28:38.950
It's yours until
you surrender it.

01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:41.530
Are there any times when a
director or producer, whoever,

01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:44.410
will change something and
it was a pleasant surprise?

01:28:44.410 --> 01:28:48.730
Well, OK, glad you asked.

01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:50.701
Constantly.

01:28:50.701 --> 01:28:53.820
You write a line, you write,
who do you think you are anyhow?

01:28:53.820 --> 01:28:56.430
And it's the way [INAUDIBLE] Who
do you think you are, anyhow?

01:28:59.757 --> 01:29:00.840
But I'll tell you a story.

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:05.680
There's a great novelist
named Leonard Gardner.

01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:10.590
And he wrote a book
called Fat City, which

01:29:10.590 --> 01:29:14.200
is about a tank town boxers,
like night of the tomato

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.800
can boxers.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:16.730
And was Stockton.

01:29:16.730 --> 01:29:19.210
It was Steinbeck country.

01:29:19.210 --> 01:29:26.290
And it was a beautiful,
beautiful novel.

01:29:26.290 --> 01:29:31.000
Kind of Hemingway-esque
but better.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.040
And I read that book
when it came out.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.350
I loved it.

01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:36.430
And I was at a party
in San Francisco.

01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:40.270
And John Huston made a movie
out of that with Jeff Bridges

01:29:40.270 --> 01:29:41.560
and I forgot who else.

01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:42.308
Stacy Keach.

01:29:42.308 --> 01:29:42.808
Hmm?

01:29:42.808 --> 01:29:43.640
Stacy Keach.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.560
Right, right.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:45.910
Exactly.

01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:51.130
So I meet Leonard
Gardner at a party.

01:29:51.130 --> 01:29:55.780
And here's what you should never
say to a novelist at a party,

01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:57.474
especially when there's alcohol.

01:29:57.474 --> 01:29:59.890
So what did you think of the
movie they made of your book?

01:29:59.890 --> 01:30:05.020
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:08.650
So I asked him that question.

01:30:08.650 --> 01:30:11.800
And he's built like a whippet.

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:14.420
I think he used to box
himself at some point.

01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:15.890
He was just a coil.

01:30:15.890 --> 01:30:17.020
He wasn't even a man.

01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:21.040
He was just a coil of muscle
and tension and quiver.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:24.510
But when I asked that question
he literally started shaking.

01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:27.070
I thought his temples
were going to explode.

01:30:27.070 --> 01:30:29.020
He started cursing
out John Huston.

01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:31.439
That son of a bitch.

01:30:31.439 --> 01:30:32.980
Any time he thought
he could he could

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:36.280
score a girl he gave her an
extra line that I didn't write.

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.230
And he did this,
and he did that.

01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:42.340
And it was like talking to the
Ancient Mariner on steroids.

01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:43.575
And I said, oh, my god.

01:30:43.575 --> 01:30:45.700
And I was thinking of
adapting one of my own books.

01:30:45.700 --> 01:30:46.409
I had an offer.

01:30:46.409 --> 01:30:47.950
And after that, I
said, god damn, I'm

01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:51.730
never going to touch my books,
which I should have stuck to.

01:30:51.730 --> 01:30:55.360
And I said, god, I'm
so sorry, Leonard.

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.579
What are you doing now?

01:30:56.579 --> 01:30:58.120
I'm writing a script
for John Huston.

01:30:58.120 --> 01:30:59.720
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.460
And I went, oh, my god.

01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:08.390
Well, perhaps that's a
good place for us to stop.

01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:09.890
Richard, thank you so much.

01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:10.490
[APPLAUSE]

01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:12.340
It was [INAUDIBLE]
