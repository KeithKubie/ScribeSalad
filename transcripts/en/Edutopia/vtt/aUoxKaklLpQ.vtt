00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:03.011
(students cheering)

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.360
- Your middle school and high school years

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.350
are the end of the beginning

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.250
as you march off to college,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.920
as you march off to grad school,

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.010
and all the jobs and
careers that you want.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.010
(students cheering)
(applause)

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:25.303
(students chanting)

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:29.230
- [Thomas] All right, Class of 2018!

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.230
(students cheering)

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.470
The mission of WHEELS is to make sure

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.450
that all of our students

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.500
are academically, emotionally,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.730
socially, and intellectually prepared

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.330
to succeed in the college of their choice.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.880
We expect that 100% of our
seniors apply to college,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.780
and then it's up to
them and their families

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.458
to make the right decision
that that's for them.

00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:52.200
(students cheering)

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.070
Based on the idea that
it's to really celebrate

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.940
this process that students
have gone through.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.000
Many of them first
generation college students.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.160
- No one in my family has gone to college.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.536
When I mention it to my family,

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:05.950
they're very like, "I
can't really tell you much

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.610
because I've never been there."

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.020
- You guys made it to the College March.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.200
- [Thomas] The day starts

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.080
with a bunch of different activities.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.390
They open up letters from their families.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.378
- So you'll get your parent letter.

00:01:16.378 --> 00:01:19.711
- (speaking in Spanish)

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.250
- They got their hoodies,
which is a huge deal.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.680
It's them really being
part of something larger.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.930
- Everybody was like, "Oh, my
god, it's the College March."

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.430
It didn't hit me until we were lined up.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.101
(students cheering)

00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:38.600
- [Thomas] All the
students from our school

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.890
line both sides of the pavement.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.300
Streets are shut down.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.700
Family's there. Community
members are there.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.750
- In the youngest grades,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.421
we have our students
participate on the sidelines.

00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:50.710
So they're seeing, for the first time,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.130
young people who look them

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.370
who are going off to college

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.530
and seeing the community support that.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.340
- It's like motivation,
I guess you can say,

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.880
because, when we see them,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.600
we're like, "I'm gonna
be going off to college,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.420
and I'm gonna have everybody
else cheering me on

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.020
one of these days."

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.290
- They really look up to us,

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.890
and it was amazing to just
walk through the streets

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.020
and inspire them that the college process

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.170
shouldn't be that intimidating.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.170
(students cheering)
(drums beating)

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.980
- Because this is one of
many monumental moments

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.813
in your life.

00:02:23.813 --> 00:02:24.646
- We always have alumni

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:26.248
and then we have some community
members share as well.

00:02:26.248 --> 00:02:28.200
- Every door that you walk through,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.550
remember that you
represent this community.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.100
Hold your head up high

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.309
and know that you can do
exactly what your goals are.

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:37.030
(students cheering)

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.229
- Obviously, we have one
more thing left to do, right?

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:42.890
(students cheering)

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.938
- We have our students each
with an individualized envelope

00:02:45.938 --> 00:02:49.010
that contains their supporting documents.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.830
- The highlight of the entire experience

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.226
was when we physically took the copy.

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:55.200
- [Thomas] Come on up!

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.970
- And put it in the box to be mailed out,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.760
knowing that, when we release
it, it's going to college.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.040
It's just amazing.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.013
I could do it over and over again.

00:03:06.973 --> 00:03:08.620
- Every year, it gets a little bit bigger,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.520
a little bit louder.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.590
And it's now spread to 25
schools across the country.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.453
- And congratulations
again to the Class of 2018.

00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:18.550
(students cheering)
(applause)

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.300
- And of course, it's not the end.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.430
It's just a symbol that we're closing

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.450
this chapter of our lives

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.130
and opening the other one,

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.683
which is college and beyond.
