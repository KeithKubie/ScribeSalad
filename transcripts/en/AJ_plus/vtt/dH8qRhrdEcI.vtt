00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.200
I'm getting married. There's going to be
hundreds of wedding guests, huge plates

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.870
of biryani, henna’d hands, and a handsome groom. But this isn't my wedding. My wedding's

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.710
not for another six months, and before
the aunties pick me apart, I'm trying

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.310
to figure out how to do things right. You
see, the arranged marriages of our

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.420
parents' generation look really different
than relationships now. And weddings

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.160
aren't just a party – they set the tone
for what our futures look like as hyphenated Americans.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.080
Hi, I’m Shreen. I’m Indian American. And this is my fiancé, Soheb.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.020
He's also Indian American. We're in
the middle of planning our traditional

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.100
Indian wedding here in the U.S. And when I say ‘traditional Indian’ I should say ‘Muslim.’

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.700
Because in India, there are Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and more. And they all have

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.240
different wedding traditions, which are
intensely debated. Making the wrong call

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.460
could lead to family boycotting your
wedding day.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.500
— It’s complicated.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.400
First point of contention: the dress. This is my little sister, Yasin.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.820
Today she's helping me shop for my wedding dress.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.200
So this would be really nice for your Sangeet or your henna.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.500
There are so many dress options for brides these days. I could wear a traditionally red lehenga, like this.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.000
A super modern fusion one, like this. Or something in between.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.240
What do you think of this?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.960
— Ooh, it's pretty from the front. What does it look like from the back? Oh my God, it’s backless.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.580
What would mom say if I wore this?

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.200
— She wouldn't let you wear it.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.200
I think if I were a Hindu or Sikh bride, I could totally rock this.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.140
But for a Muslim bride, it would just be too scandalous.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.900
Would you ever want to wear something like this?

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.000
— As a bridesmaid?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.960
As a bride.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.600
— I don't really want to be a bride.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.140
How come?

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.140
— I don't really believe in marriage. I think that there's just so much pressure on, like, of course you're going to

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.500
get married, and we'll find a person to be this placeholder. And I just don't see that for myself.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.360
Weddings are such an insane capitalist industry.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.700
You could take that money and be part of a way to a down payment on a house.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.140
— Yasin, if you don't get married, you'd be the first woman in our family to opt out of marriage intentionally.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.990
That's pretty cool.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.840
— That's super cool.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.480
Because then it’s like, what does that open up for my life?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.520
My sister has a point. But getting married is at the core of my Indian identity.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.380
Before me, almost all the marriages in my extended family have been arranged. The aunties

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.560
would get together and swap details on
wedding resumes to find the right match:

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.360
someone with the same religion, language
and status. But I never wanted an

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.360
arranged marriage. My fiancé and I have
what's called a "love match" which means

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.880
we found each other without involving
our parents. And we waited until we were

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.600
in our 30s to get married. Which is
really old in Indian standards!

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600
And just because our families are both Indian
doesn't mean they have anything in

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.740
common. They don't even speak the same language.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.680
— Yeah, like mine. They speak Gujrati. Kem cho [How are you]?

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.380
And mine speaks Urdu. I don’t understand a word of what your family says.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.040
And it only gets more complicated

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.150
if you marry outside the culture. Enter
Jessica and Hardeep. Her family is German

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.840
and Christian. His family is Punjabi and Sikh.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.840
We both met each other on the online game “World of Warcraft” and we met each other killing monsters.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.800
He would send something in Punjabi and I'd have
to translate it.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.620
– Oh, wow.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.760
And then I'd something in German and then he'd have
to translate that.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.200
Jessica and Hardeep kept their relationship secret from his parents for nine years.

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.560
I am the first in my family to marry someone who is not Desi.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.780
— And that’s a big deal.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.040
It's a big deal.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.200
— Who did your parents want you to marry?

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.819
So my parents wanted … a perfect scenario would be someone Desi,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.520
from Punjab, who’s Sikh, speaks Punjabi, and is familiar with all the traditions.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.380
— And you brought home …

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.080
A white girl.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.960
It was definitely difficult to be the secret. I had told

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.579
him numerous times over and over again,
you need to tell them. And he's like, 'I

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.040
don't wanna be kicked out and I don't want to lose them.' I mean, I can totally understand that.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.460
If you look back at 1940s, 1950s, you

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.840
didn't even see who you married. Your
parents just went over to another

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.630
parents house, they talked to each other
and you were engaged, and you didn't even

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:41.720
see your bride or the groom. Me, I'm just the complete opposite of that culture. I've decided everything.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.060
When he finally got the courage to tell his parents about Jessica,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.800
things got so heated that they stopped talking for a while.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.800
My dad was fine with it right away. But my mom, she's more traditional and

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.640
she was more stuck on, “Oh, you should marry a Desi girl.” But, eventually she came around.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.620
I can understand Jessica and
Hardeep's situation because my older

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.100
sister Yazi also married outside the culture.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.700
Tell me about some of the traditions that you grappled with when you were wedding planning.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:17.180
— Well, I really wanted to make sure that the ceremony reflected us as a couple,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.380
that our partnership is a partnership, and it's an egalitarian partnership.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.500
So, for example, we had a woman officiate our nikkah.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.440
Which was a big deal.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.380
— Which was a big deal.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.560
In Muslim weddings, the nikkah is when we sign the Islamic marriage contract.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.580
In Sikh weddings, couples circle the holy book four times to get married. And

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.500
during Hindu weddings, they take seven steps around the ceremonial fire.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:48.740
Modesty is so important. Even in Bollywood movies, for the longest time, there was never

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.060
ever kissing, and like the couple’s faces are so close together, but they would never kiss.

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.140
During the wedding ceremony, we did not. We walked out

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.040
and we had a private moment to ourselves, and our first kiss was right there.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.960
— I'm struggling with that. It does feel like a loss to me.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.840
How come?

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.820
— I've been watching movies for 30 years where, after you seal your union, you kiss.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.960
To me, getting to stand up in front of all our friends and family was a sealing of our union.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.420
—I'm not sure if we're going to kiss on our wedding, but I really want to.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.480
Something that Soheb and I really want to have is dancing,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:42.120
but dancing can be a bit of a taboo in our community. So why is that?

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.940
Would it make you uncomfortable if we pulled you onto the dance floor?

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.520
What about if we pulled amijan [grandma] and baba [grandpa] on the dance floor?

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.120
What my mom is saying is that you probably wouldn't see this at a Desi Muslim wedding. But this is

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.300
Jessica and Hardeep’s wedding, and Punjabis are known for dancing. Soheb’s

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.000
parents, by the way, also have reservations about dancing at our wedding.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.100
Yazi got married and I'm next. So, of course all eyes are going to point to Yasin.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.860
What are your thoughts on Yasin not wanting to get married?

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.400
What does that mean?

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.240
So if I don't change my mind?

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.860
But mom, that’s kind of interesting, because you are divorced, and you and dad, your marriage didn't

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:04.100
work out. And you're so happy being a single, you know, independent person. So why is marriage so

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:09.340
important for Yasin if we've seen that the marriage can be quite flawed?

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.880
Even my grandpa, who we call baba, is trying to change Yasin’s mind.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.080
— So you think I’ll change my mind?

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.760
— What if I don’t change my mind?

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.599
There’s one more thing I haven’t talked to Soheb about yet: the maher. It’s a

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.380
Muslim marriage tradition of a cash gift the groom gives the bride.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:43.940
It’s the opposite of a dowry, which the bride’s family pays the groom and is common in

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.960
Hindu weddings. On Jessica and Hardeep’s wedding day, we saw something lighter.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:52.560
Hardeep was blocked from entering the gurdwara until he paid Jessica’s family to step aside.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:02.140
I’m really nervous to talk to you about the maher because it feels totally anti-feminist to choose a number,

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:09.980
negotiate that number, and then like expect my partner to pay for it. And it just seems really old school.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.960
—No, I think you get to use it, like you can … that's your money.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.000
You get to use that the next day if you wanted to.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.480
Have you heard that there’s a number that is the traditional number to give as a maher?

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:27.820
— Yeah, it was. So there’s a way to calculate what that maher would be in today’s terms.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:37.260
What's the equivalent in the present day? Scroll, scroll, scroll. In dollars, it is approximately $396.70.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.960
— Yes!

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.040
And then it ends with, “And Allah knows best.”

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.040
— Allah knows best. He knows the bestest. I think it would be helpful to understand the process,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.700
if you talk to my mom or my sisters. Or my dad.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.480
– Or my dad.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.100
— Yeah. Or your dad.

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.940
– Hi dad!

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.380
Asalaam walaikum [Peace be with you]! How you doing?

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.020
So, pop-pop, I have some questions about maher. Why is that important?

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.500
What would the minimum be?

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:20.380
I don't know, that sounds like a lot, dad. I feel like I'm earning, so why would I ask for so much money?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.560
$10,000 is reasonable, in your opinion?

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.940
Used car. Okay, pops. Well, thanks for your advice.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:42.440
As I’m making decisions about our wedding, I now realize that it’s OK to switch things up.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.080
Culture evolves and our perspectives will, too. On our wedding day, Soheb and I

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.820
will be reinventing Indian traditions to fit our American lives — even if it doesn’t please the aunties.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.380
Oh, and back to that whole kissing thing …

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.460
Cool. So we're doing it?

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.120
—Sure.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.220
Yes! Really?

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.600
— Yeah. If you want to kiss at the wedding, we can kiss at the wedding.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.200
I do.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:08.260
Thanks for watching our video on Indian weddings.
