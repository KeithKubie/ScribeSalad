Speaker 1:          00:00          Doco. I struggle with receiving banter from other guys. Banter. Okay. I'm naturally a sensitive gut which lends myself to take normal smack talk from other guys. Personally, I'm trying to get after it. I wake up early, I work out, eat healthy, work pretty hard, but still seem to have some deep seeded insecurities which flare up when guys give me stick, I have some bloody good mates.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23          Yeah, and I want to get to the point where I can take smack talk for what it is and even give a bit of stick back to the guys.

Speaker 3:          00:32          What can I do to help this? Here's one thing that you can try to get into your brain and this is one of those things that's hard to get into your brain and it's even harder to actually get it in your brain and functionally use this thought. Here's the thought. The more, okay? If you're, if you're paranoid about something, if you're insecure about something, the more you let things bother you, the more insecure you will appear. Well, let me say that again. The more you let things bother you, the more insecure you are going to appear. And the worst, whatever that thing that you're worried about, whatever that thing that makes you feel insecure, the worst it's going to appear to everyone else. So if you got a big nose and you're embarrassed because you got a big nose and every time someone says something about your big nose, you get mad and you get offended, that big nose it be even bigger. So think about that. If there's something that bothers you and you let it be known,

Speaker 2:          01:48          yeah

Speaker 3:          01:48          and you let it bother you, divorce, it's going to get. And also think about this. Another thing that will help, these are things I'm trying to help help uh, sort of smooth the edges of insecurity. Here's another one. People, even though you think evenly think they are, and it's kind of egotistical to think this, but we all do it. People aren't sitting around and thinking about you and your weaknesses. They're not sitting around and thinking about you and your weaknesses. They're not like, that's your ego telling you that. So don't sit there and think everyone is looking at your big nose all the time. They don't care. They've got their other problems. They've got their own life going on. You don't care about your big nose wheel. You know what makes them care about it? When they know, if they say something you, it bothers you.

Speaker 3:          02:36          That's the first thing you're gonna think when they see you again. Here comes the good time. Some fun. Yeah. And here's another thing. If you want to kind of mitigate that man, do want to do it. Mark doesn't weigh the warrior kid when Uncle Jake says, hey, if you're getting made fun of is in way the word could call them plate face. Yeah. Saint Marco, you got to route this guy. Nathan James had Telemaco. You've got round face. You look like plate calls him plate face. That's his insult. As insults him all the time. And it bothers him cause he's looking in the mirror going, right, I do. I look like a plane. Let it bother him. And Uncle Jake says, hey, go, go make fun of yourself. And he finally gets a chance. He does. Uh, they're, you know, a class and they have to do a self portrait and he draws himself as a plate, a plate face.

Speaker 3:          03:20          And when the kid that's been making fun of it sees and he laughs and then guess what doesn't make fun of him anymore about it because he realizes it doesn't bother and they kind of bond a little bit. Then they kind of modeled what he's going for in this question. That is, yeah. Yeah. So you got, um, and it's, it's this what, that's why I said it's hard to do this because when you're insecure about your big nose or you're insecure about your big ears or whenever and you let people know that, or B, you just think it's in your brain. You think if you say something, let's get even more so they won't get worse. It might get worse for an uptick for a second, right? It might, you make fun of yourself, you know, people like, oh yeah, that's right. I didn't notice that you do it.

Speaker 3:          03:58          Then it'll kind of, no one really cares. And that's why in the teams and the teams, you never let anyone know that something bothers you or if they know it bothers you, you're going to hear about it forever. That's just going to be how, it's just the way it's going to be. And what that means. The polar opposite of that or the flip side of that is it's not fun to harass some, it's not fun to harass someone about something that doesn't bother them. It's not even fun. Right. It's not fun. Why would you harass them? One when they don't get it, when you don't even get a rise out of him, this is not fun. You just leave that thing that you look for something else. Yeah. So poke a little fun at yourself. These guys are going to back off because they're bored.

Speaker 3:          04:40          If you show no reaction and like you said that that kind of self deprecating humor will formed a little bond. Yeah. You can give a little stick back to the guys. If you start giving stick. The guys be ready to take it back though. Yeah, they're going to escalate. Yeah. And that's just so, I mean, I grew up with two brothers. Oh one twin brother. And that's like a, like that's literally the foundation of our relationship is just you tease the other guy about some lit everything. Like he can come in with a new shirt on that's a seal platoon. Yeah. Like, oh, we'll be like, oh no sure. No, you know like Beth, not even something to tease someone. They sell men's shirts where you bought that. Yeah, whatever. It's literally, it's so bad to the point where one, um, when, when I got with my current life, when we were, when we started dating or whatever, like it's just habit, you know?

Speaker 3:          05:34          And like even you like, same thing, you know, like you'll, you'll give me crap, I'll give you criminal, whatever. But it's so common that I do it to her. Oh yeah. Yeah. And you know, at first she's like, Oh, what? Like what, why are you teasing me so much like your, cause I knew where he'd been before we were together. I knew her for years actually. And he's like, Hey, I kind of annoying, you know, you'd like teases or whatever. And I did like reel it back yourself and yeah, because that, because that is so, so much of how guys do it, you know, to 100% and I've told this story before when I got, when I was going to college and I was around team guys all day and I started doing the team guy thing with my wife after she, she's like, Hey, I'm not in the teams so you can be quiet now.

Speaker 3:          06:18          And I was like, wow, she's right. And I didn't even realize it cause that's just, you know, all day long you show up, you show up in the platoon space and his verbal sparring. As soon as you walk through the door, somebody is going to say something, they're going to bring it. And what's interesting is Holly, how he's like, I want to get to the point where, you know, he can say back to her with things, I would agree with this. I'll probably even hundred 10% which is hard to agree 100% but I feel this way probably stronger than him. Like you ever been around someone who like you just can't really joke around with like, I'm not, I'm not the kind guy who all tease someone and try to like to make them, you know, especially if I don't know him good or whatever. But um, but if you're around someone who like, can't really take it, you can't joke around with them.

Speaker 3:          06:59          It's like, man, I don't want that guy to be there, man. I wish he just wasn't, you know, I'm not mad at him, but I just, I don't want to hang around with that guy. You don't want to be that guy. So even if like, like, especially at first, like let's say, okay, I'm, I'm this guy right here. The worst is someone that can dish it out but can't take it. Yeah. But what do you mean? Yeah, that is the worst. It's, I, I wouldn't, the only reason I wouldn't say he's the worst is what's worse than that. If he's dishing it out and he can't take it, it's kind of you get a pay off of teasing the guy. I'm just saying it lists that he doesn't do shit up. Let's say he's just a guy, you just can't joke around with it. It's like man, you're making me uncomfortable kind of thing, you know.

Speaker 3:          07:33          But if this guy cause you to your point, if it's yeah, if the load is annoying when people can't take it and you make a joke and they get all fired up and then they're like actually mad, right? Yeah, that's, that's what, that's how you end up with people that aren't really your friends. Maybe your friends. Exactly. Right. So, but yes. Yes. So you get there men. I say get there and at first just, and you kind of made it really clear to me how, you know when you make a change or something, it's not going to whoop boom, you're off to the races with the change going full speed. You know, what'd he say? Low drag. When weight load hospital, it's not going to be like they're ready for, especially with this kind of stuff. If you, if you already know you're insecure. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          08:11          Which is a big step ahead, by the way. Some people do it or I'm not an insecure, and meanwhile they're, he's curating it. They know it, but they just don't admit it. Yeah. So this guy, he knows so, but you're going to feel it, man, when they call you big, you know, whatever they're calling you, whatever, you're going to sort of feel it on the inside still, but just don't behave, you know, in a way, just be like, Oh, I dunno. I don't know what to do. There's plenty of things to do, but know, I mean, you do want to get their hundred percent check.
