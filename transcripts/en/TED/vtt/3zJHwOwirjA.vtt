00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.538
When I was in high school
at the age of 17 --

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:19.245
I graduated from high school
in Decatur, Georgia,

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.494
as valedictorian of my high school --

00:00:21.952 --> 00:00:23.446
I was very proud of myself.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.783
I was from a low-income community,
I had grown up in Mississippi,

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:28.635
we'd moved from Mississippi to Georgia

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:34.445
so my parents could pursue their degrees
as United Methodist ministers.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.112
We were poor, but they didn't think
we were poor enough,

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.112
so they were going for permanent poverty.

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:40.403
(Laughter)

00:00:40.427 --> 00:00:42.363
And so, while they studied at Emory,

00:00:42.387 --> 00:00:45.521
I studied at Avondale,
and I became valedictorian.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.239
Well, one of the joys of being
valedictorian in the state of Georgia

00:00:49.263 --> 00:00:52.330
is that you get invited
to meet the governor of Georgia.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.320
I was mildly interested in meeting him.

00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:57.672
It was kind of cool.

00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:01.205
I was more intrigued by the fact
that he lived in a mansion,

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.025
because I watched a lot
of "General Hospital" and "Dynasty"

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.206
as a child.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.880
(Laughter)

00:01:06.904 --> 00:01:10.934
And so I got up that morning,
ready to go to visit the governor.

00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.156
My mom and my dad,
who were also invited, got up,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.442
and we went outside.

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:17.331
But we didn't get in our car.

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:20.607
And in the south,
a car is a necessary thing.

00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:23.974
We don't have a lot of public transit,
there aren't a lot of options.

00:01:23.998 --> 00:01:26.331
But if you're lucky enough
to live in a community

00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:27.657
where you don't have a car,

00:01:27.681 --> 00:01:29.807
the only option is public transit.

00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:31.488
And that's what we had to take.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:33.815
And so we got on the bus.

00:01:33.839 --> 00:01:37.260
And we took the bus from Decatur
all the way to Buckhead,

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:41.680
where the Governor's Mansion sat
on this really beautiful acreage of land,

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:44.717
with these long black gates
that ran the length of the property.

00:01:45.101 --> 00:01:46.697
We get to the Governor's Mansion,

00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:49.688
we pull the little lever
that lets them know this is our stop,

00:01:49.712 --> 00:01:50.887
we get off the bus,

00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.585
my mom, my dad and I,
we walk across the street.

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.728
We walk up the driveway,
because there are cars coming up,

00:01:56.752 --> 00:01:59.741
cars bringing in students
from all across the state of Georgia.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:01.374
So we're walking along the side.

00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:03.476
And as we walk single file along the side,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.137
my mom and dad sandwiching me to make sure
I don't get hit by one of the cars

00:02:07.161 --> 00:02:08.970
bringing in the other valedictorians,

00:02:08.994 --> 00:02:10.843
we approach the guard gate.

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:13.259
When we get to the guard gate,
the guard comes out.

00:02:13.283 --> 00:02:16.153
He looks at me,
and he looks at my parents,

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:19.195
and he says, "You don't belong here,
this is a private event."

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.751
My dad says, "No, this is my daughter,
Stacey. She's one of the valedictorians."

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.276
But the guard doesn't look
at the checklist that's in his hands.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.236
He doesn't ask my mom for the invitation

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.800
that's at the bottom
of her very voluminous purse.

00:02:32.228 --> 00:02:34.617
Instead, he looks
over our shoulder at the bus,

00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:38.722
because in his mind, the bus is telling
him a story about who should be there.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.656
And the fact that we were too poor
to have our own car --

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.037
that was a story he told himself.

00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:47.323
And he may have seen
something in my skin color,

00:02:47.347 --> 00:02:49.268
he may have seen something in my attire;

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:51.220
I don't know what went through his mind.

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:53.742
But his conclusion was
to look at me again,

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:55.357
and with a look of disdain, say,

00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:58.815
"I told you, this is a private event.
You don't belong here."

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:02.587
Now, my parents were studying to become
United Methodist ministers,

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:04.627
but they were not pastors yet.

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:07.016
(Laughter)

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.024
And so they proceeded
to engage this gentleman

00:03:10.048 --> 00:03:12.996
in a very robust discussion
of his decision-making skills.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.381
(Laughter)

00:03:14.405 --> 00:03:15.842
My father may have mentioned

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:18.564
that he was going to spend eternity
in a very fiery place

00:03:18.588 --> 00:03:20.770
if he didn't find my name
on that checklist.

00:03:21.215 --> 00:03:23.930
And indeed, the man checks
the checklist eventually,

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.276
and he found my name,
and he let us inside.

00:03:26.927 --> 00:03:29.511
But I don't remember meeting
the governor of Georgia.

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:32.633
I don't recall meeting
my fellow valedictorians

00:03:32.657 --> 00:03:34.553
from 180 school districts.

00:03:34.577 --> 00:03:36.717
The only clear memory I have of that day

00:03:36.741 --> 00:03:39.879
was a man standing in front
of the most powerful place in Georgia,

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:42.903
looking at me and telling me
I don't belong.

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:47.101
And so I decided, 20-some-odd years later,

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.569
to be the person
who got to open the gates.

00:03:50.085 --> 00:03:53.600
(Cheers)

00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:57.532
(Applause)

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.783
Unfortunately, you may have read
the rest of the story.

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:03.544
It didn't quite work out that way.

00:04:03.568 --> 00:04:07.329
And now I'm tasked with figuring out:
How do I move forward?

00:04:07.953 --> 00:04:11.543
Because, you see, I didn't just want
to open the gates for young black women

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:14.350
who had been underestimated
and told they don't belong.

00:04:14.374 --> 00:04:18.363
I wanted to open those gates
for Latinas and for Asian Americans.

00:04:18.387 --> 00:04:22.496
I wanted to open those gates
for the undocumented and the documented.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.937
I wanted to open those gates
as an ally of the LGBTQ community.

00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:27.314
I wanted to open those gates

00:04:27.338 --> 00:04:30.855
for the families that have to call
themselves the victims of gun violence.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.649
I wanted to open those gates wide
for everyone in Georgia,

00:04:33.673 --> 00:04:36.035
because that is our state,
and this is our nation,

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:37.592
and we all belong here.

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:40.505
(Cheers)

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:44.068
(Applause)

00:04:46.006 --> 00:04:50.202
But what I recognized
is that the first try wasn't enough.

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:53.506
And my question became:
How do I move forward?

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.141
How do I get beyond the bitterness
and the sadness and the lethargy

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:03.220
and watching an inordinate amount
of television as I eat ice cream?

00:05:03.244 --> 00:05:04.776
(Laughter)

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.513
What do I do next?

00:05:07.498 --> 00:05:10.149
And I'm going to do what I've always done.

00:05:10.173 --> 00:05:13.324
I'm going to move forward,
because going backwards isn't an option

00:05:13.348 --> 00:05:15.045
and standing still is not enough.

00:05:15.673 --> 00:05:20.182
(Applause)

00:05:20.206 --> 00:05:23.373
You see, I began my race for governor

00:05:23.397 --> 00:05:26.593
by analyzing who I was
and what I wanted to be.

00:05:26.617 --> 00:05:29.696
And there are three questions
I ask myself about everything I do,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.315
whether it's running for office
or starting a business;

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.553
when I decided to start
the New Georgia Project

00:05:34.577 --> 00:05:35.918
to register people to vote;

00:05:35.942 --> 00:05:39.291
or when I started the latest action,
Fair Fight Georgia.

00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:42.032
No matter what I do,
I ask myself three questions:

00:05:42.056 --> 00:05:43.333
What do I want?

00:05:43.357 --> 00:05:45.025
Why do I want it?

00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:46.357
And how do I get it?

00:05:47.048 --> 00:05:49.570
And in this case, I know what I want.

00:05:49.594 --> 00:05:51.363
I want change.

00:05:51.387 --> 00:05:52.699
That is what I want.

00:05:52.723 --> 00:05:54.265
But the question is:

00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:57.042
What change do I want to see?

00:05:57.656 --> 00:06:00.325
And I know that the questions
I have to ask myself are:

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:03.307
One, am I honest about the scope
of my ambition?

00:06:03.744 --> 00:06:07.212
Because it's easy to figure out
that once you didn't get what you wanted,

00:06:07.236 --> 00:06:10.001
then maybe you should
have set your sights a little lower,

00:06:10.025 --> 00:06:12.973
but I'm here to tell you
to be aggressive about your ambition.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:15.506
Do not allow setbacks to set you back.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.048
(Applause)

00:06:21.022 --> 00:06:25.299
Number two, let yourself
understand your mistakes.

00:06:25.323 --> 00:06:27.482
But also understand their mistakes,

00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:29.053
because, as women in particular,

00:06:29.077 --> 00:06:31.329
we're taught that if something
doesn't work out,

00:06:31.353 --> 00:06:32.577
it's probably our fault.

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.998
And usually, there is something
we could do better,

00:06:35.022 --> 00:06:37.236
but we've been told
not to investigate too much

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.998
what the other side could have done.

00:06:39.022 --> 00:06:40.914
And this isn't partisan -- it's people.

00:06:40.938 --> 00:06:43.736
We're too often told
that our mistakes are ours alone,

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.893
but victory is a shared benefit.

00:06:46.331 --> 00:06:49.086
And so what I tell you to do
is understand your mistakes,

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.220
but understand the mistakes of others.

00:06:51.608 --> 00:06:53.599
And be clearheaded about it.

00:06:53.623 --> 00:06:57.179
And be honest with yourself
and honest with those who support you.

00:06:58.108 --> 00:07:00.346
But once you know what you want,

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.308
understand why you want it.

00:07:02.647 --> 00:07:05.794
And even though it feels good,
revenge is not a good reason.

00:07:05.818 --> 00:07:08.333
(Laughter)

00:07:08.357 --> 00:07:10.434
Instead, make sure you want it

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:13.921
because there's something
not that you should do,

00:07:13.945 --> 00:07:15.921
but something you must do.

00:07:16.383 --> 00:07:19.391
It has to be something
that doesn't allow you to sleep at night

00:07:19.415 --> 00:07:20.947
unless you're dreaming about it;

00:07:20.971 --> 00:07:24.431
something that wakes you up in the morning
and gets you excited about it;

00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:26.295
or something that makes you so angry,

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:28.867
you know you have to do
something about it.

00:07:28.891 --> 00:07:31.010
But know why you're doing it.

00:07:31.034 --> 00:07:33.423
And know why it must be done.

00:07:34.074 --> 00:07:37.153
You've listened to women
from across this world

00:07:37.177 --> 00:07:39.750
talk about why things have to happen.

00:07:39.774 --> 00:07:41.785
But figure out what the "why" is for you,

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:44.798
because jumping from
the "what" to the "do"

00:07:44.822 --> 00:07:47.353
is meaningless if you don't know why.

00:07:47.377 --> 00:07:50.180
Because when it gets hard,
when it gets tough,

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:52.363
when your friends walk away from you,

00:07:52.387 --> 00:07:54.522
when your supporters forget you,

00:07:54.546 --> 00:07:57.156
when you don't win your first race --

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.915
if you don't know why,
you can't try again.

00:08:00.363 --> 00:08:02.403
So, first know what you want.

00:08:02.427 --> 00:08:04.450
Second, know why you want it,

00:08:04.474 --> 00:08:06.831
but third, know how
you're going to get it done.

00:08:07.323 --> 00:08:09.601
I faced a few obstacles in this race.

00:08:09.625 --> 00:08:11.569
(Laughter)

00:08:11.593 --> 00:08:12.743
Just a few.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:14.296
But in the pursuit,

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.533
I became the first black woman
to ever become the nominee for governor

00:08:18.557 --> 00:08:22.034
in the history of the United States
of America for a major party.

00:08:22.612 --> 00:08:26.617
(Cheers)

00:08:26.653 --> 00:08:30.643
(Applause)

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:33.458
But more importantly, in this process,

00:08:33.482 --> 00:08:37.744
we turned out 1.2 million
African American voters in Georgia.

00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:38.991
That is more voters

00:08:39.015 --> 00:08:42.934
than voted on the Democratic side
of the ticket in 2014.

00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:47.418
(Applause)

00:08:47.442 --> 00:08:49.966
Our campaign tripled the number of Latinos

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.775
who believed their voices mattered
in the state of Georgia.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:54.756
We tripled the number of Asian Americans

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.426
who stood up and said,
"This is our state, too."

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.275
Those are successes that tell me
how I can get it done.

00:09:01.299 --> 00:09:04.712
But they also let me understand
the obstacles aren't insurmountable.

00:09:04.736 --> 00:09:06.331
They're just a little high.

00:09:07.156 --> 00:09:08.719
But I also understand

00:09:08.743 --> 00:09:12.127
that there are three things
that always hold us hostage.

00:09:12.649 --> 00:09:14.947
The first is finances.

00:09:15.822 --> 00:09:18.442
Now, you may have heard,
I'm in a little bit of debt.

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.617
If you didn't hear about it,
you did not go outside.

00:09:21.641 --> 00:09:23.386
(Laughter)

00:09:23.712 --> 00:09:26.609
And finances are something
that holds us back so often,

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:30.433
our dreams are bounded
by how much we have in resources.

00:09:30.822 --> 00:09:32.172
But we hear again and again

00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:36.253
the stories of those who overcome
those resource challenges.

00:09:36.744 --> 00:09:39.530
But you can't overcome
something you don't talk about.

00:09:39.554 --> 00:09:43.170
And that's why I didn't allow them
to debt-shame me in my campaign.

00:09:43.569 --> 00:09:47.839
I didn't allow anyone to tell me
that my lack of opportunity

00:09:47.863 --> 00:09:50.117
was a reason to disqualify
me from running.

00:09:50.141 --> 00:09:52.903
And believe me, people tried
to tell me I shouldn't run.

00:09:52.927 --> 00:09:54.784
Friends told me not to run.

00:09:54.808 --> 00:09:56.587
Allies told me not to run.

00:09:56.899 --> 00:09:59.780
"USA Today" mentioned
maybe I shouldn't run.

00:09:59.804 --> 00:10:01.026
(Laughter)

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:02.337
But no matter who it was,

00:10:02.361 --> 00:10:07.104
I understood that finances are often
a reason we don't let ourselves dream.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:10.570
I can't say that you will always
overcome those obstacles,

00:10:10.594 --> 00:10:13.694
but I will tell you,
you will be damned if you do not try.

00:10:14.482 --> 00:10:19.591
(Applause)

00:10:19.615 --> 00:10:21.488
The second is fear.

00:10:21.512 --> 00:10:22.846
And fear is real.

00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:24.725
It is paralyzing.

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:25.982
It is terrifying.

00:10:26.433 --> 00:10:28.433
But it can also be energizing,

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:31.028
because once you know
what you're afraid of,

00:10:31.052 --> 00:10:33.379
you can figure out how to get around it.

00:10:33.403 --> 00:10:35.069
And the third is fatigue.

00:10:35.942 --> 00:10:38.709
Sometimes you just get tired of trying.

00:10:39.314 --> 00:10:43.145
You get tired of reading
about processes and politics

00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:46.218
and the things that stop you
from getting where you want to be.

00:10:46.774 --> 00:10:51.416
Sometimes, fatigue means that we accept
position instead of power.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.432
We let someone give us a title
as a consolation prize,

00:10:54.456 --> 00:10:57.717
rather than realizing we know what we want
and we're going to get it,

00:10:57.741 --> 00:10:58.899
even if we're tired.

00:10:58.923 --> 00:11:00.622
That's why God created naps.

00:11:00.646 --> 00:11:02.808
(Laughter)

00:11:03.472 --> 00:11:05.829
But we also learn in those moments

00:11:05.853 --> 00:11:10.846
that fatigue is an opportunity
to evaluate how much we want it.

00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:14.196
Because if you are beaten down,

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.950
if you have worked as hard as you can,

00:11:16.974 --> 00:11:19.689
if you have done everything
you said you should,

00:11:19.713 --> 00:11:21.286
and it still doesn't work out,

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:23.898
fatigue can sap you of your energy.

00:11:24.863 --> 00:11:27.303
But that's why you go back
to the "why" of it.

00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:31.446
Because I know we have to have women
who speak for the voiceless.

00:11:32.113 --> 00:11:34.478
I know we have to have people
of good conscience

00:11:34.502 --> 00:11:36.459
who stand up against oppression.

00:11:36.938 --> 00:11:38.684
I know we have to have people

00:11:38.708 --> 00:11:42.033
who understand that social justice
belongs to us all.

00:11:42.423 --> 00:11:44.400
And that wakes me up every morning,

00:11:44.424 --> 00:11:46.231
and that makes me fight even harder.

00:11:46.931 --> 00:11:51.200
Because I am moving forward,
knowing what is in my past.

00:11:51.224 --> 00:11:53.395
I know the obstacles they have for me.

00:11:53.419 --> 00:11:55.029
I know what they're going to do,

00:11:55.053 --> 00:11:59.022
and I'm fairly certain they're energizing
and creating new obstacles now.

00:11:59.046 --> 00:12:01.482
But they've got four years
to figure it out.

00:12:01.506 --> 00:12:02.974
(Laughter)

00:12:02.998 --> 00:12:08.044
(Applause)

00:12:08.068 --> 00:12:09.218
Maybe two.

00:12:09.568 --> 00:12:12.039
(Cheers)

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:14.879
(Applause)

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:16.433
But here's my point:

00:12:16.887 --> 00:12:19.799
I know what I want, and that is justice.

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:21.299
I know why I want it,

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:24.981
because poverty is immoral,
and it is a stain on our nation.

00:12:25.005 --> 00:12:26.736
And I know how I'm going to get it:

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.974
by moving forward every single day.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.220
Thank you so much.

00:12:30.244 --> 00:12:32.704
(Cheers)

00:12:32.728 --> 00:12:36.706
(Applause)
