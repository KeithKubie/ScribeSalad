really important in the in that sense

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040
really important in the in that sense
 

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:55.940
really important in the in that sense
being able to just click and being able

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:55.950
being able to just click and being able
 

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.790
being able to just click and being able
to play the game that's going to be

00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800
to play the game that's going to be
 

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.480
to play the game that's going to be
really important it removes the friction

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:01.490
really important it removes the friction
 

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:06.010
really important it removes the friction
of the installation which is where

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:06.020
of the installation which is where
 

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.350
of the installation which is where
people actually are eager to play the

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360
people actually are eager to play the
 

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.750
people actually are eager to play the
game and they probably need to wait 10

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760
game and they probably need to wait 10
 

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.010
game and they probably need to wait 10
15 20 seconds to download it and being

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020
15 20 seconds to download it and being
 

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.650
15 20 seconds to download it and being
able to take advantage of that eagerness

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.660
able to take advantage of that eagerness
 

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.100
able to take advantage of that eagerness
and I think that's going to be really

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.110
and I think that's going to be really
 

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:25.579
and I think that's going to be really
important thank you so from our side we

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:25.589
important thank you so from our side we
 

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.610
important thank you so from our side we
actually see a lot of users like a high

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620
actually see a lot of users like a high
 

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.320

intent to install and then we've

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:30.330
intent to install and then we've
 

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.030
intent to install and then we've
actually seen a lot of users who played

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.040
actually seen a lot of users who played
 

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.860

Bob which three are candy crush saga so
 

00:17:36.419 --> 00:17:38.510
Bob which three are candy crush saga so
that's what we're really excited about

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:38.520
that's what we're really excited about
 

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.950
that's what we're really excited about
and then I think if there's different

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960
and then I think if there's different
 

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.990
and then I think if there's different
ways to continue to optimize the funnel

ways to continue to optimize the funnel
 

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.320
ways to continue to optimize the funnel
from you know instant to actually

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:45.330
from you know instant to actually
 

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.990
from you know instant to actually
installing the game yeah so we've been

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000
installing the game yeah so we've been
 

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.700
installing the game yeah so we've been
really encouraged by the level of

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:49.710
really encouraged by the level of
 

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.350
really encouraged by the level of
engagement we've seen with the try now

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360
engagement we've seen with the try now
 

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.960

great instant experience I think for us
it was really important you know you're

00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:46.049
it was really important you know you're
 

00:18:46.049 --> 00:18:47.570
it was really important you know you're
pretty much playing instantly and to

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:47.580
pretty much playing instantly and to
 

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.549
pretty much playing instantly and to
make sure that the player feels like

as you shown earlier really exciting
 

00:18:55.289 --> 00:18:56.659
as you shown earlier really exciting
levels so we wanted to make sure we had

00:18:56.659 --> 00:18:56.669
levels so we wanted to make sure we had
 

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:58.399
levels so we wanted to make sure we had
really great exciting and engaging

00:18:58.399 --> 00:18:58.409
really great exciting and engaging
 

00:18:58.409 --> 00:19:01.369
really great exciting and engaging
levels for the user experience so that

00:19:01.369 --> 00:19:01.379
levels for the user experience so that
 

00:19:01.379 --> 00:19:02.899
levels for the user experience so that
was for us really important that's why

00:19:02.899 --> 00:19:02.909
was for us really important that's why
 

00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:04.820
was for us really important that's why
we've selected certain levels as you can

boosters certain features to make sure
it's really different for every level

00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559
it's really different for every level

Play instant experience yeah like you
rephrase the restate the question yet so

00:19:19.879 --> 00:19:19.889
rephrase the restate the question yet so
 

00:19:19.889 --> 00:19:22.100
rephrase the restate the question yet so
what factors make for a great instant

what factors make for a great instant
 

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.879
what factors make for a great instant
expiry yes

00:19:22.879 --> 00:19:22.889

so yeah certainly you know speed is

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:28.470
so yeah certainly you know speed is
 

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.049
so yeah certainly you know speed is
important so getting people immediately

00:19:30.049 --> 00:19:30.059
important so getting people immediately
 

00:19:30.059 --> 00:19:31.489
important so getting people immediately
into the core experience I think

00:19:31.489 --> 00:19:31.499
into the core experience I think
 

00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:34.460
into the core experience I think
probably goes without saying but I also

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:34.470
probably goes without saying but I also
 

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:36.769
probably goes without saying but I also
think it's important to redesign for the

00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:36.779
think it's important to redesign for the
 

00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:37.489
think it's important to redesign for the
use case

00:19:37.489 --> 00:19:37.499
use case
 

00:19:37.499 --> 00:19:40.159
use case
so at Zynga with optimization of

00:19:40.159 --> 00:19:40.169
so at Zynga with optimization of
 

00:19:40.169 --> 00:19:42.080
so at Zynga with optimization of
installs being sort of our primary

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:42.090
installs being sort of our primary
 

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:43.820
installs being sort of our primary
driver we're really trying to get an

00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:43.830
driver we're really trying to get an
 

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.249
driver we're really trying to get an
experience that was concise and short so

00:19:46.249 --> 00:19:46.259
experience that was concise and short so
 

00:19:46.259 --> 00:19:48.109
experience that was concise and short so
that it ended in a clear opportunity to

00:19:48.109 --> 00:19:48.119
that it ended in a clear opportunity to
 

00:19:48.119 --> 00:19:50.720
that it ended in a clear opportunity to
expose a user to installing the full

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:50.730
expose a user to installing the full
 

00:19:50.730 --> 00:19:52.970
expose a user to installing the full
experience I think if you were you know

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:52.980
experience I think if you were you know
 

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.100
experience I think if you were you know
doing something like a social invite or

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:55.110
doing something like a social invite or
 

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.109
doing something like a social invite or
using it for cross promotion or user

00:19:57.109 --> 00:19:57.119
using it for cross promotion or user
 

00:19:57.119 --> 00:19:59.239
using it for cross promotion or user
acquisition or different channels you

00:19:59.239 --> 00:19:59.249
acquisition or different channels you
 

00:19:59.249 --> 00:20:00.950
acquisition or different channels you
might have to think about the design for

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960
might have to think about the design for
 

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.629
might have to think about the design for
that use case specifically so I think

00:20:02.629 --> 00:20:02.639
that use case specifically so I think
 

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:05.779
that use case specifically so I think
use case is very important to understand

00:20:05.779 --> 00:20:05.789
use case is very important to understand
 

00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:08.060
use case is very important to understand
and exactly what KPI you're trying to

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:08.070
and exactly what KPI you're trying to
 

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.519
and exactly what KPI you're trying to
drive when building the experience this

00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:10.529
drive when building the experience this
 

00:20:10.529 --> 00:20:11.600
drive when building the experience this
is probably not necessarily one size

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:11.610
is probably not necessarily one size
 

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:17.029
is probably not necessarily one size
fits all fits all answer gotcha so well

00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039
fits all fits all answer gotcha so well
 

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:20.720
fits all fits all answer gotcha so well
for us what made sense was to assemble

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:20.730
for us what made sense was to assemble
 

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.330
for us what made sense was to assemble
before build like the first part of the

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340
before build like the first part of the
 

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.050

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:33.340
basically because we we know it's strong
so I wanted to share that and having the

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:33.350
so I wanted to share that and having the
 

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.740
so I wanted to share that and having the
possibility to then move to the full app

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:35.750
possibility to then move to the full app
 

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.890
possibility to then move to the full app
and and be able to carry over that

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:38.900
and and be able to carry over that
 

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.910
and and be able to carry over that
progress that that was the the use case

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:42.920
progress that that was the the use case
 

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:50.190
progress that that was the the use case
that ways but we see in the future

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200
 

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.870
another possibilities of making probably

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880
another possibilities of making probably
 

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.220
another possibilities of making probably
in another games that we do in some city

00:20:59.220 --> 00:20:59.230
in another games that we do in some city
 

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.920
in another games that we do in some city
like just in different use cases and

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:01.930
like just in different use cases and
 

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:06.160
like just in different use cases and
optimize those for for each game so I

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.170
optimize those for for each game so I
 

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.040
optimize those for for each game so I
have a follow up for you so building a

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:09.050
have a follow up for you so building a
 

00:21:09.050 --> 00:21:10.810
have a follow up for you so building a
game that meets the 10 megabyte size

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:10.820
game that meets the 10 megabyte size
 

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.210
game that meets the 10 megabyte size
limit sounds probably for many of you

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:13.220
limit sounds probably for many of you
 

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.190
limit sounds probably for many of you
like to be pretty intimidating but all

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200
like to be pretty intimidating but all
 

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.110
like to be pretty intimidating but all
of you have successfully you know done

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120
of you have successfully you know done
 

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.420
of you have successfully you know done
something like that and what my question

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:19.430
something like that and what my question
 

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.780
something like that and what my question
is for you is as you as you built out

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:22.790
is for you is as you as you built out
 

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.470
is for you is as you as you built out
the instant experience for for Panna pop

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480
the instant experience for for Panna pop
 

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.300
the instant experience for for Panna pop
what are the kinds of things you learned

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:28.310
what are the kinds of things you learned
 

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:30.460
what are the kinds of things you learned
about you know both that process as well

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:30.470
about you know both that process as well
 

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:32.350
about you know both that process as well
as maybe things that you learned about

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360
as maybe things that you learned about
 

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.920
as maybe things that you learned about
the the installed apps infrastructure

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:35.930
the the installed apps infrastructure
 

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:39.520
the the installed apps infrastructure
and so forth so our first idea was to

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:39.530
and so forth so our first idea was to
 

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:44.980
and so forth so our first idea was to
make the ascent 20 levels long being

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:44.990
make the ascent 20 levels long being
 

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:48.490
make the ascent 20 levels long being
able to go back and forth to them up and

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:48.500
able to go back and forth to them up and
 

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.320
able to go back and forth to them up and
then go to the game and then go to the

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:50.330
then go to the game and then go to the
 

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:56.800
then go to the game and then go to the
map again but again we realized that we

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:56.810
map again but again we realized that we
 

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:00.730
map again but again we realized that we
weren't going to achieve the size limit

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:00.740
weren't going to achieve the size limit
 

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:05.320
weren't going to achieve the size limit
goal that we had so at that point we get

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:05.330
goal that we had so at that point we get
 

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.660
goal that we had so at that point we get
together with the team and basically

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:07.670
together with the team and basically
 

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.870
together with the team and basically
decided to only do gameplay and do the

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880
decided to only do gameplay and do the
 

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:14.890
decided to only do gameplay and do the
first 10 levels so that enabled us to

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:14.900
first 10 levels so that enabled us to
 

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:18.580
first 10 levels so that enabled us to
remove a lot of textures scenes that we

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:18.590
remove a lot of textures scenes that we
 

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:23.980
remove a lot of textures scenes that we
weren't using localization strings that

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:23.990
weren't using localization strings that
 

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:29.490
weren't using localization strings that
needs to be stripped off and

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:29.500
needs to be stripped off and
 

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.600
needs to be stripped off and
what we learn is that every little thing

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:33.610
what we learn is that every little thing
 

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:37.230
what we learn is that every little thing
that you can can remove from from the

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240
that you can can remove from from the
 

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.690
that you can can remove from from the
app remove it because it's going to be

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:39.700
app remove it because it's going to be
 

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.390
app remove it because it's going to be
important

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400
important
 

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.400
important
remove the plugins remove the local

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:44.410
remove the plugins remove the local
 

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.700
remove the plugins remove the local
essentials that children use even the

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:47.710
essentials that children use even the
 

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.840
essentials that children use even the
the smallest prefab it's important to

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:51.850
the smallest prefab it's important to
 

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.630
the smallest prefab it's important to
take it out so it's all cut out yeah

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640
take it out so it's all cut out yeah
 

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.300
take it out so it's all cut out yeah
yeah so take away everything we try to

00:22:59.300 --> 00:22:59.310
yeah so take away everything we try to
 

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.480
yeah so take away everything we try to
do it in a way where we could build it

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:03.490
do it in a way where we could build it
 

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:08.250
do it in a way where we could build it
on top of the regular game so we benefit

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:08.260
on top of the regular game so we benefit
 

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:10.860
on top of the regular game so we benefit
from changing from the changes that we

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:10.870
from changing from the changes that we
 

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:15.480
from changing from the changes that we
made in in the full app so I would also

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:15.490
made in in the full app so I would also
 

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:20.100
made in in the full app so I would also
recommend that if possible so you're

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:20.110
recommend that if possible so you're
 

00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:22.110
recommend that if possible so you're
saying that it through that process you

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120
saying that it through that process you
 

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.270
saying that it through that process you
were able to make optimizations that

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:24.280
were able to make optimizations that
 

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.220
were able to make optimizations that
then impacted your full game is that

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:26.230
then impacted your full game is that
 

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:31.050
then impacted your full game is that
right yes in fact there were two things

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:31.060
right yes in fact there were two things
 

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.820
right yes in fact there were two things
that we benefit from building the

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:32.830
that we benefit from building the
 

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:38.910
that we benefit from building the
instant up one was we improved the way

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:38.920
instant up one was we improved the way
 

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:43.820
instant up one was we improved the way
we were making bone animations and that

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:43.830
we were making bone animations and that
 

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.230
we were making bone animations and that
that made the application of run

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240
that made the application of run
 

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.780
that made the application of run
smoother and with a reduced memory

00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:48.790
smoother and with a reduced memory
 

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:49.970
smoother and with a reduced memory
footprint

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:49.980
footprint
 

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.820
footprint
so we basically in the full app we

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:53.830
so we basically in the full app we
 

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:57.420
so we basically in the full app we
gained memory and we gained performance

00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:57.430
gained memory and we gained performance
 

00:23:57.430 --> 00:24:01.920
gained memory and we gained performance
so it was truly beneficial it's awesome

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:01.930
so it was truly beneficial it's awesome
 

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:04.620
so it was truly beneficial it's awesome
and how what do you talk about what

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:04.630
and how what do you talk about what
 

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.150
and how what do you talk about what
about your experience he converted you

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:06.160
about your experience he converted you
 

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.010
about your experience he converted you
know and you know at least a couple of

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:08.020
know and you know at least a couple of
 

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:10.050
know and you know at least a couple of
games that I've had an opportunity to

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:10.060
games that I've had an opportunity to
 

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.700
games that I've had an opportunity to
play and what was your experience like

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:11.710
play and what was your experience like
 

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.380
play and what was your experience like
and how did you do that yeah so

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:13.390
and how did you do that yeah so
 

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:14.700
and how did you do that yeah so
fortunately in the case of single

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:14.710
fortunately in the case of single
 

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.100
fortunately in the case of single
solitaire the full app itself was just

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.110
solitaire the full app itself was just
 

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.890
solitaire the full app itself was just
around a 10 megabyte mark so we I didn't

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:19.900
around a 10 megabyte mark so we I didn't
 

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.540
around a 10 megabyte mark so we I didn't
have much difficulty getting in under

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:21.550
have much difficulty getting in under
 

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.180
have much difficulty getting in under
the threshold in that case in the case

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:24.190
the threshold in that case in the case
 

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.800
the threshold in that case in the case
of words with friends too

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:25.810
of words with friends too
 

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.380
of words with friends too
I think it was and this goes back to

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:28.390
I think it was and this goes back to
 

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:30.510
I think it was and this goes back to
sort of like the design piece of it as

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:30.520
sort of like the design piece of it as
 

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.280
sort of like the design piece of it as
well was really just having a clear

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:32.290
well was really just having a clear
 

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:33.780
well was really just having a clear
focus of what we wanted to bring to

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:33.790
focus of what we wanted to bring to
 

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.120
focus of what we wanted to bring to
consumers and so for us we launched

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:36.130
consumers and so for us we launched
 

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.680
consumers and so for us we launched
words of friends to about six months ago

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:37.690
words of friends to about six months ago
 

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.360
words of friends to about six months ago
one of the new features we launched with

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:39.370
one of the new features we launched with
 

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.130
one of the new features we launched with
that was a feature called solo series

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:41.140
that was a feature called solo series
 

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.610
that was a feature called solo series
which allows user

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:42.620
which allows user
 

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.680
which allows user
to play against AI powered BOTS we

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:44.690
to play against AI powered BOTS we
 

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.480
to play against AI powered BOTS we
thought that was a really good match for

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:46.490
thought that was a really good match for
 

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.130
thought that was a really good match for
the instant experience so he focused

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:48.140
the instant experience so he focused
 

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.040
the instant experience so he focused
exclusively on bringing a subset of solo

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:51.050
exclusively on bringing a subset of solo
 

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.860
exclusively on bringing a subset of solo
series to the instant app by having that

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:53.870
series to the instant app by having that
 

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.080
series to the instant app by having that
clear focus we were able to remove a lot

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:56.090
clear focus we were able to remove a lot
 

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:57.580
clear focus we were able to remove a lot
of other stuff that was tangential

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:57.590
of other stuff that was tangential
 

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.440
of other stuff that was tangential
unrelated and so we could really reduce

00:24:59.440 --> 00:24:59.450
unrelated and so we could really reduce
 

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.540
unrelated and so we could really reduce
the app size and build a really clean

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:01.550
the app size and build a really clean
 

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.030
the app size and build a really clean
experience without a lot of the other I

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:04.040
experience without a lot of the other I
 

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.100
experience without a lot of the other I
won't call it fluff but aspects of the

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:06.110
won't call it fluff but aspects of the
 

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.700
won't call it fluff but aspects of the
app also so to synthesize that you're

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:09.710
app also so to synthesize that you're
 

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.620
app also so to synthesize that you're
saying that you know you can cut out

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:11.630
saying that you know you can cut out
 

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.120
saying that you know you can cut out
let's say lots of levels but the other

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:13.130
let's say lots of levels but the other
 

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:14.710
let's say lots of levels but the other
thing is to just focus on like one

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720
thing is to just focus on like one
 

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.680
thing is to just focus on like one
particular slice of the experience yeah

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:17.690
particular slice of the experience yeah
 

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:19.140
particular slice of the experience yeah
exactly

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:19.150
exactly
 

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:23.890
exactly
that was a good summary be thoughtful of

00:25:23.890 --> 00:25:23.900
that was a good summary be thoughtful of
 

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.350
that was a good summary be thoughtful of
you yeah so I think for us we just focus

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:26.360
you yeah so I think for us we just focus
 

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:28.720
you yeah so I think for us we just focus
a lot on the gameplay and then you know

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:28.730
a lot on the gameplay and then you know
 

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:30.640
a lot on the gameplay and then you know
we took out the saga map we don't have

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:30.650
we took out the saga map we don't have
 

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.440
we took out the saga map we don't have
any other features and a lot of our

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:32.450
any other features and a lot of our
 

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:33.850
any other features and a lot of our
games always have a narrative in the

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:33.860
games always have a narrative in the
 

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.470
games always have a narrative in the
beginning and if a2e so we obviously

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480
beginning and if a2e so we obviously
 

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.180
beginning and if a2e so we obviously
took everything else it was only just

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:37.190
took everything else it was only just
 

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.040
took everything else it was only just
focused on the gameplay that's what we

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:39.050
focused on the gameplay that's what we
 

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.500
focused on the gameplay that's what we
wanted to focus on makes a lot of sense

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:41.510
wanted to focus on makes a lot of sense
 

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.740
wanted to focus on makes a lot of sense
and you know we've heard similar things

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:44.750
and you know we've heard similar things
 

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.140
and you know we've heard similar things
from a lot of our other partners as well

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.150
from a lot of our other partners as well
 

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.630
from a lot of our other partners as well
you know that's either stripping out

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640
you know that's either stripping out
 

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.540
you know that's either stripping out
assets or choosing and select gameplay

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:52.550
assets or choosing and select gameplay
 

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.610
assets or choosing and select gameplay
but something's really good to get some

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:54.620
but something's really good to get some
 

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.810
but something's really good to get some
additional context from you up here so I

00:25:58.810 --> 00:25:58.820
additional context from you up here so I
 

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:00.280
additional context from you up here so I
wanted to particularly talk to you about

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:00.290
wanted to particularly talk to you about
 

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.470
wanted to particularly talk to you about
some of the challenges related to

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480
some of the challenges related to
 

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.049
some of the challenges related to
developing a instant experience in unity

00:26:05.049 --> 00:26:05.059
developing a instant experience in unity
 

00:26:05.059 --> 00:26:06.880
developing a instant experience in unity
and what are some of the things that you

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:06.890
and what are some of the things that you
 

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.190
and what are some of the things that you
you know ended up having to do and learn

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200
you know ended up having to do and learn
 

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.430
you know ended up having to do and learn
through that process well as you mention

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:12.440
through that process well as you mention
 

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.960
through that process well as you mention
before the the biggest challenge for us

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:13.970
before the the biggest challenge for us
 

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:21.340
before the the biggest challenge for us
was size right sorry so we we needed a

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:21.350
was size right sorry so we we needed a
 

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:23.919
was size right sorry so we we needed a
summation before we needed to change the

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:23.929
summation before we needed to change the
 

00:26:23.929 --> 00:26:28.500
summation before we needed to change the
way we were doing Dragonborn animations

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:28.510
way we were doing Dragonborn animations
 

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:32.400
way we were doing Dragonborn animations
because what we were using at the time

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:32.410
because what we were using at the time
 

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:36.220
because what we were using at the time
the device that was producing they were

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:36.230
the device that was producing they were
 

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.400
the device that was producing they were
bigger and they were also taking up a

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:39.410
bigger and they were also taking up a
 

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:46.780
bigger and they were also taking up a
lot of memory in the game and after that

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:46.790
lot of memory in the game and after that
 

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:52.150
lot of memory in the game and after that
we also needed to like refactor certain

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:52.160
we also needed to like refactor certain
 

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.360
we also needed to like refactor certain
point of certain parts of the code

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:55.370
point of certain parts of the code
 

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:59.320
point of certain parts of the code
to be able to only use the scene of the

00:26:59.320 --> 00:26:59.330
to be able to only use the scene of the
 

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.830
to be able to only use the scene of the
gameplay I think those were the two

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840
gameplay I think those were the two
 

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.570
gameplay I think those were the two
biggest challenges that we needed to

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:04.580
biggest challenges that we needed to
 

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.000
biggest challenges that we needed to
make but in the end we end up with a

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.010
make but in the end we end up with a
 

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:15.400
make but in the end we end up with a
more modular eyes application mm-hmm and

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:15.410
more modular eyes application mm-hmm and
 

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:19.240
more modular eyes application mm-hmm and
we were able to benefit from that in a

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:19.250
we were able to benefit from that in a
 

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.240
we were able to benefit from that in a
technical way also so it was a win-win

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:22.250
technical way also so it was a win-win
 

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:28.770
technical way also so it was a win-win
for us excellent and so looking forward

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:28.780
for us excellent and so looking forward
 

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.330
for us excellent and so looking forward
overall what kind of developments do you

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:31.340
overall what kind of developments do you
 

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.630
overall what kind of developments do you
see emerging in the instant gaming space

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640
see emerging in the instant gaming space
 

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.450
see emerging in the instant gaming space
in the coming years yes you could go as

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:37.460
in the coming years yes you could go as
 

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.150
in the coming years yes you could go as
far in the future as you would like but

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:39.160
far in the future as you would like but
 

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:41.890
far in the future as you would like but
love to hear your thoughts on how you

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:41.900
love to hear your thoughts on how you
 

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:48.460
love to hear your thoughts on how you
see the whole space evolving I think

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:48.470
see the whole space evolving I think
 

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:54.240
see the whole space evolving I think
that this is going to be like probably

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:54.250
that this is going to be like probably
 

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:58.720
that this is going to be like probably
the I would say the future of user

00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:58.730
the I would say the future of user
 

00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:05.190
the I would say the future of user
acquisition also the social part of

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200
acquisition also the social part of
 

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.870
acquisition also the social part of
being able to share a link and start

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:07.880
being able to share a link and start
 

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.040
being able to share a link and start
playing like right away that that's

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.050
playing like right away that that's
 

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.960
playing like right away that that's
probably going to be the future apps

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:13.970
probably going to be the future apps
 

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.870
probably going to be the future apps
that they're going to see and of course

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:16.880
that they're going to see and of course
 

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.630
that they're going to see and of course
we are going to benefit from them

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640
we are going to benefit from them
 

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:22.030
we are going to benefit from them
awesome I think as you mentioned

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:22.040
awesome I think as you mentioned
 

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.040
awesome I think as you mentioned
especially with new games coming so

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:24.050
especially with new games coming so
 

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.590
especially with new games coming so
there's also a way you know to also

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:26.600
there's also a way you know to also
 

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.600
there's also a way you know to also
fully leverage their pre-registration on

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:28.610
fully leverage their pre-registration on
 

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.070
fully leverage their pre-registration on
Google Play right so players can

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080
Google Play right so players can
 

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.799
Google Play right so players can
actually try the game before they

00:28:31.799 --> 00:28:31.809
actually try the game before they
 

00:28:31.809 --> 00:28:34.240
actually try the game before they
pre-register and actually install it so

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:34.250
pre-register and actually install it so
 

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:36.520
pre-register and actually install it so
I think that's another way and then you

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:36.530
I think that's another way and then you
 

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.100
I think that's another way and then you
know depending on where you are in you

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:39.110
know depending on where you are in you
 

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:40.900
know depending on where you are in you
know the stage for your game there could

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:40.910
know the stage for your game there could
 

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.650
know the stage for your game there could
be different instant games experiences

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:43.660
be different instant games experiences
 

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.180
be different instant games experiences
yeah I'm really excited to see what the

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:46.190
yeah I'm really excited to see what the
 

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:49.810
yeah I'm really excited to see what the
creativity of game developers will bring

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:49.820
creativity of game developers will bring
 

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.120
creativity of game developers will bring
to Google Instant and I think there will

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:52.130
to Google Instant and I think there will
 

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.700
to Google Instant and I think there will
be you know some breakout mechanic built

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:54.710
be you know some breakout mechanic built
 

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.640
be you know some breakout mechanic built
on top of Google instant Google Play

00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:57.650
on top of Google instant Google Play
 

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.700
on top of Google instant Google Play
instance that to date would would not be

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:00.710
instance that to date would would not be
 

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.640
instance that to date would would not be
possible and so I think once you think

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:03.650
possible and so I think once you think
 

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.110
possible and so I think once you think
about it from a design perspective and

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.120
about it from a design perspective and
 

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.000
about it from a design perspective and
what you can bring it once there's no

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:07.010
what you can bring it once there's no
 

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:08.509
what you can bring it once there's no
friction between you know

00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519
friction between you know
 

00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:10.190
friction between you know
a current user and a potential user or

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200
a current user and a potential user or
 

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.839
a current user and a potential user or
reactivated user I think we'll be able

00:29:11.839 --> 00:29:11.849
reactivated user I think we'll be able
 

00:29:11.849 --> 00:29:13.479
reactivated user I think we'll be able
to build new mechanics on top of that

00:29:13.479 --> 00:29:13.489
to build new mechanics on top of that
 

00:29:13.489 --> 00:29:17.810
to build new mechanics on top of that
that are our breakout I wanted to give

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820
that are our breakout I wanted to give
 

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.489
that are our breakout I wanted to give
you a big round of applause thank you

00:29:19.489 --> 00:29:19.499
you a big round of applause thank you
 

00:29:19.499 --> 00:29:22.820
you a big round of applause thank you
for being here and hope you all learned

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:22.830
for being here and hope you all learned
 

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:27.769
for being here and hope you all learned
a lot and I just wanted to close things

00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779
a lot and I just wanted to close things
 

00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:30.649
a lot and I just wanted to close things
out with a collection of links so that

00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659
out with a collection of links so that
 

00:29:30.659 --> 00:29:34.129
out with a collection of links so that
you can follow up and take action on the
