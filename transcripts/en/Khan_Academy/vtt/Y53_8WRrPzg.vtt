00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.490
- [Instructor] What we have here

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.560
are six different distributions.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.080
And what we're gonna do with this video

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.280
is think about how to classify them,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.300
or use the words people typically use

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.078
to classify distributions.

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:13.533
So, let's first look at this
distribution right over here,

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:16.030
it's the distribution of
the lengths of houseflies.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.410
So, someone went out there and measured

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.520
a bunch of houseflies.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.860
And then said, "Hey look,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.662
there's many houseflies that are between

00:00:21.662 --> 00:00:23.460
six tenths of a centimeter

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.720
and six and a half
tenths of a centimeter."

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.220
Looks like there's about
40 houseflies there.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.880
And then if you say between six
and a half and seven tenths,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.710
there's about 30 houseflies.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.820
And if you were to say
between five and a half tenths

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.390
and six tenths, it looks like
it's about the same amount.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.100
This type of distribution
is usually described

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.890
as being symmetric.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.630
Why is it called that?

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.990
Because if you were to draw a line

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.061
down the middle of this distribution,

00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:54.070
both sides look like mirror
images of each other.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.660
This one looks pretty exactly symmetric.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.410
But more typically when
you're collecting data,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.744
you'll see roughly
symmetric distributions.

00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:04.150
Now, here we have a distribution

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.560
that gives us the dates on pennies.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.527
So, someone went out there,

00:01:07.527 --> 00:01:09.190
observed a bunch of pennies,

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.450
looked at the dates on them.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.580
They saw many pennies,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.970
looks like a little bit
more than 55 pennies,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.950
had a date between 2010 and 2020.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.452
While very few pennies had a date

00:01:18.452 --> 00:01:21.224
older than 1980 on them.

00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:23.290
And this type of distribution

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.580
when you have a tail to the left,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.730
you can see it right over here,

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.646
you have a long tail to the left,

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:34.010
this is known as a
left-skewed distribution.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.550
Left-skewed.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.490
Now in future videos,
we'll come up with more

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.990
technical definitions of
what makes it left-skewed,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.345
but the way that you can recognize it is,

00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:47.150
you have the high points of
your distribution on the right,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.711
but then you have this long tail

00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:51.980
that skews it to the left.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.570
Now, the other side of a left-skewed,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.403
you might say, well,

00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:56.220
that would be a right-skewed distribution,

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.890
and that's exactly what
we see right over here.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.580
This is a distribution
of state representatives,

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.070
and as you can see, most of
the states in the United States

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.500
have between zero and ten representatives.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.040
It looks like it's a little over 35.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.400
None of them actually have zero,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.092
they all have at least one representative,

00:02:12.092 --> 00:02:14.380
but they would fall into this bucket,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.942
while very few have more
than 50 representatives.

00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:20.930
So, here where the bulk of our
distribution is to the left,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.320
where we have this tail
that skews us to the right,

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.320
this is known as a
right-skewed distribution.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.630
Now, if we look at this next distribution,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.463
what would this be?

00:02:32.463 --> 00:02:34.460
Pause this video and think about it.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.300
Well, this could be a
distribution of maybe

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.823
someone went around
the office and surveyed

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.550
how many cups of coffee each person drank,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.440
and if they found someone

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440
who drank one cup of coffee per day,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.590
maybe this would be them.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.930
If they found another person who drinks

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.268
one cup of coffee, that's them,

00:02:47.268 --> 00:02:49.150
then they found three people who drank

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.300
two cups of coffee.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.980
Well, this is a very similar situation

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.130
to what we saw on the dates on pennies.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.870
A large amount of our data
fell into this right bucket

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.060
of three cups of coffee,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.328
but then we have this tail to the left.

00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:04.894
So, this would be left-skewed.

00:03:04.894 --> 00:03:07.980
Now, these right two
distributions are interesting.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.230
One could argue that
this distribution here,

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.636
which is telling us the number of days

00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:14.540
that we had different high temperatures,

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.710
that this looks roughly symmetric,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.720
or actually even looks exactly symmetric.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.186
'Cause if you did that little exercise

00:03:20.186 --> 00:03:22.620
of drawing a dotted line down the middle,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.372
it looks like the two sides are
mirror images of each other.

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:28.088
Now, that would not be
technically incorrect.

00:03:28.088 --> 00:03:31.215
But typically when you
see these two peaks,

00:03:31.215 --> 00:03:34.670
this would typically be called
a bi-modal distribution.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.065
So, even though bi-modal distributions

00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:40.180
can sometimes be symmetric
or roughly symmetric,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.790
you wanna be more precise,

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.170
and here when you have these two peaks,

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.630
that's where the bi comes from.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.040
You'd call it bi-modal,
and this makes sense

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.570
because you have a lot of days

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.660
that are warm that might
happen during the summer

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.129
and you might have a lot
of days that are cold

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.870
that are happening during the winter.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.360
Now, this last distribution here,

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.470
the results from die rolls,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.143
one could argue as well that
this is roughly symmetric.

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:06.690
It's not exact, it's
not perfectly symmetric,

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.610
but when you look at this dotted line here

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.950
on the left and the right sides

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.593
it looks roughly symmetric.

00:04:11.593 --> 00:04:14.730
But a more exact classification here

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.400
would be that it looks
approximately uniform.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.750
So, rather than calling it
a symmetric distribution,

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.146
or a roughly symmetric distribution,

00:04:21.146 --> 00:04:23.410
most people would classify this

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.583
as an approximately uniform distribution.
