00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.480
- [Instructor] A sequence is
defined recursively as follows.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.410
So A sub N is equal to A sub N minus one

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.850
times A sub N minus two

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.220
or another way of thinking about it.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.410
the Nth term is equal to
the N minus oneth term

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.357
times the N minus two-th term

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.310
with the zeroth term

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.180
where A sub zero is equal to two

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.420
and A sub one is equal to three.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.430
Find A sub four.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.000
So let's write this down.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.400
They're telling us A
sub zero is equal to two

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.140
and they also tell us that
A sub one is equal to three.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.010
So they've kind of given
us our starting conditions

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.430
or our base conditions.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.820
Now we can think about what A sub two is.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.630
They tell us that A sub two is going to be

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.390
A sub two minus one,

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.180
so that's A sub one.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.180
It's A sub one times A sub two minus two.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.890
That's A sub zero.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.290
A times A sub zero.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.590
They already told us what A sub one

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.310
and A sub zero is.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.080
This thing is three,

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.220
this thing is two.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.846
It's three times two

00:01:03.846 --> 00:01:07.150
which is equal to six.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.150
Now let's move on to A sub three.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.120
A sub three is going to be the product

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.020
of the previous two terms.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.580
It's going to be A sub two,

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.120
three minus one is two,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.410
three minus two is one.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.330
So it's A sub two.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.490
A sub two times A sub one.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.470
Times A sub one.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.410
So it's equal to six times three

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.250
six times three.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.140
which is equal to 18.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.280
Which is equal to 18.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.580
And then finally A sub four,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.210
which I will do in a color that I'll use,

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.043
I'll do it in yellow.

00:01:44.043 --> 00:01:47.810
A sub four is going to
be equal to A sub three,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.978
A sub three times A sub two.

00:01:49.978 --> 00:01:52.720
So four minus one is three,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.030
four minus two is two.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.700
So times A sub two,

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.810
times A,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.960
and then a blue color.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.420
Times A sub two,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.820
which is equal to 18,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.860
18 times six.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.840
18 times six which is equal to,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.673
let's see,

00:02:16.673 --> 00:02:20.600
six times eight is 48 plus 60,

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.260
or six times 10 is 100,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.980
108.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.813
And we're done,

00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:27.593
A sub four is equal to 108.
