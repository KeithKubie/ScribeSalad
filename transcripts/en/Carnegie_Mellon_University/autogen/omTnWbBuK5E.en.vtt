00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460
the computer science department and as I
 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.610
the computer science department and as I
asked him what the expectations were of

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620
asked him what the expectations were of
 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.710
asked him what the expectations were of
me like any nice Chinese student now he

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720
me like any nice Chinese student now he
 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.240
me like any nice Chinese student now he
asks the professor

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250
asks the professor
 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.180
asks the professor
what is your expectation of me and Nico

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190
what is your expectation of me and Nico
 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.310
what is your expectation of me and Nico
said to me and I remember to the state

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320
said to me and I remember to the state
 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.020
said to me and I remember to the state
that I expect you to be the best you the

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030
that I expect you to be the best you the
 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.840
that I expect you to be the best you the
best in the world in the area of your

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850
best in the world in the area of your
 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.840
best in the world in the area of your
PhD thesis and that was really shocking

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850
PhD thesis and that was really shocking
 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.440
PhD thesis and that was really shocking
to me that a 21 year old can dream that

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450
to me that a 21 year old can dream that
 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.270
to me that a 21 year old can dream that
in four or five years time to be the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280
in four or five years time to be the
 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.060
in four or five years time to be the
best in the world in anything but he

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070
best in the world in anything but he
 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.710
best in the world in anything but he
explained to me that that's the

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720
explained to me that that's the
 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.230
explained to me that that's the
expectation of Carnegie Mellon that and

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240
expectation of Carnegie Mellon that and
 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.480
expectation of Carnegie Mellon that and
also it's not the best in computer

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490
also it's not the best in computer
 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.850
also it's not the best in computer
science but in a specific area in which

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860
science but in a specific area in which
 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.270
science but in a specific area in which
I worked but at the same time he told me

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280
I worked but at the same time he told me
 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.100
I worked but at the same time he told me
that while I would take away from

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110
that while I would take away from
 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.380
that while I would take away from
Carnegie Mellon the most valuable gift

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390
Carnegie Mellon the most valuable gift
 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.640
Carnegie Mellon the most valuable gift
was not that PhD thesis but the process

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650
was not that PhD thesis but the process
 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.190
was not that PhD thesis but the process
in building that thesis that the journey

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200
in building that thesis that the journey
 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.380
in building that thesis that the journey
would be more important than the

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390
would be more important than the
 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.720
would be more important than the
destination that the journey would teach

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730
destination that the journey would teach
 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.210
destination that the journey would teach
me how to think how to solve problems

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220
me how to think how to solve problems
 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.130
me how to think how to solve problems
how to work with people how to work

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140
how to work with people how to work
 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.590
how to work with people how to work
independently and that would be the

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600
independently and that would be the
 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.800
independently and that would be the
largest gift and today almost 30 years

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810
largest gift and today almost 30 years
 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.650
largest gift and today almost 30 years
later I find that those were truly words

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660
later I find that those were truly words
 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.550
later I find that those were truly words
of wisdom and they have really

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560
of wisdom and they have really
 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.610
of wisdom and they have really
significantly changed me so those words

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620
significantly changed me so those words
 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.970
significantly changed me so those words
at innovation works were also words that

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980
at innovation works were also words that
 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.320
at innovation works were also words that
I apply to my work all the time that I

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330
I apply to my work all the time that I
 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.080
I apply to my work all the time that I
realized that in a large domain of

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090
realized that in a large domain of
 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.420
realized that in a large domain of
possible investments that we could make

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430
possible investments that we could make
 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.940
possible investments that we could make
there are a few pockets that are really

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950
there are a few pockets that are really
 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.870
there are a few pockets that are really
really really important for example

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880
really really important for example
 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.690
really really important for example
building an Android ecosystem in mobile

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700
building an Android ecosystem in mobile
 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.450
building an Android ecosystem in mobile
and the approach we took was basically

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460
and the approach we took was basically
 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.180
and the approach we took was basically
what Niko taught me to go find every

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190
what Niko taught me to go find every
 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.150
what Niko taught me to go find every
smart person and inspire them to build

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160
smart person and inspire them to build
 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.490
smart person and inspire them to build
that best product within the Android

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500
that best product within the Android
 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.490
that best product within the Android
ecosystem so we would use our technical

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500
ecosystem so we would use our technical
 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.460
ecosystem so we would use our technical
expertise to pick the small domain find

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470
expertise to pick the small domain find
 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.440
expertise to pick the small domain find
great people and what they would work on

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450
great people and what they would work on
 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:39.170
great people and what they would work on
within that small domain and everybody

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180
within that small domain and everybody
 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.790
within that small domain and everybody
can be the best in

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800
can be the best in
 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.680
can be the best in
all domain and we want to encourage

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690
all domain and we want to encourage
 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.320
all domain and we want to encourage
inspire and help and enter and coach

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330
inspire and help and enter and coach
 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.510
inspire and help and enter and coach
these people to pick that small domain

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520
these people to pick that small domain
 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.790
these people to pick that small domain
and be the very best and that's how

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800
and be the very best and that's how
 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.159
and be the very best and that's how
Google Facebook Microsoft and great

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169
Google Facebook Microsoft and great
 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:54.290
Google Facebook Microsoft and great
companies were made and that was my

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300
companies were made and that was my
 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.930
companies were made and that was my
first lesson that was is tremendously

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940
first lesson that was is tremendously
 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.730
first lesson that was is tremendously
helpful to me and innovation works the

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740
helpful to me and innovation works the
 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.219
helpful to me and innovation works the
second biggest lesson I learned who

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229
second biggest lesson I learned who
 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:05.899
second biggest lesson I learned who
basically happened the second day at

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:05.909
basically happened the second day at
 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.180
basically happened the second day at
Carnegie Mellon after talking to Nikko I

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190
Carnegie Mellon after talking to Nikko I
 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:12.170
Carnegie Mellon after talking to Nikko I
went to class and then the professor

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.180
went to class and then the professor
 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.820
went to class and then the professor
said well for the next month there are

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830
said well for the next month there are
 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.920
said well for the next month there are
actually no classes you are about to

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930
actually no classes you are about to
 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:19.490
actually no classes you are about to
enter the marriage process and what

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:19.500
enter the marriage process and what
 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.890
enter the marriage process and what
marriage process was at school of

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900
marriage process was at school of
 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.230
marriage process was at school of
computer science at Carnegie Mellon was

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240
computer science at Carnegie Mellon was
 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.010
computer science at Carnegie Mellon was
that the students would get to sit there

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020
that the students would get to sit there
 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.800
that the students would get to sit there
and listen to the hundred of the best

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810
and listen to the hundred of the best
 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.959
and listen to the hundred of the best
professors in computer science pitched

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:32.969
professors in computer science pitched
 

00:07:32.969 --> 00:07:35.600
professors in computer science pitched
to them why they should pick them as

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:35.610
to them why they should pick them as
 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.959
to them why they should pick them as
their professor and supervisor and this

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:38.969
their professor and supervisor and this
 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:41.420
their professor and supervisor and this
was unheard of especially to a Chinese

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:41.430
was unheard of especially to a Chinese
 

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.700
was unheard of especially to a Chinese
student that is not a teacher who picks

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:43.710
student that is not a teacher who picks
 

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.740
student that is not a teacher who picks
the student but the other way around and

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:45.750
the student but the other way around and
 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.760
the student but the other way around and
that month in itself if for no other

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:49.770
that month in itself if for no other
 

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:52.580
that month in itself if for no other
thing really gave confidence to that

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:52.590
thing really gave confidence to that
 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.879
thing really gave confidence to that
class of thirty people that we were

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:55.889
class of thirty people that we were
 

00:07:55.889 --> 00:07:59.120
class of thirty people that we were
respected that we were empowered that we

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.130
respected that we were empowered that we
 

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.490
respected that we were empowered that we
were in control of our destiny that we

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:01.500
were in control of our destiny that we
 

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.499
were in control of our destiny that we
got to pick what we were passionate

00:08:03.499 --> 00:08:03.509
got to pick what we were passionate
 

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:06.230
got to pick what we were passionate
about and that was something very very

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240
about and that was something very very
 

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.990
about and that was something very very
special and that one month was probably

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000
special and that one month was probably
 

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.709
special and that one month was probably
the most fun I've had before funding

00:08:12.709 --> 00:08:12.719
the most fun I've had before funding
 

00:08:12.719 --> 00:08:15.499
the most fun I've had before funding
innovation works and and during that

00:08:15.499 --> 00:08:15.509
innovation works and and during that
 

00:08:15.509 --> 00:08:17.659
innovation works and and during that
month I absorbed everything that

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:17.669
month I absorbed everything that
 

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:19.790
month I absorbed everything that
teachers had to say and eventually I was

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800
teachers had to say and eventually I was
 

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.219
teachers had to say and eventually I was
fortunate enough to pick Raja Reddy

00:08:22.219 --> 00:08:22.229
fortunate enough to pick Raja Reddy
 

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:25.899
fortunate enough to pick Raja Reddy
as my PhD supervisor and of course

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:25.909
as my PhD supervisor and of course
 

00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:28.550
as my PhD supervisor and of course
perhaps everybody wanted to pick a great

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560
perhaps everybody wanted to pick a great
 

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.619
perhaps everybody wanted to pick a great
professor that it can't just be a

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:30.629
professor that it can't just be a
 

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:32.540
professor that it can't just be a
one-way process so the professor would

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:32.550
one-way process so the professor would
 

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:35.389
one-way process so the professor would
have to say well you know one person

00:08:35.389 --> 00:08:35.399
have to say well you know one person
 

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:37.459
have to say well you know one person
picked me fine I'll take him but if six

00:08:37.459 --> 00:08:37.469
picked me fine I'll take him but if six
 

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:39.230
picked me fine I'll take him but if six
people picked me maybe I have to pick

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240
people picked me maybe I have to pick
 

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.509
people picked me maybe I have to pick
only two of the six to sort of make it

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519
only two of the six to sort of make it
 

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:44.060
only two of the six to sort of make it
fair so basically people were only

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:44.070
fair so basically people were only
 

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.540
fair so basically people were only
guaranteed of getting it maybe your top
