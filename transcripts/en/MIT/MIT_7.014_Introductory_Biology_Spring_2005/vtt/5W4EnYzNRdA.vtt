00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.017
So I just want to back up a
couple because I think there's

00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:10.122
still some confusion about what
a restriction enzyme is and

00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:13.819
exactly what it does,
although I indicated,

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:18.132
a three prime hydroxyl and a
five-prime phosphate.

00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:19.540
Let me show you.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.677
This is the way a lot,
at least a large class of

00:00:23.677 --> 00:00:25.877
restriction enzymes,
went.

00:00:25.877 --> 00:00:30.806
We've seen a deoxyribose
backbone before with a phosphate

00:00:30.806 --> 00:00:36.000
backbone going on up to the next
nucleotide.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.686
This is the five-prime
position.

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:45.523
This is the three prime
position.

00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:49.453
There is a phosphate here.

00:00:49.453 --> 00:00:53.837
It goes down to the next one.

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:57.313
It goes down like this.

00:00:57.313 --> 00:01:05.023
So what I'm showing you,
GAATTC, five prime to three

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:15.000
prime, here's where I indicated
the first cut comes from.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.739
And I indicated that the
cleavage generates a G with a

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:24.211
three prime hydroxyl,
and the G ends up with a five

00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:26.000
prime phosphate.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.375
So what that means is that the
hydrolysis happens right there,

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:37.391
so that after cleavage,
what you end up with is a

00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:42.095
five-prime phosphate and three
prime hydroxyl.

00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:47.111
This is paired with the C on
the opposite strand.

00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:52.023
It makes one cut here,
and then it would make an

00:01:52.023 --> 00:01:55.786
identical cut on the opposite
strand.

00:01:55.786 --> 00:02:01.534
So if we were to pull those
apart this strand here would

00:02:01.534 --> 00:02:07.805
have G with its three prime OH,
and the other strand would be

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:10.000
TTAA.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.465
And if we were to pull the
apart.

00:02:13.465 --> 00:02:18.014
We'd have A A T T C,
a three prime OH here,

00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:23.862
five prime phosphate there,
five prime phosphate there.

00:02:23.862 --> 00:02:29.602
Again, you have to remember,
this strand is going five

00:02:29.602 --> 00:02:33.501
prime, three prime in that
direction.

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:40.000
This was going five prime,
three prime in the end.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.765
And the beauty of these
restriction enzymes,

00:02:42.765 --> 00:02:45.144
at least it's not true of all
of them.

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:49.067
But it's true of a lot of them
as they generate these what are

00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:50.289
called sticky ends.

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:51.832
You can pull them apart.

00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:55.241
They come back together,
though, and reform those base

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:55.627
pairs.

00:02:55.627 --> 00:03:00.000
It's almost like having little
bits of Velcro at the end.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.995
And when this end is looking
for a complementary sequence to

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:04.672
pair with.

00:03:04.672 --> 00:03:08.600
It doesn't know what's out
here, and it doesn't know what's

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.699
out there, all it sees as this.

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:14.559
So I can cut this and rejoin it
or I can cut them and pull

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:18.690
apart, take another piece of DNA
that's been cut with the same

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.753
enzyme and therefore has the
same corresponding little sticky

00:03:22.753 --> 00:03:25.801
ends on each end,
and it could insert right in

00:03:25.801 --> 00:03:26.546
the middle.

00:03:26.546 --> 00:03:30.000
And that's the principle of
cloning.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.260
And it was the development of
these, if you will,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.408
magic scissors that made it
possible to take this DNA which

00:03:39.408 --> 00:03:42.781
looks so homogeneous,
nothing but GA's,

00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:46.508
T's, and C's,
and then cut it up in defined

00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:46.952
ways.

00:03:46.952 --> 00:03:51.035
When I was a postdoc,
a friend of mine had just

00:03:51.035 --> 00:03:56.183
purified $2 million worth of
EcoRI because he purified some

00:03:56.183 --> 00:03:57.514
of this enzyme.

00:03:57.514 --> 00:04:01.635
At that point,
the only way to get these

00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:04.973
things was to produce them
yourself and purify them.

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:08.179
Now there are literally
hundreds of these and they

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:12.171
recognize different sequences,
and once people understood that

00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:14.985
they existed,
then they just started to look

00:04:14.985 --> 00:04:17.799
in different,
usually they're from bacteria,

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.202
and they just looked in
different bacteria until they

00:04:21.202 --> 00:04:22.380
found another one.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.081
And then they purified it.

00:04:24.081 --> 00:04:27.092
So if you go to,
say, any of the companies that

00:04:27.092 --> 00:04:32.000
do stuff for recombinant DNA,
you'll find lists like this.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.475
Funny little abbreviations like
EcoRI usually have something

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:40.724
that tells you some abbreviation
related to the organism,

00:04:40.724 --> 00:04:44.213
from which the restriction
enzyme was isolated.

00:04:44.213 --> 00:04:48.386
And you can find things that
will cut, I won't say every

00:04:48.386 --> 00:04:51.420
sequence, but very,
very, many sequences.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.124
There are literally hundreds of
these, and you just order them.

00:04:56.124 --> 00:04:59.689
And the next day,
a FedEx package arrives with a

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:05.000
little bit of the enzyme that
will cut at that sequence.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.972
Another concept that seemed to
be a problem,

00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:12.285
was what's a vector?

00:05:12.285 --> 00:05:19.455
So if you understand that there
are sequence specific molecular

00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:25.700
scissors, that if we have a
piece of DNA and there's an

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.904
EcoRI site here,
you would come to think of it

00:05:30.904 --> 00:05:39.000
like that because it's going to
cut in a slightly skewed way.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.520
Maybe there's another one right
here, another one over here.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.947
If we take this DNA and cut it
with this particular enzyme,

00:05:49.947 --> 00:05:51.818
we get a break here.

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:56.964
Then this will get this piece
running from here to here.

00:05:56.964 --> 00:05:59.959
We'll get this little piece
here.

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:05.198
We'll get this piece here,
and will get whatever goes off

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:06.602
on those sides.

00:06:06.602 --> 00:06:11.000
So that's naked DNA in a test
tube.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.872
So I could cut any piece of DNA
at some sites generating a bunch

00:06:16.872 --> 00:06:22.652
of fragments and if I just took
those fragments and transformed

00:06:22.652 --> 00:06:25.915
them into E.
coli, I took naked DNA,

00:06:25.915 --> 00:06:29.550
took it from the outside,
put it inside,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.881
is it going to replicate?

00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:33.000
No.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.560
Why not?

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.205
Because there's a special
signal called the origin of

00:06:37.205 --> 00:06:40.710
replication that says "start
replicating DNA here".

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.635
This came from a piece of
human, lets say some of my DNA,

00:06:44.635 --> 00:06:48.210
it would not have a signal in
it that said to the E.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.065
coli replication machinery,
"start replicating DNA right

00:06:52.065 --> 00:06:52.485
here".

00:06:52.485 --> 00:06:55.850
So the principle of,
apart from being able to cut

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.443
DNA fragments,
is you have together to

00:06:58.443 --> 00:07:03.000
replicate so you can make lots
of lots of copies.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.011
The trick is to attach the DNA,
at least a widely used trick is

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:12.134
to attach the DNA to something
that has an origin of

00:07:12.134 --> 00:07:16.500
replication that will work in
the organism in question.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.248
And that was what we call a
vector.

00:07:19.248 --> 00:07:21.350
So this is an E.
coli cell.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.634
Another thing that's very
confusing is all the circles

00:07:25.634 --> 00:07:27.898
that show up in this course.

00:07:27.898 --> 00:07:30.000
This is huge.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.214
The vector was double-stranded
DNA that maybe,

00:07:33.214 --> 00:07:36.928
let's say, had a unique EcoRI
restriction site in it.

00:07:36.928 --> 00:07:39.642
That's the only EcoRI
restriction site.

00:07:39.642 --> 00:07:43.714
The other thing that we'd need
to have is an origin of DNA

00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:44.571
replication.

00:07:44.571 --> 00:07:48.500
So, that's why this plasmid is
able to propagate itself.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.285
This little circle of DNA is
able to propagate itself,

00:07:52.285 --> 00:07:55.071
and then some kind of
selectable marker.

00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:58.357
And, most of the time that's a
drug-resistance,

00:07:58.357 --> 00:08:02.000
so although it doesn't have to
be.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.792
And if we cut that here,
generate sticky ends,

00:08:07.792 --> 00:08:14.356
then we can take this fragment
and stick it in here,

00:08:14.356 --> 00:08:20.019
to give this piece here joined
to the vector.

00:08:20.019 --> 00:08:22.722
And that's an insert.

00:08:22.722 --> 00:08:28.000
Let's say it was that piece
there.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.409
In fact, if you wanted to clone
DNA in E.

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:33.120
coli, and then have the plasmid
work in yeast,

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.734
if you just take that plasmid
that works, the vector with its

00:08:36.734 --> 00:08:39.867
insert that works in E.
coli and put it in the yeast,

00:08:39.867 --> 00:08:41.433
it won't replicate either.

00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:45.168
And that's because these other
languages other than the genetic

00:08:45.168 --> 00:08:46.554
code are not universal.

00:08:46.554 --> 00:08:50.108
So, you also have to put also
in a sequence that said to the

00:08:50.108 --> 00:08:53.120
yeast replication machinery
"start something here".

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.313
People call that a shuttle
vector, something that will

00:08:56.313 --> 00:08:58.843
replicate in E.
coli or replicate in yeast,

00:08:58.843 --> 00:09:03.000
and the same principle applies
to other organisms

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.553
Okay, now probably the
trickiest thing,

00:09:05.553 --> 00:09:08.645
the thing where I sort of
muddled it on Friday,

00:09:08.645 --> 00:09:11.737
and I apologize for that,
was this discovery of

00:09:11.737 --> 00:09:13.081
restriction enzymes.

00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:15.635
And again, some of you were
frustrated.

00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:17.651
You said, why do I waste time?

00:09:17.651 --> 00:09:20.743
Why not just tell you stuff
that's on the exam?

00:09:20.743 --> 00:09:24.910
Okay again, people were talking
about molecular scissors when I

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:28.338
was an undergrad and grad
student, and chemists were

00:09:28.338 --> 00:09:32.169
trying to think if they could
come up with some way to get

00:09:32.169 --> 00:09:36.000
some specificity in how to
cutting DNA.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.721
And the answer,
the discovery of restriction

00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:41.759
enzymes didn't come from that
kind of experiment.

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:45.620
It came from somebody trying to
understand what seemed to be a

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.645
really obscure piece of biology.

00:09:47.645 --> 00:09:49.860
Julie made up a lovely little
slide.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.594
But I think it basically did
was I left at one of the little

00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:56.000
layers that I usually show.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.697
So, let me just talk.

00:09:58.697 --> 00:10:03.834
Here's, again,
what Luria saw when he was

00:10:03.834 --> 00:10:06.917
doing these experiments.

00:10:06.917 --> 00:10:14.110
So, I'm going to tell you now
what was in strain A and B,

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.321
and maybe that will help.

00:10:17.321 --> 00:10:25.155
But I wanted you first to see
it without knowing what anything

00:10:25.155 --> 00:10:28.110
beyond what Luria knew.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:35.559
OK, strain A has no restriction
enzyme, and no modification

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:38.000
enzyme.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:46.717
And although there are
different types of modification

00:10:46.717 --> 00:10:52.638
enzymes, many of them are
methylases.

00:10:52.638 --> 00:10:55.927
So, we'll call that.

00:10:55.927 --> 00:11:03.000
And this one has a restriction
enzyme.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.414
And, it has corresponding
methylase.

00:11:06.414 --> 00:11:11.780
Just to review that again,
if you can figure this pretty

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:17.536
much out from first principles
that if you were an organism,

00:11:17.536 --> 00:11:22.609
and you had a restriction
enzyme that would cut this,

00:11:22.609 --> 00:11:28.463
there are two things you can
possibly do to keep from cutting

00:11:28.463 --> 00:11:31.000
up your own DNA.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.007
One is to never have that
sequence of pure DNA.

00:11:34.007 --> 00:11:37.342
That would prevent you from
cutting up your own DNA,

00:11:37.342 --> 00:11:38.780
even though it has it.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.115
It's pretty constraining now,
because somewhere in a

00:11:42.115 --> 00:11:45.319
particular protein,
you might need that little bit

00:11:45.319 --> 00:11:49.438
of sequence to encode something
that you need to make a critical

00:11:49.438 --> 00:11:49.961
protein.

00:11:49.961 --> 00:11:53.557
So instead what you find is
organisms have a restriction

00:11:53.557 --> 00:11:57.480
enzyme, have those sequences,
but they don't cut up their own

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.684
DNA because they modify their
own DNA, by putting,

00:12:00.684 --> 00:12:05.000
in the case of this one,
they put a methyl here.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.325
And I drew that out the other
day.

00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:10.213
You can see,
you can put a methyl group on

00:12:10.213 --> 00:12:14.370
the exocyclic amino group of
adanine, and not interfere with

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.286
base pairing.

00:12:15.286 --> 00:12:18.809
But what you can do,
is interfere with the way that

00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:21.768
the restriction enzymes sees
that sequence.

00:12:21.768 --> 00:12:26.065
And when the cell pulls the DNA
apart, each of the old strands

00:12:26.065 --> 00:12:29.095
is methylated,
and a new strand is initially

00:12:29.095 --> 00:12:30.152
not methylated.

00:12:30.152 --> 00:12:34.027
But that's enough keep the
restriction enzyme from doing

00:12:34.027 --> 00:12:36.000
its thing.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.392
And then the methylase will
come along, find a sequence,

00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:42.353
and then the progeny strand,
the daughter strand,

00:12:42.353 --> 00:12:44.142
will begin to get methylated.

00:12:44.142 --> 00:12:47.350
So, once you get DNA
methylated, you can propagate it

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.571
as long as you have the methyl
group.

00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:52.840
So this was what was really
underlying what Luria did.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:55.000
But he didn't know that.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.551
Let me quickly just go through
this again.

00:12:58.551 --> 00:13:02.363
So he grew the strain,
the phage on strain A,

00:13:02.363 --> 00:13:05.915
no restriction enzyme,
just plain old DNA.

00:13:05.915 --> 00:13:10.940
So, he picks a plaque that's
probably about a billion phage

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:15.185
in a plaque, somewhere around
10^8, 10^9 probably,

00:13:15.185 --> 00:13:18.910
no that's not true,
a little less than that,

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.242
somewhat less than that,
but lots and lots of phage

00:13:23.242 --> 00:13:25.321
particles in the plaque.

00:13:25.321 --> 00:13:30.000
Resuspend them and then plate
them out.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.255
And of course it grew on strain
A.

00:13:32.255 --> 00:13:34.305
That's what it was growing on.

00:13:34.305 --> 00:13:36.560
That wouldn't surprise you at
all.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.840
The surprise was,
even though he knew he had lots

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.847
and lots of phage,
hardly any of them grew on

00:13:42.847 --> 00:13:43.462
strain B.

00:13:43.462 --> 00:13:47.015
But, he found a rare plaque
that had learned to grow.

00:13:47.015 --> 00:13:50.364
And he tested then,
and this thing grows on strain

00:13:50.364 --> 00:13:50.501
B.

00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:54.806
That was not a surprise because
it had to grow on strain B to be

00:13:54.806 --> 00:13:55.421
up there.

00:13:55.421 --> 00:13:58.496
And he tested,
and it still grew on the strain

00:13:58.496 --> 00:14:00.000
A.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.048
So up until now,
everything we knew,

00:14:03.048 --> 00:14:06.880
everything we've talked about
in that course,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.799
you think, ah-ha,
this original phage couldn't

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:13.761
grow on strain B,
but it's mutated.

00:14:13.761 --> 00:14:14.458
Somehow.

00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:17.245
It's learned to grow on strain
B.

00:14:17.245 --> 00:14:21.425
That would be a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

00:14:21.425 --> 00:14:27.000
But if that were the case,
what would've happened?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.037
Well it was growing on those
phage, you pick them again,

00:14:31.037 --> 00:14:34.708
it should still grow on A and
B, and they still do.

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:38.967
The problem with that model was
that they grew on strain A.

00:14:38.967 --> 00:14:41.610
They had trouble growing on
strain B.

00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.794
Now that we've learned to grow
on strain B, but you hadn't

00:14:45.794 --> 00:14:48.217
forgotten how to grow on strain
A.

00:14:48.217 --> 00:14:52.182
But if you take the ones that
were growing on strain A,

00:14:52.182 --> 00:14:56.000
they grow on strain A,
not a surprise.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.194
This is the problem right here.

00:14:58.194 --> 00:15:00.883
If this was a mutant,
permanent change,

00:15:00.883 --> 00:15:05.059
then we should have been able
to have it grow on strain B as

00:15:05.059 --> 00:15:05.413
well.

00:15:05.413 --> 00:15:08.031
So what was really happening in
there?

00:15:08.031 --> 00:15:11.712
Well, at the beginning,
the phage DNA was lacking any

00:15:11.712 --> 00:15:13.198
kind of modification.

00:15:13.198 --> 00:15:16.383
It grew fine on strain A,
because there was no

00:15:16.383 --> 00:15:17.728
restriction enzyme.

00:15:17.728 --> 00:15:21.267
When it went into strain B,
that now had an enzyme,

00:15:21.267 --> 00:15:25.089
a restriction enzyme that cut
up any time it found that

00:15:25.089 --> 00:15:27.000
sequence.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.560
And so, most of the phage that
injected their DNA,

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.120
those DNAs were trashed by the
restriction enzyme.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.898
But there is a methylase in
there that's also able to

00:15:37.898 --> 00:15:39.787
methylate those sequences.

00:15:39.787 --> 00:15:44.074
And what happened somewhere
along the way was that there was

00:15:44.074 --> 00:15:48.434
the methyl, on one phage DNA,
and got enough methyls on there

00:15:48.434 --> 00:15:52.357
that the phage could be
replicated before it got cut up

00:15:52.357 --> 00:15:54.246
by the restriction enzyme.

00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:58.024
Once the phage molecule has
methylations on the site,

00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:02.529
it's able to grow just fine on
strain B, and it will be able to

00:16:02.529 --> 00:16:05.000
do that forever.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.431
However, if you take that DNA
with the methyls on it,

00:16:08.431 --> 00:16:11.401
and we put it back strain A,
it'll still grow,

00:16:11.401 --> 00:16:15.030
as this one doesn't have any
kind of restriction enzyme,

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:18.989
but while it's growing its busy
losing all the methyls again.

00:16:18.989 --> 00:16:21.761
We are right back to where we
started from.

00:16:21.761 --> 00:16:24.994
An obscure experiment,
one of the most obscure you

00:16:24.994 --> 00:16:28.360
could get, many people would
have paid no attention.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.000
It does not seem worth it.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.950
So, the phenomenon was called
restriction.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:35.893
They had to give it a name.

00:16:35.893 --> 00:16:37.260
It wasn't mutation.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.578
They said this phage DNA was
being restricted somehow when it

00:16:41.578 --> 00:16:42.801
grew on strain B.

00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:46.039
People called them,
postulated there must be a

00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:50.213
restriction enzyme that was
doing this restricting of phage

00:16:50.213 --> 00:16:50.717
growth.

00:16:50.717 --> 00:16:54.818
When they found out what was
doing it, they had discovered

00:16:54.818 --> 00:17:00.000
magic scissors that would cut
DNA at particular sequences.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.080
So, the point here again,
to try and go back and do this,

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.269
I hope some of you will get
this anyway, many of the really

00:17:06.269 --> 00:17:08.910
important discoveries come out
of basic research.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.339
They are easy to ridicule.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.089
Why would I spend money on
cancer, human disease or

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:16.390
something, for somebody studying
some little weird phenomenon

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:17.049
about phage.

00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:19.634
But if you want to trace back
to the experiment,

00:17:19.634 --> 00:17:21.779
it sort of started the biotech
industry.

00:17:21.779 --> 00:17:24.144
It was the discovery of
restriction enzymes.

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:26.674
It took a little while to
discover what it was,

00:17:26.674 --> 00:17:29.535
but the reason they were
discovered, were people were

00:17:29.535 --> 00:17:33.000
trying to understand that
phenomenology.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.578
Once we got restriction
enzymes, we already had ligase,

00:17:36.578 --> 00:17:40.686
which is sort of the tape we'd
need, and just to show you here,

00:17:40.686 --> 00:17:44.265
when we go back to this one,
you can see that if we put

00:17:44.265 --> 00:17:47.710
these together again,
we have a three prime hydroxyl,

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.500
and a five-prime phosphate.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.277
That's what DNA ligase knows
how to do, because that's how

00:17:53.277 --> 00:17:55.993
you seal up the end of a Okazaki
fragment.

00:17:55.993 --> 00:17:59.969
So, that particular part of the
molecular biology toolkit was

00:17:59.969 --> 00:18:03.813
already known to molecular
biologists who had been studying

00:18:03.813 --> 00:18:06.000
DNA replication.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.340
OK, so, if we took some DNA
from anything,

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:19.415
and we cut up into pieces like
this, and then we join them with

00:18:19.415 --> 00:18:26.710
a vector that had been cut,
so let's just sort of open it

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:32.701
up a little bit,
this fragment would go in here

00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:37.000
into one vector molecule.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.643
This fragment would insert in
another vector molecule,

00:18:41.643 --> 00:18:43.658
and so on and so forth.

00:18:43.658 --> 00:18:47.513
Then we would have what I said
was a library,

00:18:47.513 --> 00:18:52.770
and the problem at this point
is, so you transform those into

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.486
E.
coli, and now we have a whole

00:18:55.486 --> 00:18:56.975
series of E.
coli.

00:18:56.975 --> 00:19:02.320
They have their own chromosome,
every one of them because they

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:06.000
still have to be a bacterium.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.210
So, let's take three members of
E.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:19.105
coli from this library,
and they will all have this

00:19:19.105 --> 00:19:27.315
vector, but they'll have,
let's say, insert number 1,

00:19:27.315 --> 00:19:28.105
2, 3.

00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:33.000
This insert is a little.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.909
This insert is bigger,
and so on.

00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:37.636
If we did it right.

00:19:37.636 --> 00:19:43.272
We have every possible fragment
of DNA from the original source

00:19:43.272 --> 00:19:45.636
sitting in its own vector.

00:19:45.636 --> 00:19:51.090
And the whole collection of E.
coli in this population in the

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.272
certain library,
and the next part of the trick

00:19:55.272 --> 00:20:00.909
was, how do you find the thing
you want, especially if you take

00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:05.000
my DNA with 3 billion base
pairs.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.738
That's an awful lot of
restriction fragments no matter

00:20:08.738 --> 00:20:09.584
what you do.

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:11.629
How do you go about doing it?

00:20:11.629 --> 00:20:15.931
So the experiment that I showed
you at the end of the lecture,

00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:19.035
cloning by complementation,
is fairly simple,

00:20:19.035 --> 00:20:23.337
and it was basically one of the
first methods that was used to

00:20:23.337 --> 00:20:25.664
find genes in recombinant
library.

00:20:25.664 --> 00:20:27.780
And that would be,
for example,

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:33.000
something that had thisGene
mutation in the chromosomal DNA.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.760
This is what the situation I'd
described the other day.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.609
So, if we put the library into
every cell, such that the

00:20:42.609 --> 00:20:47.811
bacterium we transformed the
library into was broken for the

00:20:47.811 --> 00:20:52.836
hisG gene, and that mutant
couldn't grow on minimal medium

00:20:52.836 --> 00:20:55.657
unless we put in added
histadine.

00:20:55.657 --> 00:21:00.241
But, if one member of that
library had the wild type,

00:21:00.241 --> 00:21:03.856
hisG gene, let's say it was
this one here,

00:21:03.856 --> 00:21:08.000
maybe it had several genes on
it.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.122
But let's say over here.

00:21:10.122 --> 00:21:13.571
We had hisG+,
then the strain is back to

00:21:13.571 --> 00:21:18.346
being able to synthesize
histidine because it's got all

00:21:18.346 --> 00:21:19.408
the enzymes.

00:21:19.408 --> 00:21:24.537
What I was pointing out was
this really is complementation,

00:21:24.537 --> 00:21:27.721
just like we did in that phage
cross.

00:21:27.721 --> 00:21:30.993
We've got one broken copy of
the gene.

00:21:30.993 --> 00:21:34.000
We've got a good copy.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And all you need is one good
copy, and you're back in

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:38.692
business.

00:21:38.692 --> 00:21:43.307
What I was saying at the end of
the lecture was this is not a

00:21:43.307 --> 00:21:45.153
general solution,
though.

00:21:45.153 --> 00:21:49.076
If I wanted to find the
corresponding histidine gene

00:21:49.076 --> 00:21:53.000
from my DNA, and all of these
biosynthetic pathways,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.307
pretty much they rose so early
in evolution,

00:21:56.307 --> 00:22:00.461
the biochemistry is essentially
identical in all cells.

00:22:00.461 --> 00:22:06.000
Can I use this approach to find
the same gene for my DNA?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.069
What do you think?

00:22:07.069 --> 00:22:10.576
Why don't you turn to somebody
beside you and see if you can

00:22:10.576 --> 00:22:12.954
talk for a minute,
and then let's see if,

00:22:12.954 --> 00:22:15.569
I can think of at least a
couple of problems.

00:22:15.569 --> 00:22:18.660
Let's see if you can come up
with one or two of them.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.811
Find somebody near you and see
if you can come up with

00:22:21.811 --> 00:23:06.000
anything.
00:22:23&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.900
Anybody want to volunteer?

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.700
An idea of why it would not
work?

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:19.200
Or some of you think it would?

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.549
No ideas?

00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:24.599
God, it's Monday.

00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:30.000
I feel like most of you guys.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.162
Somebody, come on.

00:23:32.162 --> 00:23:34.324
What do you think?

00:23:34.324 --> 00:23:36.607
It's going to work?

00:23:36.607 --> 00:23:37.568
No idea?

00:23:37.568 --> 00:23:41.532
What has to happen for it to
work?

00:23:41.532 --> 00:23:48.740
I'll give you a vector that has
my gene corresponding to that

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.581
enzyme.

00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:51.383
It's in E.
coli.

00:23:51.383 --> 00:23:54.626
I need to make the protein.

00:23:54.626 --> 00:23:55.227
Yeah?

00:23:55.227 --> 00:23:57.990
No, it's in the vector.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:02.194
We cloned it into an E.
coli vector.

00:24:02.194 --> 00:24:04.357
So, that's got it.

00:24:04.357 --> 00:24:07.000
Yeah?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.917
Well it'll have a language that
will say "start transcription",

00:24:11.917 --> 00:24:14.931
but whose language is it going
to have?

00:24:14.931 --> 00:24:18.341
It's going to have my
transcriptional stuff.

00:24:18.341 --> 00:24:20.324
Will that work in E.
coli?

00:24:20.324 --> 00:24:23.655
Even though the open reading
frame is fine,

00:24:23.655 --> 00:24:24.606
that's good.

00:24:24.606 --> 00:24:26.351
How about translation?

00:24:26.351 --> 00:24:30.000
I didn't even tell you about
that.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.801
There is actually some specific
stuff needed.

00:24:32.801 --> 00:24:34.583
That's not universal,
either.

00:24:34.583 --> 00:24:38.021
So when you get the RNA you
still have to translate it.

00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:40.822
There is another thing that
might mess us up.

00:24:40.822 --> 00:24:43.433
Do you remember anything else
about, yeah?

00:24:43.433 --> 00:24:44.579
Introns and exons?

00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:48.462
What if my gene has introns in
it, which it almost surely has?

00:24:48.462 --> 00:24:50.245
We have to get rid of those.

00:24:50.245 --> 00:24:52.091
E.
coli doesn't know what they

00:24:52.091 --> 00:24:52.346
are.

00:24:52.346 --> 00:24:54.383
It's not used to taking them
out.

00:24:54.383 --> 00:24:55.593
You see the issues?

00:24:55.593 --> 00:24:59.285
Although that's a cute thing
and that helps you find a gene

00:24:59.285 --> 00:25:01.259
from E.
coli by complementing E.

00:25:01.259 --> 00:25:03.869
coli mutant,
or maybe you could do it with

00:25:03.869 --> 00:25:07.371
yeast if you had a factor that
would replicate in yeast,

00:25:07.371 --> 00:25:11.000
it wasn't a general solution.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.311
So people had to use a whole
variety of different ways.

00:25:14.311 --> 00:25:15.476
Here's another way.

00:25:15.476 --> 00:25:17.929
You know that you have that
genetic code.

00:25:17.929 --> 00:25:19.768
That was worked out years ago.

00:25:19.768 --> 00:25:22.650
So let's say I was a
biochemist, and I'd found a

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.778
protein that I was interested
in, and I purified it,

00:25:25.778 --> 00:25:29.518
and they got it out to single
protein, and then I could cut it

00:25:29.518 --> 00:25:33.136
up with things that proteases
that will cut the protein into

00:25:33.136 --> 00:25:37.000
pieces, and there are ways of
sequencing protein.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.864
I'm not going to tell you how
it works in this course.

00:25:40.864 --> 00:25:42.614
We just don't have time.

00:25:42.614 --> 00:25:46.697
But you can get the sequence of
little pieces of protein.

00:25:46.697 --> 00:25:50.927
And let's imagine that this was
the sequence of part of the

00:25:50.927 --> 00:25:52.677
protein that I purified.

00:25:52.677 --> 00:25:55.666
It's one of my enzymes [SOUND
OFF/THEN ON]

00:25:55.666 --> 00:25:57.854
and I'd like to find the gene.

00:25:57.854 --> 00:26:02.010
Well, how could I use that
information to figure out where

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:05.000
the gene is in this library?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.401
So here's the strategy.

00:26:07.401 --> 00:26:12.831
We get out the genetic code,
which Gobind Khorana and

00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:17.947
Marshall Nirenberg helped work
out, and we say OK,

00:26:17.947 --> 00:26:24.212
alanine, and if you look it up,
what you'll find is that it's

00:26:24.212 --> 00:26:27.658
GC, and then it can be A T C or
G.

00:26:27.658 --> 00:26:31.000
It can be any of those.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.482
If we look up what the codon
for aspartate.

00:26:34.482 --> 00:26:38.960
We'll find that there's a G or
an A, but it could be T,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.370
or it could be C.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.356
We look up lysine;
it'll mostly be A,

00:26:43.356 --> 00:26:45.263
but it could be A or G.

00:26:45.263 --> 00:26:50.156
You'll notice the variation of
those things is almost all in

00:26:50.156 --> 00:26:53.556
the third codon if that hadn't
struck you.

00:26:53.556 --> 00:26:58.200
Same thing with threonine:
A, C, and this is another one;

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.936
therefore codons that encode
this.

00:27:00.936 --> 00:27:05.000
And this one asparagine is
that.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:13.653
So knowing that piece of the
protein doesn't define a unique

00:27:13.653 --> 00:27:14.973
sequence.

00:27:14.973 --> 00:27:23.186
Though, what we could do it is
we could synthesize what's

00:27:23.186 --> 00:27:27.000
called a mixed probe.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.849
And that would mean when we are
going to synthesize this DNA and

00:27:32.849 --> 00:27:36.007
we'd start with a G building
block.

00:27:36.007 --> 00:27:39.349
And then we'd add a C building
block.

00:27:39.349 --> 00:27:41.578
So, now we made G and C.

00:27:41.578 --> 00:27:46.407
And at the next step,
we'd add an equal mixture of A,

00:27:46.407 --> 00:27:47.521
T, G, and C.

00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:53.092
So, what we would get out of
that would be we'd be getting G,

00:27:53.092 --> 00:27:57.828
and then the next biosynthetic
step would give us G,

00:27:57.828 --> 00:27:58.014
C.

00:27:58.014 --> 00:28:02.842
And then the next biochemical
step would give us GCA,

00:28:02.842 --> 00:28:06.000
GCT, GCC, or GCG.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.553
At the next step,
we'd add a G.

00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:11.446
So everyone of these would get
a G.

00:28:11.446 --> 00:28:15.446
Everyone would get an A,
and then the next step,

00:28:15.446 --> 00:28:16.978
they would branch.

00:28:16.978 --> 00:28:21.829
And if you follow that out,
you'll see by the end you have

00:28:21.829 --> 00:28:23.531
a mixture of probes.

00:28:23.531 --> 00:28:28.638
One of them is going to be the
right one that you find in the

00:28:28.638 --> 00:28:30.000
DNA.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.364
Now if you work out the number
of possibilities,

00:28:33.364 --> 00:28:37.587
you'll discover that most of
the time there is only going to

00:28:37.587 --> 00:28:39.520
be one probe that's unique.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.099
Once you get to about 20
nucleotides, any sequence,

00:28:43.099 --> 00:28:46.750
on average, is represented once
in the human genome.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.900
So as long as you make the
probe long enough,

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.980
one of the things in your
mixture will be a defined probe.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.275
So, what we can take is we have
all these different pieces of

00:28:58.275 --> 00:29:03.000
DNA that are the logical
variants you can see here.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.805
And then we would label the
probe with P32.

00:29:06.805 --> 00:29:10.974
It's a radioactive isotope,
and it's very easy.

00:29:10.974 --> 00:29:14.598
You can add it to a five-prime
phosphate.

00:29:14.598 --> 00:29:19.491
There's a special enzyme that
will very easily take the

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:23.388
terminal phosphate from ATP and
put it over.

00:29:23.388 --> 00:29:26.650
It doesn't really [SOUND
OFF/THEN ON]

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.000
for this course how we get it
there.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.011
But we can do is radioactively
label the probe.

00:29:35.011 --> 00:29:37.627
So now we've got this mixture.

00:29:37.627 --> 00:29:42.860
And, somewhere in this library
is a piece of DNA that's going

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.569
to have the gene that's encoding
the protein that we're

00:29:47.569 --> 00:29:48.790
interested in.

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.976
So, how do you go about trying
to deal with that?

00:29:52.976 --> 00:29:56.290
So, what we'll do is we'll
plate our E.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:01.000
coli library onto a bunch of
Petri plates.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.218
So, I won't put too many
colonies on here,

00:30:05.218 --> 00:30:08.408
so we can sort of see a
pattern.

00:30:08.408 --> 00:30:14.479
But, we'd have probably a lot
of them, and we'd have a bunch

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:15.508
of plates.

00:30:15.508 --> 00:30:21.887
You can work out statistically
how many plates you have to have

00:30:21.887 --> 00:30:26.929
to have a chance of finding your
gene of interest.

00:30:26.929 --> 00:30:33.000
Then what we do,
is lay a membrane on the plate.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.857
It's a particular type of
membrane, and what that will do

00:30:39.857 --> 00:30:45.857
is it will make a copy of
everything that's there,

00:30:45.857 --> 00:30:49.897
and we're going to save the
plate.

00:30:49.897 --> 00:30:55.040
And then we're going to treat
the membrane,

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:55.408
OK?

00:30:55.408 --> 00:31:03.000
We've got a membrane that's got
an identical pattern.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.605
They've got some of the
bacteria from the colonies stuck

00:31:08.605 --> 00:31:12.885
at the corresponding parts on
the membrane.

00:31:12.885 --> 00:31:18.286
We're going to lyse the E.
coli; that means break them

00:31:18.286 --> 00:31:21.853
open so all their insides spill
out.

00:31:21.853 --> 00:31:27.254
We will denature the DNA by
treating with a condition.

00:31:27.254 --> 00:31:31.840
You can, for example,
vary the pH and make the

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.000
strands come apart.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.980
That gives single stranded DNA,
"ss" I'm using as an

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:46.035
abbreviation for single strand
of the strands you pulled apart.

00:31:46.035 --> 00:31:49.160
And, this sticks to the
membrane.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.652
So, now we've got,
at every one of these little

00:31:53.652 --> 00:32:00.000
positions on the membrane
something that looks like this.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.557
Here's the membrane,
and there's some sort of single

00:32:05.557 --> 00:32:11.769
stranded DNA that's stuck to the
membrane in that fashion.

00:32:11.769 --> 00:32:18.525
The DNA that's stuck here came
from the bacterium here that had

00:32:18.525 --> 00:32:20.705
a particular insert.

00:32:20.705 --> 00:32:26.916
Over here, we have all the E.
coli DNA and the vector DNA,

00:32:26.916 --> 00:32:34.000
but we will have a different
piece of DNA in the vector.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.279
Everybody with me?

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:39.404
OK, so if we were now to take
our radioactive probe that we

00:32:39.404 --> 00:32:42.746
made up there and get the
conditions just right,

00:32:42.746 --> 00:32:46.942
that single stranded probe will
come in, and it will try and

00:32:46.942 --> 00:32:48.364
find its complement.

00:32:48.364 --> 00:32:52.417
It'll form hydrogen bonds
because that's the lowest energy

00:32:52.417 --> 00:32:52.773
well.

00:32:52.773 --> 00:32:55.617
And, we think about it
thermodynamically.

00:32:55.617 --> 00:32:59.244
And, if we can get it right,
the temperature and the

00:32:59.244 --> 00:33:02.586
conditions right,
nothing will stick unless it's

00:33:02.586 --> 00:33:06.000
an exact match to the sequence.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.190
And, if we get the right probe
that can form hydrogen bonds

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:20.008
with everything on here,
and it's got P32 at this point,

00:33:20.008 --> 00:33:26.950
what will happen is we'll have
now, the probe will stick,

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:34.264
say, to this particular colony,
now with radioactivity right

00:33:34.264 --> 00:33:36.000
there.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.792
So, put some photographic film
over the membrane,

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:51.000
and right here there's P32,
and that'll expose the film and

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.839
nowhere else.

00:33:52.839 --> 00:33:59.773
And then, when we develop,
what we'll find is one,

00:33:59.773 --> 00:34:06.000
if this works well,
anyway, one spot.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.713
So, now we know that that
piece, that colony had a piece

00:34:09.713 --> 00:34:13.697
of human DNA in it that was
related to the sequence from the

00:34:13.697 --> 00:34:15.588
protein that I had purified.

00:34:15.588 --> 00:34:19.099
So we go back to this colony,
I think our things have

00:34:19.099 --> 00:34:21.935
probably migrated around a
little bit here.

00:34:21.935 --> 00:34:25.784
Let's move this up just a
little bit, and make it a little

00:34:25.784 --> 00:34:27.000
better.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.166
So this one is this one.

00:34:29.166 --> 00:34:33.859
So, now I can go back to this
colony and pick it out.

00:34:33.859 --> 00:34:36.657
And, let's say it's this
insert.

00:34:36.657 --> 00:34:41.622
So, now I've found I can
sequence the rest of that piece

00:34:41.622 --> 00:34:42.254
of DNA.

00:34:42.254 --> 00:34:46.496
We'll talk about how we
sequence DNA in the next

00:34:46.496 --> 00:34:47.218
lecture.

00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:52.904
So that's an alternative way of
identifying a clone of interest.

00:34:52.904 --> 00:34:57.959
There was a particularly
painful way of finding a gene in

00:34:57.959 --> 00:35:05.000
a library that we for the most
part do not have to do any more.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.400
It was called positional
cloning.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:23.199
And for example the gene that
when it's broken causes cystic

00:35:23.199 --> 00:35:32.000
fibrosis, it's a very difficult
disease.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.909
Humans who have cystic
fibrosis have a very tough time.

00:35:36.909 --> 00:35:41.818
So there's a great deal of
interest in finding the gene

00:35:41.818 --> 00:35:44.818
that was broken in these
patients.

00:35:44.818 --> 00:35:49.000
Human geneticists,
I showed you something about

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.545
pedigrees, they would have a
chromosome.

00:35:52.545 --> 00:35:57.272
They might have banding
patterns, and they would have

00:35:57.272 --> 00:36:03.090
figured out that somewhere along
the chromosome that the gene for

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:08.636
cystic fibrosis lay somewhere
between two genetic markers that

00:36:08.636 --> 00:36:12.000
they had identified.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.792
Now, the amount of DNA between
something that you knew that the

00:36:15.792 --> 00:36:18.300
gene was here,
and something knew that the

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.074
gene was there,
could be huge.

00:36:20.074 --> 00:36:22.827
It could be many,
many, many times the size of

00:36:22.827 --> 00:36:24.172
the E.
coli chromosome.

00:36:24.172 --> 00:36:27.476
So, what people would do is
they'd clone something from

00:36:27.476 --> 00:36:31.329
here, a little piece of DNA from
there, and also clone something

00:36:31.329 --> 00:36:35.000
and they get a little piece of
DNA from there.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.907
And then they go into the
library, and they try and find

00:36:38.907 --> 00:36:43.311
something that had this DNA and
something that extended in this

00:36:43.311 --> 00:36:45.087
direction the little bit.

00:36:45.087 --> 00:36:49.562
By the sort of thing you'd have
marker A somewhere in the middle

00:36:49.562 --> 00:36:53.896
of the cystic fibrosis gene but
you didn't know exactly where.

00:36:53.896 --> 00:36:58.229
You'd clone a little piece of
DNA and use that to find another

00:36:58.229 --> 00:37:01.000
one that overlapped with it.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.516
And that you'd find,
use that to find another piece

00:37:04.516 --> 00:37:05.008
of DNA.

00:37:05.008 --> 00:37:09.087
You'd walk your way over this
way, and you'd start the same

00:37:09.087 --> 00:37:10.846
process at the other end.

00:37:10.846 --> 00:37:15.206
And, every one of these things,
the same kind of operation that

00:37:15.206 --> 00:37:17.808
we've got here,
so cycles, and cycles,

00:37:17.808 --> 00:37:21.606
and cycles of acquiring the
next adjacent piece of DNA,

00:37:21.606 --> 00:37:23.786
and working your way along
here.

00:37:23.786 --> 00:37:27.514
And you had to use more than
one different restriction

00:37:27.514 --> 00:37:33.000
enzymes, otherwise you wouldn't
be able to get these overlaps.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.237
And by doing that,
eventually they were able to

00:37:36.237 --> 00:37:39.475
get all the DNA that was between
these markers.

00:37:39.475 --> 00:37:43.487
They knew the cystic fibrosis
gene was there from the maps

00:37:43.487 --> 00:37:46.373
they had made by studying human
pedigrees.

00:37:46.373 --> 00:37:50.033
And then, once you knew the
sequence, then you'd take

00:37:50.033 --> 00:37:52.919
candidate genes,
and you'd take a bunch of

00:37:52.919 --> 00:37:56.861
cystic fibrosis patients,
and you'd start to see if every

00:37:56.861 --> 00:38:02.000
person who had cystic fibrosis
had a mutation in that gene.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.442
And, eventually they got it.

00:38:04.442 --> 00:38:09.501
That process in the case of
cystic fibrosis took five years

00:38:09.501 --> 00:38:12.728
to do that with a huge team of
people.

00:38:12.728 --> 00:38:15.694
And, I guess it was from
1985-1990.

00:38:15.694 --> 00:38:19.271
If you wanted to do that
experiment today.

00:38:19.271 --> 00:38:24.417
We come now to one of the most
widely used ways to finding a

00:38:24.417 --> 00:38:28.080
gene of interest,
and that is you go to the

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.000
computer.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.751
The whole human genome sequence
is in there.

00:38:32.751 --> 00:38:35.184
If we were to do that
experiment today,

00:38:35.184 --> 00:38:37.744
we'd say, well,
I know what this gene is,

00:38:37.744 --> 00:38:40.304
so you look that gene up in the
database.

00:38:40.304 --> 00:38:44.143
And you knew what this gene was
and you look up the database.

00:38:44.143 --> 00:38:47.599
Then you just look at all the
DNA that's in the middle.

00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:50.864
And you'd see a whole series of
open reading frames.

00:38:50.864 --> 00:38:54.255
And you'd probably say,
well, what do I know about the

00:38:54.255 --> 00:38:55.983
biology of cystic fibrosis?

00:38:55.983 --> 00:38:57.327
Could I make a guess?

00:38:57.327 --> 00:38:58.927
Is it a membrane protein?

00:38:58.927 --> 00:39:02.000
Is it not a membrane protein?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.009
And, there are certain
characteristics that would

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:07.141
probably allow you to make a
guess.

00:39:07.141 --> 00:39:10.778
And then, you could jump right
in and start sequencing DNA.

00:39:10.778 --> 00:39:14.289
You could start the experiment
practically that afternoon

00:39:14.289 --> 00:39:16.045
instead of five years later.

00:39:16.045 --> 00:39:19.807
So, if you look back from the
literature, you'll find some of

00:39:19.807 --> 00:39:22.315
the key genes;
in fact, in human biology,

00:39:22.315 --> 00:39:25.826
we're isolated by this very
painful process of positional

00:39:25.826 --> 00:39:28.836
cloning, and you hardly ever
have to do that now.

00:39:28.836 --> 00:39:31.782
It may be the odd case where
something's needed,

00:39:31.782 --> 00:39:34.855
but most of the stuff now,
there are these amazing

00:39:34.855 --> 00:39:38.742
databases, and I'll give you the
URL for it at the beginning of

00:39:38.742 --> 00:39:41.000
next lecture.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.281
And I'll show you when,
this is an experiment in which

00:39:45.281 --> 00:39:48.674
someone took this gene for
cystic fibrosis.

00:39:48.674 --> 00:39:53.116
It is a membrane protein,
and it's one of those proteins

00:39:53.116 --> 00:39:57.317
that mediates the passage of
chloride ions across the

00:39:57.317 --> 00:39:58.044
membrane.

00:39:58.044 --> 00:40:01.841
And, if that gets broken,
you end up with cystic

00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:02.568
fibrosis.

00:40:02.568 --> 00:40:06.849
What someone has done here is
they've taken that green

00:40:06.849 --> 00:40:10.000
fluorescent protein gene.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.809
And, they've fused it to the
end of the cystic fibrosis gene.

00:40:14.809 --> 00:40:18.736
So, you can tell where the
cystic fibrosis gene is

00:40:18.736 --> 00:40:22.824
localized in a lung cell by
looking to see where the

00:40:22.824 --> 00:40:24.106
fluorescence is.

00:40:24.106 --> 00:40:28.755
And, I think you can see that
the fluorescence is out there

00:40:28.755 --> 00:40:31.000
along the membrane.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.860
OK, so at the beginning of next
lecture, I'll introduce you to

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.445
how we take one of these
recombinant plasmids,

00:40:39.445 --> 00:40:42.632
and make what's called a
restriction map.

00:40:42.632 --> 00:40:47.014
It's using a very simple,
little piece of apparatus like

00:40:47.014 --> 00:40:51.396
that, and we'll go in and tell
you about DNA sequencing,

00:40:51.396 --> 00:40:55.619
and this PCR technique you've
heard, preliminary chain

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:58.552
reaction that you've heard so
much about, OK?
