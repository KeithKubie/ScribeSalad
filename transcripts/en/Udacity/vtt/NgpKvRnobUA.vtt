00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.810
Let's have another quick quiz about Subsumption. If we

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.720
consider Branch and Condition Coverage, does it subsume Branch Coverage,

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.512
and therefore Statement Coverage? Or in other words, does branch

00:00:09.512 --> 00:00:12.750
and condition coverage imply branch coverage? Answer yes, or no.
