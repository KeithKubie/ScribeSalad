1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,680
The Joe Rogan experience. Good for
the UFC. It's good for everybody.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,540
Her mom's mind, people say, oh,

3
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:10,370
did you ever think about going Belloto
one and my mind is great fighters

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,060
everywhere right now. I still think the
number one and all of his in the UFC,

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:18,790
number one martial arts and UFC,
and right now that's my goal. Yeah,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,320
that's all great, but I'm here to be the
best. I can go to one and make a killing.

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,270
I go to bed to try and
get my sponsors back,

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,180
but I'm in no rush to leave here
because I want to be the best. Yeah,

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,050
like after I proved that there was
nothing else, and then it's like, okay,

10
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:33,090
now I'm ready for the money.
Then that's maybe an option,

11
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:34,700
but there's no competence

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,840
in terms of prestige. There's no
context. If you get the UFC title,

13
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:39,410
you're the best.

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,900
That's it. There's no question I
got. What about the villa tour?

15
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,440
This isn't is because dibella toy chant,
while especially John Jones absolutely

16
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,190
went on in your division.

17
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,100
You know in your division you have
one of the best guys of all time,

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,440
if not the best guy of all,
Thomas and champion.

19
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,280
So when you see a guy like
John at the top of the heap,

20
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,283
is that,

21
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,240
is that motivating to you to just ramp
up and even harder because you realize

22
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:07,810
that the guy who was a champion in your
division is not just the best light

23
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:10,900
heavyweight of all time, may be the
best martial artists of all time.

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,990
They're ramps up so much like I,
well I'm riding a bike in my basement.

25
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,500
I got the air down bike and a stationary
bike and I got the project and I'm down

26
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:21,140
there only thing on fight pass
and I watching him fight pass.

27
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:23,060
I'm usually watching Jon Jones,
you know,

28
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:25,310
to see him dominate another guys
and that you just hear that bite.

29
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:27,230
You can hear the,
the pedals are putting on weight gain.

30
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:29,990
So I can go from raw some crazy and
like I don't even be looking down at the

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,200
clock and just here had aired
the fam picking up right now.

32
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,680
I didn't realize it till like it goes
to break and I slow it down in our heart

33
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:41,030
rates and not just Washington just like
this. Like I want to get there. I gotta,

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,830
I gotta beat him to be the best, so I
need to work hard for you to take on him.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,610
You can't take away what he does
in the sport. What is his outside?

36
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:53,770
His personal life, that's all he say.
She say, I have my words after the,

37
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,100
the California stuff,

38
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:59,290
we went to two 26 or whatever fight was
in Vegas and got moved here because of

39
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,970
his lifestyle and drug tests
and all that extra stuff.

40
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,450
However you want to code it up, his
past, you know, I'm done with it.

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,490
I had my words there, the fact that
he kept using God and Jesus and this,

42
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:09,921
this and this,

43
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:13,370
and I'm a golfer and got read my Bible
every morning and I don't like the fact

44
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,400
that you can, that he would do
that. I'm like, I'm not want it now.

45
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:19,280
But at the time my worries
was the fact that he did that.

46
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,840
And then at the same time I
want to interview with us.

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,300
I want to thank God and is
that kind of rubbed me wrong.

48
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,700
And then we flew on a plane
together and like I said,

49
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:28,160
I saw the way he was acting
when he came on a plane.

50
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:31,610
Like we not doing this because of him
like all day at a time bothering me and I

51
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:33,920
was a pent up anything else on
mills going into that fight?

52
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,670
That was something on my shoulders.

53
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,350
I have posted something cause when the
UFC called me right before I got on the

54
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:42,620
flight and he's like, oh don't come all
the way to Vegas now I've got my wife,

55
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,320
she's eight months pregnant.
Like she's 30 weeks, whatever.

56
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:47,480
She can't travel after this.
She's struggling.

57
00:02:47,481 --> 00:02:50,720
We all them bags and y'all call me
and I'll say don't come this and this.

58
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:53,150
Go back home. We're going to fly you out
again. Like I'm not doing this again.

59
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,120
And then when they get to they will, we
can get you here but we get you to Cali.

60
00:02:56,121 --> 00:02:58,700
But we can't take your wife
like what? Like, well you,

61
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:02,990
we your ticket in the code you take like
no, fuck that all because Jon Jones,

62
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,030
that's what got me mad that so they're
trying to save money pretty much flying

63
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,990
people because we as all,

64
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,230
we was literally walking down
the wrong way to the plane.

65
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,230
When they call him a can I turn around?
But then when we got like, okay,

66
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:16,320
you come here but we
can get you to category.

67
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,960
We couldn't get you get a wife to Cali.
Like my wife is 30 weeks pregnant.

68
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:21,460
She's here when she's coming like,

69
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,280
well we don't know what to do because
you bought her ticket, isn't it?

70
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:26,560
Like what do you mean you don't know
what to do? Get her another ticket.

71
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,230
Like I paved my family. What about the
people that's on the way right now?

72
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,980
Like God, I got to find the own way
and that maybe around week five,

73
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,010
week of the fight, the thing of the
things that you have to think about,

74
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,980
do you know fucking with,

75
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,050
that's the last thing I'd worry about
God and then I get there and they said,

76
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,630
when you get, make sure you got your
workout. If you don't have your workout,

77
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:47,080
schedule the Pie set already. As
soon as you get there, go do it.

78
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,040
I did mine like a month and a half
ahead of time. I'm all, I'm like I said,

79
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,580
I'm punctured. Like I like
having stuff done. Yeah,

80
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,160
I'm getting ready to go to the piano.
I'm packing my bags and I get a call. Oh,

81
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,090
you can't come to the Pei.
Why?

82
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,080
John just came in and said he wanted
to work out so we closed the gym down.

83
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,900
You're not allowed.
Y'All call me two months ago.

84
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:07,270
Told me to set my schedule
to come ahead of time.

85
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,460
I'm really get ready to walk
to my Uber that's outside.

86
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:13,270
And you said I can't come now. Like
I, sorry. Nothing we can do is John,

87
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,830
why can't you work out the same place
with John's working on the same thing when

88
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,110
connoisseur and I'm there in
the summer and kind of show up.

89
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:23,440
They're coming until there. But you gotta
leave like just throw. Yeah. Really.

90
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,670
You all got and kindness. I just got
locked up on the sidewalk come. Yeah,

91
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,080
they have security guards block
the stairs off and everything.

92
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,630
Yes. Yeah, exactly.

93
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,820
And like you heard somebody say big place.
Yeah,

94
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,370
but you can go to the
cardio room and the weights,

95
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:43,120
but you can't use the upstairs with
the cage in the bag and stuff is,

96
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,660
you can't use the,
if he's in the cage security best there,

97
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:51,010
so you can't go up there. Oh fuck. Is that
about mass jazz to people? I don't know.

98
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,990
My Pete, I'm an independent contractor
sir. But yeah, like that stuff.

99
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:00,070
It kind of rubbed me wrong and
that's what I was kind of like,

100
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,870
if I was a champ I wouldn't
want that. No. Yeah,

101
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,910
I mean I want people to be able to see
what I'm doing. Security, I don't know.

102
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,450
You know, you got to think about how
much death threats that guy must get,

103
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,200
how much shit he must take. You
know, and he's just popular as he is,

104
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,190
as famous as he is,

105
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,580
maybe just has overzealous security maybe
and they just want to tighten it down.

106
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,610
So they didn't want anybody up there.
They kept was.

107
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,650
So that was the first time I've
ever cursed at a UFC employee.

108
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,360
Like [inaudible] I was Kurt like going
on like y'all want me to change my whole

109
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,280
workout scheduled fight week.
I'm cutting weight too.

110
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:33,270
You know like it's not just
John like we understand bit,

111
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,960
I'm going to fuck up at night, I
don't care. What are you doing?

112
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:35,940
I need to go up there and get a workout.

113
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,560
My coach's meeting me there from the
airport but we can't do it antibiotic

114
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:38,950
corridors.

115
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,680
And the guy kept hanging up cause I was
going on that is when her and call her

116
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:42,730
back and I was like Yo.

117
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:45,060
And then people would hit me up like
I'm glad you actually voicing it.

118
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:46,720
So I'm hearing around the PR right now,

119
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,570
everybody talking about how you're mad
if somebody texts like I'm glad you

120
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,750
actually speaking out cause everybody
else kind of like, okay. Like no,

121
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,080
like if it wasn't for my wife being there,
I probably wouldn't check the same.

122
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,790
But I see the way she's struggling to
carry this belly around. She's hurt.

123
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,880
She's eight months. She could just
give birth at any time. So the,

124
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,860
I'm sure it's like all that and my
baby's Miller's. Sure. Really? Yeah.

125
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,230
It was revving me up and my wife
can't like Cory just stop, calm down.

126
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,520
It'll be okay. This isn't this. Like,

127
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,370
I think the fact of being okay with
the fact that they laid in one person

128
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,750
dictate at all. Like we're all equal
and I treat it as like a number.

129
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:25,340
He's Jon Jones, but we're number
4,722 right. You know what I mean?

130
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:29,120
I don't like that. He's John. I'm Corey.
Like I was telling wheel on the way here.

131
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,850
Reason. I love rose number units
cause I've never seen that from her.

132
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,781
She's a champ.

133
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,710
But you would see her and she act just
like rose before when she was in Invictus

134
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,700
did.
She doesn't change.

135
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,080
I don't want to have special
treatment from her or from anybody.

136
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,850
If I was a champ,
treat me the same.

137
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,060
You know what I mean is some
people are different I guess.

138
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:49,920
I don't know if it's John or his camp
doe is doing it or UFC is doing or

139
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,960
security or what,

140
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,850
but it rubbed me wrong that
we aren't equal anymore.

141
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,000
No, that's understandable. But that's
also got to give you some motivation.

142
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,360
Exactly. I got 'em told
them in the area. Other one,

143
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,700
I'll sit on the plane and I was really
directly behind Jon Jones. I see said,

144
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:06,230
hey Bob and Sally just looking.

145
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,140
I looked at my wife and
she's like struggling like
falling asleep but struggle

146
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:11,270
to fall asleep. I looked at the top
of his head, the back of his head.

147
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,320
I was just like, it's time for change the
torch. Like my brother always said like,

148
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:17,300
you're good and you know
you can be there by about,

149
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:19,820
I feel like when I come to those
top guys like John Jones and Gus,

150
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:23,570
you doubt yourself just a little bit.
You ain't sure that you can get them yet.

151
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,680
You know you're good.

152
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:27,660
But you feel like this was before
like before they leave fight,

153
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,920
you get there and you, you feel like
you don't think you're ready for that.

154
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,770
But I'm telling a wash you bro, I
know that you may have, you can do it.

155
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:37,370
And I sat there and saw him Baba and all
the frustration going through my mind.

156
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:40,820
Six o'clock in the morning we had to
get up and catch a plane cause his guys

157
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,080
isn't necessarily show up on time.

158
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:45,200
He still was late to that
and they was just like, I,

159
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:47,390
if I'm the champ I don't want this.
Yeah,

160
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,710
I mean I don't want no special treatment.

161
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,580
If you tell me sign up ahead of
time and keep your scheduled.

162
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,360
I expect that if we get down to scale
first come first. So first come,

163
00:07:56,361 --> 00:07:59,180
first serve. If I show up
late, put me in the order I am,

164
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,200
don't put me up front because I'm the
chance because I was the first or second

165
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:06,350
person there. I'm on my way to scale
and John was walking down the stairs,

166
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:06,981
fully dressed.

167
00:08:06,981 --> 00:08:09,830
We went back to the commission room
and I remember people in blue shirt

168
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,290
campaigns like hold up, hold up.
Now all the sudden John come in,

169
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,540
he could do all the paperwork,
he wants scale and he was out.

170
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,690
He was the last person down.
How's the, he's first like,

171
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:20,300
it wasn't that big of a deal,
but the fact that I don't like that.

172
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,640
Well it's because he's headline
in the card, right? Yeah.

173
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,210
Giving them special tree is John Jones.
There was,

174
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,410
I got the phone with this John Jones.
They hang up like, I don't like that.

175
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,540
It's still, he's still a person. Well,

176
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,950
he's a great person to be Corey Anderson.

177
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,260
Hundred percent it's coriander and
changed the tide. It's coriander score.

178
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:42,230
Annison but treat me know, don't
give me treatment. Beautiful.

179
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:46,010
That you have that attitude. What? When
you look at John, you look at John Skills,

180
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,380
like what do you think you need to do,

181
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,820
if anything different in your life or
in your training or where do you need to

182
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:57,020
get to where you think you could beat
him? Just keep getting better. Leo.

183
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:01,720
The TFA five must've been a big
boost. 400% every fight. Lash,

184
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,780
every fight. Even the ones I
lost it. I had been a boost.

185
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,840
Could you go back and seek,
tell me a fight. I've been
getting beat up Joe, right?

186
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,980
I've never been a fight where somebody,
they're all core. You're too smart.

187
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:10,500
You're not good.

188
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,410
There's never been one fight in my career
where somebody straight manhandled me

189
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:17,550
and push me around. You know what I mean?
I talk about this, this and this. Uh,

190
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,200
he's the greatest issue.
The greatest day.

191
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,660
I was watching the UFC main event last
night hotel and they had Dick Glover,

192
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,590
Rasha fight and this and this and this
note and closes clover that globally as

193
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,130
Glover's at nothing like upbeat,
Degas, you know, I use on,

194
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,520
you're talking about hope. Don't give
a little tip or Johnny Walker Blue TV.

195
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:34,740
He's super good. This is
nice. But at the same time,

196
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,560
I was thinking when you said it, but what
about Korea? And I was like, here we go.

197
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,630
Finally.
Somebody's always got to talk.

198
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:42,270
They talk about how good these guys
not in beat them all. You're like,

199
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:44,820
I'm that guy coming into the radar
and they don't expect me to do nothing

200
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:49,350
because I lost the Gian Volante my third
four fight, UFC two years of my career.

201
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,030
You know what I mean?
Uh,

202
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,860
Jimmy man with Jimmy Ma told wheel
on the way here to Jimmy Manual.

203
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,420
I was the only fight.
I will say a guy beat me.

204
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,040
He didn't man handle me,

205
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,730
but in my head from his highlights
and it's like you said on Instagram,

206
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,090
Breen comments, and I'll let what people
were saying in reading and seeing,

207
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:11,190
get in my head to think that if there's
got touches me, he's gonna put me out.

208
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,170
And where are you going?
So fight thinking there.

209
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,280
I literally got touched in my mind
was already set. Like if I get hit,

210
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:20,580
I'm going out. And I,
I think subconsciously,

211
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,630
like I have myself so doubted
that when he hit me in my mind,

212
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,920
just like in panic kind of shut down
because I remember when I hit the mat,

213
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,860
like I wasn't, I was abroad.
I remember I was out.

214
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,040
But I remember seeing his feet walk away
and I remember when I can see clearly

215
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,820
and I thought to myself, it happened
exactly what I'll put them on my,

216
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,150
if I got hit, it happened and
that's right. That was it. Yeah.

217
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:44,460
It was like I can take,
I can take it to anybody.

218
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,720
And I think Osp was more dangerous
than Jimmy because he can kick,

219
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:52,080
he explosiveness isn't the amp punch now
did everything right and just slipped

220
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:55,200
into the punch the wrong way. But I
was manhandling don't put three rounds.

221
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,440
I mean, it's simple mistakes because
I didn't have the discipline yet.

222
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,430
In three years of my career I hadn't
learned the discipline and focus that it's

223
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:05,580
a 15 minute fight. Right? I
can win 12 minutes of it all,

224
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,080
but one mistake and it's all gone.

225
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,660
Well, the experience of making those
mistakes and realizing what they are. And,

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,670
and then when those moments come up again,
and you deviate from the game plan,

227
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,570
and you do go to your right
and you do move the wrong
direction, you know, you'll,

228
00:11:19,571 --> 00:11:22,400
you'll catch yourself.
You'll realize it's,

229
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,400
it's the experience of competition
for a fighter is there's nothing that

230
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,420
substitutes it. He could have great
talent. You can have a great mindset,

231
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:34,470
but the experience of
competition is like nothing else.
