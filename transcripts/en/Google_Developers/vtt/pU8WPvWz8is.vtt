[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.870
JENNY GOVE: So good morning.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.040
My name's Jenny Gove and
I'm a lead researcher

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.845
on the Google Pay team.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.220
BRANDON HERRING:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.525
I'm Brandon Herring and I'm
the design lead for Google Pay.

00:00:17.525 --> 00:00:18.900
JENNY GOVE: And
today we're going

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.530
to look at how to design great
payment experiences with Google

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.520
Pay.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.800
We're going to cover what
we've learned with partner

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.440
integrations and
integrating Google Pay

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.630
into some of our own
products, and we'll

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.050
talk about how you can
easily create great checkout

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.460
experiences to
get great results.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.030
Through watching many usability
studies over the years,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.030
I'm well aware that
e-commerce experiences

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.110
can be the high points
of frustration for users.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.510
That's because they're
often the low points

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.690
of the entire
shopping experience.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.640
There's friction everywhere.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.980
You start typing in information,
but something's wrong, right?

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.660
Red errors appear in
the forms, addresses

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.970
don't match so you try again.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.510
You add your credit card
number, but it's wrong.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.640
And so you try that again.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.820
You need to create an
account, but the password

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.834
isn't strong enough
and you get told that

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:18.000
and you need to think again.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.200
Or the two passwords don't match
or you already have a password

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.530
but you can't remember it.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.440
Every one of these
experiences represents

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.670
an opportunity for a user
to decide it's not worth it.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.550
At every red error, at
every point of friction,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.710
users can abandon
their purchase.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.980
This results in lost sales
for retailers and lots

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.300
of irritation for users.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.720
In fact, we recently
did an audit

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.840
in Europe of more
than 400 top sites

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.580
and found that very many
of the basic things that we

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.730
should do correctly for forms
are not being implemented.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.550
For example, we found
that 46% of top sites

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.820
don't implement error
messaging in real time.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.050
So when users make an error,
they don't know about it

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.170
until they go to hit the Submit
button, and then they're told.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.990
And then they have to look
for where that error is.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.600
It means that almost
half of the top sites

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.240
don't optimize their error
messaging for ease of use.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.220
And we found that 29% of sites
don't allow users to navigate

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.040
back and forth in the flow--
perhaps in the checkout

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.600
experience--

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.710
without losing information
that they've already entered.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.560
So these types of issues
lead to much frustration

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.300
for users who are trying to
complete their transaction.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.360
So it's no wonder that
69% of digital carts

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.260
are abandoned before the
purchase has been completed.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.990
These numbers represent
a significant opportunity

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.510
to improve the
experience for consumers

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.560
and to create checkout
flows that bring

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.060
delight in their simplicity.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.580
Earlier this year, we
announced that we've

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.120
unified our payment
systems and products

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.270
under one brand, Google Pay.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.370
And today, we want
to talk to you

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.200
about how Google Pay is changing
the way people pay for things

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.790
online and in stores.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.850
BRANDON HERRING: So Google
Pay gives users one place

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.760
to easily manage all
their payment information.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.580
From seeing the cards
and keeping sure

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.620
that they're up to date
to seeing their latest

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.780
transactions, Google
Pay is giving users

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.220
a flexible and comprehensive
digital wallet.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.510
And users, they can leverage
this account information

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.420
to speed through checkout, in
apps, online, and in-store.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.930
The app already has more
than 100 million installs,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.040
which is incredible.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.690
That's enabling top merchants
from DoorDash to Lyft to Airbnb

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.180
and a lot more to enable
seamless checkouts

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.490
for their users.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.770
And Google Pay is
powering transactions

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.390
across our first
party properties,

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.230
from the Google Assistant to
the Play Store, Chrome, YouTube,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.100
and more.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.110
When developers
implement Google Pay,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.420
they can create experiences
without payment forms,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.900
super easy for users,
really easy for developers

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.040
to implement.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.160
And users, with a payment method
linked to their Google account,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.170
can checkout instantly anywhere
they see the Google Pay button.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.450
And because hundreds of
millions of payment methods

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.460
are already saved to
Google accounts today,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.930
developers can
start to implement

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.800
this solution across the
globe immediately and deliver

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.670
at Google scale.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.800
With Google Pay,
users are instantly

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.190
ready to check out the first
time they visit an app or site

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.149
or even in a guest
check out flow.

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:55.940
They no longer need to
add a payment method

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.300
to every single merchant that
they want to transact with,

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.530
they can zip through check
out quickly and easily.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.780
And with less friction, the
user experience has improved,

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.660
users are happier, and
transactions increase.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.490
And we're seeing this
already validated

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.740
with a lot of our partners.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.420
Hotel Tonight has
found that customers

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.130
who were enabled
with Google Pay were

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.130
65% more likely to
complete a booking flow,

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.070
and Airbnb has seen their
traction volume jump

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.514
11 times since implementing the
latest version of Google Pay.

00:05:27.514 --> 00:05:29.680
And Jenny is going to tell
us a little bit about how

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.760
we got there.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.220
JENNY GOVE: Thank you, Brandon.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.920
So we're going to
talk about some

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.560
of the best principles
that went into creating

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.370
Google Pay, the practices
around how you can develop

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.820
great checkout experiences
with the system effectively,

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.970
and a little bit about
how Google Pay is enabling

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.940
assistive transactions
with voice.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.360
Because consumer products
are dependent on the user

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.080
experience, we started with
a user-focused approach

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.650
to meet those needs.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.830
We began defining
an overall vision

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.230
of what we wanted
to do to create

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.550
safe and easy check out
experiences for everyone

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.500
everywhere.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.570
We informed our vision
through conducting

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.950
foundational research and
then we carried our learnings

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.430
from this into our design work.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.590
And then we iterated
on the designs,

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.660
all infomed through user
testing and usability testing.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.430
And we published
developer guidelines

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.380
for our community of developers.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.140
We're continuing to update
and improve and optimize

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.880
our platform for consumers
and for developers.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.870
Let's look at this
user-centered approach

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.295
again with more specifics
about the activities

00:06:43.295 --> 00:06:46.290
that we took for each phase.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.230
So our first step involved
conducting research

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.930
to understand the
broader picture,

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.780
the users needs around
payments and their lives.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.720
And we visited different
regions across the globe.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.180
We went to Europe and
North and South America

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.500
and we visited Asia and we
explored users payment methods

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.920
and needs through
conducting research there.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.580
We learned about the importance
of speed and efficiency,

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.710
security and privacy.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.440
And these learnings have
really shaped the design work

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.820
that we've done for Google Pay.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.120
Taking these learnings, we
established a set of principles

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.350
and created a design system
that would meet those needs.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.370
And we tested our designs
with usability studies.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.310
In key phases of the
product development,

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.920
we ran studies every
two weeks, iterating

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.640
as we uncovered issues and
we could make improvements

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.020
to the product.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.120
We dedicated ourselves
to the details

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.620
and to getting it
right with our users.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.730
We also iterated through
conducting live experiments

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.720
with our partners, and used
this data in a complementary way

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.970
to inform our design decisions.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.460
Based on all our learnings
throughout this process,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.920
we published guidelines
for developers

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.230
in order to take
advantage of this work

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.805
and make implementation
clear and easy.

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:12.430
BRANDON HERRING: So let's take
a look at some of the principles

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.930
that we established that guided
us through the process Jenny

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.150
just talked about.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.600
First and foremost,
Google Pay has to be fast.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.670
We know users want a
quick and easy checkout

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.240
flow and experience online.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.870
We want to remove that friction
with a lightweight UI that's

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.500
super intuitive to use
and easy for users.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.180
And we've seen this in practice.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.679
With Game Time,
which is an app that

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:37.470
lets users purchase tickets
for events and concerts

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:40.620
they want to go to, Google
Pay is front and center

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.890
the moment a user encounters
an event they want to attend.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.220
Even before they've signed in,
they're already ready to pay.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.460
Because of this, users can check
out and purchase their tickets

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.350
in only two taps.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.250
Google Pay loads
a lightweight UI

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.330
that shows them their
account, the payment

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.560
method they're going to use.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.660
One more tap, they're done.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.330
It's really fast,
it's super easy.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.070
And that means for
Game Time users,

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.611
all they really need to
worry about is whether or not

00:09:07.611 --> 00:09:10.110
their favorite team is going
to make the playoffs this year.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:15.320
And I'm optimistic about mine,
so fingers crossed there.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.780
This is obviously
great for users,

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.180
but this efficiency
also leads to results.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.480
Game Time found that
users who had Google Pay

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.880
were two times higher
to convert than users

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.260
who just had a payment
card saved to Game Time.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.800
So in other words,
even when the user

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.470
has a payment method already
saved with a merchant,

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.384
the seamlessness that
Google Pay can offer

00:09:35.384 --> 00:09:36.800
leads to a higher
conversion rate.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:41.590
The second principle
was around scale.

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.600
So this meant a
few things to us.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.820
We needed to address
a global audience,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.107
we needed to support a
variety of payment methods.

00:09:48.107 --> 00:09:49.690
We also needed to
create a place where

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.180
users can update their payment
information once and have

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.742
it available anywhere
they sign in.

00:09:54.742 --> 00:09:56.200
And of course, we
also need to make

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.770
sure we're supporting more than
just the Android ecosystem,

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.270
that we're across browser and
we're across OS, some of which

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:04.180
we announced this week.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.650
So we have to enable users to
check out quickly and easily,

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.090
no matter where they are.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.590
With our first
party integrations,

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.470
we already support a wide
variety of payment methods.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:16.590
And we're bringing this
scalability to developers,

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.139
letting users pick
however they want to pay,

00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:21.180
from leveraging all the
payment methods they have

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.670
on file with Google
to new experiences,

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:26.940
like eMoney for in-store in
Japan and Paypal for in-store.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.130
We make it really easy to
implement localized buttons.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:36.684
That lets developers
reach a global audience.

00:10:36.684 --> 00:10:38.850
And we've made it really
easy to manage your payment

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:39.660
methods too.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.640
Now users can update
that information

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.910
in the Google Pay
app, iOS or Android,

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.060
or on the Google Pay web and
have that immediately available

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.867
anywhere they're signed in.

00:10:49.867 --> 00:10:51.450
This is a huge win
for users, but it's

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.240
a really big win for
developers, because it ensures

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.160
that a user's payment
information is going

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.590
to be available and
work on any app or site

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:01.840
that they want to transact with.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.180
And of course, Google Pay
needs to work anywhere

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.240
they can access their Google
account, so across operating

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.250
systems from Android to iOS--

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.470
which we just
announced-- and browsers

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.650
beyond just Chrome, but into
Safari, Firefox, and more,

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.300
enabling people to
check out regardless

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.430
of browser preference
or device preference.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.554
This expands the reach
that developers have

00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:21.970
and it increases
the user benefit.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.340
JENNY GOVE: Now we know
from conducting research

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.720
that one of the single
biggest concerns that users

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.870
have with digital payments
is around security.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.810
And we've worked
hard to give users

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.830
the security, transparency,
and control they need to feel

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:45.680
confident in each transaction.

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.090
The importance of
security, as I mentioned,

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:52.160
comes up again and
again in user research.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:57.050
We know that it's both important
to be secure but also to convey

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.240
that security to users.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.960
With Google Pay, we meet
these needs from the base up,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.270
from secure storage
infrastructure,

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.390
card tokenization,
and authentication,

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.210
through communications
such as notification

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.910
and supplemental technologies
such as device security.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.240
So let's take a closer look.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:21.170
As you'd expect, Google Pay
rests on Google's secure data

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.740
storage infrastructure, using
industry standard encryption

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:27.920
to keep your payment
details safe.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.820
For transactions, we support
and encourage tokenization

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.350
for install and
online use cases.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.890
Users transacting with cards
issued from supporting banks

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.090
can tokenize these
in the Google Pay app

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:43.730
and then transmit a
virtual account number--

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.100
the token-- instead
of the real one

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.500
when they pay at
participating merchants.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.890
We've also worked with payment
gateways and processors,

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:56.530
to securely transmit
payment credentials online.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:59.290
But beyond the actual
underlying technology,

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.600
it's important to
reinforce security

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.520
through conveying
information about

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.010
transactions transparently.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.740
We provide transaction
notifications

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.230
for supporter cards,
so consumers know

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.250
if a transaction is being made.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.440
Notifications is
just one of the ways

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.530
that we're communicating
transactions to users.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:22.170
We're also combining
the transaction history

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.920
across Google properties, your
website and apps and stores,

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.830
into a single place, on our
mobile and web platforms.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.700
And this provides a new
destination for users

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:36.300
to view their transactions.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.820
Device security is
also important to users

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.530
when considering payments.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.740
Android users can use the
Find my Device Service

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.950
to remotely locate a
lost device, of course,

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.920
and one that's associated
with a Google account.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.910
And then, they can secure
that device immediately,

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.670
remotely from a distance.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.950
And in terms of
user authentication,

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:01.630
we're currently exploring
different practices.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:03.750
For example in the
Play Store, we've

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:06.720
implemented user control
options for the scheduling

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.870
of authentication,
as you can see here.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.540
Users can choose to
authenticate on purchases

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:16.140
on Google Play on their device
and set a schedule for when

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.690
this happens.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.360
And there's the option
to switch from password

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.060
to fingerprint authentication
as they purchase.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.460
Here you can see this
option in Settings

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.590
and a request for a
password to confirm that.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.620
And in the third
screen, the confirmation

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.150
that the fingerprint
authentication

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.260
has been selected.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:38.190
The user now has their new
fingerprint authentication

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.750
option as they purchase.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:43.050
So we're giving users
security, but also convenience

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:46.230
within their checkout flow.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.100
Google Pay is secured
in multiple ways

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.650
and we're continually learning
about and improving the way

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.350
we convey that security
to our consumers,

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.960
so that they can
transact with confidence.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.300
And all of this
means that when users

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:03.200
see Google Pay in your
app or on your site,

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.200
they're more likely to
choose it as a way to pay,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.130
because they trust it to handle
their transactions securely,

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.330
as well as quickly and easily.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.850
The last principle that
we're going to review here

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.080
is about delivering an
experience that's unified.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.760
We've unified our
services and we've also

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.920
made it simpler for
users to get started

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.890
and to pay anywhere with
their Google account.

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.910
Specifically, we've created
a singular destination,

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:36.970
which brings together all
of the payment activity

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.070
under this unified brand.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.550
And in addition, we've
added new payment use cases

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.970
and functionality to our app.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.890
When we talked about
security just now,

00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:51.370
we talked about user experience
principle of transparency

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:52.710
being important.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.900
And one way we're achieving
this through Google Pay

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.300
is with this
unified destination,

00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:01.330
for users to see and manage
their payment information

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.860
and activity.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:05.080
Having an overview for
transactions and payment

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.710
methods gives users a lot of
peace of mind, we've found.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.110
With the Google Pay app,
we've brought together

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.680
all the functionality relevant
to people's broader payment

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.610
experiences.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.610
The home screen of
the Google Pay app

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.130
shows the users
in-store payment methods

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.970
as well as helpful information,
like their latest transactions

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.730
that they've made, and
contextual information

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:33.260
like nearby places that they
can use stored loyalty cards

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.450
or stored gift cards.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.880
With Google Pay, users
now have the ability

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.440
to see and manage all of
their payment information,

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.090
from tokens for
in-store payments

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:46.860
to payment methods
they've already

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.050
stored in their Google account.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.510
This is also where
users can fix anything

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.530
that requires their attention,
such as updating existing cards

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:59.510
or adding new cards
to their account.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:03.200
In addition to storing
merchant loyalty cards,

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.140
Google Pay now stores tickets.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.440
So concert tickets,
sporting tickets,

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.030
and train and plane tickets.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:16.190
These can all now be kept
in one easy to find place,

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.819
and they can be redeemed
through barcodes or NFC.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:24.480
Peer-to-peer payment
functionality will also soon

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.020
be fully integrated into
Google Pay, making it easier

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:33.450
to pay friends back or family
back for shared expenses.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:36.420
And recently, we've
launched new experiences

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.170
supporting mobile transit
in cities like London,

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.380
Las Vegas, and Portland.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.520
And additional
transit agencies are

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.230
coming on board, such as tram,
metro, rail, and bus systems

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:54.100
in Birmingham and the entirety
of the West Midlands in the UK.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:56.730
Including support for
activities like transit,

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.430
loyalty, and paying
friends, means

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.640
that Google Pay can be
relied upon by hundreds

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.370
of millions of users as
a daily transaction tool.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:09.570
And in this, we're
building invested users

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:15.080
and a trusted ecosystem for
your businesses to rely on.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.480
And this adds up to a
comprehensive payment

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.150
solution that
keeps users engaged

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:24.162
and they're ready
to pay anywhere.

00:18:24.162 --> 00:18:25.120
BRANDON HERRING: Great.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.130
So I want to do a
quick demo, just

00:18:27.130 --> 00:18:29.380
to show how quick
you can actually

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.360
check out with Google Pay.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:35.950
So if you could switch
to the demo, please.

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.080
So I'm going to
use DoorDash today.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.250
And Jenny, are you
getting hungry yet?

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.740
It's a little early, but--

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.840
JENNY GOVE: Yeah, something
for lunch would be great.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840
BRANDON HERRING: All right.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.340
Let's see.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.590
So we'll get some Mexican food.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:48.430
All right.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.260
And I've never added a
payment method to this app,

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:55.180
so I'm just going
to get going here.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.701
We'll do a quesadilla,
maybe veggie.

00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:00.232
Add that.

00:19:00.232 --> 00:19:01.440
JENNY GOVE: That sounds good.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:02.898
Can we have something
with chicken?

00:19:02.898 --> 00:19:04.050
BRANDON HERRING: Yes.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:11.290
How about let's do a
burrito with chicken.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.910
Sounds good.

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.100
All right, I'm going
to add that to my cart.

00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:19.380
And so now, I'm
going to go check out

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.430
my cart and everything
there looks great.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.430
So I'm going to check out.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:29.835
And this is the point where
as a user, I start to sweat.

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:31.460
My heart rate goes
up, right, because I

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.920
know there's a form
that's going to ask

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.330
for all this information.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.619
But when I look
here, I'm actually

00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:40.160
already ready to pay because I
have Google Pay on this phone.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:45.040
So I'm going to just
place the order.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.632
And that's it.

00:19:46.632 --> 00:19:48.090
I'm actually not
going to continue,

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.680
because I don't think we'll
get to where this food's going

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.030
to be delivered in time.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:55.120
But if I hit this button,
the burritos are on the way.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:58.680
So if we can switch
back to the slides now.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.950
Thank you.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.320
So I just want to highlight
a couple of things

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.680
that I think DoorDash did
pretty well on this flow.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.590
First when I looked
at my cart, they

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.180
surfaced all the
relevant details

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.940
and they made it
really easy to review.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:16.220
This is a really critical
step to make sure you're not

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.060
surprising users.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.700
And I'm actually going to talk
a little more about this later.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.260
But they made it
really easy to see

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.009
what I'd ordered, if
I had special orders,

00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:25.730
if I made any special requests,
fees associated with that,

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.360
the tax, delivery, et cetera.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.370
And then when I
got to check out,

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:32.260
they just defaulted
me to Google Pay.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.144
As a user, I didn't
have to think about it.

00:20:34.144 --> 00:20:36.310
I didn't have to say, oh,
maybe I'll try Google Pay.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.630
It just was already
there and it worked.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.050
This is a huge benefit to
having to avoid check out,

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.570
having to make users
think about it, right?

00:20:43.570 --> 00:20:46.347
It avoided forms and it
kept the entire flow really,

00:20:46.347 --> 00:20:46.930
really smooth.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:52.870
Of course, you can start to
leverage this immediately with

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.410
the site g.co/pay/developers.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.640
That's got all the API
details for you to check out.

00:21:02.408 --> 00:21:04.300
JENNY GOVE: All right.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.350
Now unfortunately,
we know of course

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:10.000
that forms aren't going away.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.790
But when a user does
encounter a payment form,

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.550
we've made lots of
improvements to the experience

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:20.510
and made auto-fill an
integral part of Google Pay.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.620
Users really appreciate it
when websites save them time

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:29.460
by automatically filling common
form fields, things like names,

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.330
addresses, and credit
card information.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:35.570
And so auto-fill helps
to bypass all those input

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.550
errors we talked about before.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.590
And these can be, as
you know, particularly

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:44.950
prevalent on virtual
keyboards and small devices.

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.090
Chrome has billions of
30-day active devices

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:50.570
around the world.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:55.420
And those users of those
devices are already checking out

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:57.490
with merchants online.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.120
And so this is a
significant pathway

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.640
to enabling seamless
payments everywhere

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.300
a user is signed into Google.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.370
Our research found
that by correctly

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.700
using auto-complete
attributes on your forms,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:14.550
users complete them
up to 30% faster.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.420
So by ensuring the auto-complete
process is working correctly,

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:23.340
you can improve the online
experience for your users.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:25.740
As developers, you can
give hints to the browser

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.050
by providing both
the name attribute

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:31.920
and the auto-complete
attribute on each input element

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.840
to help data to be
auto-completed correctly.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.600
Auto-complete attribute values
are part of the current WoT WG

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.850
html standard.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.730
Commonly used auto-complete
attributes are shown here.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:52.490
And you can find these at
the link provided here.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.290
Now, here are the specific
attributes for credit cards.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:58.660
One thing to take note
of is that the attribute

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:02.560
for the verification
or security code

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.690
is CC-CSC, standing
for Card Security Code.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.080
It's not CCCVC or anything else.

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.420
We see that sometimes.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.680
And that simple issue
can cause auto-fill

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.930
not to work appropriately.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.450
So let's make sure you
get that one right.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.210
And let me also walk you
through another example

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:27.240
of a common mistake we
see made with auto-fill.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.640
Now, a user experience
best practice

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.520
is to label form fields
outside of the fields,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.620
like you can see here.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:37.260
And that's really good because
it's this permanent reference

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.480
for the user of the
type of information

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.970
that's needed in that field.

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.370
Form fields also
have placeholders,

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:46.590
text that's shown in
the field that typically

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:48.840
give examples of
the sorts of data

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.820
that would be placed there.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.730
We've seen developers use
fake placeholders instead

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.970
of using placeholder attributes,
and then use JavaScript

00:23:56.970 --> 00:23:58.860
to remove that value.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.870
And this makes it
hard for auto-fill

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.970
to determine if the
user had inputted

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:07.470
the values versus it being
default text in the field.

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.680
And it results in the fields
not being auto-filled.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.810
So that's another
one to watch out

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:15.630
for and make sure you use
that placeholder attribute

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.280
appropriately.

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:21.430
So by implementing these
attributes correctly,

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:24.850
you can help ensure that
users don't experience errors

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.460
as their form
information is filled in.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.520
More information on
auto-complete attributes

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.010
and some of the errors
that commonly occur--

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.630
we've got a list of them there--

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:38.570
some best practices can
be found at this link.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.750
So now we've talked about
users using their cards

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.700
from Google Pay via auto-fill.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.590
Let's talk about
how we get cards

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:47.910
into Google Pay vis auto-fill.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.150
When a user fills out a form,
their credit card information

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.370
is saved to their
Google account, which

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.440
ensures that next
time, the user is

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.030
ready to pay without having to
add any card information again.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.770
And this saves
the user very much

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.900
time and effort in checking out.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.590
It reduces the number of
abandoned checkout experiences

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.640
and it grows the
ecosystem, of course,

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:13.110
beyond the hundreds and
millions of cards already saved

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:15.570
to Google accounts.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.030
By aligning auto-fill
with Google Pay,

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.730
we're ensuring users know
that the auto-fill payment

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:25.110
information is coming
from their Google account.

00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:28.620
The end result is
millions of more people

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.490
are users who are ready to pay,
enabling frictionless checkout

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.485
experiences for users
and merchants globally.

00:25:35.485 --> 00:25:36.360
And that's a win-win.

00:25:39.582 --> 00:25:41.540
BRANDON HERRING: So how
can you, as developers,

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.800
take full advantage
of Google Pay?

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.069
Jenny just walked through some
really great examples of how

00:25:47.069 --> 00:25:49.610
auto-fill can really improve
the experience when you leverage

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:51.470
it right and you
fill it out correctly

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:54.140
and you set it up in a way
that's going to work for users.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.660
Integrating the button is going
to make that more seamless.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.630
Because even though auto-fill
is awesome, it's still forms.

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.600
And Google Pay bypasses
forms all together.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.370
And so to be effective,
there are a couple

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:06.520
of things that I
want to talk through,

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.390
that you guys can keep
in mind when you're

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:11.460
designing with Google Pay.

00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.030
So first, we covered this,
it's really worth reiterating.

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:18.270
Make Google Pay the default
payment method for users

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.477
when they're new to
your site or app.

00:26:21.477 --> 00:26:23.310
By doing this, you're
going to really create

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:27.960
that truly magical experience
where payment just happens.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.300
And it's not just
they had to do it.

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:32.820
When they're done, they say,
that was awesome, right?

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.620
Users don't have to do
anything and they're

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.620
ready to pay before
they even sign in.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.430
Which leads to my next point.

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.640
Another really easy way
to streamline the payment

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.740
experience is to allow
a guest check out

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.450
option for your customers.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.480
Account creation slows
down the process.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.280
It's another form to fill out.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:54.030
It leads to more frustration
and card abandonment.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.240
There was a recent study from
its called the Baymard Research

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.730
Institute, they're an e-commerce
research organization.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.940
They found that forced account
creation was the second biggest

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.210
reason for card abandonment.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.730
So the second biggest reason.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.690
So it's a very real threat
to your transaction volume.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.190
And when you integrate Google
Pay into your guest check out,

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:15.430
you just make it really easy for
users to get through and get on

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:16.150
with it.

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.525
They don't have
to think about it

00:27:17.525 --> 00:27:19.220
and they can complete
that transaction.

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.220
Once they have a
successful transaction,

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.140
then prompt them to
create an account.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.039
But if you can reduce
that initial friction,

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:26.830
it's really going to
significantly increase

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:27.794
your conversions.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.760
Make sure you display all
relevant transaction details.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.472
You know, when a user sees the
drawer for Google Pay, that's

00:27:36.472 --> 00:27:38.680
often the last thing they
see before the transaction,

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.840
as we saw in the demo.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.180
So before they do that, you
really want to make sure

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.060
you're eliminating
any surprises, any tax

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.910
that exists, fees, et cetera.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:52.190
In that same study from
the Baymard Institute

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.370
that I referenced, they
found that 23% of users

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.860
abandon purchases because
they didn't see the total cost

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:58.940
upfront.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.190
So that's one in four, folks.

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.500
So again, another really
easy thing you can do that's

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.390
just going to have an impact.

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.700
This example here
is from Fancy, which

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.270
is an online shopping site.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.310
It shows a really
good example of them

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.120
creating a really scannable,
I can see my shipping cost.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:16.739
And there's tax and the total
and I can see the amount

00:28:16.739 --> 00:28:17.780
and it's all right there.

00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:19.071
I don't have to think too much.

00:28:19.071 --> 00:28:21.650
It verifies what
I know to be true.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.530
And they're also showing that
I'm going to pay with Google.

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:26.870
And in this case,
they're even showing

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.020
that I'm going to use my Amex.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.210
So that's another
important point

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:34.019
that you can minimize
user confusion

00:28:34.019 --> 00:28:36.310
if you can surface the payment
method that they're also

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.197
using with Google Pay.

00:28:38.197 --> 00:28:40.030
This is especially
important when users have

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.825
more than one card on file.

00:28:41.825 --> 00:28:44.200
There are a lot of ways you
can display this information.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.960
You can use the Google
Pay mark with the card,

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.030
you can simply have
it in a text string.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.275
Whatever kind of works
for your site, your app.

00:28:52.275 --> 00:28:54.400
But it is a really important
thing that you can do,

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.750
to just give users,
again, we're trying

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.208
to build trust
through this process

00:28:57.208 --> 00:28:59.036
and not make users
have to think and say,

00:28:59.036 --> 00:29:00.160
wait, which card did I use?

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:00.659
What was it?

00:29:00.659 --> 00:29:03.250
So these are just ways you
can streamline this experience

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.900
and keep users moving.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.570
And then once they
have made the purchase,

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.420
it's not necessarily over,
right, from a flow standpoint.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.010
They may want to go
find that receipt.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.930
They may have things that
they need to send to somebody.

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.070
There's some reason, right?

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.690
So when they go look
for that receipt

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:20.157
or when that receipt
comes in, at that point,

00:29:20.157 --> 00:29:21.740
also make sure you're
being consistent

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.570
and you're displaying this
stuff the exact same way

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.236
you displayed it
throughout the process.

00:29:25.236 --> 00:29:28.730
So again, build that
trust, keep users moving,

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.374
don't make them think
too much about it.

00:29:31.374 --> 00:29:33.290
I think in this case,
you also definitely want

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.720
to show the payment method
used, because at this point,

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.760
the payment's been done and
this is going to just give them

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.510
that full context.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.590
The buttons.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:46.470
The Google Pay buttons
come in two flavors.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:48.390
There's a dark button,
there's a light button.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:50.984
In most cases, we
really recommend

00:29:50.984 --> 00:29:53.400
that you use the dark button,
because most sites out there

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.490
and apps out there are white.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.560
And modern apps and sites
have a lot of white space.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.390
So use that the dark button.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.820
It's really going
to stand out more.

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.950
It's going to give users
a really strong CTA.

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:07.800
We've seen implementations
where there are the white button

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.640
on the white site.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.348
And you can imagine,
it doesn't stand out

00:30:10.348 --> 00:30:12.480
that well and users
are going to miss it.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.190
So this is just another
easy one to keep

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.540
users moving through it.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.780
Let them get on with it.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.440
If you do have a dark
site, then the white button

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.564
is going to work awesome.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:26.362
And lastly, for really quick
and easy implementation,

00:30:26.362 --> 00:30:28.570
make sure you're using one
of our recommended payment

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.490
processors.

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:31.630
In the demo yesterday,
they showed how easy

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.130
it was to set up the button.

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.020
And part of that is
because these processors

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.900
have done a lot of the
logistical work for you.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.190
They make it super
easy to get started.

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:42.255
And you can get a full
list of these guys

00:30:42.255 --> 00:30:47.940
at g.co/pay/business.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.370
So hopefully these
details have given you

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.910
guys some really concrete things
you can put into place right

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:57.060
now to make sure that you're
enabling customers to check out

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.900
really quickly, really easily.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.926
If you want to know more,
you can go to g.co/pay/brand,

00:31:02.926 --> 00:31:05.550
and that's going to give you all
the assets and how to use them

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.591
and make sure you're
implementing them correctly.

00:31:07.591 --> 00:31:12.390
And then at g.co/pay/developers,
you can get more details about

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.020
the API.

00:31:17.835 --> 00:31:19.460
JENNY GOVE: So now,
we're going to take

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:22.610
a look at some new
experiences with Google Pay.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.190
But before we do
though, let's just

00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:29.360
stop to consider that the first
online digital transactions

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.010
happened in the mid 1990s.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:35.240
So it's taken 20 years
of research, design,

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:38.720
and optimization to
get people comfortable

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:41.960
with online purchases.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.460
The e-commerce industry
has come a long way.

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.210
And as you've seen,
we at Google are

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:49.850
hard at work making
that even easier

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:53.180
for our users across
a variety of devices.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:55.640
And as device
capabilities have expanded

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.830
beyond traditional
experiences, we've

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:01.070
worked hard to adapt the
lessons of the last two decades

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:04.870
to new modalities
devices support.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:09.140
While the same principles of
fast and efficient, scalable,

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.550
secure, and unified
are just as applicable

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:16.030
for different modalities such
as voice and conversational

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:18.940
transactions, how these
principles are applied

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.070
must change.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:23.320
On phones, users
personal devices,

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.180
asking users to
re-verify their identity

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.830
before completing a purchase
may add unnecessary friction.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:34.030
While on a Google Home, if
it's a communal device, say,

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:37.840
shared with family or perhaps
friends living together,

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.920
verifying identity could
be very appropriate,

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.910
assuring the user they have
control over the purchases that

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.570
are made.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:49.390
We're working towards providing
people with the controls

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:53.545
to make the right authentication
decisions for their context.

00:32:53.545 --> 00:32:56.050
And all of this helps
to ensure that when

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:59.030
users want to make a purchase
through the Assistant,

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:01.660
the experience feels
natural and easy.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:07.210
So let's make a
payment transaction

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:10.640
as applied to
voice transactions.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.870
OK, Google.

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:14.390
Order my usual from Starbucks.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.290
- Hi, Jenny.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:16.700
Starbucks here.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:18.560
That's one tall Earl gray.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.439
Anything else?

00:33:19.439 --> 00:33:20.730
JENNY GOVE: No, that'll be all.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:21.890
Thanks.

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:24.650
- And are you picking that
up at your usual Starbucks?

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:26.000
JENNY GOVE: Yes.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:26.750
- OK.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:31.280
That'll be $3.45, but the
balance on your Starbucks card

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.010
is only $1.04.

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.500
Do you want to reload your card?

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.290
JENNY GOVE: Yes, put $20 on it.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:39.950
- OK.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:44.030
I've added $20 to your
Starbucks card with Google Pay.

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:47.280
Your total is $3.45.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:48.990
Are you ready to
place the order?

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:50.250
JENNY GOVE: Yes.

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.120
- OK.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.760
I put your order in and
it'll be ready soon.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.080
Enjoy.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:56.080
JENNY GOVE: Great.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:56.790
Looking forward to that.

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.498
BRANDON HERRING: You
should have got two.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.200
JENNY GOVE: As new
devices are introduced

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.050
and new interactions
become possible,

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:08.320
we'll continue to invest
in these new modalities,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:12.070
to ensure that we present our
users with the best experiences

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:13.179
to support their lives.

00:34:16.235 --> 00:34:17.610
BRANDON HERRING:
With Google Pay,

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:19.350
we've focused on
making something that's

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.860
fast and efficient, scalable
and secure, and really,

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.130
a unified brand that is
recognized around the world

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.300
as something that's easy to pay.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:28.800
Right?

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.530
Whether that's in-store, online,
or through new experiences,

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:34.719
as Jenny just showed with voice.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:38.380
Google Pay gives users a totally
seamless checkout experience.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:40.929
There are hundreds of millions
of payment cards on file,

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.120
and that's a huge
benefit for developers

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.670
as they start to create the
seamless check out experiences

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:49.030
of today, but also of tomorrow
with assistive experiences

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:50.030
and more.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:54.040
I think the future is definitely
going to be formless, right,

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.130
as we go into more voice.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.310
So this is really awesome
stuff that we can do.

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.520
And it kind of leads
to my final point,

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:02.320
which is just I do
think this is a really

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.880
exciting time for payments.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.020
There's so much coming.

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.150
There's so much cool
stuff happening.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.910
And I'm personally excited
to see what all of you guys

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.190
come up with as we move forward.

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.640
I want to call out, we have
one more session later today

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.390
that's actually going to go into
a lot more detail on the demo

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:22.890
that Jenny just did.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:25.820
You can learn about all
the Assistant actions.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.740
And so check out Add
Transactional Capabilities

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:29.550
to Your Actions.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:31.770
And that is on stage 5 at 2:30.

00:35:34.284 --> 00:35:35.700
JENNY GOVE: And a
reminder that we

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:40.070
have developer documentation
available at these links.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:43.500
And we'll be adding to these
as more experiences are

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.300
built for Google Pay.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.110
We'd love to hear from you.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:50.900
So don't forget to
provide feedback

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.682
on our session on
the website schedule.

00:35:54.682 --> 00:35:57.210
And we'll be in the
sandbox afterwards

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.750
to take any questions.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:02.440
So do come and see us in dome
G. And if you haven't checked

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:06.010
out this already, you can see
some really cool experiences

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:09.070
of future payment
experiences, including

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.850
in-store, interactive
retail experiences that

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:14.660
are there in Dome key to try.

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.520
So do stop by.

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.270
