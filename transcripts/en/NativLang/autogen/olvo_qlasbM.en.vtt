00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.300
can swim and those statements are
meaningful so we would consider those

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310
meaningful so we would consider those
 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.020
meaningful so we would consider those
symbols - so far it follows that those

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030
symbols - so far it follows that those
 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.330
symbols - so far it follows that those
statements would also work like

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340
statements would also work like
 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.759
statements would also work like
constants but now we're taking on so

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769
constants but now we're taking on so
 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.590
constants but now we're taking on so
many symbols all kinds of things all

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600
many symbols all kinds of things all
 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.270
many symbols all kinds of things all
kinds of sentences we can say about

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280
kinds of sentences we can say about
 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.229
kinds of sentences we can say about
things

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239
things
 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.240
things
all of these are symbols it would be

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250
all of these are symbols it would be
 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.860
all of these are symbols it would be
hard to count all of them let alone as

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870
hard to count all of them let alone as
 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.800
hard to count all of them let alone as
little and analyze all of them

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810

what if we could strip language down to

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789
what if we could strip language down to
 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:32.089
what if we could strip language down to

just the symbols that's the aim of
 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.309
just the symbols that's the aim of
symbolic logic we want a set of symbols

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319
symbolic logic we want a set of symbols
 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.499
symbolic logic we want a set of symbols
that helps us evaluate structure without

that helps us evaluate structure without
 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.210
that helps us evaluate structure without
getting tethered in the meaning and the

getting tethered in the meaning and the
 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.969
getting tethered in the meaning and the
use we may still want constants but

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979
use we may still want constants but
 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.499

we'll definitely need symbols that

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509
we'll definitely need symbols that
 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.230
we'll definitely need symbols that
aren't so fixed since their meanings

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240
aren't so fixed since their meanings
 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.159
aren't so fixed since their meanings
wouldn't be fixed

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169
wouldn't be fixed
 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.990

these symbols would vary so they're

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000
these symbols would vary so they're
 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.180
these symbols would vary so they're
called variables to make it easy on
