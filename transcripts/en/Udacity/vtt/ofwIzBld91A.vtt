00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, of course, this is a little bit subjective, but to me, it's clear that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
showing that SAT is NP-complete was the hardest thing that we had to do

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.500
because we didn't know any other problem to be NP-complete,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000
so we had to go through a lot of effort to show that

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
any problem in NP can be expressed as a boolean formula for SAT.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then I think that showing clique to be NP-complete was the next difficult thing

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.700
because it's not really obvious how you can reduce SAT to clique

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.500
because SAT is a problem on boolean formulas; clique is a problem on graphs.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
And so we had to find a good idea to show how SAT can be reduced to clique.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And then, in the first unit, it still took some thought, but showing how

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
vertex cover, clique, and independent set are related wasn't that difficult

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because all three problems were asking questions about graphs,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and they were asking mostly very similar questions,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
especially clique and independent set.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Vertex cover--yeah, we had to give it a little thought, but I still think it was much easier

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.500
than coming up with the idea of how to encode a boolean formula

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.500
into a graph that is then an input for clique.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.000
So the good news is the hardest part is over,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
but, of course, as you've seen with SAT and clique,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.500
showing NP-completeness can still be tough.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
And that is why I would like to show you one more example of a reduction

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.500
for a quite-famous NP-complete problem that you don't know yet

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.000
and then give you some more general strategies

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
on how you can show NP-completeness for other problems.

00:01:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And to introduce that problem to you, I would like you to meet Dave.
