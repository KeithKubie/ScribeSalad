00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.945
Okay, let's work through this together. We want to add 25 to the redness, but

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:09.514
we don't want it to get larger than 255. So, do we want to take the max, or the

00:00:09.514 --> 00:00:15.254
min? Do we want the larger of 255 plus 25, or do we want the smaller? We want

00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:20.316
the smaller because we never want it to get larger than 255. And that's the

00:00:20.316 --> 00:00:24.556
answer. Let's run this program. Here's the original image, which I took around

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:30.280
noon. And here it is transformed into a beautiful sunset. And thanks to our

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.538
friend mass dot min, none of the colors overflowed. Like I said, these math

00:00:35.538 --> 00:00:37.440
functions can be pretty useful.
