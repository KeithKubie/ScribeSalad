Andre we believe though we cannot yet

00:00:05.889 --> 00:00:05.899
Andre we believe though we cannot yet
 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:08.680
Andre we believe though we cannot yet
prove that our multiverse of universes

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690
prove that our multiverse of universes
 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.790
prove that our multiverse of universes
is 11 dimensional so think of this 11

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:12.800
is 11 dimensional so think of this 11
 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.310
is 11 dimensional so think of this 11
dimensional arena and in this arena

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320
dimensional arena and in this arena
 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.330
dimensional arena and in this arena
there are bubbles bubbles that float and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340
there are bubbles bubbles that float and
 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.820
there are bubbles bubbles that float and
the skin of the bubble represents an

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830
the skin of the bubble represents an
 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.790
the skin of the bubble represents an
entire universe so we're like flies

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800
entire universe so we're like flies
 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.310
entire universe so we're like flies
trapped on flypaper we're on the skin of

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320
trapped on flypaper we're on the skin of
 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.380
trapped on flypaper we're on the skin of
a bubble it's a three-dimensional bubble

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390
a bubble it's a three-dimensional bubble
 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.619
a bubble it's a three-dimensional bubble
the two-dimensional bubble is expanding

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629
the two-dimensional bubble is expanding
 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.869
the two-dimensional bubble is expanding
and that's called the Big Bang Theory

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879
and that's called the Big Bang Theory
 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.329
and that's called the Big Bang Theory
and sometimes these bubbles can bump

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339
and sometimes these bubbles can bump
 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.759
and sometimes these bubbles can bump
into each other sometimes they can split

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769
into each other sometimes they can split
 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:42.639
into each other sometimes they can split
apart and that we think is the Big Bang

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649
apart and that we think is the Big Bang
 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.790
apart and that we think is the Big Bang
so we even have a theory of the Big Bang

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800
so we even have a theory of the Big Bang
 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.189
so we even have a theory of the Big Bang
itself now you ask a question what about

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199
itself now you ask a question what about
 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:50.829
itself now you ask a question what about
the dimensions of each bubble well in

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839
the dimensions of each bubble well in
 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.719
the dimensions of each bubble well in
string theory which is what I do for a

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729
string theory which is what I do for a
 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.389
string theory which is what I do for a
living that's my day job in string

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399
living that's my day job in string
 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.250
living that's my day job in string
theory we can have bubbles of different

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260
theory we can have bubbles of different
 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.889
theory we can have bubbles of different
dimensions the highest dimension is 11

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899
dimensions the highest dimension is 11
 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.770
dimensions the highest dimension is 11
you cannot go beyond 11 because

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780
you cannot go beyond 11 because
 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.500
you cannot go beyond 11 because
universities become unstable beyond 11

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510
universities become unstable beyond 11
 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.780
universities become unstable beyond 11
if I write down the theory of a thirteen

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790
if I write down the theory of a thirteen
 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.490
if I write down the theory of a thirteen
fifteen dimensional universe it's

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500
fifteen dimensional universe it's
 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.490
fifteen dimensional universe it's
unstable and it collapses down to an 11

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500
unstable and it collapses down to an 11
 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.980
unstable and it collapses down to an 11
dimensional universe but within 11

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990
dimensional universe but within 11
 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.050
dimensional universe but within 11
dimensions you can have bubbles that are

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060
dimensions you can have bubbles that are
 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.150
dimensions you can have bubbles that are
three dimensional four dimensional five

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160
three dimensional four dimensional five
 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.700
three dimensional four dimensional five
dimensional these are membranes so for

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710
dimensional these are membranes so for
 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.460
dimensional these are membranes so for
short we call them brains so these

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470
short we call them brains so these
 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.290
short we call them brains so these
brains can exist in different dimensions

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300
brains can exist in different dimensions
 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.590
brains can exist in different dimensions
and let's say P represents the dimension

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600
and let's say P represents the dimension
 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.290
and let's say P represents the dimension
of each bubble so we call them P brains

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300
of each bubble so we call them P brains
 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.120
of each bubble so we call them P brains
so a pea brain is a universe in

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130
so a pea brain is a universe in
 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.550
so a pea brain is a universe in
different dimensions floating in a much

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560
different dimensions floating in a much
 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.550
different dimensions floating in a much
larger arena and this larger arena is

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560
larger arena and this larger arena is
 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.149
larger arena and this larger arena is
the the hyperspace that I talked about

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159
the the hyperspace that I talked about
 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.210
the the hyperspace that I talked about
originally also remember that each

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220
originally also remember that each
 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.310
originally also remember that each
bubble vibrates and each bubble

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320
bubble vibrates and each bubble
 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.700
bubble vibrates and each bubble
vibrating creates music the music of

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710
vibrating creates music the music of
 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.620
vibrating creates music the music of
these membranes is the subatomic

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630
these membranes is the subatomic
 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.660
these membranes is the subatomic
particles each subatomic particle

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670
particles each subatomic particle
 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.330
particles each subatomic particle
represents a note on a vibrating string

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340
represents a note on a vibrating string
 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.200
represents a note on a vibrating string
or viding membranes so believe it or not

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210
or viding membranes so believe it or not
 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.290
or viding membranes so believe it or not
we now have a candidate for the mind of

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300
we now have a candidate for the mind of
 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.749
we now have a candidate for the mind of
God that Albert Einstein wrote about for

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759
God that Albert Einstein wrote about for
 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.239
God that Albert Einstein wrote about for
the last thirty years of his life the

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:13.249
the last thirty years of his life the
 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.970
the last thirty years of his life the
mind of God in this picture would be

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980
mind of God in this picture would be
 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.710
mind of God in this picture would be
cosmic music resonating throughout 11

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720
