Hi! My name is Kunal and I'm delighted that

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.510
you are considering this course. Now, before we dive in,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.980
I want to introduce myself and also share with

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.460
you two reasons why I'm really excited to teach this

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.780
course. First, I love teaching. Before joining Udacity, I

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.040
was a sixth-grade science teacher in India. I remember really

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.920
enjoying presenting new ideas to my students. That would

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.820
make them question what they already knew. That experience lead

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.810
me to pursue a Master's Degree from the School of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.490
Education at Stanford University. The second reason, is that I love

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.500
to create things with programming. Now, in this course, we are

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.520
going to use the Python programming language to create a bunch

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.140
of projects. And my hope is that you would want to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.700
share these projects with your friends. Here are some of them.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.290
The first one, is project take a break. Do you know

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.830
a friend who works too many hours? Hint, that person could

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.550
be you. We will write a program that schedules

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.980
breaks throughout the day, reminding that individual to listen to

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.890
music, get up and dance to their favorite song,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.110
or just walk away from the computer every once in

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.710
awhile. Another one is called project profanity editor. Imagine

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.310
you get an email from your boss, requesting your help

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.840
with something. You reply, I can take a shot

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.670
at it but accidentally you end up including an awkward

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.350
word. Oops. We will write a short Python program that detects curse

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.820
words and saves you from embarrassing moments in the future. The final project

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.090
is project movie databases. In this project we will learn how to make an awesome

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:37.570
webpage, that lists your favorite movies, and shows their trailers. [SOUND]
