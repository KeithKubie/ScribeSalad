00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:08.279
The bigger the action, and the higher the
stakes, the more audiences tend to overlook

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.279
the little details of movie plots and surprise
twists.

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:10.830
But even when a film has been enjoyed for
decades, a closer look can reveal lingering

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.740
questions and clumsy plots that fans would
rather ignore.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.680
They don’t have to ruin a movie, and sometimes,
coming up with a solution can be more fun

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.119
than the filmmakers ever imagined.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.360
Here are Screen Rant’s 10 Massive Plot Holes
in Popular Movies.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.360
The Wolverine

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.360
He may be the face of the X-Men franchise,
but even Wolverine’s writers don’t seem

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.360
to have a handle on his unique superpowers.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.360
In his second solo film, Logan is brought
to Japan by a wealthy businessman whose life

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.360
he saved during World War 2, offering to make
him mortal as a thank you.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.360
But Logan has a hard time believing it.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.360
He’s likely referring to the Weapon X program
that gave him his metal skeleton, but Logan’s

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.360
permanently-regenerating cells and immortality
are his mutation – they weren’t given

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.360
to him by anyone.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.360
The plot holes and questions don’t stop
there.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.360
When he realizes his healing factor has suddenly
been disabled, it’s revealed to be the result

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.360
of a robotic bug on his heart.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.360
How does it work?

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.360
That’s never explained.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.360
And the same can be said for why his claws
can no longer cut through swords, or how drilling

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.360
into his bones could steal his healing factor
and, apparently, his youth.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.360
Other films may tamper with the nature of
Wolverine’s powers, but this one doesn’t

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.360
even try to make sense of them.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.360
The Avengers

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.360
In the first Thor movie, it’s established
that Earth is just one realm in the larger

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
Marvel Universe, with Asgardian visitors using
a “Rainbow Bridge”, also known as the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.360
Bifrost, to travel there and back.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.360
In the film’s climax, Thor is left with
no choice but to destroy the device, seen

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.280
as a major sacrifice, since it means he has
no way to return to his new love, Jane Foster.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.230
Since the god of thunder was needed in The
Avengers, his arrival was written off with

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.210
just one line of dialogue.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.949
Even if fans accept that “magic” brought
Thor back, director Joss Whedon has admitted

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:34.100
there’s no explanation for how he managed
to track the Avengers in midair.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:46.520
The 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.520
Matrix

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.969
In the post-apocalyptic world of The Matrix,
Morpheus learned that it isn’t just Machines

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:53.320
his crew needs to worry about.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.130
When the character Cypher realizes that the
artificial reality of the Matrix wasn’t

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.649
so bad after all, he cuts a deal: he’ll
betray his commander, as long as he’s plugged

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.179
back into the system as a wealthy actor, with
no memory of the real world.

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.140
The twist pushes Neo to embrace his role as
the One, but it’s never explained how Cypher

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.150
entered the Matrix without an operator, or
getting caught, since sharing a meal with

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:29.250
an Agent is hard to disguise.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.250
Terminator 2

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.640
Movie fans will never forget Arnold Schwarzenegger’s
introduction in the Terminator, but there

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.909
was a good reason for him appearing naked.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.909
Kyle Reese explains that only living organisms
can travel through time – or machines covered

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.940
in living tissue, like the T-800.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.970
But in the sequel, the T-1000 travels without
any problems, even though it’s made of liquid

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.280
metal alloy.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:04.799
The writers originally intended to show a
“flesh cocoon” the Terminator used to

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.769
survive the trip, but felt it would confuse
viewers.

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.340
Instead, he simply appears as naked as any
other time traveler, even though that wouldn’t

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.760
make any real difference.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.069
Star Wars: A New Hope

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:26.230
George Lucas made the right call by starting
his Star Wars saga in the middle, but it didn’t

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.430
come without some problems.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.700
When Obi-wan Kenobi first told Luke Skywalker
that the disbanded Old Republic had lasted

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.110
for a thousand generations, fans assumed he
meant tens of thousands of years – an idea

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.360
contradicted by Padme in Attack of the Clones,
claiming the Republic had only been around

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.400
for one millennium.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.459
The extended universe tweaked the language
to make sure both characters were right, but

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.300
the gap between the original series and prequels
wasn’t so easily fixed.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.739
Aside from Obi-wan and Anakin aging several
decades by the Time Luke hit his teens, Imperial

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:04.319
soldiers refer to the Force as an outdated,
“ancient” religion, and even Han Solo

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.800
claims he’s never seen any evidence of The
Force.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.459
Since that’s basically the same as grown
men now doubting the existence of VCRs, things

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.140
don’t quite add up.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.140
Minority Report

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.380
Steven Spielberg’s vision of future crime
relied heavily on science fiction, with a

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:37.960
trio of psychics able to see murders before
they happen, leading star Tom Cruise’s team

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.610
to stop them in the nick of time.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.750
That is, until he sees a murder that HE will
commit.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.040
Going on the run to find out why, he discovers
it’s all been a set-up.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:11.400
The man still winds up dead, but it’s never
explained how the Precogs saw the murder to

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.840
begin with.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:21.870
Did the film’s villain just plan the frame-up,
and cross his fingers that they would envision

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.400
his plan working out perfectly?

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.480
If there’s an answer, the movie doesn’t
include it.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.750
Guardians of the Galaxy

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.940
The cast of Guardians may have begun as criminals,
but they eventually decide to sacrifice their

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.699
own lives to protect the entire galaxy from
destruction.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.361
The team hatches a plan to bring down the
movie’s villain on board his own ship, with

00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:47.610
Gamora volunteering to cut power to the “impenetrable
security doors” so her comrades can attack.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.710
As she fights her way to the power source,
the rest of the team fights through dozens

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.050
of enemy soldiers on their way to the bridge.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.360
The doors open to even more enemies, before
Gamora blasts a hole in the floor and comes

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.170
to the rescue.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.229
Since nobody asked why they didn’t just
blast through the floor of the impenetrable

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.740
room and ambush the villain to begin with,
we’re guessing the fans should just ignore

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.740
it.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.740
Batman Begins

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.740
The Microwave Emitter used to turn Gotham
City into a living nightmare in Batman Begins

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.740
had fans debating the science of the movie's
climax from the moment it hit theatres.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.740
But the machine's ability to instantly vaporize
water without injuring people is established

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.740
earlier on in the film.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.740
What ISN'T explained is why the city wasn't
driven mad by the water-based fear toxin long

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.740
before the final showdown.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.740
The toxin may have been harmless in water,
but the villains had spent WEEKS spreading

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.740
it through the city.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.740
Which means boiling water, saunas, or simply
hot showers should have turned Gothamites

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:17.740
into crazed threats by the thousands.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.740
Back to the Future Part 2

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.740
Given the bond between Marty McFly and Doc
Brown, it made sense that Back to the Future

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.290
would end with Doc’s return from the year
2015, warning Marty that his unborn children

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.170
were headed for trouble.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.229
The physicist had refused to change the past
in the first movie, but the future was apparently

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:28.229
fair game.

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.080
It was meant to be a simple fix, and Doc reassured
Marty that he and his girlfriend Jennifer

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.120
turned out fine.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.760
Except they didn’t.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.169
With Marty’s music career ruined by a car
accident, he wound up in a dead end job with

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:40.280
a failing marriage.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.820
The obvious question is: why wouldn’t Doc
save Marty’s future?

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.560
Considering all his family’s troubles traced
back to a single street race, he would only

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.349
have had to meet Marty and Jennifer one day
later to prevent his entire failed future

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:52.449
in a single moment.

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.300
He must have really hated rock and roll.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.300
Interstellar

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.300
Even the defenders of Christopher Nolan’s
complicated space adventure have trouble explaining

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.300
away one plot point – and it has nothing
to do with interstellar travel.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.300
When fluctuations in gravity send Coop stumbling
onto NASA's mission to save humanity, he's

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.300
told that it's a trip only he can lead.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.300
So why did those planning the mission - who
knew Coop years beforehand - never contact

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.300
him, despite his farm being just a day's drive
away?

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.300
Even if his arrival was a lucky break, the
idea that a man who needed a wormhole explained

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.300
to him would be taking the wheel instead of
experts who had probably planned and trained

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.300
for months makes no sense at all.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.300
So what do you think of our list?

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.300

story lines in your favorite movies?
