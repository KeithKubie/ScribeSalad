00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.370
Here we are at Bletchley Park but in
a part of the

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.530
Bletchley Park site that's the National
Museum of Computing

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.269
in the UK. And they've had the sense to have
the siting here

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.460
for the rebuild of the Colossus machine

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.000
that was, as many of you know, the big
feature

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.650
of Bletchley Park later on in the war,
because it was involved in helping to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.480
decrypt the

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.189
Lorenz cipher, which was a much much
bigger challenge

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.399
than even Enigma.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:37.780
[Is there much to see ?]  Yes, there's quite 
a lot to see. You've got to remember this is

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.120
arguably the world's very first

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.300
electronic computer - it really is largely
electronic.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.850
It relies on thermionic valves -

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.910
that's vacuum tubes for those of you 
in North America.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.190
So yes, the logic and the
counting is done with vacuum tubes.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.550
The feature, though, of computers of
this

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.540
era - and it is a special-purpose computer
remember - it's not general purpose,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.110
and the one thing that was very difficult was
to get them to have memory

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.780
because memory hadn't been invented. So the
data that it has to analyze is

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.820
actually on a 5-hole paper tape

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.200
and you just have it spinning round at
very high speed

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.100
and if you miss a particular piece of data
you have to wait for it to come round

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.210
So that tape that you see there is going
at five thousand

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.990
characters per second . [Let's get over there
and have a look].  Five thousand characters per

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.399
second roughly, I think, corresponds to
thirty miles an hour

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.670
and it is absolutely amazing that it does
not fly apart.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.890
There is one problem of joining the
ends of the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.710
tape and Phil, over there, who is the expert, tells me
that whereas in the Second World War

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.189
they used to use a benzene-based Bostik
sort of glue,

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.640
Health and Safety won't permit that any more
and it's highly inflammable.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.490
And so he's just been doing, he tells me,
some experiments on what

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.079
the best substitute would be for
joining tape ends.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.220
Answer number one was brown parcel tape

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.540
which worked quite well. Answer number two,
which he's just tried out I think, is Pritt Stick.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.540
And Pritt Stick is just superb!

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.180
So there we are then - continuous read-out 
of data.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.030
Quite a high latency because if you miss
something you've got to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.160
wait for it to come round again. But
all of the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.500
electronics here is dedicated,
it's special-purpose.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.680
It's recognizing patterns in the
ciphertext

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.090
that came off the Lorenz cipher machine. 
And once you've specified what

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.980
sort of patterns you're looking for it will do
the automatic counting for you.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.920
The Lorenz machine was basically an adapter

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.620
that you could add on to a teleprinter.
We've heard all about Enigma

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.670
which in many ways was a very low level
very labour-intensive machine.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.549
Hitler wanted something faster, more
personal, more secure.

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.540
So the Lorenz machine was used by the
High Command

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.599
to talk to each other. It  was used by Hitler
to give commands to his

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.579
generals. It was crucial round about D-day

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.950
to be able to decrypt the Lorenz traffic,
because essentially

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.380
it did show that Hitler had been 
taken in

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.810
by an Allied plan to convince him

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.560
that D-day wasn't going to happen in Normandy
but there was a whole -

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.600
how shall we say - `feint operation'-  to say:
"No! No! No!

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.250
let's try and convince the Germans that it's
going to happen in Calais."

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.290
And they found out by decrypting Lorenz
traffic using

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.710
Colossus Mk.II that, yes, Hitler had fallen

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.280
for this deception and kept on saying
to his generals: "No! No! No! it's not going

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.930
to be in Normandy.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.290
It's going to be in the Pas de Calais" 
That, according to

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.890
military people made a world of
difference about the level of opposition they

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.880
faced and how quickly the advance 
across Germany could take place after D-day.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.950
Well, what we'll find, in more detail
later on, with all of these valves,

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.340
is  this is why it really is thought of
as one of the world's first

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.550
special-purpose, valve-driven, computers. Tommy
Flowers

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.830
was its famous designer and people said
to him

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.110
at the time "Flowers what are you proposing?

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.310
What's wrong with electromechanical
technology - relays - you know, like in the Bombe?"

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.090
And basically Tommy said; "Look, for the
job we have to do with the Lorenz cipher 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.720
it's not gonna be fast enough

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.370
I'll build it for you using valves" and
then people said: "But how many

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.380
will you need Flowers, you know, six valves ? 
A dozen?" .  And he said: "1500" and here we

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.800
have them !

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.260
And he was not afraid of valves, he didn't
mind how many

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.840
he used. People when they said to him "But Flowers, 
come, come, come 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.900
we all know about thermionic valves 
they blow,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.060
and they go `bang', and you have to replace
them. They're not reliable enough!"

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.240
And he was basically a Post Office

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.630
telecoms engineer and he said: "Look I've
worked in the research section - 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.690
I've led it - valves are fine so long as you
never switch them off."

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.330
They've got heaters in there, of course, and

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.320
so long as, maybe, you know, when it's
not working flat-out

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.640
you turn the heating voltage down, but DON'T

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.880
SWITCH IT OFF, you will be surprised how
reliable 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.090
it can be. And he was proved right. It was
tested out at Tommy's own place, 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.910
Dollis Hill,

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.270
in late '43. I think it's been established it
was on

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.990
8th December 1943 at Dollis Hill.
Testing

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.690
moved to Bletchley Park here in early
1944

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:36.210
and came into action pretty soon
thereafter.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.740
[This is a replica is it?]. This is a replica,
Yes, as a result, I think, of the Freedom of

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.750
Information Act

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.990
in America, it was possible to get hold
eventually

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.260
I think, of a complete set of drawings.
[Wasn't Flowers very much an unsung hero ?] 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.930
Yes, he did suffer, because first of all
people wouldn't believe him

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.960
then, when he did deliver, of course he was
a hero

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.950
but effectively felt that he would
never get his just

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.150
deserts of fame,

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.830
and all that, because of the secrecy. It's hard
to believe now

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.010
how ultra, Ultra, ULTRA secret this was.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.470
And i think it was very hard for Tommy

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.490
when later on, I think it was about 1946,
there was an American

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.830
electronic special-purpose computer came
along called ENIAC

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.950
which calculated gunnery trajectories.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.060
Now of course since nobody knew anything
about Colossus

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.150
this [ENIAC] has been widely reported as the
world's first special-purpose

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.550
computer with valves. This [Colossus] was two years
earlier than ENIAC,

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.140
but nobody could say a word about it. 
Not a word!

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.350
And I think a lot of people at Bletchley

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.580
still felt, at the end of the war, that frankly

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.720
Tommy Flowers, Max Newman, who was the
head of the Newmanry here, which was in

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.430
charge of all this and

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.670
the guy who made one of the real initial

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:58.980
analyses that enabled Colossus to be built,

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.000
a chap called Bill Tutte, they should all 
have been knighted.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.370
They weren't. They got various

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.720
sort of awards, and so on. The only good spin I can
put on this, as to why they weren't

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.860
honoured more

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.880
is the secrecy again. I can just imagine a

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.740
Whitehall civil servant saying: "Look, if we 
start knighting all these people

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.390
they're going to start asking questions - the 
public - `Why?' "

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.450
"There's Flowers, superb engineer, but why 
a knighthood? Why?"

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.430
And don't forget this was in an era

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.730
up until about fairly recently, where the
whole idea was that this

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.830
should be kept secret for ever. They didn't

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.710
want it ever to come out. Or I think Winston Churchill's 
compromise was something like a hundred years.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.870
Can you imagine having to wait until

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:49.650
2045, or 2044, for this

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.630
to be made available. Anyway common sense 
has now prevailed, I'm glad to say.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:57.060
And it's a wonderful thing to behold,
it really is.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.360
Flowers said: "One of the best days in my
life was seeing all these

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.919
clever people

00:08:00.919 --> 00:08:04.020
Alan Turing, Max Newman. Bill Tutte,

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:07.190
all of them with their mouths dropping
open saying: "Flowers

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.319
what have you done?!" And I think he said

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:15.319
the worst bit, after that, was "This is
wonderful! This is so quick! 

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:19.169
Now we can really get working! Erm - 
Flowers we'd like four more

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:24.270
of these, preferably in two months time". And
I don't think people said "Get real" in

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.740
early 1944

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:31.240
but that was the sentiment, effectively.
