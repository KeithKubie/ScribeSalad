00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.290
It’s said that actors are a fickle, sensitive
bunch.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.690
Some with varying levels of devotion to their
craft.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.880
Because they’re constantly trying on new
personalities, it’s not unusual for the

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.020
person underneath to get a little weird over
time.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.650
Wether it’s because of method acting, self-righteousness,
or just plain old bad manners, here are Screen

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.480
Rant’s 10 Actors No One Wants to Work With.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.349
Christian Bale
In 2009, the world learned a lesson: do not

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.460
interrupt Christian Bale when he’s working.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.920
One unlucky crew member on the set of Terminator:
Salvation found out the hard way.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.870
When the director of photography distracted
the actor, Bale hurled a flurry of threats

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.140
and insults at him.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.690
Audio of this interaction leaked online, and
others have since come forward saying the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.559
actor’s intensity is unsettling.

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.109
Bale has since apologized for the outburst,
but insists that maintaining an air of mystery

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.270
is essential to his craft.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.030
He isn’t in it to make friends, which is
good- because that Batman voice wasn’t doing

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.920
him any favors.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.219
Harrison Ford
Being a star comes with some pretty monotonous

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.219
work.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.560
Doing press for a movie sometimes means sitting
in a chair for 12 hours a day answering the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.520
same questions over and over.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.870
While a lot of actors grin and bear it, showbiz
badass Harrison Ford chooses the straightforward

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:12.870
approach.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.150
Notoriously difficult to interview, Ford has
explained that he just doesn’t like answering

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.150
stupid questions.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.730
And given how long he’s been in the business,
how many stupid questions he must have answered

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.640
by now, we can understand why.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.570
Usually the Star Wars actor reserves snarky
comments for reporters, but has made special

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.280
public exceptions for Josh Hartnett and Kevin
Smith.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.240
And later, Indiana Jones co-star Shia LaBeouf.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.000
Gwyneth Paltrow
Gwyneth Paltrow isn’t everyone’s cup of

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.480
organic fair-trade tea.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.560
Some describe her as hardworking and self-confident,
but others see the Goop queen as self-righteous

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.560
and fussy.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.760
Often criticized for her ‘holier than thou’
attitude, Paltrow advocates for a very specific,

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.280
very expensive lifestyle.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.630
And, not one to mince words, the actress is
prone to hyperbole.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.280
This rubs some people the wrong way.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.100
Rumors circulated regarding Paltrow feeling
a competitiveness toward Iron Man co-star

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.330
Scarlett Johannessen.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.940
Leaving some fans wondering if this is the
reason we haven’t seen Pepper Potts on-screen

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.759
in a while.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.280
Russell Crowe
Russell Crowe has opinions, and he doesn’t

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.910
care who hears them.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.260
He’s been short-tempered in interviews,
aggressive behind the scenes on set, and even

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.820
tried to pick a fight with George Clooney.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.069
He’s so famously unpleasant that South Park
immortalized his affinity for brawling with

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.300
segment called ‘Fightin’ Around the World’-
where he antagonizes people indiscriminately.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.719
No area is safe from the Oscar-winners scorn,
not even Twitter, where Crowe will argue with

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.379
an average joe one day, then a multi-million
dollar corporation the next.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.069
Rebel Wilson once described an encounter where
the Gladiator star told her to ‘fuck off’

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.140
before she could say hello.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.450
Short or tall, Russell will fight them all!

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.180
Terrence Howard
It’s been said that “money makes the world

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.989
go ‘round” and nobody understands this
better than Terrence Howard.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.310
Audiences will recognize Howard as Lt. Colonel
James “Rhodey” Rhodes in the 2008 Marvel

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.730
powerhouse Iron Man.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.430
But apparently, being friends with Tony Stark
isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.629
After the colossal success of the franchises
first chapter, the studio approached Howard,

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.090
and reduced his salary from eight million
dollars down to one million for the upcoming

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.090
sequel.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.409
This move didn’t sit well with Howard- who
openly accused co-star Robert Downey Jr. of

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.680
absorbing the seven million dollar difference.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:04:25.790
This was good news for Don Cheadle, who took
over the role when Howard left.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:05:41.460
Jared 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.120
Leto
Jared Leto’s recent shenanigans on the set

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.250
of Suicide Squad is leading some to ask the
question: How far is too far when it comes

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.680
to method acting?

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.370
In step with his role as The Joker, Leto set
out to create some distance between himself

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.370
and fellow cast-mates.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.490
By sending them some pretty unorthodox stuff:
used condoms, dead animals, and sex toys to

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.490
name a few.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.250
He also studied topics like violent crime
and psychopathy, the likes of which would

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.740
make most of us deeply squeamish.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.220
Co-star Margot Robbie has even been quoted
as saying she was legitimately scared of him.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:26.150
So it’s safe to say he probably wasn’t
too fun to be around on set.
