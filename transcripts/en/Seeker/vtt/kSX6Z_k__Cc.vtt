00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.160
A study published in the journal Lancet ranked
heroin as the second most harmful to users

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.160
and to others.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.590
And it’s one of the most addictive, according
to the National Institute on Drug abuse,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.960
But it’s also one the most deadly, according
to the World Health Organization, heroin users

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.820
face a 20 to 30 times higher risk of death
than non-drug users.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.840
So how is the drug so powerful?

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.930
Well like most opioids it works on certain
receptors in the brain.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.160
Your brain has receptors for endorphins, the
feel good chemicals your body naturally produces.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.719
They help us handle pain and stress by inhibiting
the firing of neurons.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.660
But opioids like heroin have similar chemical
structure as those endorphins.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.421
So they bind to those receptor sites, sometimes
even more strongly than the natural ones in

00:00:57.421 --> 00:00:58.829
your body.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.720
According to a study published
in the Journal of Neuroscience, frequent heroin

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.860
injections actually desensitize these receptors.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.660
They get so stimulated they kind of wear themselves
out.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.369
So over time a user will have to increase
their dosage just to get the same feeling.

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.160
Heroin users reportedly feel a “rush”
lasting just a few minutes that produces an

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.420
intense relaxation.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.580
Afterwards, the “high” lasts for a few
hours,where users feel like they don’t have

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.929
a care in the world and don’t need a thing.

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.740
They aren’t really bothered by much in their
environment.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.910
Speaking of environment, the weird thing is,
it’s not just the high that gets you addicted.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.910
It’s the associations.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:33.910
Seriously.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.130
A study published in The Journal of Neuroscience
found that using heroin literally flips a

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.230
switch in a part of your called the basolateral
amygdala.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:48.700
This switch links the high of the drug with
environmental triggers.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.760
Your brain rewires itself to respond more
strongly to these memories.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.140
These neural pathways get stronger over time
and your ability to form new ones gets worse.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.130
You lose what’s called neural plasticity,
which makes it harder to resist the urge to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.450
use when you come across these triggers.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.030
But on the other hand, there’s been some
research that suggests people turn to heroin

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.920
to escape their environment.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.060
Research from Columbia University's Mailman
School of Public Health linked heroin use

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.460
to disadvantaged neighborhoods and stressful
lives.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.700
But there’s no doubt that heroin is dangerous.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.010
It’s a drug especially prone to deadly overdose.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.190
I mean it’s not exactly a regulated industry,
so hits can vary in purity.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.890
Someone who is used to using 10% pure heroin
mixed with other stuff, might purchase some

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.910
that’s 60% pure heroin, but there’s no
good way to tell the difference.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.890
The drug’s deadly effects come from it’s
relaxing properties.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.740
Basically while you relax, it can suppress
your respiratory system, to the point where

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.880
you body forgets to breathe.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.880
yeah, not good.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.240
Heroin can also cause some serious heart problems
too.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:03:08.990
Even leading 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:19.840
to a heart attack.
