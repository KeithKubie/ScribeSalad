00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:06.630
[inaudible].

2
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.630
<v 1>Alright. Hey, what's going on? Welcome to my kitchen and as I mentioned,</v>

3
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:13.270
I told you I was going to show you how to make a pie crust, right?

4
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:15.790
The fucking holidays coming up. Who's kidding? Who?

5
00:00:15.791 --> 00:00:18.310
You didn't do shit with your life, right? You haven't done anything.

6
00:00:18.311 --> 00:00:20.860
You're not bringing anything to the table. You don't have any kids.

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.860
Maybe you got busted for fucking drinking and driving.

8
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.000
You just don't fit in with your family that you got to do something right.

9
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.580
Then we'd go, you make a pie crust him. All right,

10
00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:32.320
this is what you're going to need. You're going to need one of these,

11
00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:36.730
a road pit, a fucking papers. They're staying in a pastry cloth,

12
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.140
like a board thing. I don't know what this is called. All right,

13
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.430
so maybe this is the graphic up right now, this thing, and he got,

14
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.610
you got two types of these things. He got this one. This is an old one.

15
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.930
That was one of the styles that I fucking hate doing.

16
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.230
That makes a lot of noise. This is, this was my grandmother's right?

17
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.170
I just took it from when she's on the weekend. I was just like,

18
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.950
grandma taking this right. You didn't want to eat. I'm just kidding.

19
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:08.980
She died and that's what I got. Um,

20
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.630
so anyways. Alright,

21
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.540
so two cups of flour and this is a,

22
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.720
this is the all purpose gold medal flour. It's not a

23
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.240
gluten free. Save the fucking with whatever the hell it is. It's like, look,

24
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:30.640
you're making a pie already. You know what I mean?

25
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.760
It's not going to be helpful today. Tell yourself you're going to go to the gym.

26
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.360
So there's two cups of this and you also put solid. So you just go like this.

27
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.810
You take the one cup dumping in like that. They should one cup.

28
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.740
Then I put the salt right over there. You getting there? Are you getting that?

29
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.440
You put the salt just like that. Dump it on.

30
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.950
Type of like that, right? Boom. See the done with that.

31
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.610
You take this thing here. You just doing what's going like this.

32
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.480
I don't know why you do this. Look at it. See how it's in there.

33
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.790
It looks a little different there, right?

34
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.060
[inaudible] yeah.

35
00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:19.040
Naked worked with their products and they make sure you don't steal any.

36
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.660
All right? So at this point, I mean I'm a five year old could do this.

37
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.600
Everybody gets freaked out about papers, you know what I mean? Like, oh,

38
00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:29.850
what's going to happen? What if I fuck it up? Who Cares? Nobody's watching it.

39
00:02:29.851 --> 00:02:34.000
It's not like they're filming it. Um, all right, so this is, hey a,

40
00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:38.330
this is a butter base cross. So you want eight ounces of it.

41
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.930
Every it's I kind of fucked up. I mentioned that. Well, it has it right here.

42
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.440
See what I make it nice and easy. All right. Eight tablespoons,

43
00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:48.940
I should say dope. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. It's a whole,

44
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.740
it's own goddamn stick. Um, so you want to have this shit cold.

45
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.290
You don't want to have it at room temperature because it's going to be too

46
00:02:56.291 --> 00:02:59.530
mushy. So then you just take it like this. You've washed your hands of right.

47
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.580
Um, and you just cut it up like this,

48
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.760
cut it off. You drop it in there. You getting that Andrew,

49
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.600
for the people at home. You know what's funny somewhere,

50
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.390
I don't know why and I don't know who,

51
00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:20.860
but somebody who's probably jerking off to this cause it is the internet.

52
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.830
Put the head butter in the fucking

53
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.570
wanting to see a balding redhead do.

54
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.540
This is why you want an 8.2 everybody makes 28 who did you?

55
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.760
Who'd you blow to get that thing?

56
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.250
And you don't have to suck any debt to get these. You just go to bed,

57
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:40.900
bath and beyond, right? The reason to sell yourself on the street and fight.

58
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.870
So now the problem is if you start going like this with it,

59
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:46.240
the buttons just going to get in here. It's going to be a pain in the ass.

60
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:50.650
So what I try to do is I just kind of used, he's only just,

61
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.000
I get everything covered in the flowering. I don't see that just like dad.

62
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.240
Now I want you to want to do what you want to do is just attack,

63
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.770
be tapped to. The butter's going to get stuck in this.

64
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:08.380
You start off tapping lightly, all right?

65
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.560
And then you gradually build an intensity.

66
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.520
This is essentially what all those women's magazines say.

67
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.470
Women like how you please them in bed. This is like the foreplay. Oh you are?

68
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:25.190
That is a beautiful dress. Oh yeah. How many brothers and sisters do you have?

69
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.560
Oh that's interesting. This is the hard part of doing a cooking show, Charlotte.

70
00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.810
This is usually when like Rachel,

71
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.840
we're able to just tell some fucking stories cause it reminds me of when we were

72
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:37.120
like up in the cabins in Hampshire one time.

73
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.120
[inaudible] I

74
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.380
thinks she's on medication and that's sort of the consistency you're looking

75
00:04:47.381 --> 00:04:49.060
for, their little coin y'all type of thing.

76
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.950
How fucking ridiculous is it that it makes it too much? You're going to get,

77
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.390
you're going to get a tough cluster.

78
00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.540
This grease every real mother who still beats at children and crocs and stays at

79
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:08.270
home. Like women should say.

80
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.930
He goes to meet and Cresco and you just do the same thing to just cover a little

81
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:14.350
bit of flour so it doesn't stick to whatever the fuck this thing's called.

82
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.390
Stick handle with that a little bit. You know more Phil Castle,

83
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.200
less Sidney Crosby here. Right, by the way, are you guys were like, oh,

84
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:26.020
why did they have two half times in hockey? First of all,

85
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:29.570
the math doesn't make sense. That will be a third and a two third time. Okay,

86
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.710
it's an ass. Now you got into this, you've got that consistency going there.

87
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.840
You know it's just starting to come together. This is like Yo,

88
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:37.540
your pieces are shortening and butter, right? That's what you want to have.

89
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.350
Mostly mixed. So now they say four to five ounces.

90
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.850
I like to score and this is how I put in it.

91
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.280
What I do is I go like this and then I just,

92
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.000
you know whatever I put like like that much yet, whatever.

93
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.870
I don't even know what that is. Then you take it and you put this stuff on top.

94
00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.150
Give it a little twist. I don't like the fucking kid in the mud puff. Alright,

95
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.280
same thing again. Here we go.

96
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.390
That was a really disgusting sound, wasn't there?

97
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.200
You got so it's not totally mixed. It's mostly mixed or whatever.

98
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.090
So now what you want to do, come over here or here?

99
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.680
Pastry cloth. So it doesn't stick. Let's take a little bit of flour like this.

100
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.203
PLOP it down.

101
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.000
Try to make like a little ball of it like that.

102
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.180
I'm pretty fucking good now for most people. You haven't fucked up already.

103
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.700
You haven't screwed the pooch.

104
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:46.970
This is where you separate the fucking something from the sump and this is where

105
00:06:48.121 --> 00:06:52.290
it usually goes to shit. So you do just give it a little this, this way,

106
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.090
a little fucking that way.

107
00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.780
Was there stuff on that, that stupid old. Same deal.

108
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:08.290
You stop going like this already. You start looking at that going, oh my God,

109
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.510
what's going to happen? Did I fuck it up? You did. All right.

110
00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.090
You just keep calling like this and just trying to work at

111
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.040
like, you know you're trying to make like a circle. Here's your,

112
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.760
here's your applied this, you know, you know what you're doing.

113
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.470
You know circle is right, you're a, you're an adult. All right,

114
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.430
so now this is basically what you got and this looks like a big goddamn mess.

115
00:07:30.431 --> 00:07:35.200
Doesn't it? Like like how the hell is that gonna fit into this, right?

116
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.130
And keep working in here, right? Oh, by the way,

117
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:41.860
I can't work 20 posts is the amount of people that are going to be giving me

118
00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:45.700
shit. You should've done. All right.

119
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.010
You just take a little bit of this crap, right? You'd use it up. Yeah.

120
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.340
Now this thing is, this is an absolute shit show that does not. I mean,

121
00:07:53.341 --> 00:07:57.420
you see it as a cross. You can see it. It's there not a fuck.

122
00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:02.310
And you get this into that and to have it somewhat look like this,

123
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.850
look how perfect. There's this fucking bastard.

124
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.370
So that consistency is straight up.

125
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.790
Day is right here. This is the model for,

126
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.840
alright, so you just basically got one, two, three, Bam. Just like that.

127
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.880
Okay. You don't even think about it. You know,

128
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.120
it's like breaking up with somebody you don't want to be with. You.

129
00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:31.340
Just sit down. What's wrong? I'm not happy and just stay in it.

130
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.790
What happened? It's not you, it's not me. It's just, it's right here.

131
00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:40.730
It's just like this one, two, three, boom.

132
00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.640
It's like that. Let me take this part over here.

133
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.090
Fucking bring it out that and bomb. Now you're gone.

134
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.730
Fucking third toe.

135
00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:56.731
Now what you want to do is you want to push this down so it lines the,

136
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.690
uh, the pie plate here. And if you go like that, it's gonna rip.

137
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:05.560
So what you do is you lift this up like this. That's how you, I like that.

138
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.790
Oops. No one's ever going to know. All right? You push things down,

139
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.830
you start making things fit here.

140
00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:20.810
Everything worked out. There you go.

141
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.710
There's your pie crust and a little bit of flour there. A little bit of flour,

142
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.970
nothing. And that's the, a fill is whatever the fuck you want to put in there.

143
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.900
You know, just start off with some, uh, some of your grandmother's recipes.

144
00:09:32.901 --> 00:09:35.860
You know, if you think it's under seasoned or overseas and you know,

145
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.700
you make it an apple pie, not enough cinnamon.

146
