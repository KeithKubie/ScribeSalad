00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.770
So let's sort of focus
on privacy threats and

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.960
the context of tracking information or
online information.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.500
Somebody tracks your
activities that you do online.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.730
Okay, so tracking, essentially,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.770
it's collection of information about
the activities that you do online.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.390
So, a threat is collection
of such information,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.510
the act of tracking what you do.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.290
If they do it with your
consent that's one thing.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.584
But doing it without your consent,
obviously, that many of us,

00:00:35.584 --> 00:00:38.251
we'll view as invasion of our privacy.

00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:44.169
Okay, so one threat is without consent,
doing this without consent.

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:49.043
If they have collected this
information how can they use?

00:00:49.043 --> 00:00:53.610
How did I agree to this specific
use that they have in mind?

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.590
If I had not agreed to it, or
this was not sort of revealed to me,

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.670
well, that's a threat to my privacy.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.400
How long can they keep some information
that I agreed they can collect about me?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.090
We're talking tracking information.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.560
You went through a certain website,
you searched for results.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.820
How long do they keep this information?

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.740
Who do they share this information with?

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.140
Maybe this information has some value
associated because it describes me,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.010
what I do,
what my preferences may be and

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.670
things like that, so they can
actually sell it to somebody else.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.560
And if they're selling to somebody else,
did I agree to it?

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.212
Are these parties that
I had authorized or

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:40.501
I had given consent that
sharing is okay with me?

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.590
Or do they do it without my knowledge?

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.500
If they do it without my knowledge,
of course,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.040
that's another privacy threat, because
my information then gets to somebody

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.100
else that I had no idea that they
would be able to gain access to it.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.740
So, I may actually specify
what they can collect, and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.710
who they can share it with and
how long they can retain.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.930
So that's what the constitutes
we're going to see and

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.300
examples that are privacy
policy that we agree to.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.570
But what if the policy changes actually,
so information collected by me, actually

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.590
they change it to a more lax policy,
then they don't ask me to agree to it.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.110
Then they will be able to do things that
they were not able to do before, and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.775
they're not able to do those
things before because they hadn't

00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:26.725
agreed to it, to them.

00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:30.785
So, now by changing the policy they
could basically can get around that

00:02:30.785 --> 00:02:35.995
requirement that I give explicit
consent and that's a threat if

00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:41.480
all privacy policies can be changed
to anytime without informing me and

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.030
getting my consent,
then that's a threat to my privacy.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.530
And finally,
sort of information security,

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.560
this is what we're talking about,
they collect all this information.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.130
What if they have a breach?

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.830
The bad guy walks away
with all this information.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.970
They didn't explicitly share it with
the bad guy, they were trying to sort of

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.720
respect my privacy and only share it
with whoever I had agreed to, but

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.190
a bad guys, they don't care
about consent and agreement.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.980
The reason they were able to reach and
gain access to this information that's

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.371
private is may be my information
security was not what it should be.

00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:19.910
We hadn't have good
identity access management,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.487
didn't have good monitoring and
place and various other threats.

00:03:24.487 --> 00:03:29.000
So, if they are going to collect this
information and in good faith going to

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.210
try to use it the way you agree
that they be able to use it.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.000
Well, we still have to
protect it from the bad guys.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.370
And if they don't,
that is a privacy threat.
