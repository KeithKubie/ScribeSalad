00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.620
Now, finally let's talk
about the occasional and

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.330
the cultural segmentation options.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.710
The occasional segmentation focuses on
certain occasions that are completely

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.140
independent of the customer.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.970
Now, you don't care about demographics.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.860
You just care about occasions
such as going out for

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.570
ice cream, taking a vacation, or
as Coke famously did it, being thirsty.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.762
Coke's campaign doesn't care if you're
a man, woman, living in Uruguay or

00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:30.770
Ukraine or if you have high
socio-economic status or low.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.120
All they care about is are you thirsty,
it's very simple.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.160
And finally there's
cultural segmentation.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.960
With this you'll classify the markets
according to cultural origin.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.830
Now this can be incredibly powerful
given that understanding a culture can

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.130
give you so much insight to certain
groups of customers and their behaviors.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.760
Now when you use cultural segmentation,
you'll be able to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.510
communicate well with a given
culture in the most effective way.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.890
Cultures can be large,
they can be nationwide.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.180
Or they can be small and

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.990
reflect a particular region such as the
Bay Area or even the startup culture.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.840
And so now we've talked about a few
different types of segmentation.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.050
Behavioral psychographic, demographic,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.810
geographic, occasional and
cultural segmentation.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.790
Let's explore how to
best segment your market.
