00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:01.870
All right.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.030
So welcome to the green glow--

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.730
psych ward.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.830
[rain pouring]

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.500
I'd rather be just
about anywhere but

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.370
inside this shelter right now.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.000
These rainy days are brutal.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.370
It's cold.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.670
I don't want to go outside.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.000
I don't want to be in here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.270
And it's just a monotonous day.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.300
It's going to be tough.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.900
Need my blue sky for
my mental health.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.170
How in the world did I
survive Vancouver Island?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.530
I don't know.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.530
I had a white tarp,
for one thing.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.370
Huge difference, white tarp.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.430
Not this green psych ward
shelter I'm living in.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.530
It's not good-- not
good for the mind.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.800
Just sitting here
staring at the fire.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.370
Hoping the rain slows down
or stops today at some point,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.230
so I can get outside.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.600
[rain pouring]

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600
I'm pretty sick of myself.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.700
Yep.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.500
Had all about enough
of me as I can stand.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.930
[laughs] Woo!

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.300
It's a party.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.730
Party of one!
That's me.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.600
You know, I don't think it's--

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.270
the rain is
lightening up at all.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.430
I don't think the
sky is, either.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.170
[rain pouring]

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.570
It's my wishful imagination.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.770
I'm not sure how much
more I can handle today.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.070
Hey, guys.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.830
Turns out I'm pretty sick
of hanging out with myself.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.570
And I'm pretty lonely.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.800
It-- it gets to
you after a while.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.470
Just the quiet of not
sharing the experience--

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.970
it just kind of
eats away at you.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.600
[sobbing] And, uh,
starving sucks.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.800
[laughs]

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.600
It has been so
incredibly humbling to go

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.300
through this twice.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.670
I feel like this time, because I
was alone instead of with Dave,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:33.930
it's a bit of redemption.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.900
It's a bit of a chance
to prove on my own

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.070
the skills that I have.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.300
But there is this recollection
of Vancouver Island.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.700
I don't want to go there again.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.030
I don't want to get
that hungry again.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.570
This is enough hungry.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.870
This is enough cold.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.530
This is enough loneliness.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.730
It's enough of
the green monster.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.600
It's like, OK, this is over.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.770
Leave with a smile on my face.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.900
And that's what I choose.
