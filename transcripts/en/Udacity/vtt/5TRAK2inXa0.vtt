00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.804
In all the cases before, we've been adding like radicals together. And in a

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:06.684
couple of the cases, we couldn't even combine the radicals, because the

00:00:06.684 --> 00:00:11.320
radicands were different. Sometimes radicals will appear to be different, but

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.306
they're actually alike. We can simplify these radicals to determine whether or

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:19.380
not we can add or subtract them together. For example, we can split up the

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.846
square root of 20 into 4 times 5. Then, we can split this radical up into two

00:00:23.846 --> 00:00:28.877
separate radicals, using our product rule. We do the same thing for 80 and for

00:00:28.877 --> 00:00:32.452
500. Notice that when I split up 80, I split it up into the largest perfect

00:00:32.452 --> 00:00:37.449
square. And the same is true for 500. 100 is the largest perfect square that

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.978
goes into 500. This allows me to simplify the radicals more quickly. Now that

00:00:41.978 --> 00:00:45.878
we have some perfect squares, we can simplify them. The square root of 4 equals

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:51.750
2, the square of 16 equals 4, and the square root of 100 equals 10. We multiply

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.772
the remaining factors in front of our radical to get 16 root 5, 12 root 5, and

00:00:56.772 --> 00:01:02.148
negative 20 root 5. Notice how we were able to simplify each of these radicals

00:01:02.148 --> 00:01:06.276
to radicals that all have a square root of 5. Because these radicals are

00:01:06.276 --> 00:01:10.530
identical, we can add and subtract them. We'll have 16 plus 12 minus 20, which

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.691
equals 8 times the square root of 5. This is why we learn how to simplify

00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:19.585
radicals first, because even though these radicals don't appear to be like, we

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:23.223
can simplify them and then combine them.
