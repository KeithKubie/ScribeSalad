00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:12.974
- I'm happy to introduce Ruti Regan,

00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:15.940
and Ruti is a rabbinical
student from the

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.669
Jewish Theological Seminary of America,

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.183
board member and founder of Anachnu,

00:00:21.183 --> 00:00:23.542
inclusion speaker and
trainer from New York.

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:26.429
And Ruti is going to talk to us about

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.999
when listening is complicated,
skills for honoring

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.499
the individual perspectives
of every person

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:33.968
with disabilities.

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:34.801
Ruti.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.700
- Hello, everyone.

00:00:53.421 --> 00:00:55.374
Everyone hear me?

00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:58.062
Can the person next to you hear me?

00:00:58.062 --> 00:01:00.381
(audience laughs)

00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:02.658
Well, check, 'cause if you can't hear me

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:06.408
you probably didn't hear
the question, right?

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:11.401
So I'm Ruti Regan, I'm a rabbinic leader

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:14.816
in a couple of organizations
concerned with disability.

00:01:14.816 --> 00:01:18.310
One of which is Matan,
which is an organization

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.342
that about 10 years ago was founded

00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:23.638
to solve the problem of
Jewish kids with disabilities

00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:26.888
not getting access to Jewish education.

00:01:27.794 --> 00:01:30.477
What we used to doing
is mostly self-contained

00:01:30.477 --> 00:01:32.303
Special Ed Hebrew school classes,

00:01:32.303 --> 00:01:35.518
but we've realized that
kids really need education

00:01:35.518 --> 00:01:37.594
within their own communities.

00:01:37.594 --> 00:01:41.011
So now what we do is
train education directors,

00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:43.045
educators, SEIT schools, how to increase

00:01:43.045 --> 00:01:45.445
the inclusivity of their programs.

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:47.769
And I also work for Anachnu,

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:50.860
which is another Jewish
disability organization.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.703
Anachnu means 'we' in Hebrew,

00:01:53.703 --> 00:01:57.120
and the reason that's behind that is that

00:01:58.264 --> 00:02:01.357
a lot of what I do, a lot of what we do,

00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:04.204
is focused on getting out of the silos,

00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:07.133
because I think that
we all need each other.

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:10.838
You know we have a lot of
great developments in medicine,

00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:14.584
in social work, in special education,

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:18.563
in disability organizations, from parents.

00:02:18.563 --> 00:02:21.288
And there's a lot of
barriers to collaboration

00:02:21.288 --> 00:02:24.582
and to us knowing what we
all, and sharing knowledge.

00:02:24.582 --> 00:02:26.947
And I think we all really need each other,

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:28.822
because dealing with disability

00:02:28.822 --> 00:02:32.235
has a lot of unsolved problems
that are very difficult

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.676
on a number of levels.

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:35.978
And so what we've found is that

00:02:35.978 --> 00:02:39.803
one of the most difficult
silos to get out of,

00:02:39.803 --> 00:02:42.611
is the one regarding
disability perspective.

00:02:42.611 --> 00:02:45.415
Because we're socialized to believe

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:48.706
that disability
perspective does not exist.

00:02:48.706 --> 00:02:51.873
And even if we know better explicitly,

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:54.608
which I think most of us do,

00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:58.794
to feel that people with
disabilities have needs,

00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:01.597
people without disabilities
have perspectives.

00:03:01.597 --> 00:03:03.831
I can't tell you how many times I've heard

00:03:03.831 --> 00:03:05.986
'we're doing all these things

00:03:05.986 --> 00:03:08.302
to meet this child's medical needs,

00:03:08.302 --> 00:03:11.317
but how does his sister
feel about all of this?'

00:03:11.317 --> 00:03:13.921
Well that's great, that's a
question we should be asking,

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:17.668
but also, how does he feel,
and what does he think?

00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:21.668
And so, from a spiritual
leadership perspective,

00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:26.220
and also from a service
provision perspective,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.582
because a lot of it's pretty universal,

00:03:28.582 --> 00:03:31.631
and also from a disability perspective,

00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:35.125
I wanna talk about how
in various settings,

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:37.522
clinical and educational,

00:03:37.522 --> 00:03:41.141
we can really acknowledge
in practical ways

00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:43.010
that everybody has a perspective,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.843
and that everybody's
perspective is important.

00:03:48.307 --> 00:03:52.129
So let me just flip to
this slide here. Okay.

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.140
So, the thing that's core about this

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.555
is people really always have perspectives

00:03:58.555 --> 00:04:00.714
whether or not we know what they are.

00:04:00.714 --> 00:04:03.684
And sometimes there is no effective means

00:04:03.684 --> 00:04:07.634
for knowing with either
certainty or any real accuracy

00:04:07.634 --> 00:04:10.076
what someone's perspective might be.

00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:12.067
And whether we know or not,

00:04:12.067 --> 00:04:14.548
and again a lot of times we don't,

00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:16.786
the perspective exists and it matters.

00:04:16.786 --> 00:04:20.848
And we need to treat it as
both an unsolved problem

00:04:20.848 --> 00:04:23.775
in figuring out more effective
ways for figuring out

00:04:23.775 --> 00:04:27.110
what people are thinking when
there's communication barriers

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.360
but also a problem of what do we do now

00:04:31.987 --> 00:04:34.100
when we haven't solved the problem,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.379
or are in the process
of solving the problem

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:38.535
and there's this person before us,

00:04:38.535 --> 00:04:40.410
who we may not know what they think,

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.441
but we want to recognize their humanity

00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:45.004
in a way that is about
recognizing it to them,

00:04:45.004 --> 00:04:48.662
and not just to society, not
just to their caregivers,

00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:50.455
not just to people that might hurt them

00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:51.839
if they think they're not human,

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:54.922
but to that person and everyone else.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.863
So, we can't read people minds,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.564
their minds are still there
and they're still important.

00:05:03.564 --> 00:05:06.147
And one place this breaks down,

00:05:07.215 --> 00:05:10.069
is when somebody has a
proxy decision maker,

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.468
because they either are in reality,

00:05:12.468 --> 00:05:15.075
or have been determined by
someone else to not be someone

00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:18.537
who's capable of
communicating their choices.

00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:21.960
Somebody can be a proxy decision-maker,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.356
they cannot be a proxy mind,

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:27.817
a proxy perspective-haver
or a proxy human.

00:05:27.817 --> 00:05:31.198
Nobody is a proxy for
someone else's humanity.

00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:35.100
And somebody's views exist,
matter, are important,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.228
even if they have a proxy decision-maker,

00:05:38.228 --> 00:05:41.892
even if we don't know
what their views are,

00:05:41.892 --> 00:05:45.309
even if their views are being overridden.

00:05:46.197 --> 00:05:49.497
And consent means something legally,

00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:51.983
and it means something morally,

00:05:51.983 --> 00:05:55.400
and even if there is legal
consent from someone else,

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.937
it matters when somebody's
consent in the sense of

00:05:58.937 --> 00:06:02.770
their bodily integrity,
autonomy, views, choices

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.260
being overridden,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.610
and part of recognizing
somebody's humanity is

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.847
acknowledging that,
taking that into account

00:06:09.847 --> 00:06:11.665
in our decision-making,

00:06:11.665 --> 00:06:15.832
and using language that reflects
the fact that it happened.

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.480
Because it's very
difficult to solve problems

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.549
that we don't acknowledge.

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:26.716
And it can be very painful
emotionally, spiritually,

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.789
to think of ourselves
as people who are doing

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.100
something against someone's
will that's distressing to them.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.079
But even if it's the right decision,

00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:40.510
even if we have to do
it, it's really important

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:43.177
to acknowledge what's happening,

00:06:44.647 --> 00:06:48.483
and to remember that as bad
as we might feel about it,

00:06:48.483 --> 00:06:53.202
it feels a lot worse to be
the person it's happening to,

00:06:53.202 --> 00:06:56.785
and they shouldn't have
to feel that alone.

00:06:57.627 --> 00:07:02.053
So respecting someone's
perspective is partly an attitude,

00:07:02.053 --> 00:07:06.180
but a lot of it is embodied in practice.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.012
And it's something that
I think that we all need

00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:09.959
to work on continuously.

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.976
But one thing that I
think is really key about

00:07:12.976 --> 00:07:15.332
recognizing humanity in practice,

00:07:15.332 --> 00:07:18.761
is acknowledging that we're
making a lot of guesses.

00:07:18.761 --> 00:07:20.579
We're making a lot of assumptions,

00:07:20.579 --> 00:07:23.847
and we're going to be wrong
a high percentage of time,

00:07:23.847 --> 00:07:25.911
when we're communicating with people

00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:28.598
for whom there are
barriers to communication

00:07:28.598 --> 00:07:30.705
in the sense of them understanding us,

00:07:30.705 --> 00:07:32.644
and communication in the
sense of them telling us

00:07:32.644 --> 00:07:34.336
what they think about it.

00:07:34.336 --> 00:07:37.272
We're making guesses, we're
going to be wrong a lot,

00:07:37.272 --> 00:07:39.253
and we're not going to be as competent

00:07:39.253 --> 00:07:41.447
as we like to feel we are,

00:07:41.447 --> 00:07:44.714
and as we are in areas
where there's more of

00:07:44.714 --> 00:07:46.658
an established knowledge base.

00:07:46.658 --> 00:07:48.971
And part of getting good at it,

00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:52.769
is realizing that it's
an unsolved problem,

00:07:52.769 --> 00:07:54.466
it's hard because it's hard.

00:07:54.466 --> 00:07:55.749
It's not a failure, it's just that we have

00:07:55.749 --> 00:08:00.086
received education on
all kinds of other things

00:08:00.086 --> 00:08:02.736
that allow us to be really competent,

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:05.639
when we don't have received education,

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:07.790
we don't know certain
things, and it's okay,

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.980
and it's not a professional failure,

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.883
it's not a reflection on anyone,

00:08:11.883 --> 00:08:14.736
it is an unsolved problem
that it's on all of us

00:08:14.736 --> 00:08:15.688
to work on.

00:08:15.688 --> 00:08:19.105
That said, there are certain assumptions.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:22.681
Part of it is a matter of

00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:24.295
working on making good assumptions,

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:27.517
part of it is learning
error correction mechanisms.

00:08:27.517 --> 00:08:30.623
And there are certain assumptions
that we should be making.

00:08:30.623 --> 00:08:33.478
One is, it's said a lot
in disability communities,

00:08:33.478 --> 00:08:34.927
regarding communication:

00:08:34.927 --> 00:08:37.277
silence is not absence.

00:08:37.277 --> 00:08:40.295
When somebody isn't responding,
all you know is that

00:08:40.295 --> 00:08:42.075
they're not responding.

00:08:42.075 --> 00:08:43.316
You don't know what they're thinking,

00:08:43.316 --> 00:08:47.328
you don't know what their
cognitive abilities are,

00:08:47.328 --> 00:08:50.911
and we make a lot of
mistakes in that area,

00:08:52.085 --> 00:08:55.269
so it's really good to err on the side of

00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:58.936
assuming that people
who have brain activity

00:09:00.599 --> 00:09:03.656
are capable of understanding
and have opinions

00:09:03.656 --> 00:09:05.062
about what you're saying.

00:09:05.062 --> 00:09:07.713
Whether they in fact do understand or not,

00:09:07.713 --> 00:09:09.783
they are people who have
thoughts, feelings and

00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:13.135
we should at least try
to explain things to

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:15.635
and at least try to listen to.

00:09:16.855 --> 00:09:19.047
'Cause if we don't try we won't succeed.

00:09:19.047 --> 00:09:21.610
And again, a lot of this is guessing.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.424
And part of guessing well is being clear

00:09:24.424 --> 00:09:27.493
about what you know, what you don't know,

00:09:27.493 --> 00:09:29.269
and if you think you know something,

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:32.352
how do you know and how do you check?

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.866
So one thing that I
didn't put in the slides

00:09:37.866 --> 00:09:39.689
that I think is important is
that part of good guessing

00:09:39.689 --> 00:09:41.678
is cultural competence.

00:09:41.678 --> 00:09:45.198
Because people with disabilities are not

00:09:45.198 --> 00:09:48.007
interchangeable disabled people.

00:09:48.007 --> 00:09:50.946
People with disabilities, disabled people,

00:09:50.946 --> 00:09:53.226
come from somewhere, have a culture,

00:09:53.226 --> 00:09:55.957
have a cultural background,

00:09:55.957 --> 00:09:58.897
operate within a cultural context.

00:09:58.897 --> 00:10:02.086
And not only that, but
they're not interchangeable.

00:10:02.086 --> 00:10:05.067
We're not interchangeable within cultures.

00:10:05.067 --> 00:10:09.234
For instance in the Bay Area,
I'm sure all of you are aware,

00:10:10.524 --> 00:10:13.667
that a lot of parents
who are really crunchy

00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:18.426
will swear up and down
that their kid hates sugar.

00:10:18.426 --> 00:10:22.279
So cultural competence
involves recognizing that

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:24.140
they may well be wrong about that,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.027
and that the kid has a
cultural reaction to sugar

00:10:27.027 --> 00:10:29.716
and to being part of that culture,

00:10:29.716 --> 00:10:31.043
which may be a number of things.

00:10:31.043 --> 00:10:34.847
Less obvious examples is:
not all Jews keep kosher,

00:10:34.847 --> 00:10:38.158
not all Jews will like
it if a person shows up

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:41.175
and makes certain assumptions
about how they feel

00:10:41.175 --> 00:10:44.441
about gender, or what their
culture is, stuff like that.

00:10:44.441 --> 00:10:48.249
But you should still probably
know when Passover is,

00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:52.512
and there's a range of things
that people might be thinking,

00:10:52.512 --> 00:10:55.113
feelings people might be
having around the holidays,

00:10:55.113 --> 00:10:57.514
because working on making good assumptions

00:10:57.514 --> 00:11:01.897
is part of improving your
ability to make good guesses.

00:11:01.897 --> 00:11:05.980
So, another part of guesses,
making good guesses,

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.385
is that when you don't know,

00:11:09.385 --> 00:11:12.072
it's important to try multiple things.

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:14.466
And the less responsive someone is,

00:11:14.466 --> 00:11:16.371
the less evidence you have,

00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:20.305
the more important it is
to try multiple approaches.

00:11:20.305 --> 00:11:22.740
For instance, one thing
that I think is very much

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.094
consistently on the table
when we're talking about

00:11:25.094 --> 00:11:26.623
developmental disability,

00:11:26.623 --> 00:11:29.394
is the issue of simple language.

00:11:29.394 --> 00:11:32.451
And for some people
simple language is great.

00:11:32.451 --> 00:11:35.015
For some people using simplified language

00:11:35.015 --> 00:11:36.969
can make all the difference

00:11:36.969 --> 00:11:39.618
in their ability to understand things.

00:11:39.618 --> 00:11:42.276
And for some people
using simplified language

00:11:42.276 --> 00:11:44.424
completely breaks their ability to have

00:11:44.424 --> 00:11:47.025
any idea what you're talking about.

00:11:47.025 --> 00:11:51.450
Because there's a reason why
we use technical language.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.552
Technical language increases
some kinds of clarity

00:11:54.552 --> 00:11:57.031
and it sends certain
kinds of messages in a way

00:11:57.031 --> 00:11:58.892
that's more understandable.

00:11:58.892 --> 00:12:01.701
And for some people,
simple language can be

00:12:01.701 --> 00:12:04.601
very vague and confusing and disorienting,

00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:06.294
and can send the message
that you don't think

00:12:06.294 --> 00:12:08.114
that they understand things.

00:12:08.114 --> 00:12:09.930
So if you don't know,

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:14.359
and if somebody's not responding
clearly, you don't know,

00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:17.256
regardless of what someone
else says their I.Q. is,

00:12:17.256 --> 00:12:20.775
'cause we don't have great
assessments for distinguishing

00:12:20.775 --> 00:12:23.507
between not understanding and
not being able to respond.

00:12:23.507 --> 00:12:26.609
But in any case, if you don't know

00:12:26.609 --> 00:12:28.926
it's really important
to try simple language,

00:12:28.926 --> 00:12:32.946
and it's really important to
also try technical language.

00:12:32.946 --> 00:12:34.392
And even if somebody is responding,

00:12:34.392 --> 00:12:36.871
if somebody is not
understanding or responding

00:12:36.871 --> 00:12:40.601
to your simplified language,
try something else.

00:12:40.601 --> 00:12:42.129
Because sometimes the problem

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:44.796
isn't that it's too complicated,

00:12:46.139 --> 00:12:49.740
sometimes the problem is
that it's too simplified.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.087
Another thing that's really important,

00:12:53.087 --> 00:12:55.773
in recognizing people's humanity

00:12:55.773 --> 00:12:57.921
that is less guess-oriented,

00:12:57.921 --> 00:13:01.643
is that it's very important
to address people directly,

00:13:01.643 --> 00:13:04.998
even if you think the
overwhelming probability is that

00:13:04.998 --> 00:13:06.656
somebody no longer understands language,

00:13:06.656 --> 00:13:08.513
never did understand language,

00:13:08.513 --> 00:13:11.283
has no idea what you're talking about.

00:13:11.283 --> 00:13:14.712
It's very important to
directly address them

00:13:14.712 --> 00:13:17.939
and not just the people they came with,

00:13:17.939 --> 00:13:21.389
and to not just examine someone,
or make a plan for someone.

00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:24.389
It's important to address them directly,

00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:27.662
and that's beneficial even if it turns out

00:13:27.662 --> 00:13:29.730
that they really don't understand you,

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.665
because most people have
some understanding of

00:13:32.665 --> 00:13:35.852
what's considered respectful
behavior and what's not,

00:13:35.852 --> 00:13:38.423
and most people who
don't understand language

00:13:38.423 --> 00:13:40.951
do understand being ignored,

00:13:40.951 --> 00:13:44.219
and do understand being treated as though

00:13:44.219 --> 00:13:45.802
they're irrelevant.

00:13:48.316 --> 00:13:50.757
And, a lot of times people do,

00:13:50.757 --> 00:13:53.090
and people who do understand

00:13:54.072 --> 00:13:58.086
and have a lot of trouble
communicating often give up,

00:13:58.086 --> 00:14:01.440
because of despair, because of
just coming to the conclusion

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.377
that nobody is ever going
to listen to them anyways,

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:05.294
so why try?

00:14:06.449 --> 00:14:09.871
And sending the message that you care,

00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:12.191
can help somebody to not give up,

00:14:12.191 --> 00:14:14.799
and you might not see the fruits of it,

00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:18.350
but it still might be part
of what gets them to a point

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:20.212
where they don't give up and they're able

00:14:20.212 --> 00:14:21.575
to communicate later.

00:14:21.575 --> 00:14:23.976
So it's part of recognizing humanity,

00:14:23.976 --> 00:14:26.751
and it can be beneficial in other ways.

00:14:26.751 --> 00:14:28.942
It's often worth saying explicitly

00:14:28.942 --> 00:14:30.886
that you're acknowledging the situation.

00:14:30.886 --> 00:14:31.921
Like saying things like

00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:33.902
'I don't understand what you're saying,'

00:14:33.902 --> 00:14:35.634
'I do care what you're saying,'

00:14:35.634 --> 00:14:37.369
'your opinion is imporant to me,'

00:14:37.369 --> 00:14:39.229
'I want to listen to you.'

00:14:39.229 --> 00:14:42.167
Sometimes that doesn't go anywhere,

00:14:42.167 --> 00:14:46.316
but sometimes if you
keep doing that over time

00:14:46.316 --> 00:14:47.983
people surprise you.

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:54.861
So part of giving people space
to communicate is wait time.

00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:57.426
Something that educators
are advised to do,

00:14:57.426 --> 00:15:00.238
is when you're lecturing
and you say something,

00:15:00.238 --> 00:15:02.681
ask a question, and nobody's responding,

00:15:02.681 --> 00:15:05.161
it can feel like an
eternity, and you're like

00:15:05.161 --> 00:15:06.816
'oh my God, they must
not have understood me,

00:15:06.816 --> 00:15:08.598
I should jump in and clarify,'

00:15:08.598 --> 00:15:11.124
it's like this natural instinct
'cause it feels really long,

00:15:11.124 --> 00:15:13.480
but what teachers are told,

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.919
and they've found that as a
teacher this really matters,

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:18.601
is that you need to wait
at least seven seconds

00:15:18.601 --> 00:15:22.280
after you ask a question
before you say anything else,

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.386
because it gives people time

00:15:24.386 --> 00:15:26.994
to process and formulate responses.

00:15:26.994 --> 00:15:29.827
And so, if you're asking questions

00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:35.642
and not giving space
for people to respond,

00:15:35.642 --> 00:15:38.289
the questions effectively don't get asked.

00:15:38.289 --> 00:15:43.128
So with anyone, waiting at least
seven seconds is necessary,

00:15:43.128 --> 00:15:44.619
with people with disabilities

00:15:44.619 --> 00:15:46.975
it's often necessary to wait longer.

00:15:46.975 --> 00:15:48.546
So if somebody is not responding

00:15:48.546 --> 00:15:50.654
and is being said to be non-responsive,

00:15:50.654 --> 00:15:54.957
sometimes just waiting
longer can be game-changing.

00:15:54.957 --> 00:15:58.976
And if somebody uses
alternative communication,

00:15:58.976 --> 00:16:01.726
no matter how skilled someone is,

00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:04.814
that's going to take longer,

00:16:04.814 --> 00:16:07.295
and making it clear that you're willing

00:16:07.295 --> 00:16:08.657
to take the time to listen,

00:16:08.657 --> 00:16:11.388
and that you're not rushing
through and interrupting

00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.618
is both respectful and conducive

00:16:13.618 --> 00:16:17.142
to actually recognizing
that somebody's perspective

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:20.989
is important, knowing what
it is and acting on it.

00:16:20.989 --> 00:16:25.052
So, related to that, people
have a lot of different

00:16:25.052 --> 00:16:27.082
communication preferences,

00:16:27.082 --> 00:16:30.267
and sometimes if you ask what
they are people can tell you.

00:16:30.267 --> 00:16:33.434
Not always, but sometimes asking about

00:16:34.861 --> 00:16:38.694
communication preferences
gives somebody space

00:16:40.274 --> 00:16:42.912
to feel safe enough to communicate

00:16:42.912 --> 00:16:45.355
in a way that isn't typical.

00:16:45.355 --> 00:16:48.207
And this is important even
with people where you're like

00:16:48.207 --> 00:16:50.853
'oh, he's so high-functioning,
she's so high-functioning,

00:16:50.853 --> 00:16:52.502
they're so verbal.'

00:16:52.502 --> 00:16:55.237
Just because somebody can talk

00:16:55.237 --> 00:16:57.350
in a relatively normal
cadence doesn't mean

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.753
that's the best way for
them to communicate,

00:16:59.753 --> 00:17:01.946
and most people who can speak

00:17:01.946 --> 00:17:05.666
for whom another form of
communication is better

00:17:05.666 --> 00:17:08.021
are really afraid of
the reaction they'll get

00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:09.838
from educators, from social workers,

00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:12.088
from medical professionals.

00:17:13.388 --> 00:17:16.116
So asking about
communication preferences and

00:17:16.116 --> 00:17:20.283
continuing to ask can be both
effective and respectful.

00:17:22.488 --> 00:17:25.430
And even if people
don't take you up on it,

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.498
it can still mean that
they're less afraid of you

00:17:27.498 --> 00:17:28.665
in other ways.

00:17:30.641 --> 00:17:31.474
Related:

00:17:34.623 --> 00:17:37.628
asking yes or no questions
can get a lot of mileage

00:17:37.628 --> 00:17:41.461
and it works a lot better
if it's planned for.

00:17:43.293 --> 00:17:47.896
And a lot of people can actually
answer yes or no questions

00:17:47.896 --> 00:17:52.032
but can't initiate explaining
to you how they say yes or no.

00:17:52.032 --> 00:17:53.599
So it can be worth asking,

00:17:53.599 --> 00:17:55.337
again with appropriate wait time:

00:17:55.337 --> 00:17:58.561
can you show me yes, can you show me no?

00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:01.660
And thinking in advance: what is it likely

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:05.827
that someone in this
situation, facing this issue,

00:18:11.314 --> 00:18:13.286
from this culture, of this age and gender,

00:18:13.286 --> 00:18:15.182
might want to be able to tell me,

00:18:15.182 --> 00:18:19.105
and writing down some of the
questions they might want.

00:18:19.105 --> 00:18:21.047
Because not everyone can use their words,

00:18:21.047 --> 00:18:23.880
some people need you to use yours.

00:18:28.185 --> 00:18:31.387
If you plan for it, you
can get a lot of mileage

00:18:31.387 --> 00:18:33.371
out of yes or no questions,

00:18:33.371 --> 00:18:36.931
two choice questions, that are more open,

00:18:36.931 --> 00:18:41.183
can get you often more
mileage than yes or no.

00:18:41.183 --> 00:18:44.578
For instance, some of
them can be closed like

00:18:44.578 --> 00:18:46.106
'do you want x or y?'

00:18:46.106 --> 00:18:48.756
but you can also do
things that are more open,

00:18:48.756 --> 00:18:52.316
along the lines of 'I
think you're saying x,

00:18:52.316 --> 00:18:55.214
am I getting that right, or
did you mean something else?'

00:18:55.214 --> 00:18:58.849
And then continuing to
make and check guesses

00:18:58.849 --> 00:19:03.315
allows for a surprising
amount of communication,

00:19:03.315 --> 00:19:07.363
and I've done this very
effectively with a number of people

00:19:07.363 --> 00:19:09.349
who others had told me

00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:12.331
are impossible to have
a conversation with.

00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:16.346
So even if somebody is saying
things that seem to you to be

00:19:16.346 --> 00:19:20.436
complete nonsense, or
non-seqiturs, like random phrases

00:19:20.436 --> 00:19:22.468
from television or whatever,

00:19:22.468 --> 00:19:26.896
making a guess and asking
them to confirm or deny it,

00:19:26.896 --> 00:19:29.671
and acting on the possibility that

00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:33.565
it may well be communication,
for some people can open up

00:19:33.565 --> 00:19:36.828
a lot of communicative possibilities.

00:19:36.828 --> 00:19:38.688
And again, not universal.

00:19:38.688 --> 00:19:41.991
For some people this can be heard as

00:19:41.991 --> 00:19:44.143
'why are you not ignoring my vocal tick,

00:19:44.143 --> 00:19:45.382
what's wrong with you?'

00:19:45.382 --> 00:19:49.189
So again, it's about making
and confirming guesses

00:19:49.189 --> 00:19:52.203
there are unfortunately very few universal

00:19:52.203 --> 00:19:54.064
or well-established things,

00:19:54.064 --> 00:19:57.064
but this is often well worth trying.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.687
And, related to documenting
communication and uncertainty,

00:20:16.714 --> 00:20:20.881
Related to documenting
communication and uncertainty,

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:26.557
doing chaplaincy, I've seen
a lot of people's charts

00:20:26.557 --> 00:20:29.707
say that they have no communication,

00:20:29.707 --> 00:20:33.874
and in situations where
what that really meant was

00:20:35.207 --> 00:20:38.726
they have dementia, or they speak slowly,

00:20:38.726 --> 00:20:41.090
or I didn't talk to them.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:45.187
And writing down that
somebody has no communication

00:20:45.187 --> 00:20:47.831
in their chart endangers them,

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:50.650
and it is something that
nobody should ever do.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.593
And that's one of the few
things in this presentation

00:20:52.593 --> 00:20:55.283
I'm comfortable saying unequivocally.

00:20:55.283 --> 00:20:59.418
It is absolutely never
appropriate to write

00:20:59.418 --> 00:21:02.517
in somebody's chart, in
their file, in their I.E.P,

00:21:02.517 --> 00:21:03.921
in their educational plan:

00:21:03.921 --> 00:21:05.948
this person has no communication,

00:21:05.948 --> 00:21:09.092
this person is incapable of conversation.

00:21:09.092 --> 00:21:11.076
It can be appropriate to say

00:21:11.076 --> 00:21:13.599
'I was not able to find an effective means

00:21:13.599 --> 00:21:15.793
of communication with this person,'

00:21:15.793 --> 00:21:17.992
because that's what you actually know.

00:21:17.992 --> 00:21:20.721
If you didn't communicate with someone,

00:21:20.721 --> 00:21:22.665
what you know about that person,

00:21:22.665 --> 00:21:26.591
is that you did not successfully
communicate with them.

00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:27.832
You don't know what they're thinking,

00:21:27.832 --> 00:21:29.865
you don't know what they're
capable of understanding,

00:21:29.865 --> 00:21:32.226
you don't know what they're
capable of communicating

00:21:32.226 --> 00:21:34.726
under the right circumstances.

00:21:35.655 --> 00:21:38.464
And if you document that somebody

00:21:38.464 --> 00:21:41.320
has no capacity for communication,

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.386
other people will believe you,

00:21:43.386 --> 00:21:45.247
and they will act on that belief,

00:21:45.247 --> 00:21:49.093
and it will certainly be
degrading to the person

00:21:49.093 --> 00:21:51.079
you say has no communication,

00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:53.637
and it can very easily
be life-threatening.

00:21:53.637 --> 00:21:55.704
That's again the one thing
that I'm willing to say -

00:21:55.704 --> 00:21:58.681
two things I'm willing
to say unequivocally:

00:21:58.681 --> 00:22:01.738
everyone has a perspective
that needs to be respected,

00:22:01.738 --> 00:22:03.930
and it is absolutely
never appropriate to write

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.955
in any sort of documentation or file

00:22:05.955 --> 00:22:07.237
that a person has no communication or

00:22:07.237 --> 00:22:09.737
no capacity for communication.

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:22.516
And I've done various things
in chaplaincy settings

00:22:22.516 --> 00:22:25.494
and other settings with
people who've been told to me

00:22:25.494 --> 00:22:27.577
to have no communication,

00:22:30.194 --> 00:22:34.361
and one of the people was
a woman who had dementia,

00:22:36.567 --> 00:22:40.734
and was past the point of
using sentences very often.

00:22:42.604 --> 00:22:46.242
But you know, I was told this
woman has no communication,

00:22:46.242 --> 00:22:49.926
and I was also told she
likes to walk around,

00:22:49.926 --> 00:22:51.953
she's always trying to walk around,

00:22:51.953 --> 00:22:54.480
so we have to strap her
down in her wheelchair

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.759
and we give her lorazepam at night

00:22:56.759 --> 00:23:00.442
when there's no aid to
walk with her to supervise,

00:23:00.442 --> 00:23:04.359
and after about 15 minutes
she stops resisting.

00:23:05.696 --> 00:23:09.951
I also saw this person
has no communication,

00:23:09.951 --> 00:23:11.980
and I want to be careful on this,

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:13.800
because one thing I'm not
willing to say unequivocally

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.752
is behavior is communication.

00:23:15.752 --> 00:23:19.887
Because, I mean for a couple of reasons.

00:23:19.887 --> 00:23:24.688
One is that I can tell you,
nothing that I have ever done

00:23:24.688 --> 00:23:27.994
has been intended to
communicate the message

00:23:27.994 --> 00:23:30.064
'please follow me around with a clipboard,

00:23:30.064 --> 00:23:33.165
take detailed notes on
everything I do and put me

00:23:33.165 --> 00:23:35.332
on a behavior plan,' ever.

00:23:36.723 --> 00:23:40.306
And I don't know, if
my life was different,

00:23:41.356 --> 00:23:44.013
and I was less lucky and my disabilities

00:23:44.013 --> 00:23:47.196
put me in the system, I think
it would be very hard for me

00:23:47.196 --> 00:23:51.001
to do anything that was
not seen as communicating

00:23:51.001 --> 00:23:54.061
the message 'please follow
me around with a clipboard,

00:23:54.061 --> 00:23:56.259
find out what I like, dole
it out in small details

00:23:56.259 --> 00:23:57.834
and put me on a behavior plan

00:23:57.834 --> 00:24:00.565
that will get me to do what you want.'

00:24:00.565 --> 00:24:02.815
So behavior is information,

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.805
and movement is not necessarily behavior.

00:24:08.805 --> 00:24:10.216
Which is also important,

00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:14.383
like if you can't communicate
with somebody in a way

00:24:15.379 --> 00:24:18.974
that allows them to confirm
or deny your assumptions,

00:24:18.974 --> 00:24:22.557
then you really can't
know what the meaning

00:24:24.806 --> 00:24:26.556
of their behavior is,

00:24:27.824 --> 00:24:29.978
and even sometimes
whether or not something

00:24:29.978 --> 00:24:32.501
is actually behavior.

00:24:32.501 --> 00:24:36.714
Because, you know, not all
body motion is intentional,

00:24:36.714 --> 00:24:39.547
not all body motion is controlled,

00:24:43.403 --> 00:24:47.144
and I think most people get
this about, say like, epilepsy.

00:24:47.144 --> 00:24:49.582
If somebody is having
a convulsive seizure,

00:24:49.582 --> 00:24:53.882
very few people who are
aware that medicine exists

00:24:53.882 --> 00:24:55.452
would call that behavior.

00:24:55.452 --> 00:24:58.426
But if somebody has partial
seizures that affect things,

00:24:58.426 --> 00:25:02.593
and they're put on a
reinforcement-based behavior plan

00:25:03.808 --> 00:25:06.660
based on the presumption that
all communication is behavior,

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:10.216
it's probably solving the wrong problem.

00:25:10.216 --> 00:25:14.379
And charting somebody's
behavior and finding

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:17.115
an effective way of modifying it,

00:25:17.115 --> 00:25:20.426
is not at all similar to
listening to that person,

00:25:20.426 --> 00:25:22.535
and the two are conflated.

00:25:22.535 --> 00:25:26.285
And it is very very
important to realize that

00:25:27.946 --> 00:25:31.415
'listen to somebody' is not the same as

00:25:31.415 --> 00:25:34.230
'find an effective way of
modifying their behavior

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.258
to meet perceived needs.'

00:25:36.258 --> 00:25:40.272
Because people with disabilities
do not just have needs,

00:25:40.272 --> 00:25:43.625
people with disabilities
also have perspectives,

00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:45.125
opinions, beliefs,

00:25:47.533 --> 00:25:50.450
and those are things that very much

00:25:51.652 --> 00:25:56.081
need to be respected in a way
that is really not captured

00:25:56.081 --> 00:25:59.255
by what is usually meant by
behavior is communication.

00:25:59.255 --> 00:26:02.754
That said, behavior is information.

00:26:02.754 --> 00:26:06.226
Behavior is something
that should be looked at,

00:26:06.226 --> 00:26:09.251
because it is a source of guesses.

00:26:09.251 --> 00:26:12.316
Behavior is information
that is a source of guesses,

00:26:12.316 --> 00:26:14.757
and some things that people
do that are not words

00:26:14.757 --> 00:26:16.703
are communication.

00:26:16.703 --> 00:26:20.120
And part of respecting someone's humanity

00:26:22.283 --> 00:26:26.450
is paying attention to
things that are communicated

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.997
other than in words.

00:26:30.351 --> 00:26:32.748
Which is not the same as
behavior modification,

00:26:32.748 --> 00:26:35.473
and I think that, again,
is there a time and place

00:26:35.473 --> 00:26:37.126
for behavior modification?

00:26:37.126 --> 00:26:40.437
Sometimes. Not as many times
and places as it's used,

00:26:40.437 --> 00:26:44.604
but in no case is modifying
behavior the same as listening.

00:26:48.499 --> 00:26:51.185
So I'm gonna go back to the
issue of cultural competence

00:26:51.185 --> 00:26:52.268
for a minute.

00:26:53.377 --> 00:26:57.544
Part of cultural competence
is knowing something about

00:26:58.838 --> 00:27:03.101
someone's cultural background,
in an ethnic sense,

00:27:03.101 --> 00:27:07.268
in a family sense, in a
crunchy San Francisco sense,

00:27:08.321 --> 00:27:12.488
in a they're from conservative
families, whatever.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:15.971
Part of cultural competence is knowing

00:27:15.971 --> 00:27:19.638
what group they come
from in a family sense.

00:27:21.762 --> 00:27:25.929
Another part of cultural
competence regarding those cultures

00:27:26.982 --> 00:27:31.065
is understanding the range
of meanings disability

00:27:33.601 --> 00:27:36.002
in general and communication
disability specifically

00:27:36.002 --> 00:27:38.585
might have within that culture.

00:27:40.229 --> 00:27:44.202
But another part of cultural
competence is being aware of

00:27:44.202 --> 00:27:48.202
the other context someone
might be operating in.

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:52.513
If somebody has a disability,
they may well be connected

00:27:52.513 --> 00:27:55.513
to disability cultures of some sort.

00:27:58.139 --> 00:27:59.295
And certainly if they're
a person with a disability

00:27:59.295 --> 00:28:00.996
who attends special education,
who is institutionalized,

00:28:00.996 --> 00:28:03.512
who is in any sort of disability program,

00:28:03.512 --> 00:28:06.232
those programs are not just
programs, they're also cultures.

00:28:06.232 --> 00:28:09.540
And understanding what
the cultural expectation,

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.428
symbolism and responses
in those cultures are

00:28:13.428 --> 00:28:17.095
is a pretty key point
in making good guesses

00:28:18.101 --> 00:28:22.268
in ways that you can confirm
or deny or respect humanity.

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:28.279
Another aspect of disability
culture is that some people

00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:32.910
are connected with self-advocacy
movements of some sort.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.888
Like the intellectual and
developmental disabilities

00:28:35.888 --> 00:28:40.055
self-advocacy community has
some very strong cultural norms

00:28:41.435 --> 00:28:44.662
that affect what people's
perspectives are like to be

00:28:44.662 --> 00:28:47.266
and how they're likely
to interpret what you say

00:28:47.266 --> 00:28:48.424
and your behavior.

00:28:48.424 --> 00:28:51.039
So part of cultural
competence is being familiar

00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:54.305
with that kind of thing,
and being familiar with

00:28:54.305 --> 00:28:57.694
what the politically organized
activist communities think

00:28:57.694 --> 00:29:01.001
and what other disability
communities think.

00:29:01.001 --> 00:29:04.803
Because I think sometimes we
don't want to acknowledge that

00:29:04.803 --> 00:29:07.939
these cultural things are
cultures and that they matter,

00:29:07.939 --> 00:29:10.671
because we want to say
people with disabilities

00:29:10.671 --> 00:29:11.912
are all individuals,

00:29:11.912 --> 00:29:14.599
we don't want to make
collective assumptions.

00:29:14.599 --> 00:29:17.766
It's true, people are all individuals,

00:29:19.063 --> 00:29:23.404
but part of how people's
individuality manifests,

00:29:23.404 --> 00:29:26.091
is not only the things
that are unique about them,

00:29:26.091 --> 00:29:27.662
but the cultures they're part of

00:29:27.662 --> 00:29:29.975
and the things they share
with some other people

00:29:29.975 --> 00:29:31.835
that are not universal.

00:29:31.835 --> 00:29:35.099
And just like if you're
working with gay patients,

00:29:35.099 --> 00:29:38.987
which again, some of the
people you're working with are,

00:29:38.987 --> 00:29:43.154
even if you don't know,
understanding the effects that has

00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:47.098
not only from a
what-do-people-do-to-you perspective,

00:29:47.098 --> 00:29:49.375
but what cultures are you likely part of,

00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:52.144
what are the values,
symbols and assumptions

00:29:52.144 --> 00:29:53.838
associated with that culture,

00:29:53.838 --> 00:29:56.490
is part of cultural competence as much as

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:58.971
finding out what are the
typical ranges of what

00:29:58.971 --> 00:30:01.827
people without disabilities in the ethnic,

00:30:01.827 --> 00:30:03.606
or religious background,
or racial background

00:30:03.606 --> 00:30:05.671
they come from normally have.

00:30:05.671 --> 00:30:09.338
So again, every person's
perspective matters

00:30:10.882 --> 00:30:12.288
and is important.

00:30:12.288 --> 00:30:14.396
Whether or not someone can communicate

00:30:14.396 --> 00:30:18.563
in a way you understand,
they're a fully human person.

00:30:19.405 --> 00:30:21.602
Whether or not we know
what someone's thinking,

00:30:21.602 --> 00:30:23.469
their opinion is important.

00:30:23.469 --> 00:30:26.615
Regardless of impairment,
their life is their own.

00:30:26.615 --> 00:30:29.716
Even when people don't
understand language,

00:30:29.716 --> 00:30:33.774
they probably understand
respectful behavior,

00:30:33.774 --> 00:30:36.230
contemptuous behavior,
threatening behavior,

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.280
consent-seeking behavior.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:42.447
So behaving in a way that
takes this into account,

00:30:45.681 --> 00:30:48.694
acknowledge that you're making guesses,

00:30:48.694 --> 00:30:51.007
that you are going to be
wrong a lot of the time,

00:30:51.007 --> 00:30:54.186
because we do not have the
received knowledge of appropriate

00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:57.328
communication of people
with disabilities that we do

00:30:57.328 --> 00:31:01.099
in a lot of other areas of practice.

00:31:01.099 --> 00:31:03.992
And realizing that the fact that

00:31:03.992 --> 00:31:05.565
we don't know how to do it

00:31:05.565 --> 00:31:07.473
doesn't mean that it's impossible.

00:31:07.473 --> 00:31:11.767
We have a saying in Judaism,
his is me be rabbinic, right,

00:31:11.767 --> 00:31:13.397
we have a saying in Judaism:

00:31:13.397 --> 00:31:15.670
it is not upon you to complete the work,

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.439
but neither are you
free to desist from it.

00:31:18.439 --> 00:31:21.290
Don't expect to solve the whole problem,

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.849
because that's too big for any one person,

00:31:23.849 --> 00:31:26.867
but do look at what's in front of you,

00:31:26.867 --> 00:31:29.264
what assumptions you can be making,

00:31:29.264 --> 00:31:32.408
and what you can figure
out and which problems

00:31:32.408 --> 00:31:34.433
you might be able to solve.

00:31:34.433 --> 00:31:36.586
So, it's not upon us to complete the work,

00:31:36.586 --> 00:31:39.113
let's all go do it, thanks everyone.

00:31:39.113 --> 00:31:41.363
