00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This can be determined easily.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All we need is a counter in the testing function.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I have extended the test function a bit,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
such that there would be a test counter up here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
With every invocation the test counter will be increased by 1

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and so that we see what's going on behind the scenes

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm printing out the current value of test_count--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that is, the number of the test that is being executed--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and printing out the string that we're testing,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and I'm printing out its current length.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm also printing out the result--fail or pass.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now let's see what we get when we're executing this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You see this is the initial test.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is coming from the assertion.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
First test, select of foo, 20 characters long--failing.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
What you can see here is that delta debugging quickly progresses

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in its binary search phase from 20 to 10 to 5.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Well, 5 doesn't work so it sticks with 8.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In the 10th test already it already has determined the minimum.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
However, it still tries to remove single characters in here

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to make sure that the final result is really relevant.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Overall, it takes 22 tests,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
but since the first test is due to the assertion,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
we overall have 21.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The correct answer therefore is 21.
