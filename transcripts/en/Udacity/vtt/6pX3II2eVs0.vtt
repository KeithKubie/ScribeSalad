00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.710
Let's talk about thresholding, and

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.040
this is an example, I think this might
be taken also from Linda Shapiro.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.740
So the idea is that you're
imaging these cherries, okay, and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.870
the idea is that the background
here is very dark.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:13.530
Okay?

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.040
And a healthy cherry is kind of bright,
all right?

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.350
But a bruised part is medium dark.

00:00:20.388 --> 00:00:23.520
And what you'd like to
do is be able to say,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.070
do I have a bunch of bruised pixels.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.870
So in this particular one, they've
removed all the black things, but

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.450
you see these are the grey scale values,
right?

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.960
And you and I look at this, and we say
yep, you know what, here's my threshold,

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.030
and this is the number of
pixels that are bruised, and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.800
this is the number of,
of pixels that are good.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.590
And the idea finding a threshold like
that automatically is not trivial.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.100
Generally what you do when you look for

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.460
thresholds is you take a histogram
of the intensities, right?

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.990
So, this might be, you know,
go from zero to 255,

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.540
and this is the number of pixels
that you have in the image.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.400
And the question is, you know,
what are your distributions?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.560
Unlike this one, which had this nice,

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.920
clean dis, separation there, this one,
it's a lot more complicated.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.980
Are there two, or are there three?

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.789
I think, you know, from my,
from my take, I'd say, oh,

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.780
there's three lobes there, all right?

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.576
And there's different ways
of trying to do that.

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:25.352
A simple method, this is again,
a long time Otsu's method, it's,

00:01:25.352 --> 00:01:27.225
it's a binary visionary method.

00:01:27.225 --> 00:01:32.208
It basically says find,
assume that your system is bimodal, and

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:36.750
find the cut off that minimizes
the within group variance.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.214
Okay?
So you're only allowed to draw one line,

00:01:39.214 --> 00:01:43.230
and so, and it's weighted by
essentially this, these, these values.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.880
And when you do that,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.740
what's kind of cool about it is you can
do that when it's certainly bi-modal.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.670
When it's actually tri-modal, let's say,
you'll typically pick one of the modes,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.030
all right, and then, you can, look,
do it again, and, you'll cut it again,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.930
and what's kind of nice is when you
slice a mode that shouldn't be sliced,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.770
you'll get a reduction in the variance,
but not very much.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.639
And you can track how much that is.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.860
And it, and the method can be adapted
to do a pretty good job of thresholding

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.410
a continuous grayscale into either
a binary or a three valued system.
