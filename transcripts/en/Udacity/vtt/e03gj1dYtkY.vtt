00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.450
Today, we'll talk about a very general method called generate and

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.810
test. We have looked at knowledge representations like semantic networks.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.420
We'll shift our attention now to problem solving methods. Generate and

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.890
test is a problem solving method. This is another item in our

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.500
fundamental topics part of the course. The generate and test method in a way,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.620
is very simple. Given a problem, generate potential solutions to it, and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.460
then test the solutions for the efficiency for

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.060
addressing the problem. If you had complete knowledge of the world, complete and

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.480
correct knowledge of the world. If you had infinite computational resources. And

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.960
if you had a method of reasoning that was guaranteed to be correct,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.600
then you can generate the correct, the optimal solution.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.010
You don't need to test it. In general however, you do not have complete or

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.350
correct knowledge of the world. You do not have infinite computational

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.680
resources, and not all methods are guaranteed to be correct. In that case,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.120
you can generate potential solutions. Plausible solutions,

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.618
and then test them. Estimates that will generate, and

00:01:07.618 --> 00:01:12.040
test. We will use this method in conjunction with semantic networks, or

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.570
the prisoners and guards problem that we discussed last time.
