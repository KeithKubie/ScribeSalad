1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
Did you see that python that they
found in the middle of the everglades?

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:08,040
It was 17 feet long. I was
so I googled it. I saw,

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:11,370
this is one of the things I told her. I
said, I was talking about exotic pets.

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,460
I googled it.
They get to 30 feet long.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:20,490
It's ridiculous. Then so then I went down
a whole, I did. I saw that python hall,

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:21,790
the rec record,

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,670
17 foot long python carrying 73 eggs
captured in Florida's everglades.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,590
The reason we should
just get rid of Florida,

9
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:30,510
snap it off and push it into the ocean.

10
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:33,900
There's too much craziness
happening there. Fucking snake.

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,580
Now here's the thing that freaked me out.

12
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:37,710
I found out those snakes
get twice that length,

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:43,490
so this has only been going on apparently
for like the last 15 or so years.

14
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,630
They apparently didn't have a real
population of pythons in the everglades.

15
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,180
15 years ago. Somebody's pet get loose.
That thing at 73 eggs. I know. No,

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,870
it didn't get loose. Some asshole
just released his snake, right?

17
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,730
Someone just chucked it out the window
and then it fucks up the balance of the

18
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:00,720
ecosystem.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,700
They escape from a breeding facility
destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1990 to

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,130
100% oh horror movie starts starts.
Great horror movie.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,510
Somebody write that script.

22
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:16,620
Tens of thousands of Burmese pythons are
estimated now we live in the area and

23
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:20,940
that's just now they've completely wiped
out all the raccoons, all the skunks,

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,500
all the rabbits. It's almost no man. I'm
out. Yeah, they're eating alligators now.

25
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,990
Nice.
Those things eat alligators.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,960
That's a video to see shit shoulder.

27
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:36,030
There's a photograph of one that died
because the alligator chewed its way out

28
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:39,960
of its body.
Nature is so brutal,

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,480
so God damn ruthless, but there's some
beauty in that ruthlessness. Just that,

30
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,510
just that like undying desire for survival
that exists in creatures like that,

31
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:53,760
that can't, there's no
empathy. There's no sympathy.

32
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:56,510
They're just going to eat their way
out of you to survive. You have,

33
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:59,220
there's something cool about as long
as it's not your five year old kid that

34
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:04,200
gets snatched. Absolutely. That's a
goddamn nightmare. This show this,

35
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:05,610
but this just for you guys,

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,620
is this one doing this isn't eating and
you look at that as a different one.

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,800
I think this is an Anaconda and a
Cayman says python eats alligator alive.

38
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,920
It's the whole thing.
I mean it's the whole thing alive.

39
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,120
Is that a python for sure. Yeah, it
seems like it is. It seems like it is.

40
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:27,380
That's actually a video of me eating a
grilled cheese and 2:00 AM looking at o

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,710
two it is sped up, but look how it gets
all the way down to the fucking tail.

42
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,700
That is amazing.

43
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,570
I wonder if snakes have taste buds or if
it's just for pure hunger to just stop

44
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:38,400
and think about what
we're looking at here.

45
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:43,050
This snake just ate a whole alligator.
There goes a tail.

46
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,720
Oh my tenants body and it's just going
to break it down. Look at the eval.

47
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,410
Chill.

48
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,010
Because they're vulnerable when they eat
that he's got to go and just hide it.

49
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,930
Hide under a canopy. Well that's why
there's like snakes everywhere on earth.

50
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,840
Well now there are in Florida.
Yeah.

51
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:01,790
But I mean they're not
everywhere because if they,

52
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,230
they really could just eat and then go
out and eat again like real quick like,

53
00:03:06,231 --> 00:03:08,180
oh look how aligned could,
right it would be it.

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,430
They would eat all the
ecosystem would be destroyed.

55
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,020
They need to buy everything
where the alligator chewed
its way out. Look at that.

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,890
Also kind of bad ass of that alligator.
It looks like the tail popped out.

57
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,350
Even see what's going on.
Maybe the tail, you know,

58
00:03:21,351 --> 00:03:25,130
cause those tails are very strong and
they're so thick. It's like an armor.

59
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,850
Go to that website. Ah, that's wild man.

60
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,410
Jesus Christ is really wild.

61
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,110
But that's just shows you how
hungry these fucking things are.

62
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,540
They've eaten everything that's out
there but also their masters, their,

63
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,610
their ability to capture
something and then kill it.

64
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:46,180
That's that vicious Brian.
An alligator.

65
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,720
Like those are kind of hard to sneak
up on and capture and hold on to.

66
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,450
I don't think they are. I
think you don't think so? No.

67
00:03:53,451 --> 00:03:56,000
I think that's one of the reasons
why it could get it so quick.

68
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:57,890
I think they just lay
around most of the time.

69
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,210
I think alligators don't tweak because
they don't have any natural enemies until

70
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:05,480
the pythons came along. I think
because they're so bad ass. Yeah.

71
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:07,370
I don't think they're equipped for this.
Yeah.

72
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:10,150
They're probably not equipped for your
Pi. Right. Where they're just there. The,

73
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,730
the snake found a vulnerability
in the system. He was like, Oh,

74
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:13,920
I'm going to snack on alligators.

75
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:17,930
Wonder how long it takes a snake with
this nasty gut juices to break down

76
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:22,310
alligator hide. Three, three, three days.
Three to four days. That's my guess.

77
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:27,050
I'm gonna say at least a week to break
down all of that. Maybe even longer. Yeah.

78
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,790
It's got to have some gnarly like acids,

79
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,970
acids in its stomach to break that down.
Yeah.

80
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,440
Some Shit like from the movie alien.
Yes.

81
00:04:36,441 --> 00:04:39,320
Like battery acid just
burns right through it.

82
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,380
Why aren't we like using snake acid
to break down rust on cars and stuff?

83
00:04:45,381 --> 00:04:47,750
We should be looking into that.
Yeah. I would clean up everything.

84
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:48,950
Probably would clean up everything.

85
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,910
And the animated recreation of the
Python alligator battle suggest that the

86
00:04:52,911 --> 00:04:55,700
python might have survived.
It's a massive meal.

87
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,470
But that a second gator came to the
rescue and bid off the snake's head. Oh,

88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,630
was that the alligators bitch
being like the force of the tussle,

89
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,680
the new theory says is what
caused the python. Wow. Whoa.

90
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,770
So alligator came and fucked him
up after he ate an alligator.

91
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,600
Homie came and rescued him.
They have any homeys really no assholes.

92
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,380
I think they're assholes with tiny little
brains and they just shoot things in,

93
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:23,380
suck them down.
They just fuck reptilian style.

94
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,410
Did you ever see that video
of the crocodiles and they
go to feed them and uh,

95
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:30,250
it was on my Instagram,
Jamie,

96
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:34,660
the one with the crocodile through slave
nation goes to throw some chicken out

97
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:37,870
for the crocodiles and the crocodile
snap up the chicken and one crocodile

98
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:40,570
reaches over to the guy next
to him and bites his leg,

99
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,540
bites the crocodiles leg
and it just rolls. Oh God.

100
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,800
Snaps it off and checks it down.
Swallows it. And the other alligator,

101
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:49,480
the other crocodile rather
that doesn't even budge.

102
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,530
You just got his arm bit off is
like, what happened? Oh my fuck.

103
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,440
This is when you realize what these
things are. They don't give a fuck there.

104
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,000
It's so crazy to watch.

105
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:03,200
They're dinosaurs doesn't even freak
out that its arm got bitten off and

106
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:04,490
swallowed by his name.

107
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:07,360
I will say if I'm eating a
really delicious sandwich
and someone bites me and

108
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:10,010
gonna be like, I'm just going to finish
the sandwich. I have to be honest.

109
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:13,530
How hungry are you if you're very
hungry? Well, he's not even finishing.

110
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,540
He's lying there and the other allergy
or these little crocodile bites his leg

111
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,750
and then rips it off. Watch this. That
sounds this shit. Just watch it. Boom.

112
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,100
Now Watch.
They've run in.

113
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,610
See this one's snacking up and look grabs
it and the watch gator roll def snaps

114
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:35,870
it off, chucks it down.
Go. But look at him.

115
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,120
He doesn't even do anything.
What the fuck bro?

116
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,570
He just lost his leg and he's like,
what the fuck bro?

117
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,440
I mean those are not regenerative, right?
Yes they are. Can you grow another Paul?

118
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,710
Yep. Whoa. Yeah, they, they, they
grow other pots all the time.

119
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:53,100
Yeah.
That is so wild.

120
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,010
GATOR DNA on my face.

121
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,490
I bet you that's really good for just
like keeping your shit fresh or you look

122
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:03,000
like scales. You want that. That'd
be kind of cool. Forever scales.

123
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,070
That'd be a superhero I
could probably capitalize on.

124
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:07,200
It does not need to worry about
what you look like. Right.

125
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:09,330
Just scales to your face.
Boom.

126
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:11,940
Two there and right now I'm not going
to wear any rouge. I got scales.

127
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:14,850
I'm gonna go out. Some girl had to be
the first girl to get a face tattoo.

128
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,060
You could be the first girl to get skills.
Probably some.

129
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,300
Probably a really long time ago.
Somebody just got a face tattoo. Well,

130
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,390
most tribal. Yeah, most
likely tribe tribal.

131
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,690
Maybe like one of those polyandrous
tribes. What does this Jamie,

132
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:30,590
that's what it looks like. A snake.
The I'll get her inside of it. Yeah.

133
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,040
It does take three days for it
to break down the they scientist.

134
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,320
Dr Your at her watch out.
I'm a doctor and a scientist.

135
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,350
I know all about gut assets. I know
about gut acids because I'm Italian.

136
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:47,810
I've got Agita. I've been
hurt. God, you didn't forever.

137
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:53,400
It is a real thing. That's science.
That's the Caelian science guy. He's good.

138
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:58,290
The fucking,
you know what's crazy?

139
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,630
The everglades is,
if this is how it is now,

140
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:03,670
imagine what it's going to be like 20
years from now when these things just keep

141
00:08:03,671 --> 00:08:04,680
breathing. Yeah, it's gonna take,

142
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,110
it's gonna take a few generations
for that to balance back out.

143
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:10,200
They need to put some wolves in that area
and get it all back to where it should

144
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,450
be. Well, they have
crocodiles in there now too.

145
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,380
There's been confirmed sightings of Nile
crocodiles, not American crocodiles,

146
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:21,360
Nile crocodiles for the same. That's wild
where the alligators are. That's fucked.

147
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,090
It's fucked because those are the
ones that eat zebras and shit.

148
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,390
Everything they're going to be
eating, watch, hide. Your kids hide.

149
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,670
Your wife know they don't.
Definitely.
