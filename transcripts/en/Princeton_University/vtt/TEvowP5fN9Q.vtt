[MUSIC]


00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.290
GARY FOX: I think it
might have actually

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.600
been in the lab here.


00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.870
ANNA WUTTIG: It was
definitely in lab.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.170
GARY FOX: We were
both working.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.120
ANNA WUTTIG: Yeah.


00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.080
GARY FOX: And I started...


00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.590
ANNA WUTTIG: No, no, you
mentioned, somebody mentioned

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.710
you in the lead of the play.


00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.210
And I was like, what play?


00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.780
TIM VASEN: Gary, our lead,
is a chemistry major.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.910
I think there's a whole
huge range.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.040
As is normal for us since we
don't have majors in the arts

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.980
here at Princeton.


00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.750
We work with people that are
really interested in arts and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.150
also usually really interested
in something else which makes

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.510
for a very interesting mix.


00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.540
GARY FOX: And then you realized


00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.100
that you were playing...


00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.060
ANNA WUTTIG: Yeah, that
I was playing.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.400
GARY FOX: ...for the same show.


00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.910
ANNA WUTTIG: Yeah.


00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.630
MICHAEL PRATT: Our first
violinist in the orchestra is

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.180
Anna Wuttig.


00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.230
She's a senior.


00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.620
She's a chemistry major.


00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.130
Der Bourgeios Bigwig is an
English language version of

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.170
this Moliere play, Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme with the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.930
incidental music that was
written by the great German

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.770
composer Richard Strauss.


00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.060
The arts at Princeton are very
much about collaborations.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.520
And here was a collaboration.


00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.000
GARY FOX: In Der Bourgeois
Bigwig, I play Mr. Jordan

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.800
who's a middle aged man who
with all of this money, he

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.650
decides that he wants to
buy himself culture.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.230
ANNA WUTTIG: So the music
department at Princeton is

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.570
really great, because it offers
opportunities for

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.250
students who are not
even a music major.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.540
I started playing the violin
when I was four years old.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.280
And then, I continued
playing until now.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.070
But I wanted to choose a more
science oriented career path.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.450
Well, science and music, I feel,
are really interwoven,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.950
because they're both creative.


00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.550
In science, it's important to
study known systems and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.430
reactions and understand them.


00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.550
But also, it's important to be
innovative and so that we can

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.270
make new technologies
for society.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.020
GARY FOX: If we're not creative
in the lab, we're not

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.750
going to be able to solve any
of the problems that we're

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.010
currently facing here in the
US and around the globe.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.920
And on stage or with music, if
we're not creative, we're not

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.120
inspiring people to think
about the world

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.270
in a broader context.


00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.440
And so even though people might
think that chemistry or

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.490
science and the arts or theater
and music are totally

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.240
separate things, they are
really interconnected.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.900
ANNA WUTTIG: And in music, it's
important to study the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.910
score and to know a little bit
about the composer's life and

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.010
to practice and work hard.


00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.680
But when you're actually
performing, I experience I

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.110
forget all of that.


00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.160
And I'm living in the moment.


00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.480
And every note that I play is
something new and organic.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.050
And that experience is
motivation for science and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.210
vice versa.


00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.700
GARY FOX: I like to think of
research and performance as

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.580
two entities that are built
out of a toolbox.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.940
And those tools are different
for the discipline.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.500
In science, we have balances,
we have furnaces, we have

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.830
mortars and pestles.


00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.640
We have all of these things that
we need to use and put

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.690
them together in a way to
create something new.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.770
Similarly on stage, we have
techniques, we have to

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.740
rehearse lines, we have certain
gestures, we can rely

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.660
on props that we can use.


00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.030
And all of those work together
to create something that's

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.160
much greater than the
sum of its parts.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.960
ANNA WUTTIG: Exactly.


00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:27.860
[ORCHESTRA MUSIC]


00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:43.590
[APPLAUSE]


00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.590 position:78%
MICHAEL PRATT: Working with all of these students,


00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.590 position:67%
I'm just in awe of them: The fact that they


00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.590 position:59%
play at such an exceedingly high level


00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.590
AND do all this other stuff.
