this is a product of the Napoleonic
 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.540
this is a product of the Napoleonic
period but it becomes possible because

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550
period but it becomes possible because
 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.530
period but it becomes possible because
of the disappearance of the of the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540
of the disappearance of the of the
 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.470
of the disappearance of the of the
monarchy and therefore the disappearance

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480
monarchy and therefore the disappearance
 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.250
monarchy and therefore the disappearance
of the idea that you had a monarch a

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260

that you would have decisions that were
 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.300
that you would have decisions that were
based on a very lengthy and scholarly

here so then the the collected opinions
 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.690
here so then the the collected opinions
of important jurists would be published

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700
of important jurists would be published
 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.750
of important jurists would be published
and would become the references that

and would become the references that

happens is that virtually every last
 

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:23.660
happens is that virtually every last
name becomes a first name so if you had
