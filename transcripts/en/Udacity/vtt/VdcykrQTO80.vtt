00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.210
Of course, a natural question is, well,
how accurate are these forecasts?

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.810
Can you act on them?

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.970
Do they really predict the future?

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.990
Well at least a first step towards
answering that question can be found

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.500
by back testing.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.450
So that means you roll back time,
and you test your system.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.690
So here's our historical data as usual
it's organized with time coming down.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.710
Now in order to test
the capability of our approach,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.350
we have to limit the data it sees
to a certain amount of time and

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.810
then make predictions into
the simulated future.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.290
So we allow our system to only look
at data up to a certain point.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.470
It can use data before
that all it likes.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.530
It builds a model, and
then makes a forecast.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.730
On the basis of that forecast,
we can then now place orders,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.130
anticipating that that
forecast will be achieved.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.870
So we might long some stocks or
short them as appropriate.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.410
We can take those orders now,
put them into our trading simulator and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.373
see how the portfolio works.

00:01:02.373 --> 00:01:07.097
So this time right here is
the same as this time here, so

00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:12.952
we enter our positions on that date
which was the same as that date and

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:18.514
then we roll it forward and
see what happens with the portfolio.

00:01:18.514 --> 00:01:22.553
Using software that we've built in this
class, you can measure things like

00:01:22.553 --> 00:01:25.470
Sharpe ratio, return, and
so on for that portfolio.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.703
Now we're training over new data,
make a new forecast and

00:01:28.703 --> 00:01:32.920
then make a new set of orders.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.200
We enter these orders in our trading
simulator and then go forward and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600
see what happens.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.970
I'm optimistic and it's always
going to go up and to the right.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.730
Anyways, this process
can be repeated over and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.860
over again using historical data and

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.210
we can simulate our learning algorithm
and how it would trade in this way.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.480
And that's called backtesting.
