[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:07.000
SPEAKER 1: My name is
[? Akshay. ?] Welcome

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.610
to another session
of Talks at Google.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.470
Our guest today, in
case you didn't know,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.230
is the legendary Indian pace
bowler and the current ICC

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.660
match referee Javagal Srinath.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.470
He started his career
Indian cricket in the 90s

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.610
and retired about 13
years later in the 2000s.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.820
So you've obviously,
hopefully, rather, watched him

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.340
and his skill on TV.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.050
And he's here to share some
of those stories with us.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.050
He is, incidentally, the only
Indian fast bowler and the only

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.640
other-- so there's two of them--

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.660
in India who have taken more
than 300 one-day wickets.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.300
And he's also the joint
highest wicket taker

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.900
for India in World Cups at 44.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.840
He retired from cricket,
like I said, in 2003.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.960
And he has continued his life
in that world as an ICC match

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.460
referee.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.333
So please, help me in
welcoming Mr. Javagal Srinath.

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:10.689
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.230
It's an honor, sir,
to have you here.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.140
As you can see, there are many
of your fans in the room today,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.810
and many others will watch
this on YouTube at some point.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.780
So from all of us, thank
you for joining us today.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.110
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Pleasure.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.480
SPEAKER 1: You have been
in the Bay Area before.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.467
You have some family here.

00:01:28.467 --> 00:01:30.050
What's your best
part about this area?

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.970
Which area do you like the most?

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.470
Some interesting
memories from here?

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.011
JAVAGAL SRINATH: See, most of
it is like typical middle-class

00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:38.300
family coming from
India, and especially

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.120
coming from
Bangalore and Mysore.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.680
We all want to become engineers.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.284
We all want to come to US.

00:01:44.284 --> 00:01:44.950
I think that's--

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.465
[LAUGHING]

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:51.230
I'm speaking on behalf of
you all here, actually.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.650
And that's a dream for many.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.270
But then, you know,
you've got to be 80%, 90%.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.920
Medical, you know, a
percentage [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.170
So I could not come--

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.650
on this percentage
basis, I could not--

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.313
[INAUDIBLE] percentage basis,
I could not come to India.

00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:10.229
Then the other option I
thought was, you know,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.830
play cricket and know
the right kind of people

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.245
here so you get to Google.

00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:18.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.990
I've been here a few times, yes.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.870
I also tried to get
into Stanford in 2003

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.480
after I finished my
cricketing career.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.430
So, in fact, I
made some inroads,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.370
and then I think there were
sensible professors who

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.240
were talking to me.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.837
And then they said,
look, you know,

00:02:33.837 --> 00:02:36.170
do you want to give all your
cricketing credentials back

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.440
and then get into the
software industry at this age?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.090
It'll be-- you know, look,
it will be a regression.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.710
It will be going back
in time if you do that.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.500
So it's better, you know, you
start something on your own.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.410
So I was here for
almost a week, more

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.730
than a week I think,
trying to understand

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.940
whether I fit into this.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.860
I don't know whether I
did the right decision,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.590
but, you know, I had to.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.850
Then I was convinced.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.820
I was convinced-- they
convinced me, rather--

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.310
that, you know,
that might not be.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.320
Or maybe they found out
that I was not too good

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.340
and I would never pass
the MBA in Stanford.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.630
Even that could be possible.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.110
However, yeah, so I
just have a degree

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.940
that's an engineering degree.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.700
SPEAKER 1: So you are
now an ICC match referee.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.970
What else are you doing?

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.937
Are you in involved in
the technical space?

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:25.895
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Not
really, but my involvement

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:29.060
with the technical space
is because of my friends

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.860
whom I tag along with.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.260
We have a group of few friends.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.730
You know, we are very much
in touch with each other.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.896
One of them is sitting here.

00:03:36.896 --> 00:03:40.860
He has moved to Google now
from India, [? Mohandas. ?]

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.030
So even though you don't know
much about technical stuff,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.290
if you have technical
people around you,

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.100
it's as good as
the same, I think.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.126
I mean, you are as good
as a good engineer.

00:03:50.126 --> 00:03:53.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.700
SPEAKER 1: So now
you mentioned you

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.620
use a lot of Google products.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.610
Do you have a favorite one
that you use more than others?

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.110
JAVAGAL SRINATH: I think the
best application is your Google

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.609
search.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.925
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:04:04.925 --> 00:04:06.800
JAVAGAL SRINATH: For
anything and everything,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.850
I think we go for Google.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.920
I think it has become such an
integral part of our lives.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.400
But, you know, that
reach is fantastic.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.190
I mean, you don't have to
worry too much no matter what.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.779
I mean, I have a
15-year-old son,

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.720
I've got to teach
him a lot these days.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.520
So, you know, the
linear equation,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.010
the quadratic equations,
which I didn't know then.

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.060
Before Google could come up--

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.560
I mean, before
Google could come up,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.436
I used to log into Mohandas
dot com, who is sitting here.

00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:37.435
But now I think now I
would have upgraded myself

00:04:37.435 --> 00:04:40.520
and I would go to Google
and check most of it,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.680
so you get all the
answers and stuff.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.810
SPEAKER 1: So a lot
of these people here

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.670
work on many of the products
that a lot of us use.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.460
If you have any positive
or negative feedback,

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.190
this is a good time
to let them know.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.460
And then hopefully they
can implement the features

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.540
you're looking for.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.480
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Nothing
negative, I suppose.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.980
In any walk of
life, I think it is

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.350
that we pursue our technology.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.450
You know, we follow technology.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.160
And what technology
is today will not

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.170
be the same in the
next 5, 10 years.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.930
So, you know, there is
nothing called completeness

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.052
in technology, I believe.

00:05:14.052 --> 00:05:15.260
You've got to keep following.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.170
You've got to keep
researching as you people do,

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.440
and you will end up
probably doing new products

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.360
and getting on to new
technology in the future.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.640
So, you know, if you really see
what was happening 20 years ago

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.820
and what technology we live
in, completely different.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.380
I mean, people
pursue technology,

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.470
and you people change and
evolve and new things come up.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.950
So there's no negative as such.

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.600
The successful of the
product, or the popularity

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.110
of the product, not
necessarily mean success.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.440
Are they widely used?

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.000
Yes.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.460
Well, is this success?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.595
Could be a success
in one dimension.

00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:55.970
But I think that
will have an end

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.345
and then there's a new product,
there's a new technology,

00:05:58.345 --> 00:05:59.720
and you move on.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.610
So I don't see
anything negative.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:07.964
I think Google is a wonderful
present to the whole world.

00:06:07.964 --> 00:06:09.380
I mean, everything
runs on Google.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.930
Today, if you switch
off to Google,

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.720
the traffic in the world stands.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.825
I mean, it would
come to a standstill.

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:18.200
Many things, I mean, Google
search, if there's no search,

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.930
Google search, again,
people will struggle.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.730
So we are dependent on Google.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.950
So what you people do
matters to us at every level.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.836
So thank you for that.

00:06:28.836 --> 00:06:30.460
SPEAKER 1: So let's
talk about cricket,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.720
switch gears a little bit.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.620
And start from the
very beginning.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.040
How did you get into
cricket is one thing,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.350
but when did you realize
that you had the talent

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.390
to play for the country?

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.670
JAVAGAL SRINATH: When I
didn't get marks in the exam.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.140
[LAUGHING]

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.880
Then I realized I think
cricket will be better bet.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.310
Look, you know, two things--
passion and your profession.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.210
Passion and hobby
comes in the same line,

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.820
and profession is another one.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.020
Now for profession, you
know, you have to study.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.020
You've got to get marks.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.950
You've got to be in
that rat race in India.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:12.412
It's quite tough.

00:07:12.412 --> 00:07:13.620
You've got to be intelligent.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.010
You're IQ should be
more, and all of it.

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.697
Not all of them-- all of us--
are gifted with the same,

00:07:19.697 --> 00:07:21.030
barring you people sitting here.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:27.150
Cricket was a passion for me.

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.390
But some or the other,
I got into engineering.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.320
Now seriously why I
got into engineering,

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.640
because that was the
trend going on those days.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:36.230
You know, there is
a social status.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.540
There is something
about being an engineer.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.230
Not that I wanted to achieve
anything becoming an engineer.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.890
So you are seen in a
different light altogether.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.750
And that's exactly
my understanding,

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.620
let me be honest.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.310
I got into engineering.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.520
Of course, it was not
a straightforward seat.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.510
In My parents had to
pull in some money

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.630
and give some donations
and put me into the seat

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.830
because I never got
a seat automatic.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.180
So I promised them that, you
know, I will finish my degree,

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.890
and I will do well.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:14.630
But cricket came alongside
and I was doing decently well,

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.770
reasonably well.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:21.370
You know, played for
Karnataka under 23s,

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.600
and then I played for
Karnataka juniors.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.590
So my idea was that, if I had
a present Karnataka state,

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.140
I can fail in four subjects.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:31.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.080
So it's some amount of
justification within.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.700
Whenever I didn't
do well in studies,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.359
I said, well, it is
the cricket which

00:08:40.359 --> 00:08:41.900
is really coming in
the way and I had

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.110
to spend more cricket there.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.900
And so whenever I
didn't get wickets,

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.775
I used to say it's
because of my engineering.

00:08:46.775 --> 00:08:48.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:52.220
We managed this lie
somehow nicely in life.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.830
So that's how we
managed, and I managed.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.380
But I always had one
thing in my mind,

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.560
that you've got to have a
degree in India no matter what.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:06.470
I think for the
level of acceptance,

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.730
you've got to have a degree.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.830
Without a degree, you
struggle in India.

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.650
The first thing, if you really
see anybody who you meet

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:18.360
in India is
{?_{?_[SPEAKING HINDI]._?}._?} So

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:21.660
that's the basic question
that you need to answer.

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.822
The moment you say that
you don't have a degree,

00:09:24.822 --> 00:09:27.030
then they do-- straight away
they look down upon you.

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.950
I mean, that's the
Indian way of--

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.450
in a way, that's a
motivation for us

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.090
to at least have a degree.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.290
Anyway back to this.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:36.930
So I managed somehow,
and, you know,

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.250
slowly I realized that my
cricket was coming good.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.680
And then I probably
spent more time.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.040
But I never thought that my
cricket would be my profession.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.960
Even today, I will
never advocate in India

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.970
that sport can be a profession.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:53.320
The economy doesn't
support that.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.530
You've got to have a strong
economy otherwise for you

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:58.400
to fall back on sport
as a profession.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.150
So once you finish your
profession, whether you make it

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:03.276
to India or whatever
it is, you should still

00:10:03.276 --> 00:10:04.150
make a decent living.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.150
That you cannot do in India
when you risk your education

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.710
and then take up sport.

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.440
But anyway I was
employed in Vijaya Bank,

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.170
in a bank called Vijaya
Bank you all know.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:19.580
They came in in my third year.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.970
So been when I was
a bonafide student,

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.110
I was already earning
money, which is not legal.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.020
But nobody knew that I was
employed with the bank.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:33.650
So I was able to manage both.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:35.720
That came in as a
bit of a support

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:41.397
because I lost a year
when I was in third year.

00:10:41.397 --> 00:10:42.980
Semester became very
difficult for me.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.660
The semester scheme
was a little tough,

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.820
because every six months
you used to have exams.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.190
Our college,
[? SJCE ?] in Mysore,

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.650
stood by me like a rock.

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.400
You know, they could change
exams and stuff and all of it.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.390
Then I lost a year.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.910
But some amount of justification
that, you know, worst case,

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:01.040
I will be a bank clerk.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:03.800
From then on, I progressed
and then I became a--

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.300
I played for India.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.550
And then gradually I became
an officer in the bank.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.390
And those days, being an officer
in the bank was the thing.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:15.540
And it was quite a
decent job perhaps.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.920
Still, I wasn't
very clear will this

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.640
be my career for the
next 15, 20 years.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.850
Slowly I think I got
to terms with this game

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.400
and understood what is
required to stay here

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.320
for the next few years.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.160
And as time went
by, I got the gist

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.781
of how to make this
a profession, a hobby

00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:40.280
into a profession, probably the
best thing that could happen

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.310
to anybody, and stuck to it.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:48.860
And I had an injury in '96 and
then I had four subjects to go.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:53.090
And in 1996, I went back
to the college, stood

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.710
in front of my
lecturers, and then I

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.140
pleaded saying that
I need 35 marks

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.660
to pass so that I get a degree.

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:02.025
And then some of them
were really good.

00:12:02.025 --> 00:12:03.650
I mean, they took
some special classes,

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.920
and I am indebted to them
for life, actually, for that.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.660
And they did a
wonderful job, and I

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.370
was able to pass
those four subjects

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:13.077
and I got my degree in 1997.

00:12:13.077 --> 00:12:14.660
SPEAKER 1: Indian
pictures in the '90s

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.930
were not known to help
people like yourself who were

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.790
into the art of pace bowling.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:22.340
You were probably more
successful in India

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:23.900
than overseas.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.580
Did you realize early on?

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.600
And how did you adapt
to those conditions?

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:32.360
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Yeah, you
know, it was quite hard to bowl

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.110
on Indian pitches.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:38.900
But, you know, you
start adding more when

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.330
the situation is very adverse.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.240
You know, you start to
believe in reverse swing.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.660
You try to move the ball more.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.730
It also adds pressure
on your career.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.860
So that's in a way
good at the right time.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.972
So that always keeps
you on your toes.

00:12:54.972 --> 00:12:56.680
What happens when you
are under pressure?

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.920
You are trying to do your best.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.180
You are trying to learn a lot.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.022
You're spending more
time in the nets.

00:13:01.022 --> 00:13:02.480
I think that's what
my [? PS ?] saw

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.630
in me, to hold onto me on the
side for the next three, four

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.540
years.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.880
So I think an attitude which
was good in many sense.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.640
I think I was also a little
insecure to start with

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.730
but realized that that
pressure, when things are not

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.931
at your best, when you
have three spinners playing

00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:22.430
in a team.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:24.860
And then I've been
picked because I'm

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.770
more of a symbolic fastballer
to be part of the side.

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:30.320
Now, being a part
of the team, I mean,

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.620
you've got to contribute
to some extent, you know?

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.370
You've got to try.

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.120
Even if you don't get
a wicket, but you've

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.642
got to bowl those
15, 20 overs to make

00:13:40.642 --> 00:13:42.350
myself believe that
I'm part of this team

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.080
instead of just standing
there doing nothing for hours

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.120
together.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.134
Maybe that was--
subconsciously, I

00:13:49.134 --> 00:13:51.050
was doing such things
without my own knowledge

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.330
and that was recognized,
and that helped

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.810
me to learn a few things.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:57.310
So adverse conditions
also gives you

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:02.360
a chance to look for some kind
of growth within ourselves.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.740
SPEAKER 1: I want
to talk briefly

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:07.520
about the injury you
mentioned in '96.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.910
You had a rotator cuff tear.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:09.826
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Yeah.

00:14:09.826 --> 00:14:11.660
SPEAKER 1: I
remember watching, I

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.390
believe it was a test
series against South Africa.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.565
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Correct.

00:14:15.565 --> 00:14:17.690
SPEAKER 1: And I remember
clearly watching you sort

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.670
of rubbing your shoulder.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.310
You would throw the ball
underarm from the fence.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.742
Clearly you were in pain.

00:14:23.742 --> 00:14:24.950
Why did you continue playing?

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.077
And why not just stop and
attend to your injury?

00:14:27.077 --> 00:14:28.910
JAVAGAL SRINATH: The
assessment of an injury

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.140
is always a challenging one.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.800
You want to bowl as
much as possible.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:42.220
You want to kind of bowl the
last ball and then kind of come

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.820
to terms that you are injured.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.970
I mean, that's probably
the way any sportsman

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:48.730
would want to see.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.460
Even if you can bowl an over,
you don't want to stop it.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.080
You want to finish that over.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.390
But this injury was
so unique that when

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.330
the body is warmed up, when my
shoulder is nicely warmed up,

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.310
you could bowl more and more.

00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:04.270
But once you stop, the
damage would happen then.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.640
Basically, the ball was
coming out of the socket,

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.410
and there was frays.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.170
And there is something
called labrum cartilage here

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.510
at the socket.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:15.460
And that plastic
thing which holds

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:21.080
the ball in the socket, that
had almost, you know, worn out.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.060
So finally I realized that
I couldn't even lift my arm.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.530
And that was the
time I realized,

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:27.890
I need to go and see a doctor.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.848
So I went to South Africa
to one of the doctors

00:15:29.848 --> 00:15:33.400
in Rosebank Clinic.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.360
And they have the best
facilities, in fact.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.970
They said that you
need an operation.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:43.840
So I tried for a conservative
method for three years--

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.070
for three months.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:45.850
Didn't help.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.730
So then the only option I had
was to go under the knife.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.670
So I went under the knife.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.710
Then again, rehabilitation
and all of this

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:55.460
for another six months.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:00.700
Now, the honest opinion I got
from the doctor also helped me.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.720
And they said you will probably
lose 15% of your efficiency.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.340
But if you are very
keen and if you

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.680
go through the
rehabilitation and the field

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:12.220
therapy and the
strengthening process nicely,

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.290
then probably you
might get that 10% too.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.140
So you might probably lose 5%.

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.430
That's meaning nothing.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.540
You lose nothing.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.560
And thank god it
took six months.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.510
It got my degree back
in six months time.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.080
I also got my hand back so--

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.210
It was a-- challenging
times, yeah.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.544
It was really challenging times.

00:16:32.544 --> 00:16:33.501
SPEAKER 1: Now I know--

00:16:33.501 --> 00:16:35.770
I remember reading interviews
of yours back then.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.770
And you mentioned that
you were worried this was

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.940
a career-ending injury for you.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.260
Obviously, you recovered.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:45.350
You spent many more years
playing for the country.

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.914
What did you learn from this?

00:16:46.914 --> 00:16:48.580
How did you keep
yourself going through?

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.710
And now, that you look
back, obviously the injury

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:52.960
is a fairly minor
episode in your life

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.440
because you've come through it.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.632
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Yeah,
I think it was a--

00:16:59.632 --> 00:17:01.630
it's a lifetime
experience I would say.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.920
I mean, it is-- if I probably
speak on your behalf,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.829
it is just that, you
know, your mind tomorrow

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:11.367
doesn't work for Google or
for any software technology

00:17:11.367 --> 00:17:11.950
from tomorrow.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.449
That's it, there
is nothing that you

00:17:13.449 --> 00:17:15.220
can do as far as
technology is concerned.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.720
What do you do?

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.160
How do you manage?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.569
I mean, these things
do cross my mind.

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:23.950
I mean, it's not that
I can't play for India.

00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:29.200
I can never play cricket
if things don't go right.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.450
I can never bowl
again in my life.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.610
Now, can I become a backsman?

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:36.100
Can I-- what do I do?

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.210
Then I have--

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:43.500
I was 26, I had another 34
years of career ahead of me.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.240
Now should I really come back
and then start my engineering

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.480
at that stage where I was
anyway lagging quite behind?

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.504
Well, I mean, I could
have probably done that.

00:17:51.504 --> 00:17:53.170
I would have been
sitting somewhere here

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:55.062
listening to somebody else.

00:17:55.062 --> 00:17:56.520
I don't know whether
[? Mohandas ?]

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.120
will approve this.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.210
Anyway, so that crossed my mind.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:07.936
But it's good to go through
such experiences in life.

00:18:07.936 --> 00:18:11.960
It gives you-- makes
you more philosophical.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.040
You will be fatalistic in
your thinking at times.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.650
Then you realize
that cricket is not

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.390
the only thing in your life.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.390
Then probably my focus
on the other side of life

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.260
also grew a bit.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:31.200
Then I realized that if it
happens at the age of 26,

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.409
I need to manage
the next 34 years.

00:18:33.409 --> 00:18:34.700
It can happen at the age of 35.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.750
Even when I finish my
cricket at the age of 35,

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.950
what do I do for
the next 25 years?

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.540
So all those thoughts
started coming into my mind.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:49.570
But I think a lot
of belief in God--

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:53.710
all of a sudden, you become
spiritual to some extent.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.810
Not the spirits, I
didn't go that way.

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.960
Then I think you kind
of meet the right kind

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.820
of people during that period.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:08.210
And I think when we get to
such situations in life,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:12.040
and if you honestly, genuinely
want to come back into sport,

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.770
or you want to do good, I think
you-- if you have that mindset,

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.061
then you'll probably approach
the right kind of people.

00:19:17.061 --> 00:19:19.900
And I met some wonderful
people during that period,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.980
started talking to them.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.850
I mean you believe that
somebody is better than you.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:27.400
Somebody's advice can help you.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.100
I think we need to have
such mentors in life.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.900
We've got to believe
in such people.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:34.630
It's just not that, you know,
I'm the be all end all of life.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:35.710
You know, there
are a lot of people

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:36.751
who have more experience.

00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:38.500
They do not have
to play cricket.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.300
They do not have to
take 200 wickets.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:43.540
But I think people
with knowledge,

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.840
and the way they see life,
I went in search of them.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.124
I mean, some of them
I could speak to.

00:19:50.124 --> 00:19:51.790
Again, they gave me
some valuable advice

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:55.230
to be steady, stable,
finish your degree first.

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:58.240
Those such advices were
crucial, gave me confidence

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.620
that when I have a degree, I
can manage life from now on.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.880
Such advices came in very
handy at that point in time.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.440
At the same time,
managing an injury,

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.010
it was a wonderful
experience, too.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.190
You know, your commitment to
rehabilitation, your commitment

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.710
to strength training.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.860
Then that measured approach
towards bowling again.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:23.440
You know, you cannot
be bowling more,

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.610
nor you can be bowling less.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:29.460
So that fine balance what you
achieve in trying to come back

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:32.710
brought all those
good values in me.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:36.610
So I realized fine
balancing is all about life.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.970
SPEAKER 1: You know, you hear
many stories about Indian sport

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:44.294
legends who their parents
don't always support them

00:20:44.294 --> 00:20:46.960
because a career in sports, like
you said, is not really a thing

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.720
that was relied upon in India.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.090
But everyone always has
some person in their life

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:55.430
who supports them through their
growing phases into the sport.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.330
Did you have anybody like
that who helped you through,

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.090
you know, playing for your
college, playing for the state?

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.006
JAVAGAL SRINATH: A lot
of people make mistakes

00:21:03.006 --> 00:21:05.290
in looking for such people.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:07.870
I mean, you search people
for the wrong reasons,

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.200
I think you end up
in the wrong place.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.990
Never, ever in my life that I
wanted to go and meet somebody

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:18.370
that who will give me an undue
advantage in my own profession.

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:22.180
I think if you are looking at
people for the right reasons--

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.200
it could be your career,
discussion about your career

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.080
path.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.970
It could be about an honest
opinion about my own cricket,

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.010
a very brutal--

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.550
somebody who could do a brutal
assessment about my own career.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:38.800
Those are the people who we
need to go and look up to.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.900
If you start looking at--

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.400
looking up to such people,
they are your true mentors.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.840
But if I really--

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.660
I never had-- I mean, I have
seen some of my own colleagues

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.970
meeting the wrong kind of
people for wrong support.

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:59.110
And they might appear to be
the demigods at that time.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.310
They might be looking
like godfathers for you

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.650
at that point in time,
but they are not actually.

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:07.900
I think they can lead you to
the wrong side of the life.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.230
I never had anybody, but I
think of Mr. CS Subramanian, one

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.920
of our club secretaries
back in Mysore,

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.400
I think he was a wonderful
person, a great human being who

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.510
instilled a lot of values in us,
who always said that education

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.080
is the one which gives
you solid security for you

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.830
to think and play the
sport without any doubts.

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.620
And he always said, you know,
if you want to be analytical,

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.020
you've got to have
education by your side.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.320
To think better in life is where
education comes to your rescue

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.110
and not for anything else.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.300
It is just not about earning
salaries or managing money.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.780
But I think for you to think
better, you need education.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.150
So whether you are--

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:50.650
whatever you become
in life, I think

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.390
education has to be the base.

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:55.280
So such things not
said in these words

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.750
what I said, but I think that's
exactly how he guided us.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.320
Of course, my parents
were wonderful.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.778
I mean, they were
always supportive

00:23:01.778 --> 00:23:03.880
of me in whatever I
do, whatever I did.

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.060
So that was also,
you know, something

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.270
which I was probably lucky.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.080
SPEAKER 1: So you formed a
great bowling partnership

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.300
with Venkatesh Prasad.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.820
And I've certainly
enjoyed many of those

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.100
matches that you played.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.140
What was your relationship
like with him?

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.410
And what was it like working
with him over all those years

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.788
and all those matches?

00:23:27.788 --> 00:23:29.037
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Bad and good.

00:23:29.037 --> 00:23:31.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.270
He was one of the biggest
critic of mine, actually.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:37.540
He always used to--

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:42.530
I still remember
in one of the games

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:45.850
where we were playing in
Kanpur and then he was dropped.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:48.730
So there were three
spinners and myself.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:51.120
And we kind of--

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.820
I got a wicket, and I was
standing at the fine leg.

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:58.120
And I asked for some water, you
know, so he was the 12th man.

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.860
And then he used to
walk very slowly.

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:04.780
He used to walk very
slowly up to me.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.380
And then he stood next to me.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:10.120
And then I said, did
you see the replay?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.860
He said, yes.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:12.940
Then I said, what?

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.518
He said, missing down the
leg side by four stumps.

00:24:16.518 --> 00:24:18.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:22.565
And he said, you are a lucky
bowler, do you know that?

00:24:22.565 --> 00:24:25.420
That wasn't out.

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.360
And the first one, the
umpiring is so horrible.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:33.280
So that was the
motivation I got from him.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.629
And, you know, there
was a camera next to us.

00:24:35.629 --> 00:24:37.420
And then when the camera
is focusing on us,

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:40.450
there is a red light
which comes on.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.484
So the moment that
camera came on,

00:24:42.484 --> 00:24:43.650
then he was patting my back.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:46.465
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:46.465 --> 00:24:50.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.490
We shared a great
relationship with each other.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.550
And then I used to tease him
that you've got to bowl fast.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:02.119
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:04.550
So we had a very
healthy relationship,

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.830
and we had a good laugh.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.890
And we shared most
of the-- you know,

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.640
our backdrop was
very similar in life.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.660
So we kind of shared the
same food and the same taste,

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.200
most of it.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.740
So, you know, we had a
great time, of course.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.960
He is a good gentleman, and
we thoroughly enjoyed his--

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.230
I thoroughly
enjoyed his company.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.649
SPEAKER 1: Which has been your
favorite ground to play on?

00:25:28.649 --> 00:25:30.440
JAVAGAL SRINATH: See,
when you win a match,

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.106
I think irrespective
of all the states--

00:25:32.106 --> 00:25:33.024
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:33.024 --> 00:25:34.940
You have got wickets in
that particular match,

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:38.030
and you will always-- it is hard
to say that's not my favorite.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:43.010
But I think Centurian Park
in Pretoria, South Africa,

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.870
was one of the best grounds.

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.920
But now all grounds have
really come up nicely.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.610
I mean, MCG is a
fabulous ground.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:53.240
If you see-- the Melbourne
Cricket Ground is beautiful.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:57.790
I mean, if you see,
Lord's has its own charm.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.040
[? Surrey ?] Oval is beautiful.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.240
Our own Calcutta Eden
Gardens is wonderful.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.449
Many, I would say.

00:26:06.449 --> 00:26:08.240
And, of course, our
[? Bangalore ?] is also

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.960
pretty cute, I would say.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.720
SPEAKER 1: So you've played
with some really big names

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.760
in world cricket.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.710
I want to ask you about
three specific people.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.140
So I'll give you a name, and
if you can give us a story,

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:23.150
or a memory, or
something like that.

00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:25.610
First up, Kapil Dev.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:28.320
JAVAGAL SRINATH: I
think he was my mentor.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:35.330
I kind of grew up watching him
and learned a lot from him.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.960
I think we have shared
various stages of relationship

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.010
with him.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.110
As I said, he was my demigod.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.350
I emulated him.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.590
Then we started
playing together.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:50.890
Then we have kind of
challenged each other.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.660
I think that's the beauty
of this life, isn't it?

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.650
I mean, somebody--

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.710
I'm talking about '83 when
I thought he was my god.

00:27:01.710 --> 00:27:03.890
And then you start
playing with him.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:07.790
And then in three years' time,
you kind of challenge him

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.650
as well in many ways.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.000
You know, when you
work in the same space

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.417
and then when you're working
for a common objective,

00:27:14.417 --> 00:27:16.750
the way he wants to achieve
it, the way I want to do it,

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:17.791
are two different things.

00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:19.240
Our strengths were different.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.460
I mean, his talent, his natural
ability, was unbelievable.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:24.350
He was next to none.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.720
In fact, he was too good.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:32.000
At the same time, you
know, sometimes what I feel

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.330
is that when somebody is great,
he should also have the ability

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:36.950
to impart that
knowledge to somebody

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:38.760
and then take him up
to the next level.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.820
I believe leaders are like that.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.090
I mean, leaders are
somebody who create leaders.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.530
So I was expecting
a lot from him.

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.124
So it's not that
he didn't do it.

00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:49.040
Maybe I was not smart
enough to pick up points

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.540
from him as well.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:52.760
So, you know, there
was a bit of--

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.450
it was quite challenging on me
to understand what he speaks

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.920
and what he says.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:02.150
Coaching is never easy.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:05.150
It's not all that easy to
pick up points and then

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.330
implement it on yourself when
motor learning skills are not

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.190
that sharp.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.620
Changes in human body,
especially the bowling

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:16.260
action changes and all, will
take ages, three to four years.

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:18.830
So it is easy to say
something, but it is not

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:23.390
that easy to really
assimilate it into your cells

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.930
and then reproduce it.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.690
So it takes a while for
all of us to do that.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:32.670
But I think with Kapil
Dev, I learned a lot.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:37.040
I still feel that I
should have learned a lot.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:41.300
And I also believe that he
should have taught me a lot.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:42.380
I think all of it.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.750
I think I would say all of it.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.820
Great experience
with him, actually.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:50.240
I have seen Kapil
as an [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.990
I have seen him as a
senior in the team.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.320
And we have competed
for the same wickets

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.724
on either sides of the pitch.

00:29:00.724 --> 00:29:01.890
It's a wonderful experience.

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:04.176
I still have a lot
of regards for him.

00:29:04.176 --> 00:29:06.890
SPEAKER 1: Sachin Tendulkar.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.290
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Genius.

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:14.090
Unbelievable talent.

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:17.510
A little bit of a difficult
personality to understand him.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.370
But once you get to
know the card of Sachin,

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:26.120
I think he's a good human
being, represents typically

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:30.515
the middle class,
middle class system.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.056
And I'm really happy
that I got a chance

00:29:37.056 --> 00:29:38.180
to play alongside with him.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.220
Again, it was not
easy to deal with him

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.395
when we played together.

00:29:46.395 --> 00:29:51.130
Kapil was-- sorry,
Sachin was too demanding.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.670
I mean, that also shows
his passion for the game.

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.070
I mean, he was somebody
who could do anything, beat

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.830
with the ball or with the bat.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.800
He could do anything,
which we could not.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.180
Lesser mortals could
not do what he--

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:05.530
repeat what he did.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.390
So he was quite demanding.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.790
But I think little
later, he changed.

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:14.940
He was a much evolved
captain, much better captain.

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:17.380
You know, I still have a
good relationship with him.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:20.471
We have a good laugh.

00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:21.970
We miss him on the
field, but that's

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.370
what cricket is all
about, life is all about,

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:27.520
that everybody has to move on.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.759
I really enjoyed watching
him, play alongside with him.

00:30:31.759 --> 00:30:33.800
SPEAKER 1: And, last but
not least, a good friend

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.280
of yours, Anil Kumble.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.090
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Good
friend, doesn't say much,

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:42.290
doesn't say much.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:47.360
A man of few words, but
an actual gentleman.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:54.740
You know, somebody very
strong deep inside,

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:59.300
very resolute in his
nature, highly determined.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:02.030
For some-- whatever
the limitations

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:04.310
that anybody could have,
but to achieve maximum,

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.140
I think he's the standing
example for that.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.790
Man of high integrity.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:15.170
And I would say one of the
best friends I have around

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.310
in the cricketing circles.

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.924
So we share a lot.

00:31:17.924 --> 00:31:20.090
We did a good stint with
the Karnataka State Cricket

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.770
Association.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.520
We came for the right reasons,
to defend our association.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:27.720
For three years, we
did it successfully.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.740
I enjoyed working with him.

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:34.040
A lot of similarities
in the way we think.

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.050
That helps us quite a bit.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:39.062
And we understand
each other better.

00:31:39.062 --> 00:31:40.770
SPEAKER 1: How-- by
the way, how did he--

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.061
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Is Rahul
Dravid not part of that list?

00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:46.892
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:31:46.892 --> 00:31:48.600
SPEAKER 1: Let's talk
about Rahul Dravid.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:49.740
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Which
state do come from?

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:50.480
SPEAKER 1: Maharashtra.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.646
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:53.427 --> 00:31:55.760
SPEAKER 1: Well that's why I
said Tendulkar on the list,

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:56.802
see?

00:31:56.802 --> 00:31:57.760
Let's talk about Rahul.

00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.830
JAVAGAL SRINATH: I will
tell Rahul Dravid that you

00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:59.788
missed out on the list.

00:31:59.788 --> 00:32:00.572
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:00.572 --> 00:32:02.280
SPEAKER 1: Let's talk
about Rahul Dravid.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.173
He's--

00:32:03.173 --> 00:32:05.131
JAVAGAL SRINATH: I think
[? he's a Buddhist. ?]

00:32:05.131 --> 00:32:06.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:08.370
We'll move on, we'll
move on, that's OK.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.245
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:32:09.245 --> 00:32:12.700
So how did Anil Kumble
get the name Jumbo?

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:13.530
You always heard--

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.900
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Sidhu
named him Jumbo, actually.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.700
Because, you know,
at one stage he

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:21.970
was like taking off like a jump
you know, from '93 to '96, '97,

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.090
I mean, he was
unplayable in India.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:25.950
He got his hundredth
wicket within no time,

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.240
and he was winning matches.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.990
So Sidhu named him as Jumbo.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.960
SPEAKER 1: So, speaking of
Jumbo, India versus Pakistan

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.080
'99, Pakistan nine wickets down.

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.651
You were bowling further,
and you tried really hard

00:32:39.651 --> 00:32:41.276
to bowl wides, and,
in fact, you bowled

00:32:41.276 --> 00:32:44.000
a couple of real wides, which
is hard in test cricket.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.748
But--

00:32:44.748 --> 00:32:46.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:49.380
--just to help your friend
out, now [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:51.570
was batting there, and he
hits the ball in the air.

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:54.480
You see Sadogoppan Ramesh
running after it really fast.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.360
He made no attempt to
not take the catch.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.450
He actually tried.

00:32:57.450 --> 00:32:59.920
What was going
through your mind?

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.380
JAVAGAL SRINATH: You see,
history is being created.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.664
So how do I be part of that
history by not taking--

00:33:05.664 --> 00:33:11.800
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.450
And that one wicket is not going
to make any difference to me

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:15.950
at all.

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.570
If I had taken
that wicket, nobody

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:18.800
would have spoken about it.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.040
You would not have asked
that question today.

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.080
No, I think it was a
conscious decision.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.180
And then the way
Anil was bowling

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.990
that he was looking as if he was
going to get wicket every ball.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:34.340
So I think it was anybody's
duty to make sure that--

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:37.850
not to take any
wicket for that moment

00:33:37.850 --> 00:33:40.890
and enable him to
get that wicket.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:44.570
So I think he finished off
the match within no time.

00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:48.260
And I think that's the way
you kind of help somebody

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:50.120
to create records and stuff.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.450
That was 10 wickets
in a match is no joke.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:54.957
That was a fabulous performance.

00:33:54.957 --> 00:33:56.540
SPEAKER 1: One of
my fondest memories,

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.270
and I know some other people
share this opinion as well

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:03.930
of your career, is of your
batting with Anil Kumble

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:06.110
against Australia.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:09.409
You had a 52-run partnership.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:12.679
I still remember that
match you came out,

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:16.550
you swung the bat a few
times, you missed a few balls.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.300
And Anil walked down and
said a few things to you,

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.120
and then you seemed to settle
down, and you hit a few sixes.

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:24.460
What was the conversation--

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.960
JAVAGAL SRINATH: I
was in good form.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.610
I was teaching Anil how to bat.

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:33.630
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.790
No, it was just a chat, I think.

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:39.120
I don't remember every
word that we spoke.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.370
It was one of those
matches, you know,

00:34:41.370 --> 00:34:44.370
where everything fell in place,
and we won a wonderful match

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.530
from nowhere.

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:49.080
I don't know why that
match has been recognized

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:53.022
and then people talk
about it quite a lot.

00:34:53.022 --> 00:34:54.719
Maybe we were so
hopeless down the order

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:56.526
that we could not
win any matches.

00:34:56.526 --> 00:34:57.900
And then one of
our matches which

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.570
we won I think that got
stuck in the minds of people.

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.190
And even now people
talk about it.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.270
Yeah, that was one
of the good wins.

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.478
And that, too, it happened
in Bangalore, my hometown,

00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:09.870
so it added more
value, I suppose.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:14.760
SPEAKER 1: You did exceptionally
well in World Cups for India.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.844
Is there something about
that stage that brings out--

00:35:18.844 --> 00:35:22.620
at least in you, that
brought out a different side?

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.360
Or was that just
another match for you?

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.510
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Except the
finals of the World Cup, yeah.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:31.860
Yeah, I think your awareness
levels rise quite a bit.

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:33.460
You want to do well.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.140
And then there is
so much of hype.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:41.244
And that the whole nation
starts pushing you towards it.

00:35:41.244 --> 00:35:42.660
I think every
nation will do that,

00:35:42.660 --> 00:35:44.259
but in India, it
is a little more.

00:35:44.259 --> 00:35:45.800
Because of the
numbers, what we have,

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.280
and the following
of what we have,

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.530
that also puts a
bit of pressure,

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:54.330
which is good, I feel,
and also nice to have

00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:57.310
that kind of support.

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:59.100
Yeah, I mean, four World Cups.

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:01.440
I think we had a couple
of ordinary World Cups,

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.780
but twice I think we
were really there.

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.820
We couldn't make
it to the finals.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.840
We were up against
a wonderful team,

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.420
which was unbeatable then.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.890
I mean, they were really--

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:12.820
Australia was probably
the best team,

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.600
and there was no other
way to beat them.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.750
It's a cycle, you see.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:18.600
I mean Australia now,
if you see Australia,

00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:22.550
I think India is
probably doing so well.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.850
You know, Australia is not
a team what it used to be.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:28.470
So we got caught in that
particular zone where

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:32.050
they were really good, and we
couldn't do much in the finals.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.460
SPEAKER 1: So
let's switch gears,

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:39.260
speak about possibly your
second passion in technology.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.564
You are, as they say here
in Silicon Valley, a techie.

00:36:41.564 --> 00:36:42.230
This is a word--

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:43.470
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Passionate.

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:46.400
I'm not a techie for sure.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.940
SPEAKER 1: You
introduced technology

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.390
into Indian cricket
very early on.

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:52.250
And I remember reading
an interview where

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:58.040
you said that technology helped
Sachin's career, extended it

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:00.800
beyond what it would
have otherwise been.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:04.190
What was the team's and the
coaching staff's reception

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:08.489
to technology when you first
brought it up many years ago?

00:37:08.489 --> 00:37:10.530
JAVAGAL SRINATH: It wasn't
accepted, so accepted,

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:11.310
so easily.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:13.890
I mean, it was a struggle
for me to convince people.

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.110
Maybe my communication,
my articulation

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.170
in trying to convince people
about what technology could do,

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:20.550
was wrong.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:23.010
You see, when you go
to people and then

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:25.780
say that technology
is going to help you,

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:27.930
it's going to teach
you something,

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:31.560
the first reaction was, what
can technology teach me?

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.540
I think that's where
I went wrong in trying

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.490
to convince our own players.

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:39.480
Probably I should have
said that technology

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:43.710
will make you a guru to find
your own student within.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.170
That would have been a
better phrase to say.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.476
I didn't have that
many words then maybe.

00:37:51.476 --> 00:37:53.850
So I was just trying to say
that it is going to help you.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.280
Technology will
tell you what to do.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.830
So they we're not happy
because technology

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.480
was more akin--
anything, any screen

00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.020
was more akin to televisions
than what exactly

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:07.310
a computer does.

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:11.420
And so I failed to convince
them to start with.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.260
And especially when
I was talking to them

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:16.350
before the product
was developed,

00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.990
I failed to convince them--

00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:21.840
I failed to build an
imagination in the minds of each

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.541
of the players.

00:38:22.541 --> 00:38:24.540
So then I realized I think
the product should be

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.730
ready and then take it to them.

00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.880
It becomes more convincing.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:34.830
So at the very concept
stage, it was hard for me

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.090
to sell that to the players.

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.440
So once the technology
was ready and once we

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.500
started showing them,
then they understood what

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.210
exactly technology could do.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.140
So it was basically
the difference.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.992
They were able to see what they
did when they were doing well

00:38:50.992 --> 00:38:52.950
and what they're doing
when they're struggling.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.380
So when those two pictures
came next to each other,

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.320
so cognitively, they were
able to find those minute

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.900
differences and then
start correction,

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.590
start correcting themselves.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:06.150
So it is the access,
the quick access

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.050
of pictures, which made
coaching more easy, which

00:39:10.050 --> 00:39:14.340
made the corrections quicker.

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.010
You could not have
done that otherwise

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:17.700
where you could not even think--

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.090
I'm talking about
'99, 2000-- where

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:22.980
you get one of the pictures
on the television here,

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.730
and the second picture
in the second screen.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:28.720
And then to move that--

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.720
to synchronize
those two pictures

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.810
was never possible
in those days.

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.670
It was quite challenging
stuff for anyone.

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:40.820
So once the system came
in, it became quite easy.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.210
I mean, those days were tough.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:46.530
In 2000, we are
looking at a small RAM.

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:50.974
5/16 RAM used to
be this big, PCB.

00:39:50.974 --> 00:39:52.890
I'm sure-- you're all
youngsters sitting here.

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.410
You have not even
seen those, actually.

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:57.600
It was this big.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:02.940
And then we put in a system,
which was this big, almost

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.260
like one big, the byte was.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.780
An ugly-looking thing, in fact.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.160
And that used to go blue.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.340
Every second,
minute, you know, it

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:17.130
used to heat up so much
it was not possible

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:20.280
for us to handle it.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:26.220
And then when Mr. [? Mohandas ?]
came in and introduced--

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.720
he's sitting here, right here.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:31.480
He was the one who reduced from
almost 70,000 lines of codes.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.890
He brought it down to 9,000
within a month's time, made

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.730
the machine more efficient.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:41.040
In fact, he's the architect of
technology in sport in India.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.680
Nobody even knew what
technology could do.

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.660
And, in fact, we had
advanced to such stage

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.940
that even Star came and
said we will do something

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:49.080
for your technology.

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:52.620
We will take it
to the next level.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:59.340
So it was the need to address
a grave situation what we had,

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.377
where we never had feedbacks.

00:41:01.377 --> 00:41:03.210
You know, coaches could
not even communicate

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:04.920
where we were going wrong.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.150
Coaches found it very
difficult to address

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:13.370
the weaknesses or the
strengths of the opponents.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:17.310
So unless otherwise we had quick
access to the video pictures.

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:21.960
So once that was done, I
think it became more easier

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:25.870
for us to understand where we
went wrong and how to analyze.

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:28.980
And that's when I think
we really understood

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.595
the correction part of cricket.

00:41:31.595 --> 00:41:32.970
SPEAKER 1: So I
think essentially

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:38.581
what you're saying is, when
you gave your team information,

00:41:38.581 --> 00:41:39.580
that really helped them.

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.057
So now, it's an
interesting point,

00:41:42.057 --> 00:41:44.640
because Google and a number of
the companies in Silicon Valley

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.780
have thrived with collecting
such information and such data

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.420
and analyzing them and building
machine learning models and so

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.050
on.

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:55.777
Do you see a role for big data
in machine learning in cricket?

00:41:55.777 --> 00:41:58.110
JAVAGAL SRINATH: I think it
is heading that way, perhaps

00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:59.100
in the near future.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:04.410
I mean, how I see
technology moving forward,

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:06.090
I think now we have
hit a saturation.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:10.110
More or less it is nothing but
a straightforward data which is

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:14.880
every ball becomes a file
stored in the database with many

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.550
attributes and then you have
a query screen and you keep

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:20.250
calling it , whichever you want.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:22.840
But, I mean, that limit, that
has been there for the last 15,

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.550
20 years now.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.770
So we've got to move forward.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:28.350
That could be probably--

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:32.160
you know, as you said, it
could be the machine learning.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.930
It could be-- still the
work would be the same,

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.240
it won't change anything.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.120
But the way it is--

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:46.380
the analysts kind of
capture those pictures

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.010
will be different.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.920
They will probably-- it
could recognize the face,

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.740
and then say that
this is the bowler who

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:59.310
is bowling, that maybe it
can understand the action.

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.890
And then say, he's
the bowler, and what

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.480
are the outcomes of the ball?

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:11.370
But I know, for me, I think,
the next level is what

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:15.200
a player feels on the field.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.990
What are my energy levels?

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:20.780
What is my--

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:26.090
I would say-- the
energy levels within me?

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:28.630
I mean, how do you
understand energy levels?

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:37.040
It could be the lactic acid
deposits in your blood.

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:38.690
How long can I--

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:41.360
so if I have some indication,
if I have some feedback

00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:42.980
within my own
system to say that,

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.100
look, you're getting
a little tired now.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.160
You've got to replenish now.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.440
Will that be the way
forward in cricket?

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:56.990
I think it is all about where
technology meets life sciences.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.650
How do you read your heart rate?

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.790
Can you read your sweat?

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:03.960
Can you read the blood?

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:06.300
I don't know how you do
it, but can you read that?

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.190
What kind of information
you get out of it?

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:11.760
What is my mindset?

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.940
Now there is a beautiful
tool which I saw recently

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:18.116
where all the ECGs,
what you see now,

00:44:18.116 --> 00:44:19.740
now that's more or
less your heart rate

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.540
monitors which you
wear on your chest

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:25.440
and then understand your heart
rate and your optimal heart

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.134
rate and so on and so on.

00:44:28.134 --> 00:44:29.550
And at the same
time though, there

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:34.810
is this encephalograph which
reads the brain signals.

00:44:34.810 --> 00:44:36.450
I saw a tool the
other day in India.

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:40.360
Somebody was trying to
get my opinion on it.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:42.660
Where your left brain
is more logical,

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.840
right is more emotional.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.250
So when you make a decision,
which one is functioning?

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:49.380
So you have an app where
you see, and then you

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:54.030
decide this is the right time
for you to make a decision.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.710
Now these things are coming in.

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:59.190
Now I think at
some point I think

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.910
all these gadgets will
be part of your life

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.000
when you're walking.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.470
And then you will
realize that this is--

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.130
I think what is now?

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:11.400
Where is this
technology leading now?

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.040
You want to know everything
what is happening in your body

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:16.740
on your app, correct?

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.210
Anything, everything.

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:20.480
What's my sugar levels?

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:22.770
What's my starch
levels within the body?

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.270
What is that I want?

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:27.360
What is the one,
which is the one--

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.520
what is the deficiency
that I have?

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.742
Now what is it I need to add?

00:45:30.742 --> 00:45:31.950
I mean, it could be diabetes.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:33.850
It could be anything
for that matter.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.530
So probably it is
heading in that direction

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:38.530
at this point in time.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:43.940
So even in sport, what is my
water retention in the body?

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:46.500
Am I losing too many
minerals and salts

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:50.310
in my body that is
making me tired?

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:52.920
So as of now, we
just go and drink

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.990
water because we are losing it.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:59.160
But what's the right amount of
water that is important for us?

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.770
What is the rate amount of
salt that is important for me?

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.830
I think probably in the
next five to six years

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.205
we'll be heading
in the direction

00:46:06.205 --> 00:46:10.710
where we'll be getting
what we want exactly.

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:14.400
So back to your machine
learning and stuff.

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:17.460
It can help, but more
than anything else,

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:21.390
I want Google to find out where
the cricket match is happening

00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:22.410
through the world.

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:23.970
Where are the open
grounds for us

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.820
to make proper cricket grounds?

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:31.650
Honestly, in 2011
to 2013, I used

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:35.220
to see Google Maps to see where
there are grounds in Bangalore,

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.720
where there are empty spaces
where I can go and approach

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:42.120
them to lease those grounds for
us to prepare a proper cricket

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.680
pitch.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:47.070
In fact, the JC ground when
we made the ground, where

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.444
we built a ground, you
know, the first thing was

00:46:49.444 --> 00:46:50.610
this is the place where we--

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:52.679
I went to the Google Map.

00:46:52.679 --> 00:46:54.220
There's a space
here, so why don't we

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:58.180
approach JC to give the space
for us to put in a ground?

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:01.980
So Google has also
played a role everywhere.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.880
But I think at
some stage, Google

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.760
will have the rights
to get actively

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:15.075
participating on real-time
basis on the Google search.

00:47:15.075 --> 00:47:16.950
I don't know whether
that is possible or not,

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:20.660
but it might happen
in the future.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.060
SPEAKER 1: Let's hope--

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.760
what is your opinion of
the decisionary system

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.860
that we have in cricket today?

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.490
JAVAGAL SRINATH: Technology
will be a part of, I think,

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:35.620
cricket from now on because
television has become so good.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.730
Even the slightest movement
with those slow motions

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:41.500
and the quality of
the cameras have

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.980
improved so much that it is
beyond human capabilities.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:46.660
So umpires will
not be able to see

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:53.980
from a distance those
little nicks or deviations,

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.820
so on and so forth.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:59.140
But the demand at the other end
has been so high for cricket

00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.070
and for the good decisions.

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:03.730
Everybody wants good
decisions, fair decisions.

00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:06.714
So without technology, you
will not be able to achieve it.

00:48:06.714 --> 00:48:08.380
So even then, there
will be a little bit

00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.990
of errors here and there.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.030
But that is tolerable errors.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.720
So technology will
be part of it,

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.990
so DRS will be integral
part of sports from now on.

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:21.700
SPEAKER 1: Do you
see DRS combined

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.310
with machine learning replacing
human umpires in cricket

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.200
at some point?

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.910
JAVAGAL SRINATH: You see, I
think we cannot think cricket--

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:36.250
or technology as a
master at any stage.

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:39.890
I think to understand
the soul, I don't know,

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:41.710
no matter how much
improvements you do,

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:43.330
what kind of
intelligence you build,

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:47.530
it cannot understand a soul
and the mind of a human being.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:51.390
I think technology has to be
one level below at any stage.

00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:53.020
I mean, the decision
making has to be

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:58.300
in the hands of the person,
I mean, the human beings.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:01.990
You might probably get the
best of the best information

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.000
to make the right
decision, but it

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.330
should be the humans at the
top making all the decisions.

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:11.160
So the man is always the
master, and technology

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.760
should be the slave.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:15.080
I don't think the
other way is possible.

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.720
So if you take away the
entire human element,

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:20.920
so even if there is an
inherent mistake at any stage,

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.040
you might probably get
a few things right.

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:29.650
But that human element, that
fun part, will be missing.

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:32.170
Then you don't even need
players on either side.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.550
You can get some robots to play.

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:38.350
Where is the fun then?

00:49:38.350 --> 00:49:42.010
I think India will put the
11 best robots and the US

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.300
will also put 12 best
robots to play on the field.

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:48.280
And that's how the game goes.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.430
SPEAKER 1: I have one
last question for you.

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:53.270
You are currently an
ICC match referee.

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:57.670
You also have done a lot
of motivational talks

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:00.250
for corporations and such.

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.320
What's next for
you in your life?

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.720
JAVAGAL SRINATH: I think you
can plan for a good life,

00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.430
but I've been a happy-go-lucky
in many ways, which might not

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:12.490
be the right way to go about.

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:15.190
I don't really plan big as such.

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:20.940
But I'm an ardent fan
of technology in sport.

00:50:20.940 --> 00:50:23.860
I will always pursue it.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.680
I wanted to see
how far we can go

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:32.282
in helping people get
the right kind of support

00:50:32.282 --> 00:50:34.240
from the technology,
especially in the coaching

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:35.082
space and stuff.

00:50:35.082 --> 00:50:36.540
So that will be
one of my passions.

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:40.360
It's like when you're playing,
when you're schooling,

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:42.400
you play sport all the time.

00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.340
So this technology and sport
will be that particular space

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:46.210
now.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.767
And, of course, my career
will be something else.

00:50:49.767 --> 00:50:51.100
I mean, I'm a match referee now.

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:53.308
I don't know how I want to
get involved in the sport.

00:50:53.308 --> 00:50:56.360
It could be a little
bit of administration.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.560
It could be a little bit of
getting into the mainstream

00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:00.496
sport.

00:51:00.496 --> 00:51:02.120
I'm happy doing my
match refereeing now

00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.540
at this point in time.

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.370
So at this point in
time, a lot of things

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:09.203
that are happening back
home in India as far

00:51:09.203 --> 00:51:12.160
as cricket and administration
is all concerned.

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:16.250
So we have to wait and
watch what happens.

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:20.550
But as of now I'm a very
content match referee.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:23.160
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so much
for joining us today and sharing

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.780
your stories and
your experiences.

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:26.290
We really enjoyed
having you here.

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.110
I hope you enjoy your
stay in the Bay Area.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:29.651
JAVAGAL SRINATH:
Thank you very much.

00:51:29.651 --> 00:51:32.180
[APPLAUSE]
