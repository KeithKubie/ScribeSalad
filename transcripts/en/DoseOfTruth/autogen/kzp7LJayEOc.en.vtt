discipline yourself to tell the truth
and all of that and then what I would

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
and all of that and then what I would
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.429
and all of that and then what I would
say is that as your life unfolds you'll

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
say is that as your life unfolds you'll
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109
say is that as your life unfolds you'll
have the amount of influence that you

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119
have the amount of influence that you
 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.480
have the amount of influence that you
should have whatever that happens to be

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490
should have whatever that happens to be

doesn't mean that her contribution is
somehow lesser I mean she's being

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
somehow lesser I mean she's being
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.719
