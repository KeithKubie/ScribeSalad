00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.170
Now, what do you think is the relationship between frequency, this how many

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.054
times per second the wave is being produced. And pitch. This perceived sound

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:12.520
quality of the wave.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.588
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So if fast vibrations make high frequencies. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes.

00:00:16.588 --> 00:00:18.490
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which sound like high pitch.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.919
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Exactly. High frequency means high pitch.
