00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Congratulations! You've completed CS212.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You've done all the work throughout the seven weeks.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You've done the final exam. I hope you've learned a lot.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I know you've accomplished a lot in terms of writing programs.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I hope you've learned both techniques and theory

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that will help you as you progress as a computer scientist.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I know I've really enjoyed being a part of this class and learning

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
from the students as we've gone along,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and I hope to see you in the future in another class.
