00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
A person holding up a convenience store and a
pacifist at a protest might seem like polar opposites.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.600
But they actually have something in common.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.280
So do an American vegan preparing a meal at
home, and a white-collar criminal committing
tax fraud, and a runaway slave.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.340
They're all social deviants.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.140
We've spent a lot of time so far talking about
how society fits together, and how it functions.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.980
But we can’t cover that in any meaningful
way without also talking about the people
who don't fit.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.320
We have to talk about who’s normal and who’s
deviant...and how they get to be that way.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:42.080
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:50.800
Now, you might think that calling pacifists
and vegans and runaway slaves deviant is...rude,
but in sociology, deviance isn't an insult.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.620
Deviance simply means being non-normative.
Different.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:02.420
So while this does include some things that we might think of as bad or harmful, like, crime, it also includes things we might just think of as outside the mainstream.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.520
So if eating a burger is a traditional "all-American"
cultural activity, then being vegan in America is deviant.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.320
But there's something important to notice
here.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.110
I didn't say being vegan in a society where
most people eat meat is deviant, because deviance
is not just a matter of numbers.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.680
Deviance is anything that deviates from what
people generally accept as normal.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.880
For instance, red hair is statistically uncommon,
but it’s not considered deviant.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.740
Dying your hair bright purple – that is
deviant and might earn you some strange
looks from some people.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.000
And strange looks from strangers are
a form of social control,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.960
attempts by society to regulate people's
thoughts and behaviors in ways that limit,
or punish, deviance.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.220
Specifically, the strange looks are what are
known as negative sanctions, negative social
reactions to deviance.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.360
The opposite, naturally, are positive
sanctions – affirmative reactions, usually
in response to conformity.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.360
Once you start looking, you begin to see
forms of social control, both positive and
negative, everywhere:

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.900
a friend making fun of your taste in food or
a teacher congratulating you on a good paper.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.860
Or someone commenting loudly on your bright
purple hair.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.000
Sanctions all.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.400
These are all examples of informal norms,
or what sociologists call folkways.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.000
You won’t be arrested for violating a folkway,
but breaking them usually results in negative
sanctions.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.920
But not all norm violations are informally
sanctioned.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:24.340
Formal sanctioning of deviance occurs when norms are codified into law, and violation almost always results in negative sanctions from the criminal justice system – the police, the courts, and the prison system.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.460
So given the power of formal sanctions, why
does anyone do deviant things?

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.700
This is a big question.

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.960
Before we get to the sociological perspective,
we need to mention some of the biological

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.990
and psychological views of deviance that have
been influential in the past.

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:41.580
Spoiler alert: Historically, these explanations
have been insufficient in helping us understand
non-normative behavior.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.620
For example, the earliest attempts at scientific
explanations for deviance, and crime in particular,
are biologically essentialist explanations.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.060
They were based on the idea that
something about a person's essential
biology made them deviant.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.400
In 1876, Cesare Lombroso, an Italian physician,
theorized that criminals were basically subhuman,
throwbacks to a more primitive version of humanity.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.300
He went so far as to suggest that deviants
could be singled out based on physical characteristics,

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.740
like a low forehead, stocky build, and prominent
jaw and cheekbones, all of which he saw as
reminiscent of our primate cousins.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.420
Another scientist, U.S. psychologist William
Sheldon, also found a relationship between
general body type and criminality.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.740
In the 1940s and ‘50s, he studied body types and behavior and concluded that men who were more muscular and athletic were more likely to be criminally deviant.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:32.080
We know today that the idea that physical
features somehow correspond to criminality
is just no...it’s wrong.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.340
But later work by Eleanor and Sheldon Glueck appeared to confirm William Sheldon’s basic findings on male muscularity and criminal aggression.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.040
However, they refused to ascribe their results
to a biological explanation.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.780
They countered that a simple correlation
between body type and criminality could
not be taken as causal evidence.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.320
Instead, they argued this was an example
of a self-fulfilling prophecy:

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.760
People expect physically strong boys to be
bullies, and so they encourage aggressive
behavior in such boys.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.820
Large boys who have their bullying behavior
positively sanctioned are encouraged to
continue being aggressive,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.960
and some eventually grow up and
engage in aggressive criminal behaviors.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.600
Psychological approaches, by contrast,
place almost all the explanatory power in a
person’s environment.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.740
While some elements of personality may be
inherited, psychologists generally see personality
as a matter of socialization.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.939
So they see deviance as a matter of improper
or failed socialization.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.040
A classic example of this strain of psychological
explanation is found in the 1967 work of Walter
Reckless and Simon Dinitz.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.460
They studied boys who lived in an urban neighborhood
known for its high rate of delinquency.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.120
Using the assessment of the boys’ teachers,
they grouped the youths into "good boys" and

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.900
"bad boys," and then interviewed them to construct
psychological profiles.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.360
They found that the so-called "good boys" had a strong
conscience, were good at coping with frustration,
and identified with conventional cultural norms.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.240
The "bad boys," on the other hand, were the
opposite on all counts.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.740
Following the boys over time, Reckless and
Dinitz found that the "good boys" had fewer
run-ins with the police.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.159
And they attributed this to the boys’ ability
to control deviant impulses.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:01.300
This idea that deviance is essentially a matter of
impulse control is called containment theory, or
having a personality that contains deviant actions.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:10.600
And containment theory has received support in recent research, including a 2011 study on 500 male fraternal twins that assessed their self-control, resilience, and ability to delay gratification.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.000
Researchers found that the brother who scored
lower on these measures in childhood was more
likely to be criminally deviant in adulthood.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.260
Now, while we've seen that there's clearly value
in both biological and psychological approaches,
they’re each also fundamentally limited.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.800
For example, both kinds of explanations
link criminal deviance to individual factors
– either of body or of mind –

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.820
while leaving out other important factors, like
peer influence or what opportunities for deviance
different people might be exposed to.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.560
Plus, biological and psychological explanations
only understand deviance as a matter of abnormality.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.820
Both approaches begin by looking for
physical or mental irregularities,

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.300
whereas more recent research suggests
that most people who do deviant things are both
biologically and psychologically normal –

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.840
or, to use a better word, let’s
say: typical.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.280
Finally, neither biology nor psychology can
answer the question of why the things that are
deviant are considered deviant in the first place.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.360
Even if you could 100% prove that a certain
abnormality caused people to be violent, not
all violence is considered a form of deviance.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.419
Think boxing.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.420
And here's where we can turn to a sociological
approach, which sees deviance and criminality
as the result of how society is structured.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.380
And here, the approach is based on three major
ideas.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.480
First is the idea that deviance varies according
to cultural norms.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.020
In other words, nothing is inherently deviant:
Cultural norms vary from culture to culture,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.200
and over time and place, so what’s deviant
now might have once been quite normal.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.040
Slavery is an obvious example.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:33.140
Not only was race-based slavery normal in
19th century America, rejecting it was considered
deviant.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.760
So deviant, in fact, that physician Samuel
Cartwright wrote about a disorder he called
drapetomania

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.500
to explain the supposed mental
disorder that caused slaves to flee captivity.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.900
The second major principle sociologists draw
on is the idea that people are deviant because
they’re labeled as deviant.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.400
What I mean here is that it’s society's
response that defines us, or our actions,
as deviant.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.000
The same action can be deviant or not,
depending on the context:

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.660
Sleeping in a tent in a public place can be
illegal, or it can be a fun weekend activity,
depending on where you do it.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.380
And, as the Gluecks argued, labeling people
can become a self-fulfilling prophecy:

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.720
When society treats you as a deviant,
it’s very easy to become one.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.340
Deviance doesn't even necessarily require
action.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.240
Simply being a member of a group can classify
you as a deviant in the eyes of society.

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:21.900
The rich may view the poor with disdain for imagined moral failures, or we can return again to racism and slavery, which imagined African Americans as deviant by nature.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:28.669
And the last major sociological principle
for understanding deviance is the idea that
defining social norms involves social power.

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:34.620
The law is many things, but Karl Marx argued
that one of its roles is as a means for the powerful
elite to protect their own interests.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:40.820
This is obvious in the case of something like
fugitive slave laws, which applied a formal negative
sanction to deviating from the norms of slavery.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.440
But we can also see it in things like the
difference between a campaign rally and
a spontaneous protest.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:50.780
Both are public political speech, and both
may block traffic, but they draw resoundingly
different reactions from police.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.820
So these are three foundational ideas about
the sociological perspective on deviance.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.960
But I want to stress that they only begin to
define a perspective.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.240
Sociology clearly understands deviance in a
different way than biology and psychology do,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.460
but if you really want to dive into more
detailed sociological explanations,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.160
you'll need to wait until next week,
when we look at the major theoretical
explanations for crime and deviance.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.879
Today we learned about social deviance.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:15.260
We discussed biological and psychological
approaches to explaining deviance,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:18.380
what they can bring to the table,
and their inherent limitations.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.940
Then we finished by turning to the sociological
perspective and talking about the social foundations
of deviance.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:30.600
