00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.350
- [Kim] Hi, this is Kim from Khan Academy,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.750
and today we're learning more

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.100
about Brown v. Board
of Education of Topeka.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.100
Decided in 1954, Brown v.
Board was a landmark case

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.310
that opened the door for desegregation

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.420
and the Modern Civil Rights Movement.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.470
In Brown, the Supreme Court ruled

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.900
that segregated schools for
white and black children,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.630
which had been prevalent
throughout the American South

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.040
since the 1896 decision
in Plessy v. Ferguson

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.370
legalized segregation, were
in fact inherently unequal.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.290
The named plaintiff in
this case, Oliver Brown,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.440
was the father of Linda, a third-grader

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
who had to take a bus to a
segregated elementary school

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350
that was much farther from her home

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.520
than the nearby school for white children.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.510
To learn more about the Brown case,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.510
I sought out the help of two experts.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.430
Theodore Shaw is the Julius L. Chambers

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.230
Distinguished Professor of Law,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.350
and Director of the
Center for Civil Rights

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.100
at the University of North
Carolina School of Law.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.950
Michael McConnell is the Richard

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.860
and Frances Mallery Professor,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.550
and Director of the
Constitutional Law Center

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.910
at Stanford Law School,
and a Senior Fellow

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.590
at the Hoover Institution.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.010
So Prof. Shaw, could you just
kinda set the stage for us?

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.110
What was the overall social
and political context

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.190
behind this case?

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.630
- [Prof. Shaw] Well Brown was
decided in the Cold War era.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.110
I think that's important for
reasons that I'll come back to.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.040
But it also was decided,
I guess it was 58 years

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.730
after the Supreme Court
ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.330
that separate but equal railway
cars were constitutional.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.330
Of course that extended to all
walks of life in the South.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.600
And so what you had was
Jim Crow segregation

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.330
sustained and set in place by law.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.870
And Brown was the case
that cracked the edifice

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.430
of Jim Crow segregation.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.530
So, it was an enormously important case.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.030
It came after a long campaign

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.837
by the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund to overturn Plessy.

00:02:09.837 --> 00:02:12.210
- [Kim] One thing that I
think is really confusing

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.550
about Plessy v. Ferguson
is how it interacts

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.050
with the 14th Amendment.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.800
So immediately after the Civil War,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.210
Congress passed, and the states
ratified, the 14th Amendment

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.070
which gives equal protection
under the law to all citizens.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.280
But then Plessy v. Ferguson
just a couple decades later,

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.750
legalizes segregation.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.120
Can you talk a little bit more

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.500
about how the equal protection clause

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.052
of the 14th Amendment has
been interpreted in Plessy,

00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:47.530
and then later in Brown v. Board?

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.260
- [Prof. McConnell] The
doctrine of separate but equal

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.260
was itself a departure from
the prior understanding

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.420
of what the 14th Amendment meant.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.860
In the immediate wake
of the 14th Amendment,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.300
segregation was understood
to be a violation

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.573
of equal rights.

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:10.340
The Congress of the United States

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.600
passed the Civil Rights Act of 1875

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.820
which prohibited mandatory segregation

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.840
of among other things, railroads.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.660
Now that was struck down in 1883,

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.040
I believe it was 1886, but for reasons

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.070
not related to separate
but equal or segregation.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.680
But it's only in the late 1880s and 1890s

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.270
that states began passing
Jim Crow legislation,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.820
like the law in Plessy v. Ferguson.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.210
I think Plessy very
likely would've come out

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.430
a different way, had it
come up 25 years earlier.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.330
It's really very difficult to understand

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.330
the logic of Plessy, because
Plessy takes the point of view

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.300
that segregation is okay
because it treats everyone

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.380
the same way, and the sense
of inferiority or insult

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.730
that comes from segregation,
the court just ignored.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.210
You can read the opinion different ways,

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.650
and people do and have read
the opinion different ways.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.870
A portion of the opinion makes it sound

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.990
as though this is kind of
social science conclusion,

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.990
that segregation breeds
a feeling of inferiority,

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.710
that has a deleterious effect

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.090
on the black students'
performance in school.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.050
- [Prof. Shaw] There's a famous footnote

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.760
in Brown v. Board of Education,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.033
Footnote 11 in which
some social scientists,

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:58.900
and particularly Dr. Kenneth Clark,

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.120
did a series of tests, the doll tests,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.490
in which they showed black and white dolls

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.770
who were otherwise identical
to little children,

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.820
little black children, and they
asked who was the good doll,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.930
who was the bad doll,
who was the pretty doll,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.930
who was the ugly doll.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.320
And the black children
would invariably choose

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.360
the white dolls as the better dolls,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.330
and the black dolls as the inferior dolls.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.740
And then finally the bombshell question,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.510
which one looks like you?

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.510
And they would stop and
choose the black doll,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.610
and many times, tears
would come to their eyes.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.470
And so this old notion of the inferiority

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.470
that segregation imbued
in black school children

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.060
was important, and the Supreme Court

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.830
had some very eloquent
language about that.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.600
- [Prof. McConnell] Everyone
knew that the only reason

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.673
to have laws requiring black
and white to be separate,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.630
was because of the feeling

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.100
on the part of the dominant white group,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.680
that the African race was inferior.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.100
I think it was a failure
of political will really,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.740
rather than a matter of
constitutional or legal logic

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.080
that led to that.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.530
And then it took almost 60 years

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.760
before the Supreme Court
would turn itself around.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.650
- [Prof. Shaw] The late
A. Leon Higginbotham

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.010
who sat on the Court of Appeals

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.790
for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.863
he used to say that Plessy was
wrong the day it was decided.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.150
And I believe he was right about that.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.710
If you go back and look at the rationale

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.593
stated in Plessy, it didn't hold up.

00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:49.983
It's not an intellectually
honest decision,

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.870
and having said that,
if you look at Brown,

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:01.170
it really did not overrule
Plessy on its face

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.633
with respect to segregation
and Jim Crow across the board.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.690
What it did was say that in
the field of public education,

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.460
separate but equal is unconstitutional.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.250
Separate schools cannot be equal.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.690
And what followed Brown
was a series of cases

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.990
in all kinds of areas in which the court

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.210
sometimes without much of an opinion,

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.990
cited Brown, but struck down
segregation in public libraries

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:36.630
and public accommodations,
and transportation, et cetera.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.630
The case that settled
the long-running boycott

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.560
in Montgomery, Alabama, that
catapulted Martin Luther King

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.603
into the national and world stage,

00:07:53.094 --> 00:07:54.930
it was decided, it was resolved finally.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:58.630
The boycott was important, but
it was resolved by this case

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.093
that the Supreme Court
decided and had cited Brown.

00:08:02.093 --> 00:08:04.940
- [Kim] And so, Thurgood Marshall
and the Legal Defense Fund

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.220
had kind of been chipping away
at the edges of segregation,

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.420
and then they turned directly
to school segregation

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:13.820
in the Brown cases.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.460
So what kind of arguments did they use

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.180
to challenge the system
of school segregation?

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.790
- [Prof. McConnell] Thurgood
Marshall and his co-council

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.500
in the NAACP established
a very careful strategy

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.330
of one case at a time, sort
of pushing the envelope

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:34.780
of this idea that
segregation is inconsistent

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.240
with demands of equal protection.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.240
And the interesting
thing about Brown itself,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.370
the case challenging
segregation in Topeka, Kansas,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.980
you know, why Topeka, Kansas?

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.980
Why was this such an excellent
place to raise the challenge?

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:02.320
And the reason is that
the schools in Topeka

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:08.080
were very substantially equal in quality.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.020
In Topeka they actually
had integrated high schools

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:11.900
and middle schools.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.100
It was only the elementary
schools that were segregated,

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.160
and the District Court found,

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.070
and the Supreme Court did not disagree

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.380
that in terms of their
material advantages,

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.140
the black school was
essentially just as good

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.600
as the white school.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:34.150
And that's why the NAACP
wanted to go after Topeka,

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.070
because then it went to
the principle of the thing.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.180
You know it's one thing
to attack segregation

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.280
when separate but equal
is really just a fiction,

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.110
but when separate but equal is a reality,

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.280
at least pretty close to it, as in Topeka,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.760
you have to go after the actual principle

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.780
that segregation is wrong in principle

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.560
and not just wrong because
it tends most of the time

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.900
to lead to material disadvantage.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.580
- [Prof. Shaw] Brown
was actually five cases.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.620
The Brown case itself
came from Topeka, Kansas.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.590
In many ways, the Supreme Court

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.490
might've chosen to lead
with the Brown case

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.530
because it wasn't part of the South,

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.870
and so in some ways it
might've been viewed

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.640
as taking pressure off of the South.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.740
But there were five cases altogether.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.080
There was a case out of South Carolina,

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.780
a case out of Virginia,
a case out of Delaware,

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.050
a case out of Washington DC,
and then the Topeka case.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:38.820
And the Brown family was
actually not even the only family

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.370
named Brown in the Topeka case.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:46.370
And the other Brown case
did not have their father

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:53.770
available as the lead voice,
and they wanted a man,

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.080
and so Oliver Brown
was the one they chose.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.670
They stipulated that the
schools were in fact equal

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.540
in all respects, and
of course they weren't.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:06.780
It was never possible to make
separate but equal, equal.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:10.040
But they stipulated that
these schools were equal,

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.470
the black and the white schools,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.030
because they wanted the court

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:18.030
to be able to, or to have
to, confront the issue

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.490
of whether separate but equal
per se was unconstitutional.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.470
- [Kim] Interesting, so it's this place

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.810
where they're hoping not to have a ruling

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.280
that for example, oh the
schools for black children

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.090
need to be brought up to code,

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:34.620
to be the same as white children,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.470
but they're trying to strike down

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.440
the idea of segregation altogether.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.360
And indeed they rule unanimously

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:47.300
that separate but equal
facilities are inherently unequal.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.810
- [Prof. McConnell] The
Supreme Court in Brown

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.330
says well whatever may
have been the status

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:59.330
of education as a civil right back then,

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:04.150
back in the 19th century, by
now it surely is a civil right,

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:08.220
and therefore there can
be no discrimination

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.051
with regard to it.

00:12:10.051 --> 00:12:11.850
And one other thing that changed

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:14.410
that I think the Supreme
Court doesn't refer to,

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.840
but many historians think
was surely in the back

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.520
of their minds, has to do with
foreign policy of all things,

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.830
that during this time the United States

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.820
in the wake of World War II was playing

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.810
a very major role in opposing colonialism,

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.770
opposing communism, in
trying to spread the gospel

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.610
of liberty around the world.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:44.610
And when we had segregation at home,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.170
this looked like rank hypocrisy.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.890
- [Prof. Shaw] This was
the Cold War period.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:54.660
These soldiers came home from
fighting a form of racism

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.660
in Europe, Nazi Germany,
you know the Holocaust.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.420
And when they came back,

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.563
they came back to segregated America.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.550
And there are many
stories that are painful

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.250
about what their experiences were.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:12.700
But meanwhile the United States

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.560
is having this Cold War
with the Soviet Union,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.520
and the Soviet Union was
exploiting this inconsistency

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.430
in what America said it
was, and what it was.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.400
And though the Supreme Court
never said a word about that

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:32.400
in the Brown cases, that
was very much context

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.840
for that decision.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.970
- [Kim] So what did it
take for desegregation

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.130
to really come about?

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.990
Do you think we've achieved desegregation?

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.290
- [Prof. Shaw] Yes and no.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.873
There was a long battle
to implement Brown,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.230
and in fact for the most part,

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:56.170
Brown was not implemented
fully to the extent it ever was

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.890
until the early 1970s when
the Supreme Court decided

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:03.010
a case called Swann v.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.580
Board of Education in North Carolina,

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.780
and sanctioned the use of busing.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:08.760
- [Prof. McConnell] This does not depend

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.350
upon what social scientists might think

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.440
about how people do in school.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.900
This is a much more fundamental principle

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.300
of equality under the law,

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:24.300
that our law must treat
black and white the same,

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.640
that for the government to
draw racial distinctions

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:33.450
is fundamentally unequal,
and unconstitutional,

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:37.530
and wrong, and unjust, fundamentally so

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:42.530
and not just as a matter
of social science evidence.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:47.360
- [Prof. Shaw] I don't
wanna sound despairing,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.600
you know, but I think if anybody looks

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.600
at our public schools today,
and many of our communities,

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.940
and our towns, and
cities, and our counties,

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.060
we have to acknowledge honestly

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.250
that there's still a
great deal of segregation,

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.250
and there are many schools
that are identifiably white,

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.320
or identifiably black.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.320
And now Latinos, Hispanics,

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.380
large degree of segregation there also.

00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:24.220
And even voluntary desegregation efforts

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.910
have been found by the Supreme Court

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:30.250
a few years ago to be
largely unconstitutional

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.053
and illegal, and that's tragic.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.300
But that doesn't mean that
Brown wasn't significant.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.750
I was born in the year of
Brown v. Board of Education.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:41.760
The America that I grew up in

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:46.510
is a very different country
than the one that proceeded it.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.640
In spite of our flaws and our warts,

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.830
no Brown v. Board of Education,

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.560
no Civil Rights Movement, I would say.

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.920
And ultimately no
desegregation of our society

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.380
to the extent that we've accomplished it,

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.210
and we have to a great
degree, and no Barack Obama.

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.760
So I think Brown stands, as I said,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.720
as a dividing point in
America, but we can do better.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:15.620
- [Kim] So we've learned
that under the leadership

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.340
of Thurgood Marshall, and
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund,

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:22.070
the decision in Brown
v. Board of Education

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.120
struck a major blow to
the system of segregation.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.400
After World War II, amidst
the ideological struggle

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.280
of the Cold War, the
Supreme Court overturned

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.870
the precedent set in Plessy v. Ferguson,

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.870
and ruled that segregated education

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:39.280
constituted a violation of
the equal protection clause

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.780
of the 14th Amendment.
