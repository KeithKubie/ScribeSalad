00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
&gt;&gt; What are the chances of India really being
the next superpower?

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.390
Well, I mean obviously they're very good.
When you've got over a billion people, you're

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.620
going to be taken very
seriously, whether in terms of trade, resources,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.590
agricultural demand,
the views that India has in international

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.109
negotiations.
I guess the main variables will be how well

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.310
India succeeds with its
three E's: Expansion, yes.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.929
That's definitely in the cards, a lot of growth.
Getting rid of your exclusion, and trying

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.989
to do it promote inclusion
and that folds into a whole number of areas

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.350
like fixing water problems,
because the poor often don't have water, like

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.460
fixing housing, fixing
access to employment which India is trying

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.800
to do very hard with the
NRGE and I think is doing very well.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.140
So expansion, exclusion and excellence.
And one of the major themes of this meeting

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.590
has been the real need for
better education, more accessible to people

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.969
and producing better
product.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:08.930
So yes, India will be a superpower.
How important, how really much of the determinant

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.720
flair, how able to
take advantage of its own strengths, will

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.229
depend on well it sticks to
the -- to the determination to achieve these

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:17.609
goals.
