00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.932
For many of us,

00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:11.828
a typical day involves interactions
with hundreds of companies.

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:13.780
Buying their goods, using their services,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.555
even wearing their names.

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:16.898
Corporations and companies

00:00:16.898 --> 00:00:19.981
have become such a familiar part 
of the modern landscape

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:22.808
that it's easy to forget they're 
artificial entities

00:00:22.808 --> 00:00:26.113
created to allow real people
to do business.

00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:27.903
But there are some types of companies

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:30.335
that aren't engaged 
in any business at all.

00:00:30.335 --> 00:00:32.607
Instead, these anonymous companies

00:00:32.607 --> 00:00:35.241
exist mainly to disguise 
people doing things

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:38.135
they'd rather not have 
the public know about.

00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:41.987
And these people go to great lengths
to hide any links between their names

00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:44.095
and the companies they own.

00:00:44.095 --> 00:00:46.147
The life of an anonymous company

00:00:46.147 --> 00:00:49.775
usually begins in what's known
as a secrecy jurisdiction,

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.566
a place whose laws allow 
new companies to be registered

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:56.440
with little disclosure about who owns
or controls them.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.143
Some may simply not require
collecting that information.

00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:00.523
Others may collect it,

00:01:00.523 --> 00:01:03.415
but make it nearly inaccessible
to anyone else.

00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:06.479
And the lack of incentive to verify
companies' real owners

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.232
makes it easy for people
to cover their tracks.

00:01:09.232 --> 00:01:12.985
For example, someone may register
a company in the name of a relative,

00:01:12.985 --> 00:01:13.911
an associate,

00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:15.686
or even a nominee director

00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:19.148
who acts on instruction 
from the company's actual owner

00:01:19.148 --> 00:01:21.996
while keeping their name confidential.

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:25.659
Once registered, a company can do many 
of the same things as a human being,

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.349
like opening bank accounts,

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:28.858
buying and owning assets,

00:01:28.858 --> 00:01:30.401
and transferring money.

00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:33.685
What's more, it can be listed as the owner
of other companies,

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:37.754
including ones opened in places
with stricter disclosure rules.

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:42.323
This allows someone to create
a complex world-wide chain of ownership

00:01:42.323 --> 00:01:44.299
that can take years to unravel.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.631
A company based in the U.S.

00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:49.190
may be wholly owned by another one
in Liechtenstein,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.714
which is owned in turn by one
in the British Virgin Islands.

00:01:52.714 --> 00:01:56.571
And an anonymous company can be
transferred to a new owner at any time

00:01:56.571 --> 00:01:59.429
with no public record of the change.

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.253
So why all the anonymity?

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:05.333
Defenders of financial secrecy argue
that wealthy individuals need it

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.487
to avoid intrusive media attention

00:02:07.487 --> 00:02:09.532
and threats to personal security.

00:02:09.532 --> 00:02:11.619
But while this may sometimes be justified,

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:16.023
anonymous companies play a role
in almost every type of economic crime,

00:02:16.023 --> 00:02:18.654
including many major corruption cases.

00:02:18.654 --> 00:02:21.096
They are used by corporations 
evading taxes,

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:23.180
rogue governments skirting sanctions,

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.211
terrorists buying arms,

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.753
and dictators financing wars.

00:02:27.753 --> 00:02:31.247
Organized crime groups launder
their profits through anonymous companies.

00:02:31.247 --> 00:02:33.907
Corrupt government officials award
valuable contracts

00:02:33.907 --> 00:02:36.476
to corporations they secretly own.

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:40.484
International oligarchs with criminal
connections or questionable pasts

00:02:40.484 --> 00:02:44.134
have used anonymous companies
to discretely buy luxury apartments

00:02:44.134 --> 00:02:46.388
in cities like London and New York City,

00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:49.298
keeping them as safe stores of wealth.

00:02:49.298 --> 00:02:51.779
And even when criminals are convicted,

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:53.443
their anonymously held assets

00:02:53.443 --> 00:02:56.464
may be difficult for authorities 
to locate or seize,

00:02:56.464 --> 00:03:00.417
making it harder for victims 
to be compensated.

00:03:00.417 --> 00:03:04.521
Efforts are now underway to chip away 
at these crime-enabling mechanisms.

00:03:04.521 --> 00:03:06.675
International authorities and NGOs

00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:11.044
have called for requiring companies to
state who ultimately makes their decisions

00:03:11.044 --> 00:03:13.223
and benefits from their assets.

00:03:13.223 --> 00:03:15.118
But while progress is being made,

00:03:15.118 --> 00:03:18.127
international cooperation 
has been difficult to achieve,

00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:21.214
as governments that profit from 
registering anonymous companies

00:03:21.214 --> 00:03:23.366
are reluctant to lose business.

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:25.864
And some of the most popular places
for this practice

00:03:25.864 --> 00:03:29.201
are located not on remote,
tropical tax shelters,

00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:32.889
but within the same advanced nations
which claim to be leading the fight

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.273
for global financial transparency.

00:03:35.273 --> 00:03:37.961
But still, it's a fight worth fighting.

00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:41.469
Closing the legal loopholes that enable
anonymous companies

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.433
would help us cut down on corruption
and illegal activity.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.723
It would also allow us, 
as the general public,

00:03:47.723 --> 00:03:51.187
to better understand the flow
of enormous sums of money

00:03:51.187 --> 00:03:55.654
that impact politics, our daily lives,
and the health of our world.
