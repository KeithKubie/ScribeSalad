00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
And this time not all statements are correct,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.550
but the strongest one of them is,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.550
so if you showed just one single

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.850
NP complete problem

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.590
requiring exponential time to be solved,

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.010
then all NP problems will require

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.270
exponential time to solve,

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.950
and the reason for that is that all NP complete problems

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.410
are connected to each other

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.070
using polynomial time reductions,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.270
so if one of them requires exponential time

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.160
and another one requires polynomial time,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.990
then that just can not be, because

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.760
say if this problem here requires polynomial time,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.080
that would mean that

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.270
you can SAT, for example, in polynomial time,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.980
which would then mean that you can solve this problem over here in polynomial time,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.160
and so on and so on.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.090
All problems that are NP complete

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.930
are from a viewpoint of polynomial or exponential time

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.660
equally hard to solve,

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.320
which would also mean that the weaker statement here is true.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.210
Some problems in NP are only solvable in exponential time; yes,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.250
if all NP problems require exponential time,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.770
then there are problems in NP which require exponential time.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.170
Finally, this statement down here;

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.530
that is not true.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.990
All problems in NP are only solvable in exponential time.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.380
That is not true.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.500
Not all problems in NP require exponential time.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.400
So remember our picture from before when we said that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.190
P is basically a subset of NP,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.220
so these problems here will still be solvable in polynomial time.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.100
It doesn't matter if there are some problems in here

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.250
that require exponential time.

00:01:30.250 --> 99:59:59.000
It doesn't effect these problems here in NP.
