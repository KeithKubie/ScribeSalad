00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.350
&gt;&gt; Ted Widmer: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.650
Thank you for coming.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.990
It's an exciting day in Washington,
and here in the Kluge Center,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.300
this morning we had a
delegation of Congressmen come

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.190
in for a really fascinating
conversation

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.730
about the great difficulty
of doing their work.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.960
And they cited today in particular.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.500
And tonight, we're going to
see, I think it's likely,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.670
a vote on health care with
long-term ramification.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.970
Oh, really?

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.710
See, I've been doing too
much academic work today.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.990
I haven't been checking the news.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.440
Well, some kind of vote is coming,
because it's, it's been proposed.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.790
And I think the nearness of our
work to the work of Congress is one

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.400
of the many things that makes
the Kluge Center so exciting.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.160
And I'm delighted to
introduce Lanie Millar today,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.850
who will explain her work
in the literary interstices

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.590 position:56%
of the Cold War, and in particularly
the, the aspect of the Cold War

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.490
that eluded most of us growing up
in the United States in the 1970s.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.540
But Cuba's very deep involvement
with Angola, in Africa,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.170
of different kinds of
trans-Atlantic partnership.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.250
And the literary results
of that Cold War alignment.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.610
There are a few Kluge Scholars
whose work I know in more detail

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.180
than Lanie's, because I, I
was a guinea pig for her,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.650
instead of the other way around.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.510
I offered to do an interview with
her that we put up on our Web site,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.280
and it was incredibly fun and
interesting, and brought me back

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.590
into my own complex
memories as a kid, the 70s,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.510
growing up in the shadow of a Cold
War whose full complexity most

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.810
of us never understood.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.050
And we're still working
it out, years afterwards.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.820
So, she will speak to us
today on literary after lives

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.010
of the Cuban and Angolan
revolutions.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.290
It's from a book manuscript
that she's working on,

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.380
entitled The Poetics
of Disappointment:

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.570
Cuban and Angolan Narratives
after Revolution.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.870
Lanie's an assistant
professor of Romance languages

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.250
at the University of Oregon.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.550
She attended Baylor
University as an undergraduate,

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.030
and received a Master's
at Middlebury.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.010 position:56%
Her research focuses on contemporary
Caribbean and African literature

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.320
in Spanish and Portuguese.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.470
And before calling her to the
stage, I want to remind you

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.050
that Fraulka Saxa is
speaking on April 4th.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.300
Songs of Faith and Devotion:
Discovery of the Quiiche Couplas

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.810 position:56%
in Kislak Manuscript 1015, and Aroun
Soud [assumed spelling] is speaking

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.440
on the cultural memory
of Robert Burns

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.930
in 19th Century America
on April 6th at four.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.840
Both of those talks
are here in LJ 119.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.490
And on April 13th, Wayne Weegan
[assumed spelling] is speaking

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.590
on the History of School
Librarianship.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.100
So, without further -- oh, and
please turn off your cell phones,

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.020
because this is being recorded.

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.560
Without further ado,
please welcome Lanie Millar.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.360
Lanie?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.120
[ Applause ]

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.340
&gt;&gt; Lanie Millar: Thanks so
much, Ted, for the introduction.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.080
I couldn't be happier to be here.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.530 position:56%
And I have to start by thanking the
wonderful staff of the Kluge Center.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.970
Those of you who are here, the
librarians in the collections

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.770
that I've been able to consult
here, especially Laverne Page

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.610
in the African and Middle
Eastern Reading Room.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.250 position:56%
And thanks to the colleagues, and
for the many wonderful conversations

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.550
that we've been able to have

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.890
over the last six months
while I've been here.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.580
So, as Ted mentioned, what I'll
be talking about today are parts

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.670
of the research that I've been able
to complete here, that are drawn

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.410 position:56%
from chapters in my book manuscript.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.310
I'll start with an overview of
the project, talking a little bit

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.460
about the theoretical and
historical justification.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.470
And then I'm going to discuss
two novels as examples.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.120
One Cuban novel and
one Angolan novel.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.580
And then a quick vocabulary note.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.700
When I use Lush as a prefix, it
refers to the Portuguese language.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.340
Okay. Cuba and Angola share a long
history of Iberian colonization,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.440
dating from the 15th century.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.150
And are also two poles of the
trans-Atlantic slave trade

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.410
that continued into the 19th.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.190
More recently, they
shared the histories

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.820 position:56%
of 20th century leftist revolutions.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.520
Cuba's, of course,
triumphed in 1959,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.260
while Angola won its
independence from Portugal in 1975.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.620
In both places, the link between
the colonial past and the threat

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.210
of a neo-colonial present provided
an on-going rhetorical basis

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.610
for seeing Cuba and
Angola as involved

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.200
in similar ideological battles.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.760
Battles that became
literal ones when Cuba began

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.720
to send troops to Angola in 1975.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.840
A 1976 speech by Fidel Castro
commemorates the anniversaries

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.190
of the Cuban victory over US
invaders in 1961 at Playa Giron,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.090
known in the US as the Bay of
Pigs, and Angola's independence

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.230 position:56%
from Portugal, laying out the
rhetorical underpinnings of the long

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.550
and tangled geo politics
links the two nations.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.770
In Giron, quote, in Giron,
African blood was spilled.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.340
That of the selfless
descendants of an enslaved people.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.310
And in Africa, together with
the heroic combatants of Angola,

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.090
Cuban blood was also spilled.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.700
Those who one day enslaved
men and send them

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.960
to America perhaps never
imagined that one of those nations

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.990
that received slaves
would send its combatants

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.510
to fight for liberty in Africa.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.690
The victory of Angola was the twin
sister of the victory at Giron.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.830
End quote.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.880
Angolan and other Luzo-African
intellectuals shared Castro's

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.870
rhetoric of placing together two
moments of national revolution

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.100
against colonial and neo-colonial
forces, as parallel events

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.440
in a worldwide fight against
colonialism and imperialism.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.220
10 years prior, at the first
Tri- Continental Congress,

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.450
that took place in Havana in 1966,

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.350
Pisau Guinean revolutionary Amielka
Cabral [assumed spelling] had used

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.550
almost the same language as
Castro, of retracing the roots

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.620
of the slave trade in the shared
interest of decolonization.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.830 position:56%
In his speech, after lauding the
accomplishments of the Cuban miracle

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.270
of the early revolutionary years,
he declares, quote, we are prepared

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.280 position:56%
to send to Cuba as many men and
women as may be needed to compensate

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.830
for the departure of those who
have interests or attitudes

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.730
that are incompatible with the
interests of the Cuban people.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:11.260
Taking once again the formerly hard
and tragic path of our ancestors,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.520
mainly from Guinea and Angola,
who were taken to Cuba as slaves,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.470
we would come now as free men, to
strengthen the bonds of history,

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.860
blood, and culture which unite
our peoples with the Cuban people.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.490
End quote.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.480
Angola was the site of Cuba's
largest internationalist military

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.690
and humanitarian mission.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.840
During the first 15 years
of Angola's civil war,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.230
which lasted until 2002,
Cuba also sponsored thousands

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:43.200
of African students on the island,
and send teacher, engineers,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.490
and doctors to Angola to
fill the technical voids left

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.690
when Portuguese personnel
abandoned the country.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.190
Angola's politicians

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.340
and intellectuals expressed
their gratitude publicly,

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.670
and the two writers'
unions signed an agreement

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:00.320
of mutual publication in 1976.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.900
The public rhetoric in national
and international publishing venues

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.960
around South Atlantic emphasized a
process of mutual self-recognition,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.380
articulated, as we see in those
two speeches, through notions

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.030
of Africa diasporic sibling-hood,

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.050
as well as through
anti-imperialist solidarity.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.840
However, as much as this
period produced similar works

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.500
of revolutionary solidarity, there
is a parallel stream in literature

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.530
in both hemispheres that derails
the utopian imagined futures

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:35.710
that develops among tightening
political and cultural policies,

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.440
the death and mutilation of
thousands of soldiers in Africa,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.390
and the increasing distance
between political posturing

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.390
and social disintegration as the
civil war escalated in Angola.

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:51.040
This presentation will
discuss characteristics

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.100
of this alternative phase of
Cuban and Angolan narratives

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.290
from the late 20th century,

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:01.440
analyzing Angolan author
Pepetela's 2001 novel Jaime Bunda,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:08.000
Secret Agent, and Cuban Eliseo
Alberto's 1998 novel Caracol Beach,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.010 position:56%
through the lens of what I'm
calling a poetics of disappointment.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.510
I define disappointment as an
effective and formal response

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:18.780
to revolutionary enthusiasm.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.400
In his article titled
Anatomy of Enthusiasm,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.770
Cuban historian Rafael Rojas
argues that the early years

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.690
of the revolution represented
a spectacle of ideas,

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:34.080
in which public debates
centered on the shape and future

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.700
of the new utopian
revolutionary era.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.320
To describe the newness
of the feeling associated

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.800
with this spectacle, Rojas draws

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:48.470
on French theorist Jean Francois
Leotard's 1986 essay Enthusiasm:

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.870
A Kantian Critique of History.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:54.710
In which Leotard proposes
an analogic relationship

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.530
between an experience with
unprecedented political events,

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:03.890
like revolution, and the Kantian
experience with the sublime.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:09.100
In Leotard's analysis, enthusiasm
offers a glimpse of the potential

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.280
for social betterment that
provokes the observers

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.790
of the revolutionary event
into a political commitment.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.560
While for Kant, the
French revolution serves

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.860
as the foundational
event in modernity

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.180
that inspires this feeling,
Leotard argues that different times

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.460
and social conditions will
produce different events

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.910
that produce widespread enthusiasm.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:36.170
He uses as his example
May of 1968 in Europe,

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.640
while Rojas offers
the Cuban revolution

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.360
as another possible event.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.080
This feeling of enthusiasm
for the possibility

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:48.160 position:56%
of a more radically just society
produced particular types of culture

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.660
on both sides of the Atlantic.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.570 position:56%
Angolan and Cuban literature and
film focus, for example, on revising

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.750
or correcting the
Colonially-inflected

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.450
historical record.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.440
On privileging subaltern
points of view.

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:06.170
And on placing history and art
making into the metaphorical

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:08.840
and literal hands of the masses.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.680
Artistic styles were concerned with
the new, with breaking past molds,

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.590
in order to find a new visual and
verbal language, forms and styles

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:23.300
that would adequately reflect
the new social conditions.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.020
The Cuban revolution in the 1960s,
therefore, had at least two,

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:32.030
certainly more than two,
possible intellectual narratives.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:37.110
One as the inheritor of the
liberal tradition founded in 1789,

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.840 position:56%
but a second one that privileged its
links to the anti-Colonial struggles

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.100
across Latin America,
Africa and Asia.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.630
The second history is
theorized thoroughly

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:53.040
in Cuban essayist Roberto Fernandez
Retamar's seminal essay Caliban,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.220
published in 1971.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:58.610
Which Rojas reads as a pivot
away from the possibilities

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:03.150
of the liberal tradition toward
an ideology of third-worldism,

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.790
in the essay's argument for using
the figure of Shakespeare's slave

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.470
in the Tempest for a symbol
for Cuba's identification with

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.310
and allegiance for the
formerly colonized world.

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.930
Cuba's turn away from the
global North to embrace African

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:19.950
and Latin American
liberation movements

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:24.330
in the late 1960s precipitates,
among some of its theorists,

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.820
a new genealogy of revolution.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.070 position:56%
Founded in a radically anti-Colonial
interpretation of the enslaved

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:35.060
and the oppressed taking charge
of their historical future.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:38.370
It's no accident, for example,
that the Haitian revolution

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:42.010
and its leadership appear in
literary and historical works

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.670
as an alternate sign of
the age of revolutions,

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.920
in novels and works of history.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.050 position:56%
And works discussing slavery focus
on acts of rebellion and resistance,

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:54.290
rather than romantic
depictions of suffering.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.590
To Saint Lobeteur [assumed
spelling],

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:58.690
among other black revolutionary
historical figures

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.240
like the Brazilian Zumbidos
Palmaris [assumed spelling]

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.620
and the Angolan Queen Inzinga
[assumed spelling] appear

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:08.400 position:56%
in Angolan literature as
historical predecessors and founders

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.610
of a tradition of resistance.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.220
However, a series of events,
starting in the late 1960s

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.620
and continuing into the 1970s,

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.630
altered the artistic
and political landscape.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:24.530
Precipitating Cuba's break
with the Euro-American left.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.540 position:56%
On the Cuban side, first, the series

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:31.200
of high profile censorship
cases in the late 1960s.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.140
Especially the imprisonment
and forced confession of crimes

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:38.830
against the revolution by
poet Heberto Padilla in 1971,

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:45.010
and the silencing of playwright
Anton Arrufat after 1968.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.520
Second, the establishment of
the Cuban Cultural Ministry

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.780
to centrally regulate cultural
production, initiating the period

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:56.730
that essayist Ambrosio Fornet
calls the gray five years

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.670
in the early 1970s, for
its top-down implementation

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.880
of strict esthetic models and
the threat of ostracization,

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:09.050
imprisonment or censure for
those who did not comply.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:13.040
In Angola, after the leftist
MPLA party won the government

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.800
in the months after
independence from Portugal,

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.040 position:56%
the anti-colonial conflict escalated
into an international conflict,

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.210
when South Africa invaded
its southern borders.

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:26.520
And then progressed to
a full-out civil war.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.710
1977's failed coup
d'etat, led by Nito Alves

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.630
against then-president Agostinho
Neto, resulted in series

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:38.190
of forced confessions,
persecution and execution

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:39.950
of presumed collaborators.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.340
And the civil conflict
continued to intensify.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.640
It was accompanied

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.470
by a State-sponsored publishing
program similar to Cuba's,

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.490
where literature proliferated, but
where the political thrust of works

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.970
of art were tightly monitored,
to be sure of compliance

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.940
with the program linked
to revolutionary ideals.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.270
This period, in short,
ushered in the beginners

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.530
of a widespread feeling
of disappointment.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.790
In my work, disappointment responds
to how the radical possibilities

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.980
of revolutionary promise take
on recognizable political forms,

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.720
such as bureaucratization,
censorship and corruption,

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.450
while the new literary forms
that had been associated

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.980
with utopian ideals

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.500
and revolutionary promise
become the basis

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.400
for prescribed esthetic models.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.080
Texts of disappointment revisit the
radical possibilities of revolution

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.800
through a poetics of
citation and imitation.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.900 position:56%
They used techniques such as parody,
pastiche and historical re-writing.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:45.630
These practices, in turn,
interrogate the meaning of signs,

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:49.320
forms or events for which the
cultural value is changing.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.820
So, I'm now going to
turn to the first example

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.270
of a literary text
of disappointment.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:59.000
The satirical detective
novel Jaime Bunda,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.040
Secret Agent, by Angolan novelist

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.490
Ahtur Carlos Mauricio
Pestano du Santus,

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.710
better known by his
pen name of Pepetela.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.750
Perhaps the most famed
living Angolan writer,

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:15.720
Pepetela's corpus spans the early
years of revolutionary action

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.120 position:56%
in the mid-1970s to the present day.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.760
In the midst of a career of
prize-winning historical novels

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.920
and later works critical of the
corruption and domestic conflict,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.770
Pepetela has written
two Jaime Bunda novels.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.960 position:56%
Jaime Bunda, Secret Agent, published
in 2001, and the follow-up,

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:39.000
Jaime Bunda and the dead of the
American, published in 2003.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.440
They appear in the decade after
the constitutional reforms

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.070
of 1991 left behind the single
party government in favor

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.020
of a Capitalist, multi-party
democracy.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.820
In Pepetela's depiction,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:56.260
turned kleptocratic
autocracy in the 21st century.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.030
The protagonist of both novels
is the comically inept secret

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.380
not-so-secret agent of
Angola's fictional general

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.940
investigative service.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:10.140
He obtains his nickname, Abunda,
due to his outsize back side,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.570
which is what Bunda
means in Portuguese.

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:15.270
He holds his lowly
junior position only due

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.550
to the nepotism of
a distant relative.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.330
While both the Jaime Bunda novels
nod to the genre conventions

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:26.980 position:56%
of detective fiction, in both novels
he's attempting to solve a murder.

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:30.350
The wandering, tangled intrigue
of government corruption,

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.870
social disorganization,
false leads, misinformation,

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:38.910
and widespread ineptitude, by the
end of both novels, fails to result

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.990
in a satisfactory resolution
for either crime.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:46.210
In Jaime Bunda, Secret
Agent, the titular character,

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.030
the laughing stock of his
office, gets his big break

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:51.960
when his boss recruits him
to oversee the investigation

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.970
of the rape and murder
of a teenage girl.

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:58.870 position:56%
Jaime finds it strange to devote
national police efforts to the case,

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:02.720
since her family is neither
politically nor socially prominent.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.500
But it is his first chance to put

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.420
into practice the investigative
techniques he has read

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:12.450
about in the English language crime
novels and films that he favors.

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.480
He ultimately fails to discover
that the murderer is the son

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.170
of a prominent Congress member.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:20.050
That crime is solved
by the local police.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:24.750
But he does accidentally stumble
upon an international counterfeit

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.490
currency ring.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:28.980
His discovery leads to the
apprehension of several

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:32.210
of the players, but leaves
the masterminds at large.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.800
Nonetheless, Jaime distracted
from his original mission,

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.740
and more concerned with his esteem
in his office, and his access

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:44.270
to a gun and a car, accepts
his new reputation as a star,

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.260
more or less willing to accede
to the version of the truth

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.970
that puts him and his collaborators
in favor with the bosses.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.320
In the novel's portrayal
of this inept

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.990
but accidentally successful
investigator,

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:01.020
we can read in Pepetela a satire
of a wide variety of aspects

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.440
of contemporary Angolan society.

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.030 position:56%
Including nepotism and his critiques

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.780
of a rising revolutionary
elite turned bourgeoisie

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.480
in the 21st century.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.230
Who, following the post-
Cold War political winds,

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:16.590
embrace all things American.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.480
Although, of course, a
running joke in the novel is

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.730
that Jaime can't distinguish
references to British detectives

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:27.580
like Sherlock Holmes, J.G. Reeder
and James Bond from American ones

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.410
like Mike Hammer, Philip
Marlow and Perry Mason.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:35.070
For him, they're all gringos.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.180
However, in the connections
between the way

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.060
that the novel narrates Jaime's
imitation of fictional detectives,

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.890
I also read the novel as a
literary pastiche, and here,

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:49.200 position:56%
I'm drawing on Jeanette's definition
of pastiche as a satirical form

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.030
of imitation that is
primarily concerned with style.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:58.440
Pepetela manifests the stylistic
imitation central to pastiche

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.040
in describing Jaime Bunda's
approach to investigation.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.360
Drawn from a literary
history of careful observation

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.940
and logical deduction,
clearly rooted in classics

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.190
like Edgar Allen Poe
and Conan Doyle.

00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:14.200
The first time we meet Jaime,

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.830
we learned that while he lacks
the confidence of his bosses

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:20.760
and co-workers, he has honed
his observational acumen

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.810
through minute observation
of the details around him.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.630
Quote, they never gave him a chance
to prove that he could be an ace,

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.580
only ordering him to
go and buy cigarettes.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.010
During all those months spent
in that room, more than 20,

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.160
he learned to distinguish all
the types of flies that came

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.160
in and out of the windows.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.680
End quote.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.250
Later, as Jaime is briefed
on details of the case,

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.590
he interrupts his boss
with the observation

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:52.420
that his superior has one brown
shoe lace and one black one.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.770
The style of his speech
reveals a clear allusion

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:58.750
to the step-by-step
reasoning typical

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.190 position:56%
of Sherlock Holmes or Auguste Dupin.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:05.650
Jaime Bunda got up from the chair
in front of the chief's office

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.910
and walked around to the other
side, to stand next to him.

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:12.120
He even bent down, to get a
closer look, and then straightened

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.350
up with a triumphant smile.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:16.250
This is what I think
happened, chief.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.940
Actually, both shoelaces are brown.

00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:21.260 position:56%
Only one received some black polish.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.610
Probably when you were
shining your shoes.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.540
Did you do that yourself, chief,
with one of those little bottles,

00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:29.620
with one of those bottles with
the little sponge at the tip?

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.960
Jaime Bunda went back to
sit comfortable in front

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.170
of his superior, who could
not stop looking at his shoes,

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.330
and then at his subordinate,
completely dumbfounded.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:40.610
His authority undermined.

00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:42.240
End quote.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.210
The joke, of course, is not
just that Jaime is forced

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:48.620
to exercise his considerable
observational skills

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.500
on exaggeratedly trivial matters.

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.800
But that he is entirely
unable to distinguish trivial

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.820
or irrelevant observations
from important clues.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.310
Well, in a Sherlock Holmes story,
such an episode might serve

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.960 position:56%
to demonstrate the detective's skill
in advance of a brilliant deduction

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:10.970
that solves the crime, Jaime Bunda
equally enthusiastically pursues

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.260
leads that are related to the case,

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.810
and others that just match
patterns he has read about.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:20.850 position:56%
Cherche la femme, he mysteriously
repeats several times throughout the

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:24.600
novel, quoting Alexandre
Dumas, but then he never tracks

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.230
down the one female character

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.340
who holds the most
important information.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:33.070
It might well be said that if the
murder is largely without clues

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:37.430
that lead us, as readers, to its
conclusion, the novel is replete

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.840
with clues, like the
mismatched shoes laces,

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.840
that are unrelated to any crime.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.340
The deliberate unpairing
of the detailed narration

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.870 position:56%
of the protagonist's observations
and reasoning from the investigation

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.720
of the crime and its clues
is one of the primary ways

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:59.290
that the novel deforms the
detective fiction style.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.490
After sharing his affinity for
crime fiction with his inspector,

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:06.390
denying that an Englishman
was distinct from an American,

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.560
since they're both gringos,
he urges his companion

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.180
to begin with Conan Doyle.

00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:12.900
Which is always where to begin.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:16.370 position:56%
Right? However, I argue that the way

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.030
that Pepetela satirizes the
detective style also points

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.780
to another literary source,

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.670
that remains entirely
unacknowledged in the novel.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:30.450
The mystery of Cintra
Road, published in 1870,

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.990
is considered the first
detective story written

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.910
in the Portuguese language,

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:39.900
by Portugal's most famed 19th
century author, Eca de Queiros,

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:43.150
and his friend, Ramalho Ortigao.

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.180
The mystery of Cintra Road
was a satirical literary hoax

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.680
about the supposed accidental
murder of a young Englishman

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.150
by his beautiful Portuguese lover.

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.800
Delivered in a series
of letters to the editor

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.740
of the Lisbon newspaper,
Diario Di Noticias.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.640
And this is an image of
the first, the first one.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.270
The final letter spread
over more than two months.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:10.140 position:56%
In the final letter, the two authors
revealed that the case is not news

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.770
of a real murder at all,
but a literary fiction.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.750
The key to figuring
out the hoax is style.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:21.000
The two authors said
they wrote it to make fun

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.480
of a Portuguese reading public
that they see as uncritical

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:28.830
of the exaggerated and tired
tropes of the sentimentalist novels

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:31.400
that were popular in
Portugal at the time.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.580
But which the two writers
saw as markers

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:37.900
of Portugal's backwards tastes
and lack of sophistication.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.050 position:56%
The clue to figuring out the prank
lies in contrasting it with the new,

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:45.080
modern style epitomized
in modern French poets

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.890
and writers like Edgar Allen Poe.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:52.090 position:56%
Both modern style and sentimentalist
tropes are evident when one

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:55.100
of the main characters it
finds a clue to the murder.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:00.090
A single hair that turns out to
belong to the murderer herself.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.390
Quote.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.690
The person to whom it
belonged was blond, fair.

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:05.990
Certainly small.

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:09.270
Mignon. Because the strand
of hair was very fine.

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.120
Extremely pure.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.850 position:56%
The character of this person must be
sweet, humble, dedicated and loving.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.780
She must have simple tastes.

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.540
Elegantly modest, the
owner of this hair.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.800
She was likely educated in
England or Germany, because the tip

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.360
of the hair was cut into a point,
a habit of the women of the North,

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.060 position:56%
completely foreign to the meridional
women, who abandoned their locks

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:33.070
to their abundant natural
coarseness.

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.370
End quote.

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:38.600
The narrator's careful
examination of the hair results

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.400
in all the stereotypes of
the sentimentalist heroine.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.430
Although the narrator here is able

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.860
to glean a comically
excessive amount of detail

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:52.240 position:56%
from a single object, another
sentimentalist trope gets in the way

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.050
of satisfactorily resolving
the crime.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:58.360
All the five young men determined
to figure out what happened

00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.600
to their friend fall in
love with the murderer.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.340
And thus, they end up helping her
get rid of the body and retire

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.700
to a convent, rather
than face justice.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:12.690
These two elements, the unresolved
crime and the satire of style,

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:16.990
are what I'm calling on to link
the 19th century Portuguese text

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.710
with the 21st century Angolan one.

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:23.230
Especially through the
notion of counterfeiting.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.730
The counterfeit news
that the Mystery

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:29.580
of Cinta Street represents
reappears in Jaime Bunda,

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:34.370
Secret Agent as a false conspiracy
that Jaime conceives in order

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.470
to deliver some results
to his bosses

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.200 position:56%
when he fails at solving the murder.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.560
He stages a raid on a made-up
drug ring, but to his surprise,

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.900
discovers in the process actual
criminals, who are scheming

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:51.820
to exchange counterfeit
Angolan kwanzas for US dollars.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.340
You're a genius, Shinito.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.880
You're go far in the service,
his partner tells him,

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.630
after Jaime reveals the plot.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:03.140 position:56%
Jaime's genius, and his invention of
stories, differs only in the details

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.360
from the crime he actually
discovers.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.750
The narrative structure
is more or less the same.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.640
On the one hand, this
conclusion certainly points

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.640
to Pepetela's critique of
corrupt public officials.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.830
Jaime invents a story
that brings him success,

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.280
but the social milieu is so
replete with crimes that he ends

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.970 position:56%
up solving an accidental one anyway.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:29.190
On the other hand, however,
as readers, we're called upon

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.790
to recognize another
kind of counterfeit.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:34.950
Just like the readers of
the 19th century novel.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:38.430
And explicitly attributing the
sources of Jaime Bunda's style

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:42.790 position:56%
of investigation to English language
sources, the Portuguese origins

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:45.450
of the satire are obscured.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.340
I think that this mapping
together of the acknowledged

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:51.910
and unacknowledged sources
are crucial to the novel.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.540 position:56%
For the Portuguese novel, the
detective formula serves as a marker

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.570
of literary modernity that guides
the astute reader to figure

00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.300
out the hoax and the tricks
the uninformed reader,

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.880
who fails to perceive the clues.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.730
In the Angolan novel, the
history of the crime genre,

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:12.570 position:56%
referenced through-out the text,
has itself become the formulaic form

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:15.800
and style that is ultimately
insufficient.

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:19.090
At least as deployed
through Jaime Bunda's lens,

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.430
to grasp the complexity

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:23.790
of the Angolan society
in which it operates.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.650
In most crime fiction, the
reader is also the detective.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:31.450
And the economy of the text
provides the necessary clues

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:35.360
for both the detective and the
reader to follow the logic.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:40.380
While Jaime can apply the narrative
formula to his Luandan context,

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:45.160
the intimate integration of the
content and the style fall apart.

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.360
The layering of the two
English and Portuguese sources

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:53.160
of literary styles operates as
both a critique and a warning.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:58.270 position:56%
If the revolution sought to cast off
the vestiges of colonial occupation,

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.720
replacing Portuguese
political hegemony

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.750
with American cultural hegemony
leaves the fundamental colonial

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:07.000
formulas intact.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.850
The old and the new colonial
regimes float just above

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.380
and just below the
surface of Angolan reality.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.500
For Pepetela and for
Jaime Bunda's world,

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.810
the key to the crimes remain
illegible without both of them.

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.880
The second example
I'm going to discuss,

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.540
of a text that employs
techniques of disappointment,

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.850
is Cuban novelist Eliseo
Alberto's Caracol Beach.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.590
But I want to begin, however,
with a discussion of an image,

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.470
to which I'll return
at the end of the talk.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:38.940
And special thanks to Aroun Soud
[assumed spelling] for the image.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:44.980
Ah. This is missing
a -- there we go.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:48.150
Okay.

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:52.230 position:56%
Popular knowledge asserts that
Fidel Castro never appeared publicly

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:57.910
in anything other than military
fatigues between 1959 and 1994,

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:01.150
when he was famously
photographed in a guayabera.

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:04.860
His fatigues continued to be
Fidel's preferred public dress,

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:09.040
until he stepped down from
the presidency in 2006.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.240
In the days after his death, the
state newspaper Granma ran photos

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.250
of Fidel from throughout
his long political life.

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:19.880
Chatting with peasants and
schoolchildren, playing baseball,

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:24.010 position:56%
greeting world leaders, and speaking
from podiums, all the while dressed

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:27.670
in the military uniform that
provided him visual continuity

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.110
over the decades of his influence.

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:35.440
The cover page graphic from
the November 27 issue, a black

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:40.020
and white stylized image of
dozens of identical armed Fidels,

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.820
emphasizes both the saturation
of images of the iconic leader,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.430 position:56%
and communicates the idea of the
soldier cum everyman in the headline

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.280
that accompanies the image.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.870
Cuba is Fidel.

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:55.620
Depending on the viewer's
visual, rhetorical

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.480
or political vantage point, the
graphics suggest an audience

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:02.150
which is incorporated
into the multitude,

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:05.960
replicating Fidel's march toward
the future of the revolution.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.620
Or, alternately, viewers
faced with an army

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:11.700
of infinitely reproducing
opposing forces,

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.790
perhaps even about to be overcome.

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:17.450
The starkly divisive
implications of the black

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:21.050
and white graphic encapsulate
one of the ways in which authors

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:23.390
such as Eliseo Alberto reflect

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.300
on the revolution's
rhetorical inheritances,

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.450
where the neat partitions
of the Cuban community seem

00:31:29.450 --> 00:31:31.830
to themselves divide and multiply,

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:35.530
producing dozens of
different iterations.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.130
We'll come back to this image.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:43.670
Eliseo Alberto's 1998 novel Caracol
Beach explores the profound impacts

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:48.790
of what the author sees as a Cuban
community divided against itself.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:53.520
The Cuban revolution's saturation
of images, slogans and language

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.860
of militarization and Manichean
divides is one of the effects

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:01.720
of a national leadership that saw
itself as under constant threat,

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.260
or even attack, by larger
forces of imperialism,

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.460
usually the United States, that
threatened to undo the course

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:11.120
of its history since 1959.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.160 position:56%
Or even to annihilate it altogether.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.200
Alberto's novel addresses the
extension of the sense of threat

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.040
from without through
reference to two phenomena

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.620
that mark the configuration
of the Cuban community

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.070
in the latter decades
of the 20th century.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.740
The internationalist missions
abroad, ostensibly extensions

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.720
of revolutionary fervor and
solidarity on foreign ground,

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.200
and the divisions among
the Cuban community,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.730 position:56%
especially as imposed through exile.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:46.180
In Caracol Beach, the protagonist,
Beto Milanes, a Cuban soldier

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.790
in the Angolan war,
is the sole survivor

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.320
after his company is ambushed.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.400
Convinced that he has betrayed
his country after he's rescued

00:32:54.400 --> 00:33:00.000
by American forces, Beto chooses
17 years of isolation and exile

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.490
over facing what he is sure
will be punishment back in Cuba.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:09.070
Beto sees suicide as the only
way to rid himself of the madness

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.940
that haunts him after the war,

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.680
symbolized in a winged tiger
that follows him around.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:18.490
He kidnaps three teenagers to
assist him in his death wish,

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.430
forcing two of them to commit
increasingly violent acts

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:25.450
against strangers, and
ultimately these two die with him

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:29.210
in absurd accidents at
the end of the novel.

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:32.970
So, my argument here is that this
novel critiques the reproduction

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:37.430
of violence, focusing on how
media images of Cuba at war result

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:41.830
in a system that passes real
violence along a chain of actors.

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:43.810
Including the violence
of a community divided

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:46.130
between the island and exile.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.780
Beyond its critique, however,

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.060
Alberto's novel also
calls for a kind of truce.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.150
Looking to Afro-Cuban
ritual as a counterpoint

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.960
to bring the many divided factions

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:59.040
of the Cuban community
toward reconciliation.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:04.620
Eliseo Albert de Diego Garcia
Marruz, another long name,

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.400
is part of one of the most
prominent intellectual families

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:12.020
of 20th century Cuba, and was
an eclectic and prolific writer.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.610
He established his
reputation in journalism,

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:17.490
film and eventually
television script writing,

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:21.360
and published chronicles,
essays, poetry and novels.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:27.750
He moved to Mexico in 1988, and
despite many attempts to return,

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:32.940
was only able to return to Cuba
in 2010, a year before he died.

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:34.240
The breadth of his area

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.830
of production are evident
particularly in his novels.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.040
In addition to a vast array of
cultural reference points drawn

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.310
from music, literature and film,
Caracol Beach frequently lapses

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:49.000
into extradiagetic
commentary that reads at times

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.330 position:56%
like a film voiceover, stage
directions, or director's commentary

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.900
on the action taking
place in the background.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:00.000
Beyond a quirk of the individual
author's range of talents

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.670
and interests, however, I think

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:04.870
that this technique points
to a broader context.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.820
Alberto was a young child
when the revolution triumphed,

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.210
and was educated and came

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.900
of age during its first
two turbulent decades.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.060
The cinematic texture of
the novel thus also signals

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:20.480
to its readers a history of the
ongoing participatory construction

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:26.310 position:56%
of the revolution and its lived
realities via visual representation.

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.800
Critic Lillian Guerra has analyzed
the revolution's construction

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:34.220
in media via what she
called a hyperreal futurity.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.670
She focuses on television,
photography and films portrayal

00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:40.850
of social mechanisms,
like mass rallies,

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:44.350
voluntary labor, and
military service.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:48.280
In post-modern theory and media
studies, the hyperreal refers

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:52.150
to a displacement or
disappearance of external reality,

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.970
in favor of a reality
experienced through simulation,

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:58.650
image and representation.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:00.510
Guerra explains.

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.530
Critical to explaining the
imagery's importance to struggles

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:07.100
over the grand narrative
is the idea that images --

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.080 position:56%
photographic, imaginary, personal --

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.800
played a central role in placing
Cubans outside the mundane

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:15.360
circumstances of their daily lives,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.890
and into the hyperreality
of the revolution.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:23.350
That is, a utopia caught
in the process of becoming.

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:27.030
Like hyperreal spaces in
any society, hyperrealities

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.240
of State-orchestrated mass rallies

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:33.440
and routinized volunteer labor
projects convinced participants

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.280
that the euphoria, the
happiness, the sense of justice,

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.300
the pride of unity and
self-righteousness,

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:44.190
that the experience generated,
were emblematic of reality.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:46.850
That is, the rest of
the society external

00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:49.260
to the hyperreal experience.

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:53.600
One authenticated the other, even
though they were not the same.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.840
That authentication
showed that the values

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.950
of the hyperreal experience
should not be contested.

00:36:59.950 --> 00:37:01.250
End quote.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:06.970
In Caracol Beach, the vestiges of
the revolutionary hyperreality show

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:10.210
up most frequently in the
soldier's flashbacks and memories

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.130
of his experience in Angola.

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:16.840
But lose their integration
with his present reality.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.310
In the novel's present,
the soldier's kidnapping

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:23.580
of the teenagers holding one
named Laura hostage calls

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.410
up the familiar Hollywood
cinematic plot convention

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:27.870
of the woman in peril.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:31.520
Perhaps even a direct reference,
a possibility that just occurred

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.630
to me a few weeks ago, to the
classic 1944 noir film Laura,

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:40.240
who many of us saw together.

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.930
However, the predominating
references are

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:45.430
to the genre of war ethic.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.560
Connected explicitly
to the war in Angola.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:52.210
The surprise ambush that kills
Beto's fellow soldiers is a kind

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:56.580
of twisted, negative incarnation of
the war films that Beto is trained

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.990
with in advance of his deployment.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:02.100 position:56%
Specifically, Soviet war propaganda.

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.550
While his disillusionment and
even madness caused by the loss

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.350
of his companions and his
homeland are foreshadowed

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:13.260
in his frequent references to
Akira Kurasawa's Seven Samurai.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.120
While I won't have
time today to analyze

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:17.850
in detail the specific film
references in the novel,

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:20.350
I do want to examine
the place in the novel

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:23.410
of media representation
of violence in general.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:27.080
The difference between
cinematic scripting

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.720
and the soldier's lived reality
remains the underlying conflict

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.000
for the character's experience.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.120
As he recounts in his soldier's
diary, quote, what's happening is

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:40.090
that nothing is happening.

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:42.370
In training, back in Cuba,
they showed us movies

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:46.400
about the Great Patriotic War, and
naturally the defense of Leningrad

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:50.960
that lasted months and months was
condensed into two hours, in color,

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.580
with music in the background.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.380
And so, the battles were exciting.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.470
But in real life, you will learn
that wars are full of dead time.

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.710
Routine. The worse boredom.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:02.580
You dig trenches and fill
them in, climb a tree,

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.870
get water from the river, and
you don't see shooting anywhere.

00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:09.180
Or you hear it like thunder in
a rainstorm falling in hell,

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.420
until I guess the day
comes when it's your turn

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.160
to get wet in a shower of lead.

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.760
And others see our lightning in
the distance, while they're digging

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.730
and filling their trenches.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:21.520
Poundcake says we really
are seven samurai.

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:22.940
I'm the crazy one.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.390
Because just for a roof over
our head, and a few sardines,

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:30.240
we've come to defend the future of
a people we've never even heard of.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.960
End quote.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.660
Betos' epithet of the crazy one,
which recurs throughout the novel,

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:40.320
results in this case from
the gaps in his comprehension

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.950
between experience and image.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:47.450 position:56%
What defies logic for him results in
searching for a state of perception

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:52.050
that accommodates simultaneously
contradictory experience

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.540
and representation.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:58.720
Guerra discusses the case of Cuban
documentary filmmaker Nicolas

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.430 position:56%
Guillen Landrian [assumed spelling],
whose films throughout the 1960s

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:06.040
and 1970s were repeatedly
censored by the State.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.090
While the film maker was forcibly
interned in a mental asylum.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.870
Authorities argue that
his films were, quote,

00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:15.180
incoherent with the context.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.520
End quote.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:21.210
Here, Guerra points to a critical
intersection between State power

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:24.810
and the artist's power to create
the lived reality of the audience,

00:40:24.810 --> 00:40:28.090
via the hyperreal world of art.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:32.110 position:56%
Guerra's characterization of Guillen
Landrian casts the filmmaker's

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:36.220
madness as a result of
the failure of the artist

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.860
to accommodate the work of art

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.250
to the idealized experience
of the people.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.710
Being out of coherence with
the context is equivalent

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.810
to being out of one's mind.

00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:52.290
Beto's madness is certainly a
result of being out of context.

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:55.250
He believes himself to be
a failed revolutionary.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:59.170
Since he survived the attack that
killed his entire fellow company.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:02.880
And is literally out of context
by living in exile in the land

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:05.710
of the enemy, the United States.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:09.770
His solution, however, rather
than a challenge to State power,

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:13.060
is to restore his proper
cinematic ending.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:17.110
By scripting his own death to
comply with the cinematic trope

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:22.490
of the revolutionary soldier who
sacrifices himself to the cause.

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:26.110
He describes the scene in
a letter to his rescuer.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:30.040
Quote. Watch for any carelessness
on my part and shoot me.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.470
Bring your son.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.800
The boy will witness a wonderful
scene, like in the movies.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.620
I'll fall on the sand,
in slow motion.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:38.920
Background music.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.220
A harmonica.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.690
The sand will gradually
turn red with blood.

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:44.080
Don't turn my body over.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.860
Leave me like that, with
my arms out stretched.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.510
A fistful of sand in my right hand,

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:53.320
the fingers of my right
hand spread open in a fan.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.130
Fabulous. Bring your son.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:57.090
End quote.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:58.390
So, this is a trope.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:03.230
Here, I just have three apologies
for the poor quality screenshots

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:08.540
from Cuban films, roughly
contemporary to Alberto's career.

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:12.110
Two of them, Caravanna and
Cangamba, are films about Angola.

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.870
But this appears everywhere.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.610
You guys have all seen it.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:18.430
The details that the soldier
mentions, the background music,

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:22.060
the slow spreading of the blood,
the position of the hands.

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.360
Even the perspective

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.660
of the spectators fulfill
the cinematic particulars

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:30.060
that we're missing among
the tedium and the boredom

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:33.000
of his dead time in real combat.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.310
They produce, via simulated image,
the sacrifice that would allow him

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:41.430
to comply with the projected course
of the revolutionary soldier.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:45.580
But, more importantly, however,
their cinematic staging transmits

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.310
that message of sacrifice
to the spectators.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:53.300
Those spectators he has built
into his own staging of the scene.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.390
Bring your son.

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:59.780
The ultimate danger of the kind of
aestheticized and scripted violence

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:04.200
that the soldier imagines is
not just his individual suicide.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.850
But the reproducibility, and
then the actual reproduction,

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:11.250
of the violent scene,
resulting, Alberto warns,

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.080
in a kind of collective
annihilation.

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.100
The wartime violence also
serves, crucially in the novel,

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:22.550
as a metaphor for the reproduction
of violence on the Cuban community.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.000
Politically motivated divisions
on the island and, of course,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.720
the fundamental violence of exile.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.010
Virtually the entire novel
takes place on foreign ground.

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:34.550
Either Angola or Florida.

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:38.530
The conflict between hyperreality
and lived experience culminate

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:41.020
in Beto's final climactic
performance.

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:42.940
His actual death.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.650
But one that does not comply
with the cinematic end

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:47.740
that he's imagined for himself.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:52.630
It turns into, rather, a ritual
about space, where the damaged,

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:56.640
the exiled, and the
mad can find release.

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:00.860
In Beto's final act, expecting
to be shot by police officers

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.130
who have come to rescue
the teenagers,

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:06.040
he discovers at moment
of his death that he is

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.000
accompanied by Jamaiya [assumed
spelling], the Orisha or the saint

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.370
or spirit in Cuban santeria,

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:15.270
who represents both
maternity and waters.

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:19.150
That substance that connects Cuba
to Africa, as well as the island

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:21.770
to its exile communities.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:26.400
But Jamaiya is not the first
orisha that Beto invokes.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.930 position:56%
Giving up the resisting his madness,

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.900
he calls up Babalu Aiye [assumed
spelling], the saint syncretized

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:35.020
with the Catholic saint Lazarus.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.670
Who both causes and cures illness.

00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:42.260
The ritual practice serves
here as a counter point

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.940
to the revolution's
mediatic representation.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.970
And it also recalls a
prior historical moment

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:52.970
of entangled African and Caribbean
histories, the slave trade

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:56.540
that brought these religious
practices to the Caribbean.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:45:01.000
Dreaming of his return to Cuba, and
his promise to honor Babalu Aiye

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.420
if his wish is granted,
Beto imagines himself

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.800
as a part of the a procession.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.920
Quote, at a certain distance.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.140 position:56%
Quiet, respectful, loyal, patriotic.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.220
Thousands of Cubans
in solemn procession.

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.910
Men and women, young and old,
sinners and penitents, vagabonds,

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:23.120
lepers, the maimed, the Mongoloid,
the lame, the blind, the mute,

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.490
the half-witted, the diabetic,
the desperate, the disabled,

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:30.330
the one-eyed, the tubercular, the
deaf, the moronic, the paralytic,

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:33.690
the hand-less, the tongue-tied,
the weak-hearted, the hopeless,

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:37.700
the asthmatic, the AIDS-infected,
the paranoid, the solitary,

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:41.940
the melancholic, the
neurotic, the mad, mad, mad.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:47.020
Hundreds of the poor madmen, some
incurable, like him, Beto Milanes.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.840
End quote.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:51.910
In its repetitive rhythms
and syntax,

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:55.760
this passage performs the
processions in which devotees

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.380
to Babalu Aiye participate
each 16th of December.

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:03.630
Some of them crawling with
stones tied to their ankles,

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:06.780
or otherwise simulating
disease or disfigurement,

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.300
to honor the Orisha
and ask for healing.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:15.110
So, what I want to do here is offer
this passage as a counterpoint

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.610
to the image with which
I began the section,

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:20.630
of infinitely replicating Fidels.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.310
Rather than reproducing
the model revolutionary,

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.670
Alberto here is using the novel

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:29.890
as a space the ritually acknowledge
those figures whose representations

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:33.460
fall outside of the
hyperreality of the revolution.

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:35.830
As well as to call for
bridging the divides

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:39.630
that separate the Cuban
community from itself.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:43.730
This, I believe, is the function
of the layering together of film

00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:47.440
and other media with
the form of the novel.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.440
And here, I'd like to return
to that idea of disappointment.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.560
So, this is my conclusion.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.390
The techniques that
I've analyzed with both

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:59.660 position:56%
of those novels use citation in part
as a way of insisting on the place

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:03.490
of art, and specifically of
literature, as a privileged place

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:06.400
to negotiate both the
possibilities imagined as part

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:09.370
of revolutionary fervor,
and to bridge the divides

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.900
between those hopes and
the difficult realities

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.420
that many Angolans and Cubans live

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:16.710
in the later decades
of the 20th century.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:20.630 position:56%
I've tried to show not only that
authors from different places engage

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:23.600
in similar literary
techniques, but that Cuba

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.660
and Angola's mutually
imbricated left overs

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.290
of enmeshed Cold War-era ideologies

00:47:29.290 --> 00:47:33.490
and post-colonial geopolitics
continue to be visible

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:38.450 position:56%
through the very forms of the novels
that contemporary writers produce.

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:40.480
As I hope we've seen, the notion

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.510
of disappointment certainly
encompasses critique.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:47.180
But it does not remain solely
in the realm of the negative.

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:51.040
Techniques of disappointment also
constitute, in cases especially

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.900
such as the Alberto novel,
an ethical re-engagement

00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.410
with the politics and
promises associated

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:59.910
with the early years of revolution.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:03.780 position:56%
Considering texts like this together
also reveals their similar turn

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:07.760
to the potential of literature
itself, as both an expression

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:10.630
of the negotiations that
make art a site of healing

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:14.410
and rebuilding community,
in both Cuba and Angola.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:17.170
The revolutions live
on in literature.

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.970
Thanks.

00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:25.420
[ Applause ]

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.720
&gt;&gt; Ted Widmer: We have
time for some questions.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:31.000
And if you wouldn't mind
repeating it, so it's captured?

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.360
&gt;&gt; Lanie Millar: Thanks
so much, Shannon.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:49.850
So, just to repeat the
questions, the first one was

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:55.080
about the critic I cited, Lillian
Guerra, and her use of the image

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.770
to generate a sort of mass affect.

00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:59.050
And that's relationship to Leotard,

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:01.950
the theorist that I
cited at the beginning.

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:05.090
And then the second
question, about this passage,

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:08.210
of listing all the deformities,
and how that might be,

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:11.360
provide a different kind of model
of revolutionary collective.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.740
So, thank you so much
for the questions.

00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.310
They're both wonderful questions.

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:19.900
I think that you are absolutely
spot-on in the relationship

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:24.330 position:56%
between the mediatic construction of
hyperreality that Guerra describes,

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:30.340
and the possibilities that Leotard
opens with other possible ways

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.420
of generating enthusiasm.

00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:36.660
Of course, Leotard is one
of the theorists of sort of,

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:40.240
post-modern moment,
and the use of image,

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.390
and I think that you have pointed
to an excellent way in which

00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:48.690
that could be deployed
to describe why his idea

00:49:48.690 --> 00:49:52.810
of revolutionary enthusiasm
is different from Kant's.

00:49:52.810 --> 00:49:55.700
And so, for Kant, I think
it is absolutely predicated

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.450
on the physical presence and
participation and observation

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:01.520
of the revolutionary action.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.060 position:56%
And your question is making me
think, if maybe Leotard is proposing

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:09.080
that there's another kind of
observation that's mediated,

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.350
that might be able to produce
that kind of enthusiasm as well.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:16.740
So, Guerra mention, for example,
the difference between going

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:20.800
to a mass rally, when you can't
really perceive the size and scale

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.510
and sort of impact
on the, on the space.

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:27.710
And then, seeing it on
television, where you think,

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:30.050
I was one of those
hundreds of thousands

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:31.700
or millions of people there.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.460
And so, that might be one way to
begin to approach those things.

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:36.760
And so, thank you for that.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.060
I'm going to think
about that further.

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:42.090
The second question, I think
you're absolutely correct as well.

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:44.610
And so, I like your
suggestion of a different model

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:47.120
of revolutionary collective.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:51.970
So, there are a number of artists
and writers who would think

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:54.880
of themselves, or whom the
critics have labeled dissident.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:58.390
And I don't think that Eliseo
Alberto is one of those.

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:02.470
He's a member of a community that
always insisted on his right,

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:05.400
and his desire, to return to Cuba.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:10.470
And he, interestingly, had several
obituaries as well as publications

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:13.420
that came out posthumously, in
Cuba, which would not have happened

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.510
with some earlier generations
of exiles.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:21.540
And so, I think that that model
of bridging various aspects

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.770
of the community, and not
allowing exile to become a cutting

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:29.280
of from the revolutionary
action is going to be key.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.740
Yeah. Thank you.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:33.040
Matthew?

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:38.370
That's a really excellent question.

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:40.890
So, just to sort of
outline the question.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:44.470
Matthew is talking about the
sort the triumphant narrative

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:47.280
of Cuba's participation
in a war that neither

00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.540
of the superpowers was
interested in getting involved

00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.590
with until they were forced to.

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:54.560
And what the Angolans
might think of that.

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.080
I don't have a complete
answer to that question.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.830
That's one of the questions
that I'm trying to answer.

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:03.520
The official position from
Angola is absolutely one

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.980
of solidarity, friendship,
gratitude.

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.960 position:56%
So, in 2013, the Cuban international
book festival was dedicated

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:13.260
to Angola.

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:14.650
That was their special
invited country.

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:16.910
They have a special
invited country every year.

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:20.630
And they did all of these
translations of Angolan literature.

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:24.340
Most of the translators that I
talked to had served in Angola

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.680
in some capacity, and that
was how they knew Portuguese.

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.420
And every single one of the Angolan
writers who attended would start

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.620
of speaking by saying, I
want to express my thanks

00:52:35.620 --> 00:52:37.380
and solidarity with
the Cuban people.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.490
Thank you for what you
did for our country.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:42.370
But notably, several
authors were not there.

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:44.760
And the authors that
tended not to be there,

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:49.110
the most prominent one was
the young writer Onde Jacque

00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:50.410
[assumed spelling].

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:56.230 position:56%
Are authors who have, in some cases,
expressed a more nuanced perception

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:58.570
of Cuba's presence in Angola.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:02.900
Not as a critical presence
necessarily,

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:07.530
although there's one ethnography
that interviewed Angolans

00:53:07.530 --> 00:53:09.590 position:56%
that calls them the good colonizers.

00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:12.450
I don't imagine that that
sentiment is widespread,

00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:13.750
but I don't actually know.

00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:17.610
And so, sort of that gap
between the official position

00:53:17.610 --> 00:53:20.710
and what people talk about
among themselves is one

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:22.490
of the questions I don't
have an answer to yet.

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:24.850
And I really, really
want to find out.

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:30.530
Thanks. Thank you so, so
much for that comment.

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:33.790
From an actual Kant scholar.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:37.550
Or, somebody who knows Kant
better then I do, I think.

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:40.540
I really like your, your sort

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.040
of touching a sublime
that can never last.

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:44.970
Because, of course, the
notion of the sublime is

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:48.110
that it couldn't be
cognicized, right?

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:52.840
So there's a necessary search
for some kind of concept or form

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:54.630
that will allow us to discuss that.

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:57.950
But of course the paradox is
that that moment is then lost

00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:59.630
by putting it into a form.

00:53:59.630 --> 00:54:03.930
So, I appreciate, I
appreciate the commentary.

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:10.110
Yeah. And that's really helpful
also, because there is, of course,

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:14.110
an extensive body of theory that
looks at revolutionary theory

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:16.360
and its connections
to Catholic theology.

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.390
And the sort of messianic
figure of the revolutionary.

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:22.530
Thank you.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:25.380
Okay. Mary Lou?

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:27.160
Yeah. That's a really, so, sorry.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:29.980
The comment is about Shaddon's
[assumed spelling] work

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:33.740
on the seduction of the
colonized by the colonizer.

00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:39.280 position:56%
And its relationship, maybe, to this
relationship between two nations

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:43.190
who see themselves
as colonized people.

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:44.910
I think that's a really
excellent point.

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:47.980
And in fact, there's a
long history of theorizing,

00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:50.460
particularly in the
Portuguese context,

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.930
that the Portuguese were
the exceptional colonizers,

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:55.180 position:56%
because they seduced their colonies.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:57.790
They didn't conquer
their colonies violently.

00:54:57.790 --> 00:55:00.070
And so, I think, actually,
part of the image

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:05.850
of the violent revolutionary is a
deliberate mechanism to counteract

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:08.080
that ideology of seduction.

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.170
So, violence becomes sort
of rarefied and celebrated

00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:14.350
as this possibility of
resistance against a colonizer

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:18.370
that did not seduce but in
fact violently conquered

00:55:18.370 --> 00:55:20.610
and oppressed the people

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:23.600
on whom this supposed
seduction is being enacted.

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:28.700 position:56%
And so, I think that's an
excellent sort of comparison to make

00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.010
about sort of the circulation
of the opposition

00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:32.310
to that kind of seduction.

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:33.610
Thank you.

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:38.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ted Wimer: All right, everyone
please join me in giving our thanks.
