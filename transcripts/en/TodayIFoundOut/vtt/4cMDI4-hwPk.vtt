00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:14.250
the “night parrot”, is often described
by ornithologists as being the most mysterious

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.270
and enigmatic bird on Earth- a moniker the
night parrot earned by being so rare and elusive

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.840
that fewer people alive today have seen one
with their own eyes than have ever walked

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.230
on the Moon.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.869
Described bluntly by one of the few people
to have handled one as a “dumpy oversized

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.550
budgie”, the unassuming greenish-yellow
bird is endemic to Australia, with confirmed

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.440
sightings largely being limited to the deserts
of Western Australia and Queensland.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.160
Unusually for a bird that is capable of lengthy
and extremely fast flight, the night parrot

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.310
spends much of its time on the ground hiding
amongst the brush and shrubland of the Australian

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.730
outback, making the species one of only three
known “ground parrots” as they’re commonly

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.730
known.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.490
That said, a very recent tagging of one of
these birds which provided GPS data for the

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.009
animal for 15 days demonstrated that, as mentioned,
the night parrot can cover a lot of ground

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.200
very quickly, with the shortest distance the
tracked bird flew in one night being approximately

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.909
40 kilometres (about 24 miles).

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.649
As for this travel, it would seem the purpose
behind it is generally to find water.

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.920
Its food, on the other hand, is speculated
to be things likes the seeds of Triodia grasses

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.229
that it likes to hide in.

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.170
Speaking of its nocturnal movements, as you
may have guessed given the night parrot’s

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.070
name, the bird is described as being a mostly
nocturnal creature, generally hiding in tall

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.139
foliage during the day, with their coloring
patterns blending in well with such shrubbery.

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:40.240
First “discovered” in 1845 by members
of an expedition trying to find a “mythical

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.359
sea” that supposedly existed somewhere in
the heart of Australia (an amazing story we’ll

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:49.889
no doubt cover another day), the bird was
seemingly quite common at the time, with over

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:52.600
a dozen specimens being easily collected in
the 1870s alone.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.930
In fact, the indigenous Maiawali people are
known to have once made extensive use of the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.810
night parrot’s feathers for ceremonial clothing.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.020
For reasons experts can’t quite agree on
though, around the turn of 20th century the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.940
bird almost completely disappeared, with the
last live specimen caught in that century

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.720
being captured sometime in 1912.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.190
As to where the bird went, it’s speculated
it was simply displaced by humans or perhaps

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.290
hunted to near extinction by feral and domestic
cats, but nobody really knows.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.750
In fact, there have been some who have speculated
that perhaps the bird isn’t endangered at

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.720
all; it’s just extremely good at hiding.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.420
That said, after that 1912 capture of a live
specimen, while amateur bird watchers sporadically

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.920
claimed sightings of the parrot, as the century
stretched on with no well documented sightings

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.200
occurring despite many pro bird-nerds conducting
extensive searches, many experts began to

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.640
write-off the bird as being extinct.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.960
Not willing to accept this, in 1989 Australian
businessman, entrepreneur, and conservationist

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:56.950
Dick Smith offered a $25,000 reward to anyone
who could provide proof that the bird was

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:57.950
still out there somewhere.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.390
A year later, this proof was found almost
entirely by accident when three ornithologists

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.120
decided to randomly pull over to pee while
driving through south-west Queensland.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.700
During their little wizz break, they stumbled
upon a dead night parrot by the side of the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.700
road.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.270
As if that wasn’t fortunate enough, it’s
noted that the only reason the ornithologists

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.150
were even able to identify the bird at all
is because two of them just so happened to

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.060
be “among a handful of people in the world
to have handled stuffed night parrots”.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.270
Dick Smith dutifully paid the men the reward
money (which they in turn donated to the university

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.030
they all worked for) and Australia’s ornithologists
once again began searching for the night parrot

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.030
with vigor.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.190
The next reasonably well documented sighting
occurred in 2005 when a pair of biologists

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.520
claim to have spotted not one, but three night
parrots while the scientists were studying

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.800
a region for potential iron ore mining.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.250
A much better documented sighting occurred
in 2006 when another specimen was found dead

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.780
by a park ranger, Robert Cupitt, working in
Diamantina National Park.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.750
Oddly, this bird was found without a head,
seemingly flying into a barbed wire fence

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.500
at high speed and, it is generally thought,
decapitating itself.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.550
However, a search for the bird’s head proved
fruitless, and it is possible the bird simply

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.250
had its head eaten off by some wild animal
or it was otherwise eaten after it was removed

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.270
by the fence wire.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.270
Whatever the case, after several more years
of nothing but unsubstantiated reports of

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.289
the night parrot from enthusiastic bird watchers,
wildlife photographer and ornithologist John

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:24.499
Young became the first human in over a century
to definitely have seen a living night parrot

00:04:24.499 --> 00:04:26.849
when he managed to snap a photo of one in
2013.

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:33.370
By his own estimation, Young spent some 15
years and around 17,000 hours searching for

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.830
the bird in the Australian outback, eventually
managing to get a handful of photos of one,

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.570
a few seconds of footage of it in flight,
and sound recordings of its call.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.870
(For the curious, the night parrot is variously
described as sounding like everything from

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.979
a bell going “ding ding” to a croaking
frog.)

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.900
Since 2013, several more confirmed sightings
of live night parrots have been recorded with

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.529
an ecologist called Dr Steve Murphy even managing
to capture one and tag it for study in 2015.

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.349
Murphy caught the bird (which he affectionately
called Pedro) with the help of his wife Rachel,

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.460
but refused to divulge where exactly Pedro
was spotted except to a select few, including

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.740
fellow ecologists, ornithologists and academics.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.919
(You can see a picture of the night parrot
here.)

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.689
Seemingly the information must also have been
divulged to some politicians, because to protect

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:22.490
Pedro and his kin, the Pullen Pullen Reserve
was established consisting of some 56,000

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.110
hectares of land in Queensland around the
area Murphy found him.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.810
However, the exact location of the reserve
has never been publicly released because of

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.809
course Australia has empty areas of land so
vast that they can reserve approximately 140,000

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:42.909
acres (560 kilometres squared) for wildlife
without needing to tell the public where it

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.999
is.

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.690
The night parrot is considered to be at great
risk of predation from feral cats and as a

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.129
result, the Pullen Pullen Reserve has a number
of special traps designed specifically to

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.330
targets cats and nothing else.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.680
These traps use cameras and a proprietary
algorithm to detect cats based on their gait

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.759
and size, at which point a toxic gel is sprayed
at the animal’s face.

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:19.389
The idea being that when the cat grooms itself,
it will ingest the gel 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.749
and die.

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:45.699
We are not making that up.
