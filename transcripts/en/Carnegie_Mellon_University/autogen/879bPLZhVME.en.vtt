course the spring in the HCI and we're
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.419
course the spring in the HCI and we're
very excited about it because it's being

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429
very excited about it because it's being
 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.470

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.099
ipad apps and a professor whose research
focuses on how people interact with

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109
focuses on how people interact with
 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.800
focuses on how people interact with
information and new ways for people to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
information and new ways for people to
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.870
information and new ways for people to
interact with information so I'm really

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
interact with information so I'm really
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880
interact with information so I'm really
excited about this course because it

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
excited about this course because it
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.189
excited about this course because it
combines cutting-edge development on the

from human computer interaction so the

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
from human computer interaction so the
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.500
from human computer interaction so the
idea is that we can help students with

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
idea is that we can help students with
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.630
idea is that we can help students with
not just understanding how to program

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640
not just understanding how to program
 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.430
not just understanding how to program
but this is deciding what they can

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
but this is deciding what they can
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.670
but this is deciding what they can
program so how can they take information

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
program so how can they take information
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.560
program so how can they take information
and turn it into knowledge and insight

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570
and turn it into knowledge and insight
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.830
and turn it into knowledge and insight
to do that through ipad maps we really

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
to do that through ipad maps we really
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.439
to do that through ipad maps we really
hope to bridge HCI theory with software

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449
hope to bridge HCI theory with software
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.099
hope to bridge HCI theory with software
engineering practice and introduce

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109
engineering practice and introduce
 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.900
engineering practice and introduce
students to wide variety of techniques

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910
students to wide variety of techniques
 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930
students to wide variety of techniques
for data visualization and then show

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940
for data visualization and then show
 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670
for data visualization and then show
them how to put those techniques into

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
them how to put those techniques into
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.640
them how to put those techniques into
practice and make great apps that that

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
practice and make great apps that that
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.620
practice and make great apps that that
use them right now we have students from

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630
use them right now we have students from
 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.340
use them right now we have students from
all over the school who are involved and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
all over the school who are involved and
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.160
all over the school who are involved and
interested so from computer science to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170
interested so from computer science to
 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.310
interested so from computer science to
human computer interaction to design to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
human computer interaction to design to
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.469
human computer interaction to design to
electrical engineering and I think this

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
electrical engineering and I think this
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.929
electrical engineering and I think this
is just a really popular area we're

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939
is just a really popular area we're
 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.609
is just a really popular area we're
interacting with information in a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
interacting with information in a
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890
interacting with information in a
completely different way now we can kind

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
completely different way now we can kind
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.749
completely different way now we can kind
of hold it in our hands and sit back

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759
of hold it in our hands and sit back
 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969
of hold it in our hands and sit back
with it we can access it from anywhere

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
with it we can access it from anywhere
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.219
with it we can access it from anywhere
and I think it's making students really

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
and I think it's making students really
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.560
and I think it's making students really
interested in that you know in the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
interested in that you know in the
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.359
interested in that you know in the
classroom we can deal with maybe 30

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
classroom we can deal with maybe 30
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.050
classroom we can deal with maybe 30
students maybe 60 students but by

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
students maybe 60 students but by
 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.210
students maybe 60 students but by
putting it on iTunes U I think it's this

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
putting it on iTunes U I think it's this
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.920
putting it on iTunes U I think it's this
great opportunity for many many more

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
great opportunity for many many more
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.020
great opportunity for many many more
people to access and learn from that

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
people to access and learn from that
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.240
people to access and learn from that
