00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.240
 
should we go to the moon or should we go

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250
should we go to the moon or should we go
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.130
should we go to the moon or should we go
to Mars we should go to both but I guess

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140
to Mars we should go to both but I guess
 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.349
to Mars we should go to both but I guess
the real question is where do we go next

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359
the real question is where do we go next
 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.650
the real question is where do we go next
what's the next step and I think this

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660
what's the next step and I think this
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.270
what's the next step and I think this
goes back to the orbital perspective as

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280
goes back to the orbital perspective as
 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.999
goes back to the orbital perspective as
well I think the orbital perspective you

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
well I think the orbital perspective you
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.379
well I think the orbital perspective you
know the part of the ordinal perspective

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389
know the part of the ordinal perspective
 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.599
know the part of the ordinal perspective
that talks about long-term planning you

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
that talks about long-term planning you
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.120
that talks about long-term planning you
know let's look 20 30 40 50 years down

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
know let's look 20 30 40 50 years down
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.480
know let's look 20 30 40 50 years down
the road and see what affects our

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490
the road and see what affects our
 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.070
the road and see what affects our
decisions that we make today will take

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
decisions that we make today will take
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.290
decisions that we make today will take
us you know what trajectory will not put

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300
us you know what trajectory will not put
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.790
us you know what trajectory will not put
us on where will that get us in that

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
us on where will that get us in that
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.040
us on where will that get us in that
timeframe and so if we go to Mars first

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
timeframe and so if we go to Mars first
 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.170
timeframe and so if we go to Mars first
which we can do I say it was probably be

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
which we can do I say it was probably be
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.510
which we can do I say it was probably be
10 to 15 years from the time we make a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
10 to 15 years from the time we make a
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.400
10 to 15 years from the time we make a
decision to go to Mars we could probably

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
decision to go to Mars we could probably
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.470
decision to go to Mars we could probably
get to Mars and but by making a decision

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
get to Mars and but by making a decision
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.479
get to Mars and but by making a decision
that means we've allocated the necessary

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
that means we've allocated the necessary
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.560
that means we've allocated the necessary
funding etc etc but another path to Mars

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570
funding etc etc but another path to Mars
 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.540
funding etc etc but another path to Mars
would be to go to the moon first and by

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
would be to go to the moon first and by
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.580
would be to go to the moon first and by
going to the moon first and and what I

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
going to the moon first and and what I
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.680
going to the moon first and and what I
mean by that is by establishing a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
mean by that is by establishing a
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.200
mean by that is by establishing a
transfer transportation infrastructure

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210
transfer transportation infrastructure
 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.090
transfer transportation infrastructure
between the earth and the moon and a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
between the earth and the moon and a
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.180
between the earth and the moon and a
permanent human presence on the moon so

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
permanent human presence on the moon so
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.720
permanent human presence on the moon so
we have routine travel between Earth and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730
we have routine travel between Earth and
 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.050
we have routine travel between Earth and
its nearest neighbor by doing that that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
its nearest neighbor by doing that that
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.550
its nearest neighbor by doing that that
would open up the hole in the entire

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
would open up the hole in the entire
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.850
would open up the hole in the entire
solar system that enables us to use the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
solar system that enables us to use the
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.260
solar system that enables us to use the
resources that are on the moon it

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
resources that are on the moon it
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.300
resources that are on the moon it
enables us to launch in a much lower

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
enables us to launch in a much lower
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.859
enables us to launch in a much lower
gravity field than earth it opens up

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869
gravity field than earth it opens up
 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.999
gravity field than earth it opens up
tremendous benefits to the entire

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
tremendous benefits to the entire
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.820
tremendous benefits to the entire
population of the earth by making use of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
population of the earth by making use of
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.380
population of the earth by making use of
our nearest neighbor there's energy on

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
our nearest neighbor there's energy on
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149
our nearest neighbor there's energy on
the moon there's scientific discoveries

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
the moon there's scientific discoveries
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.399
the moon there's scientific discoveries
on the moon the list goes on and on all

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
on the moon the list goes on and on all
 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.260
on the moon the list goes on and on all
the benefits to earth that the moon

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
the benefits to earth that the moon
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.300
the benefits to earth that the moon
provides and so not only would we get

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
provides and so not only would we get
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.420
provides and so not only would we get
those benefits not only would we be able

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430
those benefits not only would we be able
 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.429
those benefits not only would we be able
to have this traffic infrastructure -

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439
to have this traffic infrastructure -
 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.499
to have this traffic infrastructure -
for routine travel to the earth on the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
for routine travel to the earth on the
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.969
for routine travel to the earth on the
moon but we'd open up the rest of the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979
moon but we'd open up the rest of the
 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.069
moon but we'd open up the rest of the
solar system including Mars so to me

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
solar system including Mars so to me
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.630
solar system including Mars so to me
from a long-term point of view it makes

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
from a long-term point of view it makes
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.109
from a long-term point of view it makes
sense to have the next step being to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119
sense to have the next step being to
 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.340
sense to have the next step being to
return to the moon this time to stay

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350
return to the moon this time to stay
 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.409
return to the moon this time to stay
