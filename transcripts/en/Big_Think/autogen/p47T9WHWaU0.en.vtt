Einsteins kind of appellation for the

Einsteins kind of appellation for the
 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.610
Einsteins kind of appellation for the
idea of nonlocality nonlocality is that

example I often give is two coins so you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
example I often give is two coins so you
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.990

can treat some of these particles as

having two possible outcomes of a
measurement and you can think of that as

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
measurement and you can think of that as
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.429
measurement and you can think of that as
heads or tails of a coin so you create

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439
heads or tails of a coin so you create
 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.080
heads or tails of a coin so you create
two of them you give one to your friend

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090

your friend goes off somewhere and you

you come up with heads they come up with

you can't decide is it heads or is it
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.590
you can't decide is it heads or is it
tails so you've got no way to manipulate

tails so you've got no way to manipulate
 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.569
tails so you've got no way to manipulate
the coin and thereby produce an outcome

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579

communicate you can't send a signal so
on the one hand the phenomena seems to

on the one hand the phenomena seems to
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.980
on the one hand the phenomena seems to
violate relativity theory but on the

coordinate their behavior even though
 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.540
coordinate their behavior even though
they're so far apart so there's a

they're so far apart so there's a
 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.820

particles were also like trick coins

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
particles were also like trick coins
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.470

that they were pre-programmed to land on

that they were pre-programmed to land on
 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.870
that they were pre-programmed to land on
one side or the other but in the 60s and

one side or the other but in the 60s and
 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.540
one side or the other but in the 60s and
70s that particular explanation was

70s that particular explanation was
 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.479
70s that particular explanation was
ruled out so the other possibility is

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489
ruled out so the other possibility is
 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.100
ruled out so the other possibility is
that there might be some kind of signal

that there might be some kind of signal
 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.630
that there might be some kind of signal
going between them but that seems to be

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640
going between them but that seems to be
 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.890
going between them but that seems to be
ruled out because you can do the

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900
ruled out because you can do the
 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.229
ruled out because you can do the
experiment kind of in synchrony you can

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239
experiment kind of in synchrony you can
 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.940
experiment kind of in synchrony you can
do it at the same time and yet the coins

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950
do it at the same time and yet the coins
 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.790
do it at the same time and yet the coins

can still act in court in a coordinated
way so you're kind of left with like

things in the universe seem to be

located far apart from one another they
 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.350

that expectation so it seems to indicate

that expectation so it seems to indicate
 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.400
that expectation so it seems to indicate
that space itself is somehow not
