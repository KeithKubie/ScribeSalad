00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.390
In the last video, using the
accrual basis for accounting,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.270
we had $200 of
income in month two.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:10.010
But over that same
month, we saw that we

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.550
went from having $100 in cash
to having negative $100 in cash.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.750
So we actually
lost $200 in cash.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.130
So how can we reconcile
the fact that it

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.230
looks like we made
$200 in income,

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.640
but we lost $200 in cash?

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.870
And that reconciliation is going
to be done with the cash flow

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:28.450
statement.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.695
So most cash flow
statements-- so I'm

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:32.820
going to do a cash flow
statement right over here--

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.240
so they'll start
with your net income.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.000
Or actually, they'll
start with the cash

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.130
that you started out with.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.920
So they take you from this cash
balance to that cash balance.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.355
So they'll say something
like starting cash.

00:00:44.355 --> 00:00:50.630
Starting cash we
know is at $100.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.130
And then they'll say, well, in
the most naive interpretation

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.830
of things, your net
income in theory

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.440
should be cash you're
getting or at least it's

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.370
some type of profit.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.130
You're getting some
assets in the door.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.000
Or at least you're
counting as if you're

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.800
getting some assets in the door.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.386
So then you have your net
income during the period.

00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:11.260
And here we'll literally
just take whatever's

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.350
reported from the
income statement.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.032
So over there, we
get $200 net income.

00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:18.990
And now, we have to do
the reconciliation part.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.310
Because if this was all
cash that you were getting,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.730
then you should have $300 in
cash at the end of the period,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.210
which we clearly don't have.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.770
So we have to
reconcile by looking

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.640
at the changes in different
things on the balance sheets.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.540
Over here, we have a net
change in accounts receivable.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.310
So we have an increase
in accounts receivable.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.130
So I'll call it AR Increase,
AR short for accounts

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.042
receivable just to
save some space.

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:45.250
So let's just think about it.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.080
When you have an increase
in accounts receivable,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.340
you're letting
people owe you money.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.920
You're letting
people owe you $400.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.960
If you didn't let them owe
you, that would have been cash.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.669
So you're kind of
pushing back the time

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:58.710
that you're getting cash.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.450
This is $400 that you
didn't get that maybe you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.790
could have gotten if you
didn't allow this person

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.860
to delay when they paid you.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.479
So an increase in
accounts receivables

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.780
is actually less cash than you
would have otherwise gotten.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.620
So this is negative
$400 for your cash flow.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.809
And we had no other changes.

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:21.600
I don't even address
accounts payable here.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.400
That's essentially
pushing back owing people,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.490
paying other people,
paying your vendors money.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.040
But I don't even address
that in the previous example.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.260
No other changes
in our liabilities.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.530
So this is the only
adjustment we make.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.950
And so if we do this--
and sometimes this

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.940
will be called a use of
cash or a subtraction from

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.730
or there's different
ways it can be phrased

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.690
in different contexts--
but over here,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.260
you'll have your net
cash from operations,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.390
cash from operations.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.530
I'll just say ops.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.230
And over here, you can
see, when you add it all,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.930
just the cash from
operations, $200 minus $400.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.130
So I'm just adding this
part right over here.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.560
You have negative $200.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.440
And so your starting
cash is $100.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.509
You have negative $200
cash from operations.

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.300
And this is what you
would have also gotten

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.300
if you had done cash accounting.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.160
You would have had negative
$200 cash from operations.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.890
And then if you start with
$100, you use $200 in cash,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.754
your ending cash will
be negative $100.

00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:27.670
So this little thing
that I just created here,

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.970
this little reconciliation
between the positive $200

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.780
in income and the
negative $200 of cash,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.610
and showing how we got from
this starting point in cash

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.720
to this ending point, this
is a cash flow statement.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.570
So you now know the three
major financial statements.
