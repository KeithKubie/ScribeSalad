00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170
Now as you'll remember from the last unit, just having a huge number of potential solutions

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.340
of course does not show that your problem is NP complete.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.300
But it can be an indicator if you cannot come up with any substantially better algorithm.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.200
Dave currently cannot come up with a substantially better algorithm,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.560
so he wonders could his problem of shortest tour also be NP-complete?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.730
That's why, together with Dave, we will now try to show that indeed

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.770
shortest tour is NP-complete.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.580
To do that we will go through these 2 standard steps here.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.880
First of all, we have to show that the problem of shortest tour is in NP.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.470
To do that, as you'll remember from the last time, we actually have to state this problem

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.470
as a decision problem. So here's our next quiz for you.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.160
How can Dave state his problem of shortest tour as a decision problem?

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.130
Given a graph with distances, what is the shortest tour?

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.090
That visits all vertices of course.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.070
The second option would be, given a graph with distances and a number d,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.650
is there a tour of length at most d?

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.670
Given the graph with distances, how long is the shortest tour?

00:01:04.670 --> 99:59:59.000
Please check the problem statement that states shortest tour as a decision problem.
