00:00:00.354 --> 00:00:02.180
- [Voiceover] In the last
video, we established that

00:00:02.017 --> 00:00:04.519
if we say the rate of
change of a population

00:00:04.681 --> 00:00:07.319
with respect to time is
going to be proportional

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.152
to the population, we were able to

00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:12.373
solve that differential equation,
find a general solution,

00:00:12.373 --> 00:00:13.910
which involves an exponential.

00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:16.827
That the population is going
to be equal to some constant

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:21.132
times e to some other
constant, times time.

00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:24.111
And in the last video we
assumed time was days.

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:27.300
So let's just apply
this, just to feel good

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.675
that we can truly model
population this way.

00:00:29.972 --> 00:00:31.500
So let's use it with
some concrete numbers.

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:33.254
Once again, you've
probably done that before.

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:36.097
You've probably started
with the assumption

00:00:36.097 --> 00:00:38.421
that you can model with
an exponential function,

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:41.532
and then you used some
information, some conditions,

00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:43.206
to figure out what the constants are.

00:00:43.206 --> 00:00:44.562
You probably did this earlier

00:00:44.562 --> 00:00:46.813
in pre-calculus or algebra class.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:49.181
Let's just do it again,
just so that we can feel

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:51.907
that this thing right over here is useful.

00:00:51.907 --> 00:00:53.755
So let's give you some information.

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:57.893
Let's say, that at time equals zero,

00:00:57.893 --> 00:01:02.893
the population is equal to 100 insects

00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:06.433
or whatever we're measuring
the population of.

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:11.433
And let's say that at time
equals 50, the population,

00:01:15.553 --> 00:01:20.553
so after 50 days, the
population is at 200.

00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:22.861
So notice it doubled after 50 days.

00:01:23.176 --> 00:01:27.278
So given this information,
can we solve for C and k?

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:28.691
I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:31.759
and try to work through it on your own.

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.764
So this first initial
condition's pretty straighforward

00:01:33.809 --> 00:01:36.905
to you, because when t is
equal to zero, P is 100.

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:41.905
So we could say, based on this
first piece of information,

00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:46.134
we could say that 100 must be equal to

00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:51.671
C times e to the k times zero.

00:01:56.531 --> 00:01:59.617
Well that's just going
to be e to the zero.

00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:02.073
Well e to the zero is just one.

00:02:02.073 --> 00:02:05.165
So this is just the same
thing as C times one,

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:07.242
and just like that we have
figured out what C is.

00:02:09.717 --> 00:02:11.743
We can now write that the population

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:16.968
is going to be equal to 100e to the kt.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.105
So you can see, expressed this way,

00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:24.306
our C is always going to
be our initial population.

00:02:24.306 --> 00:02:29.306
So, e to the kt.

00:02:30.962 --> 00:02:33.343
And now, we can use this
second piece of information.

00:02:33.343 --> 00:02:36.370
So our population is 200,
let's write that down.

00:02:36.037 --> 00:02:40.780
So our population is 200,
when time is equal to 50.

00:02:41.113 --> 00:02:42.602
After 50 days.

00:02:42.602 --> 00:02:47.602
So 200 is equal to 100e
to the k times 50, right?

00:02:54.696 --> 00:02:56.347
t is now 50.

00:02:56.347 --> 00:02:57.265
Let me just write that.

00:02:58.603 --> 00:03:00.952
k times 50.

00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:04.434
Now we can divide both sides by 100,

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:09.434
and we will get, two is
equal to e to the 50k.

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:17.546
Then we can take the
natural log of both sides.

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:19.742
Natural log on the left hand side,

00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:21.789
we get the natural log of two.

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:25.185
And on the right hand side, the
natural log of e to the 50k,

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:28.077
well that's just going
to be, that's the power

00:03:28.077 --> 00:03:31.211
that you need to raise e
to, to get e to the 50k.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:35.270
Well that's just going to be 50k.

00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:38.713
All you did was took the
natural log of both sides.

00:03:38.713 --> 00:03:40.687
Notice, that this equation
that I've just written

00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:41.620
expresses the same thing.

00:03:41.062 --> 00:03:42.329
Natural log of two is equal to 50k,

00:03:42.887 --> 00:03:45.540
that means e to the 50k is equal to two,

00:03:45.054 --> 00:03:47.262
which is exactly what
we had written there.

00:03:47.748 --> 00:03:49.491
And now we can solve for k.

00:03:49.491 --> 00:03:53.422
Divide both sides by 50,
and we are left with,

00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:58.761
k is equal to the natural
log of 2, over 50.

00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:04.151
And we're done.

00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:05.914
We can now write the particular solution

00:04:05.914 --> 00:04:09.066
that meets these conditions.

00:04:09.066 --> 00:04:11.562
So we can now write that our population,

00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:15.007
and I can even write our
population as a function of time,

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:20.007
is going to be equal
to 100 times e to the,

00:04:25.642 --> 00:04:29.041
now k is natural log of two
over 50, so I'll write that.

00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:34.041
So, natural log of two over
50, and then that times t.

00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:40.237
If you assume rate of change of population

00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:42.874
is going to be proportional to population,

00:04:42.874 --> 00:04:45.140
you assume this information
right over here,

00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:47.099
this function is what is going to describe

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.530
your growth of population.
