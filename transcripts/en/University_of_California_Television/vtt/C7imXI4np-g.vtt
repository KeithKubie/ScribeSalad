00:00:00.457 --> 00:00:02.790
(whooshing)

00:00:04.957 --> 00:00:07.540
(upbeat music)

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.023
- My name is Rui de Figueiredo.

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:34.520
I am a Emeritus faculty member

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.350
in both the Haas School

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.570
and Department of Political
Science here at Berkeley.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.041
I'm also the Chair of the
Weinstock Lecture Committee.

00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:45.370
Along with the graduate division

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.060
and the graduate counsel
of the Academic Senate,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.140
I am very pleased to welcome
Governor Jennifer Granholm.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.400
This year's speaker in the
Barbara Weinstock lectures

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.170
on the morals of trade.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.100
Before I properly introduce
Governor Granholm.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.307
Let me first take a moment to tell you

00:01:03.307 --> 00:01:05.610
how the endowment supporting the lectures

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.240
came to the University
at California, Berkeley.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.430
In 1902, Harris Weinstock
a well known business man

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.240
based in Sacramento,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.710
provided the University
of California with a fund.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.820
In honor of his wife Barbara

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.940
to support an annual public lecture

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.670
on the morals of trade.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.380
The way he explained his motivations

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.523
in an article that was written

00:01:27.523 --> 00:01:30.827
after the first lecture
in 1904, was as follows,

00:01:30.827 --> 00:01:33.030
"Thus hope is in the air,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.320
and there is a better
and cleaner day in store

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.810
for all destined to spend their lives

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.520
in commercial pursuits.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.900
The thing to do at this hour

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.640
is to accelerate the movement

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.000
and to bring this hoped for day

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.023
as near to our own as possible."

00:01:48.023 --> 00:01:51.600
The California University lecture ship

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.163
on the morals of trade is a
small effort in that direction.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.360
Others who have delivered
the Weinstock lecture

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.312
includes consumer advocate Ralph Nader,

00:02:02.312 --> 00:02:06.020
member of the British
Parliament Neil Kinnock,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.320
Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.980
former U.S. Secretary
of Labor Robert Reich,

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.930
former Secretary of the U.S. Department

00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:17.100
of Health and Human
Services Kathleen Sebelius,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.490
and most recently nutritionist
and author Marion Nestle

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.147
and today's speaker is as accomplished

00:02:25.147 --> 00:02:28.120
as the previous lecturers.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.290
A few words abut today's
distinguished speaker.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.340
A transformative politician,

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.160
Governor Jennifer Granholm served

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.560
as the former 47th Governor of Michigan

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.210
leading the state through
a period of unprecedented

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.773
economic challenge and change.

00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:45.790
Governor Granholm became the first woman

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.010
to be elected as Governor
of Michigan in 2002

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.020
and in 2006, Governor
Granholm was reelected

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.260
with the largest number of votes ever cast

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.150
for Governor in the state of Michigan.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.290
She served as Governor
of Michigan until 2011,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.210
and prior to be elected Governor,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.150
she was the state of
Michigan Attorney General

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.794
from 1998 to 2002.

00:03:07.794 --> 00:03:09.911
After leaving public office,

00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.000
Governor Granholm joined the faculty here

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.020
at the University of California, Berkeley

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.100

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.357
at both the Law School

00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:20.880
and the Goldman School of Public Policy

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.290
and as a senior research fellow

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.690
at Berkeley Energy and Climate Institute

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.290
also known as BECI,

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.250
and the center for Information
Technology Research

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.710

In addition, she is a senior contributor

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.240

of start up companies and
non profit organizations.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.210
She's also the co author of
the political best seller

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.630
a Governor's Story: The Fight for Jobs

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.410

She has received dozens of awards

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.380
for her leadership over the years

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.920
of public service.

on creating industrial
clusters in clean energy.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.720
As a member of Berkeley's Work

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.440
in the Age of Intelligent Tools work group

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.270
she has been researching
ways to ensure that

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.110
automation and artificial intelligence

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.340
are not threats to equality,
but enablers of it.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.670
Her lecture today will identify

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.450
some of the most interesting policy ideas

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.030
to address problems of displaced workers,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.370
the skills gap, and resulting inequality

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.350
in the age of robots and AI,
or artificial intelligence.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.117
It is truly a pleasure and
an honor to have her here

00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:01.820
and for me to welcome Governor
Granholm to the stage.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.888
Thank you.

00:05:02.888 --> 00:05:06.510
(audience applause)

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.210
- I am really very happy to
be talking about an issue

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.816
that has been so important to the Midwest,

00:05:14.816 --> 00:05:19.150
and to anybody who comes
from a place or a family

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.471
where this issue about trade

00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:26.270
has impacted the family wellbeing,

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.970
and we know in Michigan a ton of those.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.270
I want to start with a story.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.220
I am totally obsessed about this question,

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.430
about jobs, and how you
create jobs in America

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.230
in the global economy,

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.930
and because I was Michigan Governor

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.440
from 2002, two terms, to end of 2010,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.300
beginning of 2011,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.550
I was there at a pretty amazing time.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.370
There was the bankruptcies
in the auto industry,

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.530
which were preceded by the bankruptcies

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.540
in the suppliers to the auto industry,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.178
and when I came into office
at the beginning of 2003,

00:06:05.178 --> 00:06:07.802
George Bush was president,

00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:10.794
and at that time we were just coming out

00:06:10.794 --> 00:06:13.110
of a national recession,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.810
and in Michigan the old adage goes

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.960
that when the nation catches a cold

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.413
Michigan catches pneumonia,

00:06:20.706 --> 00:06:22.360
because we make large products,

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.980
and those large products
don't sell during a recession,

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.230
but of course at the end of a recession,

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.420
when you come out, there's
a pent up demand for them.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.050
Like vehicles.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.750
So the notion is, when you
come out of a recession,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.090
then you're gonna see a lot of jobs.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.230
You're gonna see a lot more vehicles made,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.200
because those factories
will start humming again,

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.150
and for politicians our
advisors were saying,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.900
oh what a great time to be Governor,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.320
because all these jobs will be created,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.070
and we'll be able to
take the credit for it.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.120
Fantastic!

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.710
In fact, at the beginning of a year,

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:58.890
when a Governor comes in,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.390
you have to give a budget address

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.290
to the state legislature,

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.460
and the experts were saying

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.030
that by the end of my
first year in office,

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.100
by the end of 2003,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.630
that you would see a huge
amount of job creation,

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.660
and that it was gonna be all okay,

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.180
because our unemployment rate at that time

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.710
was pretty high.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.300
The end of 2003 comes around

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.710
and I didn't see a whole lot.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.010
We didn't see a whole lot of job creation,

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.220
and I thought what's going on here?

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.900
Then I get a call from the guy

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.050
who is the head of the Michigan

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.070
Economic Development Corporation,

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:36.840
which is the public private entity

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.260
that helps businesses come to Michigan

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:43.210
and he says, Gov, we've got a big problem

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.796
and I said what is it?

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:47.164
He said there is a little
community in Michigan,

00:07:47.164 --> 00:07:51.134
Greenville, and Greenville
has a population

00:07:51.134 --> 00:07:54.037
of about 8,000 people,

00:07:54.037 --> 00:07:56.950
and in that little town,

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.311
there is a huge refrigerator factory.

00:08:00.311 --> 00:08:04.578
Refrigerator factory
is owned by Electrolux,

00:08:04.578 --> 00:08:09.410
and they say that they are about to move

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.450
to go to Mexico,

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:12.850
and I said wait, wait, wait.

00:08:14.466 --> 00:08:15.819
8,000 people.

00:08:15.819 --> 00:08:16.683
How many people work in that factory?

00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:18.508
He said almost 3,000.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.380
3,000 people in a town of 8,000.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.180
That's like a one company town

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:29.130
when you consider parents,
grandparents, kids, et cetera.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.418
In fact, Greenville had called itself

00:08:31.418 --> 00:08:35.050
the refrigerator capital of North America,

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.530
because in fact, Electrolux was

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:40.314
the largest refrigerator
factory in North America

00:08:40.314 --> 00:08:43.533
in that little tiny town in Greenville.

00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:45.710
When he said they were gonna go to Mexico

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.240
and I was the new Governor, I said no way!

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.660
We're not gonna allow this
to happen on my watch.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.070
I'm Governor.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.730
We're gonna bring my cabinet to Greenville

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:59.730
and we will make Electrolux
an offer they can't refuse!

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:02.470
Well not like a Chris Christie offer.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.620
I know what you're thinking.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.640
I'm talking about incentives
and stuff like that.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.743
What Governors do.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.550
We brought my whole cabinet to Greenville

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.090
and we went to the City Hall

00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:15.740
which was probably a quarter
of the size of this room,

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.410
and we all sat around
this big square table

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.100
and everybody who was anybody
in Greenville was there.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.380
Mayor, City Manager, the head of the UAW,

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.170
who represented the work force.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.790
The head of the community college.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:32.490
The head of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:34.520
Everybody, all the poobahs were there,

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.090
and I brought my whole cabinet,

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.430
and we all basically said,

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.040
Electrolux was there too and we said,

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.336
okay, we're gonna empty
our pockets full of chips

00:09:43.336 --> 00:09:45.080
and we're gonna make a pile

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.640
and we'll slide our pile

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:47.790
and this is a metaphor.

00:09:48.863 --> 00:09:50.622
Incentives in the pile of chips.

00:09:50.622 --> 00:09:52.830
We'll slide our pile of
chips across the table

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.800
to the management of Electrolux,

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.080
and we will be able to save the factory

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.340
and save the jobs,

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:00.410
and inside of that pile of incentives,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.527
it was really a list of incentives,

00:10:02.527 --> 00:10:04.095
but it's on the list,

00:10:04.095 --> 00:10:07.480
were things like zero taxes for 20 years,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.500
and that was state and local taxes,

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.010
and we said we would help
to finance a new factory.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:15.180
As you can see this is
actually the factory

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.646
and it was old and it needed upgrades.

00:10:18.646 --> 00:10:23.646
The UAW said we're gonna
offer a level of incentives

00:10:24.067 --> 00:10:26.395
and they didn't want anyone to know

00:10:26.395 --> 00:10:28.640
how much they were willing to give

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.700
because they didn't want other employers

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.980
to be asking for those incentives.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:35.829
We put these incentives on the table

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:39.520
and Electrolux takes
the list of incentives

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.753
and they go outside the
room for 17 minutes,

00:10:43.753 --> 00:10:47.280
and they come back in and they say, wow,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.280
this is the most generous
any community has ever been

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.357
in trying to keep jobs,

00:10:55.357 --> 00:11:00.357
but, there's nothing you can do

00:11:01.568 --> 00:11:03.705
to compensate for the fact

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:08.705
that we can pay $1.57 an
hour in Juarez, Mexico,

00:11:09.713 --> 00:11:12.045
so we're going.

00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:16.330
There's nothing you can do, they said.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.310
When they said that it was
like a nuclear bomb went off

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.342
in that little community.

00:11:22.342 --> 00:11:26.393
This is somebody leaving
on the last day of work.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.063
This is the implosion of the factory.

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:35.943
This is the beautiful new
factory in Juarez, Mexico,

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.640
and I'm gonna go back
to him for one second,

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.083
because on the last of the month,

00:11:43.437 --> 00:11:46.430
during the month that
the last refrigerator

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.490
came off the assembly line,

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.941
the employees had a gathering

00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:54.915
that they called the last supper.

00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:58.260
It was at this big pavilion in Greenville.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.580
It was called Klackle's Orchard Pavilion.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.840
It was an indoor pavilion,

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:07.090
and the whole community
went and I went too,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.110
event hough I was not invited.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.937
This was for me.

00:12:10.937 --> 00:12:12.003
Can I just pause for a moment?

00:12:13.169 --> 00:12:14.750
This story.

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:19.750
This has been my defining
moment as a leader.

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:24.290
This story, because it
was a failure on my part,

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.686
and it was so hard.

00:12:26.686 --> 00:12:28.550
Back to the story.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:31.024
I go to this dinner,

00:12:31.024 --> 00:12:34.147
and I walk into the pavilion,

00:12:34.147 --> 00:12:36.800
and there's 1,000 people there,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.310
and they're sitting around tables

00:12:39.904 --> 00:12:41.825
eating out of box lunches

00:12:41.825 --> 00:12:43.990
and it's a sad band playing

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.431
or a band playing sad music.

00:12:46.431 --> 00:12:48.310
It was probably a sad band too.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:52.102
It was like a community wake,

00:12:52.102 --> 00:12:54.997
and I go up to the first table,

00:12:54.997 --> 00:12:57.870
and I'm not sure sure what I was.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.060
I just couldn't get it out of my head

00:13:00.908 --> 00:13:03.270
that I failed this huge
factory was leaving.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.390
What was this community going to do?

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.897
What could I do as Governor?

00:13:06.897 --> 00:13:08.478
I go up to the first table

00:13:08.478 --> 00:13:10.560
and this guy stands up
and he's got tattoos

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:12.140
and he's got his tiger hat on backwards,

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.850
and he pulls his two teenage
daughters next to me.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:19.190
He says Governor, I want
you to meet my daughters.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.281
He said, look at them.

00:13:22.281 --> 00:13:27.113
I have worked at this factory
he said, for 30 years.

00:13:28.271 --> 00:13:30.563
I'm 48 years old.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.983
I went from high school to factory.

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.140
My father worked at this factory, he said.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:42.230
My grandfather worked at this factory.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:47.033
All I know is how to make refrigerators.

00:13:48.308 --> 00:13:52.230
Then he pulls his daughters in

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.735
and he puts his hands
on his chest like this.

00:13:54.735 --> 00:13:59.735
So Gov, tell me, who
is ever gonna hire me?

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.083
Who is ever gonna hire me?

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.780
That question was asked by everybody

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.330
in the Klackle's Orchard Pavilion that day

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:17.240
and honestly it's been asked by everyone

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.330
of the millions of
people who have lost jobs

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:23.730
in the 70,000 factories
that have shut down

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.673
since the beginning of this century.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:31.920
This experience, for me, seared my soul

00:14:32.568 --> 00:14:35.314
I stayed till the last person left.

00:14:35.314 --> 00:14:38.380
It wasn't just Electrolux.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.560
I knew this was the
canary in the coal mine

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.057
for factories all over Michigan,

00:14:43.057 --> 00:14:45.293
and it was just the beginning.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:49.453
I can understand.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.220
The president ran against globalization.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.592
I used to campaign on it too.

00:14:56.592 --> 00:15:01.592
NAFTA and KAFTA have given
us the Shafta, I would say,

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.980
and I was elected on
that because I get it.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:06.453
I totally get it!

00:15:07.303 --> 00:15:11.760
I completely get why people
feel like these vacant factories

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.460
that are sitting on main streets

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.450
all across the industrial Midwest

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:21.280
are permanent scars on
our soul and our identity.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.670
Even if they've been imploded

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.680
and there's just a vacant lot,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.490
everybody remembers,

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.661
oh that used to be the factory.

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:29.861
That's where we worked.

00:15:29.861 --> 00:15:31.377
I totally get it.

00:15:31.377 --> 00:15:32.980
I get why he focused on that,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.700
but the question is, is it really now,

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:39.182
in the second decade of this century,

00:15:39.182 --> 00:15:42.800
is it still all globalization?

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:47.800
Or is the other bad guy
for jobs, is it automation?

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:55.397
Actually about 13% of the job losses

00:15:55.397 --> 00:15:59.590
for manufacturing have really
been about globalization,

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.123
and the rest are due to automation.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.890
These two forces in this century

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:07.410
and obviously globalization

00:16:08.261 --> 00:16:09.630
has been going on long before
the turn of the century

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.077
but this is just when I
of course experienced it

00:16:12.077 --> 00:16:13.920
and that's why I tell that story.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:17.370
The long term job killer isn't China,

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:19.010
as the president keeps saying,

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.150
it is really automation,

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:23.330
and then what do we do about that?

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.950
This graph is really instructive.

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:26.783
The first graph.

00:16:26.783 --> 00:16:28.003
Sorry the print is so small,

00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:31.070
but the first graph shows
manufacturing employment

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.530
in millions going down,

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.930
and manufacturing output going up.

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:37.510
Increases in productivity.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:42.000
Going up despite losses
of jobs in manufacturing,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.163
and there's all these shock
studies that are out now.

00:16:46.163 --> 00:16:50.490
Automation to displace 20% to 25%!

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.770
Eradicate a third of America's workforce!

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:57.790
Machines will do half
our labor in eight years!

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:58.623
Ahhh!

00:16:58.623 --> 00:16:59.456
We're gonna lose.

00:17:00.377 --> 00:17:01.734
We're all gonna die!

00:17:01.734 --> 00:17:03.320
We're gonna be taken over by robots!

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.788
What is gonna happen?

00:17:04.788 --> 00:17:06.952
If I told that guy, in Greenville,

00:17:06.952 --> 00:17:11.748
that there is an army of millions

00:17:11.748 --> 00:17:16.748
of fourth graders who would
be willing to do this job.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.412
Not for $1.57 an hour,
but say 40 cents an hour.

00:17:21.412 --> 00:17:23.945
He'd freak out.

00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:26.983
In fact, there's your army.

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:32.300
The army of workers that can do the jobs

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.230
for so much less money,

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:38.910
and Electrolux is now
delivering refrigerators

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.920
using autonomous vehicles,

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.603
so the drivers too, gone.

00:17:44.467 --> 00:17:46.710
What are we gonna do?

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.130
What are we going to do?

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.710
There was this poll.

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.350
This is to the human side of this.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:56.090
There was a poll that was
done after the 2016 election.

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:59.000
It was to blue collar workers
in the industrial Midwest

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.610
and this was the question that was asked.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.170
Would you rather work full-time

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.080
in a good paying factory job,

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.200
or in a salaried office job?

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.700
What do you think people said?

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:12.710
Factory, yeah, by huge margins.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.690
72% said I'd rather work in a factory job.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:19.997
28% in a salaried office job.

00:18:19.997 --> 00:18:22.520
The economy is shedding.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.683
The exact kind of jobs
that these workers want.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:31.940
There is real pain out there
in the industrial Midwest

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.770
but the question is where are the jobs

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:36.670
and where are they going?

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.590
We all know that tech is dominating.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.703
The economy artificial intelligence, data,

00:18:42.703 --> 00:18:46.630
the whole we see it live
it in Silicon Valley.

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:48.651
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:18:48.651 --> 00:18:50.201
Tech is dominating the economy.

00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.420
The sector is leaving the rest in the dust

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.060
if you look at the growth companies.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:57.860
Obviously they're all tech companies

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.610
or most of them are tech companies,

00:19:00.727 --> 00:19:04.628
and in fact, the top 10
tech bosses, billionaires,

00:19:04.628 --> 00:19:09.628
own more wealth than 40% of Americans.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:15.920
Not only are people concerned
that the jobs are going away

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.860
by the companies that are
coming out of Silicon Valley,

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:22.700
but there's also this
incredible inequality

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.730
that is being created as a result

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.350
of big tech, data, AI, et cetera.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:32.302
The global average salary
of the tech worker.

00:19:32.302 --> 00:19:34.590
About $135,000.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.580
If you're in that sector,
you're doing great as a worker.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.880
That's the global average,

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.590
but if you're not you may be left behind.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.190
This income inequality.

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.290
The blue line going down.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:49.750
The red line going up.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.088
The top 1% is the red.

00:19:52.088 --> 00:19:53.570
The bottom 50% is the blue.

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.780
This is not a new story.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.730
You've heard it talked about,

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.140
but it's just to underscore the fact

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.440
that historic inequality is happening

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.870
at the same time as tech is dominating,

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:08.045
and as AI is replacing an awful lot

00:20:08.045 --> 00:20:10.870
of these jobs that were historically here.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:13.430
To me this stat says it all.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.575
Despite having a great
economy, we're told,

00:20:16.575 --> 00:20:19.000
you've got 40% of Americans,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.496
who don't even have $400
in a case of an emergency.

00:20:22.496 --> 00:20:26.910
40% of Americans, almost half the country.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.080
You walk out and almost
half the people you see

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.200
will not have $400 in their bank account

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.330
in case of an emergency.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.600
This stat however, is really troubling.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.100
That 42% of Americans,

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.480
have not even saved
$10,000 for retirement.

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.530
There is a boom coming.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:45.750
We've got a big problem,

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.900
that we have to deal with as a country.

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:52.286
This is the solution that is often cited.

00:20:52.286 --> 00:20:54.290
In a number of think tanks, et cetera.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:57.130
Is UBI, universal basic income.

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:01.470
Should we guarantee a
basic income for Americans?

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.950
Who pays for that?

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.440
Even though they may
not be working at a job

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.561
to merit that pay?

00:21:09.561 --> 00:21:13.713
Silicon Valley in
particular is enamored this.

00:21:13.713 --> 00:21:16.210
This is why I've got
one with the pitchforks

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.486
because there's some concern,

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.520
some realization that the tech industry

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.740
has created this income inequality

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.950
and they want to keep
the pitchforks at bay,

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.818
and UBI might be a way
to assuage the masses.

00:21:28.818 --> 00:21:31.420
What is the answer?

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:34.940
We've been working here in this space

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.070
through our work groups
on artificial intelligence

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.800
and we decided that,

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.920
let's see if there's a way we can get

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.630
AI to work with us, for
us, instead of against us,

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:47.770
but let's not call it
artificial intelligence.

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:49.910
Is there a way to instead call it

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.640
inclusive intelligence?

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.310
How do you get that
technology to work with people

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.636
instead of replacing them?

00:21:57.636 --> 00:21:59.410
That's the question.

00:21:59.410 --> 00:22:00.750
Can there be this?

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.630
What tech hath wrought,
tech can help solve!

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.860
Potentially, potentially!

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.740
You've heard of Singularity, many of you.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.030
Singularity is the notion that

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.570
we will be merged with machines.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:14.070
With robots, at some point.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.485
The robots are gonna take
over eventually totally,

00:22:17.485 --> 00:22:21.870
and as Elon Musk points out right now,

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:23.830
you already are part cyborg

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:25.410
because every one of you,

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:28.083
is there anybody here who
does not have a cell phone?

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.803
Nobody.

00:22:30.744 --> 00:22:32.177
You rely.

00:22:32.177 --> 00:22:33.010
You don't have a cell phone?

00:22:33.881 --> 00:22:35.099
Wow.

00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:35.932
You are the cell phone.

00:22:36.817 --> 00:22:38.469
Look you even get applause for that,

00:22:38.469 --> 00:22:40.378
because you're the only
human in the group.

00:22:40.378 --> 00:22:41.420
100% human.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.380
What do these phones do?

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.600
They make you smarter.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.203
They tell you where to go.

00:22:47.203 --> 00:22:48.576
They have your schedule.

00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:50.207
You can look anything up.

00:22:50.207 --> 00:22:52.170
You are so smart, because
you have a smartphone,

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:56.660
that you already are
merging with the robot.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.690
The question is, is there
a way to frame this,

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.500
that is a positive way, a hopeful way,

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.000
rather than a scary way?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.220
Ken Goldberg who is here at U.C. Berkeley.

00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.910
He does all of the stuff with the robots.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.420
He heads the Robot whatever.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.686
I don't even know what it's called,

00:23:14.686 --> 00:23:15.950
but he has come up with a solution

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:17.590
or a theory of the case,

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:20.050
which is called, which
he terms multiplicity,

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:22.700
which means that instead of being replaced

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:27.570
that robots and AI can in
fact, enhance worker's skills,

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.211
and make them better.

00:23:30.211 --> 00:23:31.500
Make them more valuable.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.980
If the training is right.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.560
If you can figure out how
to make it successful.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.610
The thought experiment goes like this.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.680
I'm sure many of you have seen this,

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.554
but since the ATM was introduced,

00:23:44.554 --> 00:23:48.270
and people thought all the teller jobs

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.253
are going away as a result of ATMs.

00:23:51.253 --> 00:23:54.010
Answer the question.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:56.400
Do we have more or fewer bank tellers

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.803
since the late 90s, when
the ATM became ubiquitous?

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:03.253
Not saying.

00:24:04.134 --> 00:24:05.267
We got more!

00:24:05.267 --> 00:24:06.776
More tellers!

00:24:06.776 --> 00:24:08.880
Since 2000, the number
of full time bank tellers

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.783
increased 2% a year,

00:24:10.805 --> 00:24:14.660
but the entire labor force
only grew .6% per year.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.460
Grew faster than the labor force,

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.170
or same thing with bar code scanners.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.660
We are not going to have any real people

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.640
at the grocery store anymore.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.120
You are gonna be doing the work.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:28.365
Have we got more or fewer cashiers?

00:24:28.365 --> 00:24:30.270
More.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.670
I lead you into that, didn't I?

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:33.260
Yes, we have more.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.570
Again, growing at an annual rate of 2.1%

00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:39.070
when the labor force grew at .6%.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.450
What's going on with this?

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:41.283
It goes back.

00:24:42.424 --> 00:24:43.320
Remember the old luddites,

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.500
who threw the stuff in the loom

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.820
to make sure they still
had jobs doing weaving?

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:53.260
They didn't throw weavers out of work.

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:58.260
It's a classic case of, classic economics.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.920
When you have something
created more cheaply,

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.020
people are gonna buy it,

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.527
and there will be more demand for it,

00:25:05.527 --> 00:25:07.230
and so instead of you having a suit

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:09.417
that you would have paid your whole

00:25:09.417 --> 00:25:12.820
annual salary for because
it was all done by hands,

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:15.000
now you can have a suit a day,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.630
if you buy it at H&amp;M,

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:20.250
because of the huge volume that's put out

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.480
and they're practically
throw away clothes.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.840
The bottom line is there's more work,

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:30.700
more workers because of technology.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.850
In fact, James Bessen who is

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:36.310
a professor at Boston University.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:41.080
He actually had a study that he did,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:46.080
of 317 professions,

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.090
where technology had been introduced,

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.416
and in this effort,

00:25:52.416 --> 00:25:56.980
he said in all of the professions,

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.170
all of the occupations that
had technology introduced,

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:06.170
there was only one where the
actual job was eliminated.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.363
Only one.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.100
Do you have any idea which one it was?

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.823
Who said that?

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:16.660
You are on it.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.143
Are you James Bessen?

00:26:20.802 --> 00:26:25.560
Only one guy's job was lost.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.150
It was the elevator operator,

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:29.960
and even in some places they still exist.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.794
This is what his point is.

00:26:31.794 --> 00:26:33.639
That employment grows significantly faster

00:26:33.639 --> 00:26:35.640
in occupations that use technology more,

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.900
and this is true not just
inside of those occupations

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.977
but also externally.

00:26:40.977 --> 00:26:44.949
Enrico Moretti, who also is
a professor here at Berkeley,

00:26:44.949 --> 00:26:48.730
he wrote a great book called
The New Geography of Jobs.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:52.059
He studied the impact of
technology on employment

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:54.920
around the employment.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.220
He uses as an example, Apple.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:59.681
The classic case, Apple employees,

00:26:59.681 --> 00:27:01.595
12,000 people or something like that

00:27:01.595 --> 00:27:04.100
in Cupertino at Apple headquarters,

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.560
but 60,000 in the economy around Apple

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.992
that aren't in even tech.

00:27:09.992 --> 00:27:12.620
The presence of that technology

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.727
creates a dynamism that he suggests

00:27:14.727 --> 00:27:17.675
technology has a great impact on.

00:27:17.675 --> 00:27:19.850
I just want to focus for one second

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:24.158
on one example of a technology, a product,

00:27:24.158 --> 00:27:28.159
that could be significantly impacted

00:27:28.159 --> 00:27:32.200
negatively or positively by technology,

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:36.562
and that is the mother of
all technology platforms.

00:27:36.562 --> 00:27:39.311
Which is the autonomous vehicle.

00:27:39.311 --> 00:27:42.510
There are, you know how many drivers

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:43.890
that people who drive for a living,

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:46.170
what do you say, in the U.S.?

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.063
How many people drive for a living?

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.300
Five million.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:52.960
Five million people drive for a living.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.690
When you consider Uber, or taxi drivers,

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:57.860
truck drivers, et cetera.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.060
Five million people.

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:02.030
That five million is like comparable

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.500
to the decline in manufacturing jobs

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.770
that we've seen so far this century.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.700
The potential for losing jobs

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:13.090
in this space using autonomous technology

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:14.713
is pretty big right?

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:17.910
If you look at what goes
into an autonomous car,

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:19.390
this is just, you can't read it all,

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:23.168
but it just shows that
there's all of this stuff.

00:28:23.168 --> 00:28:28.168
Whether it is sensor
hardware or battery storage

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:31.200
or engine efficiency or cybersecurity

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:33.020
or telecommunications,

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.620
connecting car to car, car
to grid, car to people.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.840
Tires that have sensors.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.694
You name it.

00:28:42.694 --> 00:28:44.570
All of these products
that go into the car,

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:46.890
but what about what goes on around

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:48.283
an autonomous vehicle.

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:51.089
If you think about what businesses

00:28:51.089 --> 00:28:52.520
could be created as a result

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.784
in logistics, or charging, or services,

00:28:55.784 --> 00:28:58.733
or construction, or networking.

00:28:58.733 --> 00:29:01.630
Let's just imagine for a moment

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:03.272
what that might look like.

00:29:03.272 --> 00:29:05.160
You might have motels.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.070
You might need to go to L.A. for a meeting

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.110
and you decide you're not gonna rent

00:29:11.014 --> 00:29:12.960
a motel, a hotel, down in L.A.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.950
I'm just gonna get in my
little autonomous vehicle

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:18.650
or I'm gonna call one up,

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:22.110
and they are gonna take me to L.A.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.741
And I am gonna.

00:29:23.741 --> 00:29:25.593
I don't know if I've got.

00:29:25.593 --> 00:29:27.274
Can you see this?

00:29:27.274 --> 00:29:29.482
This is a photoshopped thing.

00:29:29.482 --> 00:29:31.753
I didn't do the Photoshop,

00:29:31.753 --> 00:29:34.163
but I was chuckling as I
was looking at the picture,

00:29:34.163 --> 00:29:37.530
because guy lying down, sleeping,

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.250
and his high heels and
sandals are over here.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.030
His purple and pink.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.820
It's very forward looking.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:46.620
It's very gender fluid,

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:48.510
but bottom line is he's got his guitar.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:49.523
You got your toilet.

00:29:50.884 --> 00:29:52.404
You have your sink.

00:29:52.404 --> 00:29:53.780
You wake up in Los Angeles.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:55.850
You've paid $40 for the ride.

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:56.940
You're fresh.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.314
You take another one coming back.

00:29:59.314 --> 00:30:00.885
You could be working.

00:30:00.885 --> 00:30:02.707
A motel on the road, literally.

00:30:02.707 --> 00:30:04.218
What about this?

00:30:04.218 --> 00:30:05.051
These pop up shops,

00:30:06.177 --> 00:30:08.440
where you don't wanna
just buy a pair of shoes

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.510
through Amazon because
you want to try them on.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:13.080
You just Uber up your pop up shop

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.390
and try your shoes on right there,

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:18.810
or I love the fact that the opportunity

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:22.040
for mobility for people
with disabilities is huge.

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.900
You can create entire services around

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.410
getting people with
disabilities from place to place

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:32.210
and configure the vehicles
to be able to serve them.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.020
These artificially
intelligent transportation.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.592
This is so interesting.

00:30:36.592 --> 00:30:37.425
This says Alli.

00:30:38.589 --> 00:30:39.965
This is a small little bus,

00:30:39.965 --> 00:30:41.547
and the bus will pick you up,

00:30:41.547 --> 00:30:44.960
and they imagine that because it has huge,

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.010
It's got a robot.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:47.760
They partnered with IBM Watson,

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:51.020
and they will pick people up on a route.

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.700
They will connect you to your cell phone.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.440
They'll know when your
laundry needs to be picked up

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.910
and ask you do you want me to stop

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:02.410
at the laundry on your way home?

00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:05.630
They'll know that you like
that Starbucks Chai Latte

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:07.410
and they'll stop and ask whether

00:31:07.410 --> 00:31:09.620
you want me to stop on our way home.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.732
It's a little creepy, right?

00:31:11.732 --> 00:31:13.340
Because they'll have
access to your information

00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:16.204
and all of that stuff
about your personal life,

00:31:16.204 --> 00:31:19.380
is a big issue around all of this,

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:22.270
but that's personalized
artificial transportation.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:24.430
What about working out on the way home?

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.980
What if you could imagine?

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:27.270
I don't know if you could do a treadmill.

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:29.441
That would be a little bit dangerous,

00:31:29.441 --> 00:31:30.650
but at least bikes.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:33.189
Working out on your way home.

00:31:33.189 --> 00:31:35.026
The stuff around it.

00:31:35.026 --> 00:31:40.026
There's 20, no, there's 200 square miles

00:31:41.107 --> 00:31:42.220
of parking in Los Angeles.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.780
The whole city of San Francisco

00:31:44.801 --> 00:31:47.060
could fit into the parking
lots in Los Angeles.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:49.480
We have this massive housing crisis.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.400
What if you don't need parking lots?

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.798
What do you do?

00:31:52.798 --> 00:31:54.210
You could build housing.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.433
Affordable housing,

00:31:56.284 --> 00:31:58.310
and many of these housing
units they're talking about

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:01.870
you would get a unit and
you would have access

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:05.170
to the autonomous vehicles
as a service in the basement.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.390
There would be a small
fleet for the people

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.703
who live in those particular apartments.

00:32:10.627 --> 00:32:13.350
You would be able to access
them when you need them,

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.832
or rethinking the curb,

00:32:15.832 --> 00:32:18.170
meaning that you wouldn't need parking.

00:32:18.170 --> 00:32:21.400
You could see these cafes obviously

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.030
expand significantly and take advantage

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.180
of that extra space.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.283
Rethinking the garage.

00:32:27.367 --> 00:32:28.200
You don't need your garages anymore,

00:32:29.262 --> 00:32:30.540
so the garage becomes the next Air BnB,

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.030
or the next small unit.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.763
Your ADUs, et cetera.

00:32:35.195 --> 00:32:37.260
Businesses who are thinking about

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.870
doing construction in small living spaces

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.510
since garages won't be necessary.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.690
This, I'm hoping.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:47.510
You think we can press?

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.090
I'm a little worried.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:50.343
If we can press go on it.

00:32:50.343 --> 00:32:53.453
Maybe not.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.223
This is just a quick little.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.350
This little delivery thing.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:02.970
For any of you walking around campus

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:04.730
you see a version of this.

00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:06.970
I just passed one as I was walking up

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:08.750
delivering little items to you.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.290
It won't go on a freeway,

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.380
but it will deliver your groceries to you,

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:13.653
which is kind of cool,

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:17.751
and then, I love this.

00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:20.450
Proterra makes all electric buses

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.210
and they're moving into
the autonomous space

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.877
and I love the fact that they are also

00:33:24.877 --> 00:33:27.210
creating batteries as a service.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.660
Meaning this as a service,

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:31.270
delivery as a service,
transportation as a service.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.270
In this case, batteries as a service.

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.638
Another whole sphere of job creation

00:33:36.638 --> 00:33:37.960
that you could imagine,

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.185
and batteries as a service,

00:33:40.185 --> 00:33:41.948
they basically rent the battery out

00:33:41.948 --> 00:33:44.370
and the buses put their own cap on it

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:46.700
and they service it separately

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.020
so thy don't have to pay for the full cost

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.540
of a battery up front.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.633
It's kind of cool.

00:33:52.508 --> 00:33:53.829
A cool business model.

00:33:53.829 --> 00:33:55.390
The question is,

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:56.910
that's all just vehicles.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:33:58.210
That's one thing.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.640
Only 40 companies that appeared

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.910
in the Fortune 500 when
it started in 1950,

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:06.130
exist today, so there's all this churn.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.863
The best example of the churn,

00:34:08.863 --> 00:34:11.140
I think the most symbolic example is,

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:14.070
if you think about the
Gutenberg Printing Press.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:16.130
When the Gutenberg
Printing Press came about

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.000
and gave everybody access to books,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.970
all of a sudden, and
people didn't realize this,

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:24.300
you realize, oh my God,
I can't read the print.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.440
I need my glasses.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.860
A whole market for glasses came about.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.400
Where did they get those glasses?

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.320
The Isle, been to Venice?

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.670
The Isle of Burane has great glassmaking

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.190
and they put glasses upon glasses

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:42.230
and instead of just now,

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.683
instead of just glasses,

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:47.170
they had telescopes, and microscopes,

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.950
as it was all coming from
the Gutenberg Printing Press.

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:51.936
We don't know what's gonna happen.

00:34:51.936 --> 00:34:54.340
What other kinds of jobs or businesses

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.282
could happen as a result of

00:34:56.282 --> 00:35:00.300
the autonomous vehicle or
any other AI kinds of things,

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.020
but the question for us all is,

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.140
because we don't know, how
do you prepare a workforce?

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.110
In that case.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:07.990
How do you prepare a workforce

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:11.320
to be able to be flexible and adjust

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.513
to the different changes in the economy?

00:35:15.602 --> 00:35:17.430
I'm gonna give you five quick ideas,

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:19.220
and these are not comprehensive.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.120
These are just five ideas that people

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.200
have been talking about that
I think are interesting.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.752
One is, this comes from Europe,

00:35:25.752 --> 00:35:29.183
guaranteed subsidized trial employment.

00:35:29.183 --> 00:35:34.180
The Swiss example of having
interns and apprentices.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.830
We just don't do that well here.

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:39.430
We have got to get over our phobia

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.950
about copying what other
countries do that work

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:43.930
because it really does work.

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:48.317
In Germany they have a
system called Kuzerweit

00:35:48.317 --> 00:35:51.440
when times are bad the
government helps to subsidize

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.620
the employment of the
people so they stay on.

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:56.817
They don't have to pay unemployment.

00:35:56.817 --> 00:36:01.500
It's a creative way of thinking about how

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.780
the public ends up working

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.550
to incentivize or
disincentivize employment.

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:11.010
85% of Swiss apprentices find
a job within three months.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.070
This is a company that's
closer to home out of Colorado.

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.490
I pulled this up because
there's a lot of innovation

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.860
that's happening in the tech space

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:20.767
about how to train people

00:36:20.767 --> 00:36:23.280
and this one, 87% of apprentices

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.670
called the Techtonic Group

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:26.420
successfully placed in tech jobs.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.886
They do coding, and what they do,

00:36:28.886 --> 00:36:30.900
is they take people who
haven't even gone to college

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.039
who maybe are really interested in coding

00:36:34.039 --> 00:36:37.410
and who may be coming from
a disadvantaged community

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:41.270
and as a result, Techtonic has clients,

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:45.000
that they go and do software projects for

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.860
and they bring their apprentices to them

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:49.450
and the clients can decide whether

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:51.920
they want to keep this person on or not

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:54.862
and as a result 82% of the apprentices

00:36:54.862 --> 00:36:57.090
from these diverse populations,

00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:59.240
or 87% are placed.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.780
82% of these people who are replaced

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.400
are from diverse populations.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.370
The average salary is $75,000.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:07.950
That's a really great program.

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:09.513
We should take that to scale.

00:37:10.356 --> 00:37:14.180
It makes a lot of us think about

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:18.973
why do we spend all of this
money subsidizing unemployment

00:37:18.973 --> 00:37:23.160
when we could be subsidizing
instead, employment,

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.436
because what would we spend.

00:37:25.436 --> 00:37:27.170
We spend $24 billion annually

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:28.782
on unemployment insurance.

00:37:28.782 --> 00:37:31.070
What if we flipped that and take derisked

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:33.360
for the employer.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.390
Allow them to hire people
during a training period.

00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:37.973
Have the government subsidy,

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:40.810
instead of paying for unemployment

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.130
paying for that employment

00:37:43.022 --> 00:37:44.716
and then have it phased down

00:37:44.716 --> 00:37:47.073
once the person being
trained is fully hired on.

00:37:47.073 --> 00:37:49.823
This is a different way to think about it.

00:37:49.823 --> 00:37:53.360
Idea number two is to create
data driven training modules

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.500
for critical skills.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.731
AI is fantastic because it allows you.

00:37:57.731 --> 00:38:02.130
It allows the system to
know where you're at.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:03.380
How much you know.

00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:05.560
How you learn.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.890
The current workforce training programs

00:38:07.890 --> 00:38:10.700
that we have in the U.S. are terrible

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.330
and they're antiquated
and they don't work.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.870
There's a bunch of studies about this.

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:18.477
The evaluation of the trade
adjustment assistance program.

00:38:18.477 --> 00:38:21.050
$11,500 per person is paid.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.670
Only 37% of people are employed.

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.180
Working in the targeted
industries four years later.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.160
That's a really crappy percentage.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.670
The Workforce Investment Act, same thing.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.430
It appears possible, the
ultimate gains from participation

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.547
are small or nonexistent,

00:38:35.547 --> 00:38:37.570
and we spent a lot of money on it!

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.100
The overall programs themselves

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.700
failed to evolve with the global

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.610
information based economy,

00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:46.240
where technical know how trumps muscle.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.240
What do we need to do about this?

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.844
Data can make training great again!

00:38:50.844 --> 00:38:55.844
In the classroom, if you
look at AI driven learning,

00:38:57.454 --> 00:39:01.662
it has been enormously
successful in the classroom.

00:39:01.662 --> 00:39:05.480
Where the kids, you take
someone where they're at

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:10.480
and you have them learn in
ways that they best achieve.

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.190
So it's both how much they
know and how they learn it,

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:19.730
that AI can help, and you
can see here 214% improvement

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:23.410
through learning software,
compared to other students,

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:24.890
for those who took
their training that way.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:29.491
The Navy has piloted this
digital tutor program

00:39:29.491 --> 00:39:32.120
in the workplace.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.450
This is a pilot through
the Department of Defense.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.470
It improved problem solving performance

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:40.460
by 94% over classroom training.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.630
We should be taking this stuff to scale.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:45.650
All the way across.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:47.480
We're so darn slow,

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:50.150
in how we take advantage of technology.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.380
Rather than be victimized by it.

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.180
Idea number three is to
pay people for their data.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.298
I happen to love this one,

00:39:57.298 --> 00:39:58.448
because it's very cool.

00:39:59.326 --> 00:40:02.884
In this regard, think about it.

00:40:02.884 --> 00:40:06.530
Data has become, as they say,

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:09.450
the new resource, the new oil.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.268
All these companies making
huge amounts of money.

00:40:12.268 --> 00:40:15.920
Off of your data.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.040
You're on Facebook.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.270
You're giving them all
sorts of information.

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:23.770
They are so happy that you
are providing that to them

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.360
because they can then
sell it to advertisers

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.820
and make a huge amount of money off of you

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.060
and you are just giving it to them.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.250
Not granted you get a
personalized experience

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:35.600
in exchange, and the question is,

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.810
over and above that
personalized experience,

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:40.500
who gets more out of the aggregate data

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.760
that we're all giving to
Facebook, Google, et cetera,

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.510
and this goes beyond
just those experiences,

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:49.460
but if you think about data

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.030
that is being accumulated through

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:53.610
all of our devices.

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:56.100
It's a lot of data,

00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.540
and it is occupying a greater

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.790
and greater percentage of the economy,

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:06.790
and if this is being addressed
in California and Europe

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:11.683
have decided that you
are gonna own your data

00:41:11.683 --> 00:41:14.710
and that you have the ability

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.720
to say what somebody
should do with your data.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.880
This is the General Data
Protection Regulation.

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:24.330
Of Europe, and California's just starting

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.396
to experiment with this.

00:41:26.396 --> 00:41:28.020
They're not paying people for their data,

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.570
but they are starting to say

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.662
you have a property interest in your data

00:41:32.662 --> 00:41:36.685
and Mark Zuckerberg testifying,

00:41:36.685 --> 00:41:39.410
actually said every piece of content

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:41.790
you share on Facebook, you own.

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:45.423
You own it, and you're giving it away!

00:41:45.423 --> 00:41:50.329
Actually me and Chris Eldrin
who is a student here,

00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:55.120
we did a piece on this for CNN
that Facebook owes you money.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.640
There's a whole group.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.110
There's a movement here.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:59.800
Facebook users unite.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.610
Data labor union launches
in the Netherlands.

00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:04.590
Should we treat data as labor?

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:06.450
Moving beyond free.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:10.010
What if people were paid for their data?

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:13.160
The notion is instead of
a universal basic income

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:18.160
where you are given money for just being,

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:22.350
maybe you could be given, being paid,

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:24.720
for the amount of content you put up there

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:28.100
and I used the analogy of
the Alaska permanent fund

00:42:29.252 --> 00:42:30.323
where in that case in that state,

00:42:31.284 --> 00:42:32.117
everybody gets a check.

00:42:33.035 --> 00:42:34.923
Last year it was $1,600 because

00:42:34.923 --> 00:42:36.530
of the natural resources that is beneath

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:38.570
the land and the water.

00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.200
The oil and gas natural resources.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.742
What if we considered
data to be a resource

00:42:45.742 --> 00:42:50.579
that requires some kind
of shared, profit sharing

00:42:50.579 --> 00:42:53.780
from the companies that are using it

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.946
to make enormous profits?

00:42:55.946 --> 00:42:59.120
If AI, this is a Professor out of Yale

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.520
who is doing a lot of work on this.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:04.220
If AI represents 10% of the U.S. economy,

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:06.730
he estimates that paying people for data

00:43:08.782 --> 00:43:10.293
would raise household
median income by $20,000

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.442
which is a bigger increase
than the postwar era.

00:43:13.442 --> 00:43:16.517
That's assuming that you get to 10% of AI,

00:43:16.517 --> 00:43:18.212
in the economy,

00:43:18.212 --> 00:43:22.090
which actually I think is a
pretty conservative assumption.

00:43:22.090 --> 00:43:23.847
How would this work?

00:43:23.847 --> 00:43:26.040
A lot of questions about
what that would look like?

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:28.050
How do you value the data?

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:31.509
Who negotiates the data for you?

00:43:31.509 --> 00:43:35.210
People are talking about
these data negotiation

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.100
intermediaries that would actually

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.970
do the negotiations on behalf of people

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:41.580
to the companies.

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.300
How to enforce your standards.

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.520
What is the role of government?

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:47.775
You look at the analogy of, for example,

00:43:47.775 --> 00:43:50.933
Spotify pays a micropayment, a royalty,

00:43:50.933 --> 00:43:55.420
to those who have their
intellectual property

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.230
listened to in music.

00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:59.850
Small micro payments.

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:01.173
You create an account,

00:44:02.151 --> 00:44:03.984
where little bits of
micropayments might go

00:44:03.984 --> 00:44:05.574
and you wouldn't take the whole thing.

00:44:05.574 --> 00:44:06.553
The company still has to be profitable,

00:44:07.568 --> 00:44:09.070
but the amount of data of yours,

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:11.750
that's being used to
create enormous profit,

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:14.270
the question is do you
deserve a little share

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:16.870
of the profit from those companies?

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:19.960
The next one is, I happen
to love competition,

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:22.920
and I think that from a
public policy perspective,

00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.320
creating competition is a really cool way

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:29.094
of getting policy adopted.

00:44:29.094 --> 00:44:34.094
Creating a competition for a
data driven workforce training

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:38.080
is I think a neat way to go.

00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:39.900
There's you see the SunShot

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:41.060
from the Department of Energy

00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.093
which was a competition
about getting solar cheap.

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:48.600
The Race To the Top.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.090
The X prize were all competitions.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:54.660
In fact, the Workforce
Innovation Opportunity Act,

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:58.707
right now we spend $10
billion to do training.

00:44:58.707 --> 00:44:59.610
$10 billion.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.380
If you took that $10 billion

00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.953
and created a competition,

00:45:03.794 --> 00:45:04.970
oh my God, it would blow the roof off.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.880
I use the Race To The Top For Education

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.830
as an example because what happened when

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:11.319
the Obama Administration came in

00:45:11.319 --> 00:45:12.900
and they wanted to raise
high school standards,

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:15.650
what they did was to say hey states,

00:45:15.650 --> 00:45:18.700
here's $3.4 billion.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.660
That $3.4 billion we'll
allow you to compete for it

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.520
but the price to enter
is that you have to raise

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.300
your high school standards to essentially

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.567
be a college prep curriculum.

00:45:29.567 --> 00:45:31.510
$3.4 billion.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:35.098
48 states raised their standards!

00:45:35.098 --> 00:45:38.380
Just on the basis of that little carrot

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.974
that was out there.

00:45:39.974 --> 00:45:41.330
$3.4 billion is not a little carrot,

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:44.190
but to states, all 50 states,

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:47.150
that's a big incentive.

00:45:47.150 --> 00:45:49.680
If we have $10 billion being spent

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.590
for ineffective workforce
development training programs

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:54.902
right now, and you put that out there

00:45:54.902 --> 00:45:56.789
as a competition among states,

00:45:56.789 --> 00:45:59.310
I am telling you, you
would get massive response,

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:01.760
by both the private sector and governments

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.320
who want to work in ways

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:07.530
that would achieve great
workforce training outcomes.

00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:08.363
48 states.

00:46:08.363 --> 00:46:10.280
Who were the two states
that did not compete?

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.113
Do you know?

00:46:12.334 --> 00:46:13.733
Texas.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:16.360
South Carolina.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:17.310
Those were the two,

00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:19.210
and you know what the
frustrating part was,

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.860
we all competed, and in the first round,

00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:23.760
only a couple of states got the money.

00:46:24.697 --> 00:46:26.305
We did not in Michigan.

00:46:26.305 --> 00:46:27.822
I was so bummed,

00:46:27.822 --> 00:46:28.740
because I cannot tell you how hard it was

00:46:29.597 --> 00:46:31.446
to get the legislature to act to do this,

00:46:31.446 --> 00:46:33.530
but nonetheless, you could
formulate this in a way

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:34.860
where everybody gets a little piece

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.533
if you have a $10 billion fund.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:42.910
Last one, is the idea of these
new workforce arrangements

00:46:46.261 --> 00:46:51.261
where people are creating
employment through Uber,

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.850
through an app, through
Task Rabbit, et cetera.

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:57.420
How do you create portable
benefits for them?

00:46:57.420 --> 00:46:58.800
How do you create an environment

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.040
where they are covered in some way,

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.982
because right now they
have got no benefits.

00:47:04.982 --> 00:47:09.190
The notion of course that
a college graduate today

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:10.950
should expect to have 30 different jobs,

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.060
three separate careers,

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.070
over their 60 year working lives,

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.282
and this arrow up here.

00:47:17.282 --> 00:47:18.949
1995, 2005, to 2015.

00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:24.690
57% increase in the rise
in alternative work,

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.070
where you are on your own

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.660
probably using an app
to be able to connect

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.920
with potential customers.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.470
94% of the net employment growth

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:37.210
in the U.S. economies from 2005 to 2015,

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:41.200
94% have occurred in these alternative

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.920
work arrangement spaces.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:45.490
That's a huge increase

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:47.330
and we haven't done anything about it,

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:49.720
and here's the kicker is that 80%

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:51.860
of independent contractors and freelancers

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.372
preferred alternative work arrangements

00:47:54.372 --> 00:47:56.390
to standard employment.

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:58.640
They prefer that kind of flexibility,

00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.620
that kind of lifestyle.

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.160
They can choose when to work,

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:02.990
but they are completely on their own

00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:04.440
when it comes to retirement,

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:06.152
when it comes to healthcare, et cetera.

00:48:06.152 --> 00:48:08.138
What do we do about that?

00:48:08.138 --> 00:48:11.390
In the old world, everybody
works for something

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:13.140
like working for the
University of California.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.660
You got your employment relationship.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.643
You also had contractors
who had individual

00:48:17.643 --> 00:48:21.140
relationships with people
who were hiring them.

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:23.550
These independent workers in the middle

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:25.970
are going through an app.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:29.213
They really are totally a
different work arrangement.

00:48:29.213 --> 00:48:31.160
They're unable to organize.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.070
They're unable to collectively bargain

00:48:33.070 --> 00:48:34.260
for wages or benefits.

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.610
They're not protected by civil rights

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:38.410
of anti discrimination legislation.

00:48:38.410 --> 00:48:39.830
They're unable to receive benefits

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:43.400
without being classified as employees,

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:48.280
and this is the battle
between traditional employers.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.320
They don't want to take
them on as employees.

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:52.060
They don't want to have to be responsible

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:53.483
for all of those benefits.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.231
How do you do this?

00:48:56.231 --> 00:48:58.820
We've gotta create a system

00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:01.619
where you have a safe harbor for employers

00:49:01.619 --> 00:49:05.580
to offer portable benefits, without I-Ws.

00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.988
Those are independent workers.

00:49:07.988 --> 00:49:10.300
Without being classified as employers.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:14.010
They should be able to offer some kind

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:16.070
of series of accounts,

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:19.130
where they could do the tax
withholding, social security,

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:20.650
and Medicare contributions,

00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:22.940
unemployment insurance,
retirement savings,

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:24.662
create learning accounts,

00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:29.662
while allowing that person to
be a free agent essentially.

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:34.460
What's the world that that looks like?

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:37.063
There is this portable benefits issue

00:49:37.063 --> 00:49:39.346
is being discussed all over the place.

00:49:39.346 --> 00:49:41.190
It's being discussed in Europe.

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:43.110
It's being discussed
through legislation here.

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:45.700
Portable Benefits for
Independent Workers Act.

00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.700
There are state experiments in California,

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.310
Washington, New Jersey, New York.

00:49:50.310 --> 00:49:52.680
Just a quick example of
this from another country,

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:55.210
is that the government of Singapore,

00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:58.670
has given as a benefit to people

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:01.656
these individual learning accounts,

00:50:01.656 --> 00:50:03.570
which go with them wherever they are.

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.691
They started out, the
government actually paid

00:50:05.691 --> 00:50:09.520
$500 for every worker over
25 years old in Singapore

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:14.370
to be able to get educated as
a life long learning account

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:17.770
and you can take a class
in flower arranging

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:19.110
or cybersecurity.

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:20.163
Whatever is it.

00:50:21.203 --> 00:50:22.620
They just started doing
this two years ago,

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.650
so there hasn't been an
evaluation of the program yet,

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:28.120
but the bottom line is portable benefits

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.300
have got to be a solution

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.510
for the workforce of the 21st century.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:34.343
Those five ideas.

00:50:34.343 --> 00:50:36.220
Subsidized trial employment.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.740
Data driven training.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.400
Paying people for their data.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:40.500
Competition.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.910
Flexible portable benefits,

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:44.603
and here's the finish!

00:50:45.643 --> 00:50:49.190
Who is gonna get displaced
workers into good jobs?

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:52.610
Who will sustain the middle
class in the digital era?

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:54.330
Who will save us on the planet

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.813
from death and destruction?

00:50:56.813 --> 00:50:58.880
Who can ensure AI will
be a force for good?

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.420
Is it President Trump?

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:04.048
Or our next president, whoever she is?

00:51:04.048 --> 00:51:08.680
Is it Elon Musk or Bill
Gates or Mark Zuckerberg?

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.610
Is is Gavin Newsom?

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:15.610
Or is it Oski the Bear
and Berkeley brain power?

00:51:15.673 --> 00:51:18.673
(audience applause)

00:51:20.016 --> 00:51:22.751
We have an opportunity to do
a few questions and answers.

00:51:22.751 --> 00:51:25.952
If anybody wants to
engage in a discussion.

00:51:25.952 --> 00:51:27.693
- [Man] I wondered what
happened in Greenville.

00:51:27.693 --> 00:51:29.180
Did those people get jobs?

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.330
- Well, here's what
happened in Greenville.

00:51:33.058 --> 00:51:36.816
Throughout my entire two terms as Governor

00:51:36.816 --> 00:51:40.060
I worked with the city to try to get them

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:43.630
to become a sustainable community.

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:45.940
Green Up Greenville.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:50.476
We brought in solar manufacturers,

00:51:50.476 --> 00:51:55.476
and because of the fact that

00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:59.700
in China they were dumping solar panels

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.320
in the United States,

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:04.957
the factory that we brought
in ended up closing.

00:52:04.957 --> 00:52:09.200
It was even more agony for Greenville.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:12.180
What ended up happening
is a Walmart came in

00:52:13.687 --> 00:52:14.790
and so people now are working

00:52:16.045 --> 00:52:17.645
at half the wage at the Walmart.

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:19.810
Not everybody obviously.

00:52:19.810 --> 00:52:22.273
A lot of people took retirements.

00:52:22.273 --> 00:52:23.720
Just a follow up.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.470
One more on it.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:28.750
In Greenville, because
of the Electrolux factory

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:31.910
there were all these suppliers in the area

00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:33.110
to supply the factory,

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:34.680
and those suppliers also closed

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:36.500
when Greenville went away,

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.940
and the ripple effect in this community

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.769
was really very huge.

00:52:40.769 --> 00:52:44.740
We decided after, as part
of my initiative as Governor

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:48.330
that we would create something
called No Worker Left Behind,

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:52.400
and I stood up at one of my
state of the state addresses

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.740
and said all right, the
first 100,000 people

00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:57.030
to raise their hand,

00:52:57.030 --> 00:53:00.340
we will pay for full
community college tuition.

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:02.067
We'll give you $5,000 per year.

00:53:02.067 --> 00:53:03.420
$10,000.

00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.760
You have to be trained in an area of need,

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.250
and we had identified what
those were in Michigan.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:12.063
Like nursing and tech, et cetera,

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.780
and we would pay for your tuition,

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.326
and we had within months,

00:53:17.326 --> 00:53:20.050
the whole program was subscribed to.

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:22.296
I went back to the federal government

00:53:22.296 --> 00:53:23.810
and said instead of this TAA,

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.440
and workforce can you
just give me flexibility

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:28.710
and we could add more people to this.

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:31.140
We added another 50,000 people

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:33.170
to be able to get trained in an area

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:34.700
that they wanted to get trained in,

00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:35.930
but here's the kicker on it,

00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:38.710
is that a lot of people
who are like 48 years old,

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:40.310
like the guy I was talking about,

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:42.870
they don't necessarily want
to go to a community college

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:44.498
and sit next to a 21
year old and do calculus,

00:53:44.498 --> 00:53:49.420
when they can't even
remember whether they.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.243
They don't remember
percentages from high school.

00:53:51.243 --> 00:53:53.670
This wasn't something they took.

00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:55.690
This is why doing training,

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:58.350
in a way that respects where people are,

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:00.940
and takes them to the
next level at their pace

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:03.890
and in their way, is a
really important strategy,

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:07.378
and in a lot of ways
we had the union halls

00:54:07.378 --> 00:54:08.680
be open to be doing the training,

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.280
and bringing training into them

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.770
because they were more
comfortable in that setting,

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:14.873
but training has to be flexible like that.

00:54:20.384 --> 00:54:22.160
- [Man] If you wanna come up,

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.240
and just wait to ask the question.

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:26.284
- [Woman] Thank you very much.

00:54:26.284 --> 00:54:28.051
These are some really excellent ideas.

00:54:28.051 --> 00:54:29.920
Most of which I had
never thought of before.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:31.570
I need to process a little bit,

00:54:31.570 --> 00:54:34.010
but one of the things I wanted to ask you,

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.710
was could some of these ideas,

00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:39.240
not be compatible with something

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.140
like a universal basic income,

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:44.420
because for example your Alaska analogy

00:54:44.420 --> 00:54:47.140
essentially was like a
universal basic income.

00:54:47.140 --> 00:54:49.038
That is what the does.

00:54:49.038 --> 00:54:50.330
It doesn't actually depend on their skills

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:53.888
or their age or their
training or the employer.

00:54:53.888 --> 00:54:56.870
I just wanted to ask,
are these substitutes,

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:59.683
or could they be
compatible with something?

00:55:00.791 --> 00:55:02.410
- The paying people for data

00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:05.880
is sort of like a universal
basic income concept.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.540
Similar to it.

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:11.460
In the Alaska situation,
people get compensated,

00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:13.660
because they own the state,

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:15.870
and the question is what's the analogy

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:18.070
for a country where you have a state,

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:20.052
like in Michigan, we don't have

00:55:20.052 --> 00:55:21.969
huge oil and gas resources,

00:55:21.969 --> 00:55:23.940
where maybe we would have to think

00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:26.265
of a different way of doing it,

00:55:26.265 --> 00:55:27.691
and the question is,

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.690
is there a way to do it,

00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:34.690
that doesn't cause people's
hair to catch on fire

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:38.010
because you are redistributing
mass amounts of income

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:39.590
through tax increases,

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:41.730
and so the question is,

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:43.200
is there a different way of looking at

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.526
a universal basic income,

00:55:45.526 --> 00:55:46.990
which guarantees people some dignity.

00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:48.540
The other thing I would say though,

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.610
there's a lot of pushback from people

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:53.864
who feel like I don't want
to just be given a check.

00:55:53.864 --> 00:55:58.864
I want to have there be
an exchange for my input.

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:03.590
Whether it's data, or my work, my sweat.

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:05.170
Whatever it is.

00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:07.160
That's the pushback you get.

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.310
I think from people on the left even

00:56:10.310 --> 00:56:13.070
who are saying, UBI, the concept is okay,

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:15.330
but you want to respect the dignity

00:56:15.330 --> 00:56:16.830
of people who want to be able

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.993
to be engaged in employment.

00:56:20.591 --> 00:56:22.250
- [Woman] Thank you for your talk.

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:24.730
Would you mind talking about the fact

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:28.640
that I believe there are millions of jobs

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:31.001
in the manufacturing
sector in this country

00:56:31.001 --> 00:56:34.190
that go unfilled over
long periods of time.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.850
I think especially since
the end of the recession

00:56:36.850 --> 00:56:38.915
and I'd like to, I don't believe

00:56:38.915 --> 00:56:40.840
that you've talked about that

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.220
and where's the problem,

00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:44.360
and how do you solve that problem?

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:47.660
- Yeah, I would say
that there is definitely

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:52.660
a mismatch of demand and
supply in certain areas.

00:56:53.421 --> 00:56:56.949
Especially with a low unemployment rate.

00:56:56.949 --> 00:57:00.330
There's a lot of jobs
that are going unfilled.

00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:03.051
A lot of the work in
manufacturing now though

00:57:03.051 --> 00:57:05.685
requires a level of skill

00:57:05.685 --> 00:57:08.680
that you wouldn't have needed in the past,

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:12.290
so it requires somebody to
have some kind of certification

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:16.020
to do the CNC, the machines,

00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.570
that actually do the manufacturing.

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:18.663
It's sophisticated.

00:57:19.507 --> 00:57:21.076
In fact, in one of the last years

00:57:21.076 --> 00:57:21.950
when I was Governor.

00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:23.570
We cut the ribbon on a factory

00:57:24.475 --> 00:57:26.387
that was an engine plant,

00:57:26.387 --> 00:57:28.031
where they weren't hiring anybody,

00:57:28.031 --> 00:57:29.608
who didn't have a college degree,

00:57:29.608 --> 00:57:30.441
because you had to have people

00:57:31.489 --> 00:57:32.343
who knew how to operate the robots,

00:57:33.242 --> 00:57:34.989
and how to maintain a robotic line,

00:57:34.989 --> 00:57:36.881
and that's where manufacturing has gone.

00:57:36.881 --> 00:57:38.901
That's why we're seeing
some of the reshoring

00:57:38.901 --> 00:57:40.670
is because it's cheaper to have robots

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:41.663
and fewer people,

00:57:42.781 --> 00:57:44.409
but the people who you hire,

00:57:44.409 --> 00:57:45.450
they've got to know how to operate.

00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:47.490
It gets back to the question of training.

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:50.620
If there's a gap, it's a training gap.

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:51.480
Here's the problem,

00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.729
is that when you've got a
very technology driven job,

00:57:55.729 --> 00:57:58.360
whether it's a coding job,

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.760
or working with robots job,

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.750
the employer expects the employees to come

00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:05.450
fully trained up.

00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:07.620
They're not often willing to take the risk

00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:09.353
on training someone themselves,

00:58:10.262 --> 00:58:11.240
which gets back to this question

00:58:12.161 --> 00:58:14.240
about can the government
offer a subsidized

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:17.700
training period, so somebody
can learn those skills,

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.765
where the employer doesn't
have to pay fully for it

00:58:20.765 --> 00:58:23.465
and then transition over
to the employee training.

00:58:23.465 --> 00:58:25.756
Right now they don't.

00:58:25.756 --> 00:58:27.310
They aren't taking that risk

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:29.920
on hiring somebody who doesn't have

00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.280
a computer engineering
degree from Berkeley

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:36.200
and that's cutting out a
whole swath of the country

00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.900
and only a third of the
country have college degrees.

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:40.250
What are we doing for them?

00:58:41.838 --> 00:58:44.596
- [Man] Good evening.

00:58:44.596 --> 00:58:46.130
I have a question regarding taxation.

00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:48.140
As we move toward a knowledge economy,

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:49.740
and a data driven economy,

00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:53.080
what are the appropriate ways to capture

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.159
that revenue stream,

00:58:55.159 --> 00:58:56.700
and where do you see
that going in the future?

00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:59.377
- Well, this is a really
interesting question.

00:58:59.377 --> 00:59:02.100
My husband Dan who is sitting there

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:04.250
was just talking to me
about that this morning.

00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:06.350
You want to share your idea?

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:07.313
No, okay.

00:59:08.207 --> 00:59:10.240
(audience laughing)

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.491
But it's a really important question,

00:59:12.491 --> 00:59:14.570
because we have a tax structure,

00:59:14.570 --> 00:59:17.800
that especially with the latest tax plan

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.670
that really drives all the revenue up.

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:22.610
Benefits the people at the top

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:24.829
and the people at the bottom

00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:26.010
are left without anything.

00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:28.490
Think about a structure
that's much different

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:31.770
that really does allow
people to make the money

00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:34.000
that they need to make and earn the income

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:34.900
they need to earn,

00:59:36.167 --> 00:59:39.920
but gives a slice of that
to the folks at the bottom

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.240
because this disparity
that has been created

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.680
by the structural changes in our economy,

00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:47.020
is not benefiting everybody,

00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:51.950
and it's a redistribution
question that you asked,

00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:55.620
and whenever you talk about
redistribution in Washington DC

00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:57.990
people's hair really do catch on fire.

00:59:57.990 --> 01:00:01.160
The issue is can we elect people

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.910
who are not afraid to say, hey,

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:04.810
who are we as a society?

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.370
Are we gonna create a safety net?

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:07.620
Who are we?

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.700
Are we going to allow people
to be sleeping under bridges?

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:13.078
Because we haven't cared for them.

01:00:13.078 --> 01:00:15.680
What kind of community
do we want to create,

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.240
and one would expect
that in the 21st century,

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.462
people would say hey,
we share this planet.

01:00:23.462 --> 01:00:27.040
We share the air, as
terrible as it is today,

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.620
but we share the salaries
for the firefighters

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:34.850
who are out there fighting this mess.

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:37.840
We share responsibility for the roads

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.930
that you drove on to get here.

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:43.853
We share responsibility for
this fabulous University.

01:00:44.805 --> 01:00:47.209
We should be sharing a
responsibility for one another

01:00:47.209 --> 01:00:48.590
and keep that safety net intact,

01:00:48.590 --> 01:00:51.040
and people once you start to talk about

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.377
taking something from someone,

01:00:53.377 --> 01:00:56.220
that's when people freak
out until they need it.

01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.100
Until they need those services.

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.610
You would hope that you hold
one end of the safety net.

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:02.920
I hold the other.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.970
We hold it to make sure
that nobody falls through.

01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:08.160
One day I may need it.

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:10.064
One day you may need it,

01:01:10.064 --> 01:01:11.100
but in the end we hope that

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.010
we could create a world

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.060
where nobody gets left behind.

01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.150
Where we are like the Marines.

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:18.920
Nobody gets left behind.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:19.980
We're all going.

01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:22.060
We're not leaving anybody back.

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.010
Why can't we create a world like that?

01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:26.390
Why can't we talk about
sharing a little bit more?

01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:27.570
It's a great question.

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:29.170
Maybe you should run for office.

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.023
- [Man] You mentioned a couple times

01:01:36.023 --> 01:01:37.953
and I kept hearing the
word union and labor.

01:01:37.953 --> 01:01:41.800
Where does union fit
into the private public

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.290
relationship with training going forward,

01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:47.150
because it's always been
where people have gone

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:49.223
when they needed training.

01:01:49.223 --> 01:01:51.509
- Exactly, and it's a great moment

01:01:51.509 --> 01:01:54.010
for the unions to think about their role

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:56.070
in this digital economy.

01:01:56.070 --> 01:02:01.070
One could imagine that
there would be a data union,

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:03.500
or one of the existing unions

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:05.363
would take on the negotiation,

01:02:06.705 --> 01:02:10.200
for your compensation,
for your inputs on data.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.290
You could imagine a world where

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:15.208
the unions become the
brokers of great skill.

01:02:15.208 --> 01:02:19.930
Rather than people see
unions in these silos,

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:23.560
but when I think about
the UAW for example,

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.070
which is the union I'm most familiar with

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.809
from Michigan, United Auto Workers,

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:31.570
they were the place where
the auto workers went

01:02:31.570 --> 01:02:34.020
to get trained workers.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:35.542
They were the place.

01:02:35.542 --> 01:02:39.186
In a 21st century, why not think about

01:02:39.186 --> 01:02:42.150
those portable benefits for the workers

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:44.800
who have alternative work arrangements.

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.330
There should be a union or a negotiator

01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:53.330
or some entity that is pooling
people's desires together

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.500
and has a common face to Uber or whomever.

01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:00.501
To be able to negotiate for them.

01:03:00.501 --> 01:03:03.830
I think the unions absolutely can have

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:08.830
a new role if they look
as well, at themselves,

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:12.420
as transitioning in the 21st century.

01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.756
Not just building on old models,

01:03:15.756 --> 01:03:17.820
but looking to the future.

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.290
I think that they could.

01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:20.300
Some of them are doing it.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.350
Some of them are not.

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:25.750
- [Woman] I find it interesting
that you mention Walmart.

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:28.852
Something is very broken in our country,

01:03:28.852 --> 01:03:31.335
because workers at Walmart,

01:03:31.335 --> 01:03:33.980
a lot of them are on food stamps,

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:37.133
because they're not making a living wage.

01:03:37.133 --> 01:03:42.133
The Walton family has this
enormous enormous fortune

01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:45.230
where they decide how to spend the money.

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:47.398
It's not just looking to the government,

01:03:47.398 --> 01:03:51.407
it sounds like looking to the government

01:03:51.407 --> 01:03:56.407
to expect something
more humane from Walmart

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.263
and companies like that.

01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:03.314
- It's interesting, isn't it?

01:04:03.314 --> 01:04:06.035
That there isn't more accountability,

01:04:06.035 --> 01:04:09.900
at the level of ownership of companies.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.610
Like we, you probably
have a retirement fund,

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:15.470
and you have some shares of stock.

01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:17.505
I don't know if you have Walmart of not

01:04:17.505 --> 01:04:19.030
but the bottom line is, a lot of times,

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:21.930
we don't exercise any
power as shareholders

01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:25.540
to insist that the
companies that we invest in

01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:28.050
behave in a way that would make them

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:29.210
be part of the community,

01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:30.603
and leading as well.

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:34.350
We identify as shareholder.

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:36.910
Fudiciary responsibility of shareholders

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:38.620
to maximize profits,

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.671
and that's the only thing,

01:04:40.671 --> 01:04:43.590
that a CEO looks to, is maximizing profit.

01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:46.340
Maybe we should look at
GDP in a different way.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.160
Maybe it should be about
wellbeing of the citizens

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.812
of the country.

01:04:51.812 --> 01:04:54.600
Rather than just wellbeing of
the pocketbooks of the CEOs.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.840
I wish I had a good answer
for how to fix this.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.160
If I were Bob Reich.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.913
I would tell you the answer,

01:05:00.889 --> 01:05:02.672
but I will leave that to him,

01:05:02.672 --> 01:05:04.350
because I know he spoke
at the Weinstock series.

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:06.300
You can find him anywhere, as you know.

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.450
It's a great question about how to hold

01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:12.860
these companies to account for their role

01:05:12.860 --> 01:05:16.092
in the creation of a more equal society.

01:05:16.092 --> 01:05:18.090
- [Man] There are companies
that are trying to

01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:21.150
evaluate and give each
person a unique identifier

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.685
with a blockchain and then
evaluate the preferences.

01:05:24.685 --> 01:05:28.070
One of my friends is starting that.

01:05:28.070 --> 01:05:30.370
He's already raised $200
million for that one.

01:05:31.368 --> 01:05:32.201
- Really?

01:05:32.201 --> 01:05:33.854
- [Man] Yeah, it's a big thing.

01:05:33.854 --> 01:05:35.310
They used to run blockchain for IBM.

01:05:35.310 --> 01:05:37.097
This is Silicon Valley.

01:05:37.097 --> 01:05:38.853
- The blockchain is going to.

01:05:38.853 --> 01:05:40.723
- [Man] Well it's a unique identifier.

01:05:40.723 --> 01:05:42.197
Every unique identifier,

01:05:42.197 --> 01:05:44.110
what I want to do is
have it DNA sequenced.

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:47.170
That way it can't be modified,

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:50.440
and the other thing is
with neural networks

01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.490
you can actually set up a system

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:57.350
which would optimize
the gross value of a GDP

01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:58.840
evaluates all the workers,

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:00.020
what everybody's worth.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.960
That's probably what you should do

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.610
because the biggest problem
you have to worry about.

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:04.450
Forget Europe.

01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:06.350
It's all China, AI.

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:09.592
We're in a race to basically
stay alive against China.

01:06:09.592 --> 01:06:12.320
Whatever we have to do to optimize

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:15.670
our economic situation,

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:17.670
basically thinking like this,

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:20.190
AI will basically optimize things

01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:21.853
in a way we've never done before.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:23.880
That's what the big game is,

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.430
and we want to optimize as a society.

01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:27.830
The value of society,

01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:30.280
and you could do that
through neural networks.

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.060
You can have economic feedbacks.

01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.820
MIT tried to do this in the 60s.

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:35.503
Of course it would fail,

01:06:35.503 --> 01:06:36.640
because there wasn't
enough data information,

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:38.230
and it was too sophisticated.

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:39.700
Now we have models to do that.

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:41.420
That's what we should
really do as society.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.977
Thanks.

01:06:42.977 --> 01:06:43.894
What do you think?

01:06:43.894 --> 01:06:45.530
- Here's what I'd say.

01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:49.695
I think that tech can solve a lot of this,

01:06:49.695 --> 01:06:54.695
and we are so advanced in neural networks

01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.250
and blockchain, and the
next generation of whatever,

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.330
that we should take advantage of it,

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:06.924
and have it be part of lifting all boats,

01:07:06.924 --> 01:07:09.880
but we don't do that right now.

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:11.550
That's not how it's viewed right now.

01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:13.430
The question is how does
that get programmed?

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:16.100
I often think about this in terms of

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:18.930
the engineering schools in the country.

01:07:18.930 --> 01:07:21.138
In the medical schools,

01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:24.650
people take a Hippocratic
oath to do no harm.

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:27.110
We don't have that kind of.

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:28.620
There's not that kind of ethos

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:31.280
in many of the engineering schools

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.830
and what they're building could

01:07:32.830 --> 01:07:37.725
be benefiting ends that
don't serve our needs

01:07:37.725 --> 01:07:41.329
and so you wonder if it can start earlier,

01:07:41.329 --> 01:07:44.593
and have an ethos be built
into the education system

01:07:44.593 --> 01:07:48.111
and into whatever oath they have to take

01:07:48.111 --> 01:07:50.014
to become an engineer,

01:07:50.014 --> 01:07:52.330
that there's something that
there's a responsibility

01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:54.030
to the society, to the community,

01:07:54.030 --> 01:07:56.963
and using that technology,
to be able to lift all boats.

01:07:58.495 --> 01:08:00.069
I think is a great thing.

01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.902
Yep.

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:04.629
- [Woman] Hi.

01:08:04.629 --> 01:08:05.844
- Hi.

01:08:05.844 --> 01:08:07.770
- [Woman] I'm actually a
student studying data science.

01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:08.603
- All right!

01:08:09.608 --> 01:08:12.480
You are gonna have a job in a minute!

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.338
If you don't already!

01:08:14.338 --> 01:08:16.740
- [Woman] I actually would like to know,

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:18.860
it's very clear that technology

01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:20.830
is evolving so rapidly.

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.840
An exponential rate almost,

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.630
and I was wondering how would people

01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:27.489
entering the workforce,

01:08:27.489 --> 01:08:30.520
who are already in the
workforce evolve with it?

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.700
- That's the question.

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.240
Is I think I put it there as an example

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.100
these lifelong learning accounts,

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.531
but I think we should take
that seriously as a nation

01:08:40.531 --> 01:08:42.940
because if you're already in,

01:08:42.940 --> 01:08:45.340
you're gonna be, bless your heart,

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.200
you're a millennial.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.780
You're gonna have this great job,

01:08:48.780 --> 01:08:51.160
but at some point maybe 20 years from now

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:53.113
we're gonna need to sharpen the saw.

01:08:54.015 --> 01:08:55.430
Maybe 10 years from now.

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.986
Maybe five years, and maybe every year,

01:08:56.986 --> 01:08:57.910
you need yo go back and learn some more,

01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:59.690
because it is evolving so fast,

01:08:59.690 --> 01:09:02.150
and how do you have the ability to do that

01:09:02.150 --> 01:09:04.311
without accessing some kind of,

01:09:04.311 --> 01:09:08.750
some ability to pay for some up skill.

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:11.393
You might have an employer
that's willing to do that,

01:09:12.461 --> 01:09:13.932
but you might not too.

01:09:13.932 --> 01:09:14.960
I think everybody should
have the opportunity

01:09:15.843 --> 01:09:16.676
to continually learn

01:09:17.812 --> 01:09:20.290
and to have a lifelong continuous
portable learning account

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:24.240
where you can go back and
upgrade yourself is critical.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:25.660
It's one of the ideas that I think

01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:26.883
some are talking about,

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:31.060
but you all who are gonna
be taking the baton,

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:32.510
of leadership in this country,

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:34.310
you can make it happen.

01:09:34.310 --> 01:09:35.523
You can run for office.

01:09:37.903 --> 01:09:40.493
Were you not excited about all of these

01:09:40.493 --> 01:09:42.880
great young people who
were elected on Tuesday?

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.034
Yes!

01:09:44.034 --> 01:09:45.699
(audience applause)

01:09:45.699 --> 01:09:47.064
Diverse group.

01:09:47.064 --> 01:09:48.699
I'm so excited.

01:09:48.699 --> 01:09:50.591
- [Man] I wanted to
extend a really heartfelt

01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:52.272
thank you to Governor Granholm.

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:53.105
- You are so welcome!

01:09:53.105 --> 01:09:54.986
Thank you all for coming out!

01:09:54.986 --> 01:09:56.270
(audience applause)

01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:58.853
(upbeat music)
