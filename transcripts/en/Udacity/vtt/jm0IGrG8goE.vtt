00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.290
All right, so this is starting to get a little hairy. We've

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.890
got all these stages and all these bands and all these set times.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:06.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.100
&gt;&gt; And this band is playing multiple times. This is a lot to keep track of.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.050
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.090
&gt;&gt; And I think at real concerts or real festivals, what

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.810
they do is, they hire someone, they have a stage manager.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah because, I mean, you can be booking

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.980
these people at multiple stages, multiple times. There's a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.830
lot to manage to make sure the scheduling and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.740
everything goes to plan. But, instead of creating a Employee

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.820
object or something like that to relate as

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.640
stage managers, we can use the User object,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.369
which is a standard object that already comes

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.630
in the developer org. And it represents, you know,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.010
all the people that are actually logging into

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.870
Salesforce and using your applications. So this is

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.840
what real users would be doing in order

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.930
to log into your application and actually use it.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.270
&gt;&gt; Okay. And so that object is already there.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.350
&gt;&gt; That object already exists.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.710
&gt;&gt; It's hidden in the background. We haven't seen it yet.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.520
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.140
&gt;&gt; So if I go to Stages or something.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We want to relate the user to the stage object. So the stage would

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.750
essentially be a child to the user. Where

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.260
they're looking up to a specific user to.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.240
&gt;&gt; To figure out who the manager is.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.410
&gt;&gt; Stage manager is. Exactly.
