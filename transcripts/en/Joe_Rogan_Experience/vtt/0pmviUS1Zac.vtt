00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.553
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.830
<v 1>Hello Joe. What's going on man? Man, good to see Ya. Thanks. Thanks.</v>

3
00:00:08.831 --> 00:00:12.520
I feel a little overdressed. Sorry about that. Good. You know, ah, look at that.

4
00:00:12.521 --> 00:00:16.030
A little bit of story night there. Yeah, you're really into that, huh? Yeah,

5
00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:20.560
I got, I guess. Is that, yeah, your phone. So you remembered. Yes. Yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.130
That's on the phone. Starry night. What do I like about story night?

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.660
It's not what Vango saw that night.

8
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.450
It's what he felt. How do you know what he felt?

9
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.990
Because this is not an a representation of reality and anything that deviates

10
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:41.620
from reality is reality that has filtered through your senses.

11
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.370
And I think art edits highest is exactly that.

12
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.650
If this was an exact depiction of reality,

13
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.400
it would be a photograph and I don't need the artist. Hmm, okay.

14
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.430
So even photographs that take you to a slightly other kind of dimension as you

15
00:00:56.741 --> 00:01:00.790
gaze upon them, it's more than what was actually going on at the time.

16
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.900
And that's, that's art taken to the craft of photography.

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.510
That's why you like it this way. It's one of the reasons why. Plus,

18
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:12.511
I think it was the very first painting where it's title is the background.

19
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.390
Think about that. This could have been called, you know, in the full painting,

20
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:24.810
obviously this is a snippet. Yeah. Yeah. So there's a town there,

21
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:26.820
there's a cypress tree, there's a church depot.

22
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.410
It could have been called the cypress tree.

23
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.820
It could have been called sleepy village.

24
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.520
It could have been called rolling hills. But no,

25
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.520
it's called starry night and everything in front of it.

26
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.240
Everything in front of it is just in the way.

27
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.660
And how often do you paint something where the title is the background that

28
00:01:44.661 --> 00:01:47.070
that's my point. And in this particular case,

29
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.490
the background is the universe. And so,

30
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.640
so for me this was a pivot point in art and it's 1889 which is recent given the

31
00:01:56.701 --> 00:02:00.420
history of paintings and you know, they'd go all the way back.

32
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.540
So yeah, there, there it. Is that your favorite painting ever?

33
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.760
I have to say yes, it's not.

34
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.593
What are you doing?

35
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.310
And I have four or five ties that have this painting on them in different ways.

36
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.500
Yeah. So I'm all in. I'm all in.

37
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.480
What's interesting is that the town is [inaudible].

38
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.480
Have you seen story night in Bacon? Somebody didn't look,

39
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.400
dig it up on the screen. Somebody did it in Bacon. It was just crazy

40
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.510
weird. Yeah. So yeah.

41
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.220
How weird. Go back to the original one please.

42
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.650
What's interesting about the original one is that the town is realistically

43
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:46.680
depicted. The trees are recognizable as trees.

44
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.000
If you ever saw a sky that looked like that, the end would be here. Yeah,

45
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.051
exactly.

46
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:56.460
Plus that swirling is not wind and it's not clouds because it was,

47
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.530
if it was clouds, you wouldn't see the stars. Right. We'll start.

48
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.330
It's how he felt. That's all I can tell you. By the way, that is a real evening,

49
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.720
so that's, sorry. It's not even the, it's early morning. The crescent moon,

50
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:12.400
when it's that orientation means this is before sunrise and that white object

51
00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:14.650
lower on the horizon, that sort of glowy,

52
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:19.060
that's very likely Venus and that enables us to trace what's over,

53
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.470
what set of weeks. This painting was actually painted. So it's,

54
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.500
it's kind of like a forensic astronomy as they will done an analysis of like

55
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.780
where he must have been. Yeah. That's well known. Yeah.

56
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:35.200
He was in a real place and so that [inaudible] pull this out of his ass. Right.

57
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:39.490
I mean it was, he painted what he saw folded into what he felt.

58
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.320
Yeah. That's how art should be, I think. Yeah. Otherwise, what do you,

59
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.370
what do you need artists for a make cool shit?

60
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.260
The cool stuff is something that they felt that it came out of them. Yeah.

61
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.930
And they feel stuff. They, artists feel, feel the,

62
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.560
the natural world in ways different from the rest of us.

63
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.810
And that's why they're artists.

64
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.740
Do they or do they just express it with oh sorry. Yes. They not only, yes,

65
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:06.580
we all can feel it,

66
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:09.970
but to be able to express it that that's a whole other talent.

67
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.690
They know what I think about often. Um, why do you,

68
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:18.650
why do we all know who Paul Revere is? All right. We all, we,

69
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.860
we, it's a household name yet.

70
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:24.820
Is there any other war ever fought in the history of the world?

71
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.080
We're a household name is the name of the person who told other people the enemy

72
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:32.290
was coming. We, we can mention his name,

73
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:36.340
but we can't list the generals that all fought in that war. Why?

74
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.400
It's because a poem was written about him and he had this mundane job.

75
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:46.090
Let me tell people the enemy is coming and so the artists, in this case,

76
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:51.091
the poet elevated the mundane to something that forces you to,

77
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.280
to reckon it with your understanding of this world.

78
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.620
What's Joyce Joyce Kilmer, his most famous poem about a tree.

79
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.100
Dogs piss on trees. You drive by trees.

80
00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:10.090
You don't even know they're there yet. A poem about a tree.

81
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:13.630
I'll never see something as lovely as a tree. Oh my gosh,

82
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.870
this is so the art forces you to pause and just reflect on things that you took

83
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:20.470
for granted,

84
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.470
things that became ordinary in your life and they were elevated to to two.

85
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.900
They get beatified by the talents of artists will be edify.

86
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:35.740
You never know. We identify. Yeah, I'm using it loosely.

87
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:39.040
It's the intermediate step between being an ordinary person and being a saint.

88
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.910
The beatification of someone in the Catholic Church,

89
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.110
I would've thought it's making something more beautiful. Uh, oh, maybe. Okay.

90
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:51.340
I don't, it could have similar roots be attribute be UTM man. I couldn't,

91
00:05:51.341 --> 00:05:52.180
it could come from that.

92
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.830
But to be at BB ratified as the first steps on route to sainthood.

93
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.030
Oh yeah. That's, if I remember the word correctly. Here it goes. Oh, you got it.

94
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.560
Pull it up.

95
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.350
The definition to make supremely happy Christianity declare to have attained

96
00:06:06.351 --> 00:06:11.240
blessedness of heaven and authorize the title blessed and limited public

97
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:14.840
religious honor. She was beatified six years after her death.

98
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.800
So I think you can't become a saint unless you previously been beatified.

99
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.450
I think that's the role,

100
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.840
but I'm looking at the number one definition of there to make supremely happy.

101
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.270
So that's interest. Interesting. Yeah. That, that yeah,

102
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.400
that moved ahead of a definition of beatify. Yeah.

103
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.090
So it's a two beatified the, the verb was up there. Uh, you had on the screen,

104
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.370
Roman Catholic Church. Uh,

105
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.300
he beatified one Diego Indian belief to have a vision of a Virgin Mary,

106
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.630
a synonyms canonize sanctify, hollow consecrate.

107
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.070
So I think if you take something ordinary and you subject it to the

108
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:50.210
interpretation of an artist,

109
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.130
it can be beatified and elevated on a level where it becomes a household

110
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.080
recognition of its importance in this world.

111
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:00.890
So my brothers and artists, my brothers and artists,

112
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.170
so I have a kind of art fine art,

113
00:07:03.171 --> 00:07:07.940
but also he paints and he teaches history of art. So I, I,

114
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.870
I've had this sort of baptism my whole life being exposed to him. I'm the,

115
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.320
you know, the, the sip, the sibling scientist, but the,

116
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.920
they have an artist in the family. I this,

117
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.800
everyone should have an artist in family. I've got an uncle and of course the,

118
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:26.420
the whole steam movement, science, technology, engineering and math. Uh,

119
00:07:26.421 --> 00:07:29.210
the artists got in, they say, wait, I'm so stem the stem movement.

120
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.530
So I say they want to throw in the A to get art as part of that movement.

121
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.410
Science, technology, engineering, art and math. Change it from stem to steam.

122
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.790
So steam. So you get full steam ahead. Steam is a better word in that. Well,

123
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:42.620
they both good words for what they need,

124
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.800
but I just sounds like a bunch of awesome stuff like it does and yeah,

125
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:51.650
throw in comedy and building houses, you know,

126
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:54.830
it seems like you're getting very, it's like the LBGTQ

127
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.470
do things that get really squirrely when you start adding more letters. Yeah,

128
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.220
you can add letters, but if it doesn't spell anything,

129
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:03.440
then the memorization has to kick in. But steam,

130
00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:06.120
you don't have to memorize that it's already there for you. Right.

131
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:10.370
So it's cleverly conceived. I think it's the abbreviation was it?

132
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.840
It's tacit recognition that these are elements in society that advanced

133
00:08:14.841 --> 00:08:19.250
civilization and, and grow the economy actually.

134
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:20.570
So in fact,

135
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:25.430
there's hardly any growth economy in the world that isn't growing because it has

136
00:08:25.431 --> 00:08:30.170
been for not having been touched by science or technology, everything.

137
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.680
Just think about it. So if you're round running,

138
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.260
you don't have them on your show. But if you're running around saying,

139
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:39.650
I don't like science, science is bad, science is evil. Okay,

140
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.680
well then you will die in poverty if you elect officials who believe that as

141
00:08:45.201 --> 00:08:45.710
well.

142
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.710
Who the fuck thinks that science is bad in 2019 and how do they express this?

143
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.320
They express it through science. Okay, so you know what I'm saying?

144
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:55.154
Like are they saying it?

145
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.700
I have a book coming out in a month called letters from an astrophysicist. Okay.

146
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:03.000
Yeah, it's, it's not, it's not out yet, but I've got it.

147
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:06.840
It's not how did you get a copy? But I don't even have my copy yet.

148
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.580
But what I'm saying in there I,

149
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:15.770
there's a whole chapter on just angry people who don't like anything including

150
00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:19.320
science. And one of them, it's a, it's a, it's a riff. He just says, I hate it.

151
00:09:19.321 --> 00:09:20.820
And it's science that science is,

152
00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.480
it brings some of the worst things that's ever happened to humanity and

153
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:28.080
pollution and this, he goes on and on and on and on and on. And so I reply,

154
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.110
there's letters from an astrophysicist and I, and I reply as,

155
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:36.170
as commonly and as rationally as is possible when you get attacked that way.

156
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.330
But what I'm saying is, um,

157
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:43.470
not everyone embraces everything that science does and some will cherry pick it.

158
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.710
You have the science deniers for global warming of science deniers with

159
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:50.100
vaccines. You have science Meyers with GMOs. You know, there's,

160
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:55.110
there's all manner of science denying going on in modern society and you know,

161
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:59.370
we in a free society, what are you going to do, right?

162
00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:01.560
That people can think what they want. But if,

163
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:06.510
if thinking what they want influences policy, which then affects everybody,

164
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:11.870
then your science denial has consequences to the economic health of the nation.

165
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:17.010
And by the way, it's not only economics, it's your, the economic health,

166
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.730
it's your physical health cause medicine flows through advances in science as

167
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:21.840
well as our security.

168
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:27.240
Well this people that deny some aspects of science while conveniently using

169
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:29.730
other, that's where it gets weird, right?

170
00:10:29.731 --> 00:10:34.731
You're driving a car that's relying on gps using a phone to complain about the

171
00:10:35.221 --> 00:10:39.140
global warming hoax. You know, you're right. Correct. One of my more,

172
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:43.430
a more sort of popular tweets was you remember when the,

173
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.790
we had the photo of the black hole from a distant galaxy and it was,

174
00:10:47.791 --> 00:10:50.660
it was banner headlines maybe a year ago, less than a year ago,

175
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.370
banner headlines and a first photo ever of a black hole.

176
00:10:55.371 --> 00:10:59.180
And it was an astounding engineering achievement to accomplish that.

177
00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:03.590
It was multiple telescopes all around the world pooling the data to get it

178
00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:03.921
right.

179
00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:07.550
And it was one of the greatest collaborative efforts we've ever undertaken in my

180
00:11:07.551 --> 00:11:11.420
field of astrophysics. Okay. And everybody was loving the results.

181
00:11:11.421 --> 00:11:12.650
So all I tweeted was

182
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.290
scientists report first photo of a black hole public.

183
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.810
Ah, scientists report. Humans are warming the earth.

184
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.800
Oh, you brought it up. Okay. Scientists,

185
00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.830
we produced the first ever image of a supermassive black hole,

186
00:11:30.831 --> 00:11:35.420
55 million light years away. The response, Ooh, scientists,

187
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.970
we've concluded the humans are catastrophic warming.

188
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.330
The Earth response that conflicts with what I want to be true.

189
00:11:41.331 --> 00:11:42.920
So it must be false. Well,

190
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.000
that is the cherry picking of science as the Cherry picking assignments.

191
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.610
But the, the global warming thing is very much connected to, uh,

192
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.610
a certain type of ideology. A certain type of person who thinks mattered to me.

193
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.940
No nonsense person, I'm saying yes, it does matter. What I'm,

194
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:03.180
what I'm trying to say is that is a demographic that has cherry picked science

195
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.700
to deny human caused global warming.

196
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.630
There are other democratic demographics that have cherry picked other science to

197
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:11.980
deny other things.

198
00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.570
And it's not all located in one political spectrum.

199
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.930
I mean in one political branch, right?

200
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.010
So you tend to find liberal folk complaining that the conservatives who have

201
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:28.450
embraced node, the node global warming platform or denying science,

202
00:12:28.451 --> 00:12:29.830
and they need science on their side,

203
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.450
and many of those same people are rubbing crystals together to be healed by the

204
00:12:34.451 --> 00:12:35.350
crystal energy.

205
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.700
Or they're denying vaccines thinking that there's some somehow bad for you.

206
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.080
And so,

207
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:46.620
so all of this requires some are total rejection of mainstream science.

208
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.840
And we were living in that world now and I don't know,

209
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.800
I don't think it'll stop the progress of civilization,

210
00:12:56.801 --> 00:13:01.210
but it can certainly slow it down and occasionally stall it. Well,

211
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.810
that is certainly a problem, but how big of a problem is it?

212
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:09.760
Like how many people are really in denial of science in 2019 it's gotta be for

213
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:11.590
me in a free country, that's not what matters.

214
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:16.000
What matters is in a free country that you elect officials who are not official.

215
00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.850
Yes. You elect people who are scientifically literate.

216
00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.680
They don't have to be scientists,

217
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.080
a I G or if they're not scientifically illiterate.

218
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:29.100
They should be self aware of that and then listen to people who are so don't you

219
00:13:31.751 --> 00:13:33.940
think what they're doing though is they're,

220
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.930
they're doing what their constituents would like them to do.

221
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:42.820
That's why I don't be politicians over the head ever. I don't do that.

222
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.440
We're where we're a republic. We're a democracy. Whatever they believe.

223
00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.410
If they think earth is 6,000 years old and they got elected,

224
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:54.400
it's because the people elected them believe their earth is 6,000 years old or

225
00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:57.600
because they're willing to let that one go because they believe in the hot pot.

226
00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:58.453
Possibly.

227
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.760
That's a good point because you have a portfolio of thoughts and beliefs all

228
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.000
because he's such a profound Christian. I mean,

229
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:06.420
he's so profoundly Christian that he's,

230
00:14:06.421 --> 00:14:10.420
he just wants any of Christians who are connected to science that don't,

231
00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:14.140
including the pope, by the way, you know, can get more Christian than the pope.

232
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.440
All right? He believes in science. Now this new pope is pretty interesting.

233
00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.340
If you read, if you read his in cyclical from a couple of years ago, it's, it's,

234
00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.650
it's a scientifically literate doc document and no,

235
00:14:26.651 --> 00:14:29.470
this, okay, so it's not, he's still religious, right?

236
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.470
So Jesus still rose from the dead and there was still miracles and all the rest

237
00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:36.190
of that in the new testament so that he's not in denial of that.

238
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:40.840
But given that he is saying, oh my gosh, here's something we,

239
00:14:40.841 --> 00:14:44.440
the religious community and scientists can partner behind and that if we want to

240
00:14:44.441 --> 00:14:45.760
save life on earth,

241
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.750
and so we have to be better shepherds of what is going on on this earth.

242
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.680
And one of them is we don't want to flood low lying countries in the South

243
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.490
Pacific where the average sea level is 10 feet above sea level or whatever it

244
00:14:58.491 --> 00:15:02.600
is, you're gonna lose these countries if you keep melting our, our,

245
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:05.900
our um, uh, the, the, that, the ice caps,

246
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:09.330
cause that would include the north and there's no land in the north. So, uh,

247
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.170
the glacier ice, that's land-based ice, right?

248
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.600
Cause any ice that's in the water floating that can melt in,

249
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.300
it's not gonna change the water level.

250
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.770
So it's why you can do this experiments really cool. Fill up your glass,

251
00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:24.230
put some a few cubes of ice in a glass of water,

252
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.100
fill the glass up as much as you possibly can without spilling it.

253
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.370
And the ice is bobbing above that level. Okay?

254
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:33.920
Cause ice is about 10% buoyant on that.

255
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.070
About 10% of an ice cube will be lifted above this. This is,

256
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.270
this is the iceberg equation, right? Right. That's the tip of the iceberg. Well,

257
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.890
you see the 10% above and 90% is not visible to you. This is, by the way,

258
00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.740
I don't want to get to too many off-ramps here, but that's one of the,

259
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.220
one of the things that they did right in titanic. Okay.

260
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:55.190
If you look at the earliest titanic movie there was in black and white,

261
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.850
they see this huge iceberg on the horizon and then it can,

262
00:15:58.851 --> 00:16:03.260
they can't swear away from it cause it, oh my gosh, it doesn't have, no,

263
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.333
no.

264
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.120
The iceberg that cuts the bottom of your boat is a little bit of ice sticking

265
00:16:08.121 --> 00:16:11.780
out above the water because 90% of it is underwater and that's where the damage

266
00:16:11.781 --> 00:16:15.320
occurs. And in the James Cameron Titanic,

267
00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:20.460
the iceberg that they hit above water was, looks like a little chunk of ice it.

268
00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.660
Oh, that couldn't hurt anything. All the damage was under water. Anyhow,

269
00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:24.560
so back to this,

270
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.540
so do this experiment and then let the glass sit there and let the ice melt and

271
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:33.860
the water level will stay the same because when ice melts, it gets,

272
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.560
takes up lower volume than it was when it became ice.

273
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.620
And that's why pipes break.

274
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.940
I thought pipes break just because the water expands. Yeah,

275
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.370
I just described that in the opposite direction. Oh Wow. As it freezes it.

276
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.040
But I didn't know it gets larger. That's what expansion means. What kind of,

277
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:55.890
what your vocabulary here, right? No, but I'm saying like, no, no. Right, right.

278
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.680
So, so your ice cube is sitting at 10%.

279
00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.010
Your Ice Cube is sitting 10% above the water level and it melts and becomes

280
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:05.780
water. The water takes up 90% of the volume of the ice.

281
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:10.010
So that just melt back into the water and it doesn't overflow even though it was

282
00:17:10.011 --> 00:17:12.440
sticking above the waterline when you had the glass.

283
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:16.630
So now let's do the opposite. Okay. There's water in the pipes, right? What,

284
00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:21.490
can I tell you something that might blow your mind? No, sure. Is that allowed?

285
00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:25.040
I don't know. How many times does your mind you? At least once a day. Yeah.

286
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:28.230
At least we need your mind blown. Okay. Here's how it works. Okay.

287
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:32.870
So let's put water in the pipes. Okay. Um,

288
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.950
and then the temperature drops. The pipes have a certain strength.

289
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:42.150
Copper pipes, you know, they're rigid. Okay. I grew up in breaking pipes.

290
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.313
Okay. So Watch,

291
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.930
it's so the water's in there and now the temperature begins to drop. Okay.

292
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:53.220
Um, the water wants to turn to ice,

293
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:59.070
but it can't because the pipe is containing it.

294
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.410
So just sits there. Okay. At 32 degrees as water,

295
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:08.670
even though the temperature outside is dropping below 32 degrees,

296
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:13.380
okay. And it still sits there, gets the 30 degrees,

297
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:18.381
29 the pipe is squeezing that attempt of this water to become ice.

298
00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.600
And the act of squeezing it prevents the temperature from dropping. Okay?

299
00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.490
And you as the temperature drops,

300
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:30.450
depending on how strong the pipe is to and the temperature gradient across it,

301
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.890
as the outside temperature continue, it gets to now 25 degrees,

302
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.660
the pipe is still holding onto the liquid water that gets,

303
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.370
and it's still 32 degrees inside there and it holds onto and it's keeps

304
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.330
happening and keeps happening.

305
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.600
You get a point where the pipe can no longer contain the water and the water

306
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.170
freezes spontaneously.

307
00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.320
It just goes right down to that temperature.

308
00:18:55.321 --> 00:18:59.460
And the pipe is helpless in the face of this. So the point is,

309
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:01.260
the stronger the pipe is,

310
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.180
the lower the temperature has to be outside for the freezing water to break it.

311
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:07.290
So theoretically,

312
00:19:07.291 --> 00:19:09.750
if you had a pipe that was made of a stronger material than copper,

313
00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:11.760
you can get even lower than you can get an even lower temperatures.

314
00:19:11.761 --> 00:19:16.100
How low can you get? Uh, when,

315
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:18.340
when things freeze, they have to expand. So what, uh,

316
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.540
not only when water freezes does water expand? When it's, it's, it's,

317
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.130
it's a remarkable fact about water that is shared by very few other ingredients.

318
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.070
Most things when they cool, they shrink as all men know.

319
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.000
So, uh, so, so most,

320
00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.340
most materials cause things cooler.

321
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:41.760
The vibrating molecules slow down and they take up less space.

322
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:46.530
Water is the opposite of that as it passes down through. So,

323
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.670
so I'm going to describe to you an extraordinary fact about water and why we're

324
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:54.930
alive today. Okay? So Watch, let's take a lake that has fish in it. Okay.

325
00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:59.460
Temperature drops outside and the lake slowly begins to get cooler because

326
00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.730
there's a 10 time lag between the air temperature and the waters.

327
00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.050
That's why the first freeze, the lake is still there, it's gotta be cold longer.

328
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:11.310
I said, what happens? The water gets cold on the surface. Okay.

329
00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.073
And

330
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.600
it begins to, okay,

331
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.310
the water gets cold on a surface and it begins to shrink so that water false is

332
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:25.680
shrink. That makes it denser. It falls to the bottom fine.

333
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.560
It does that down to about four degrees Celsius.

334
00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:32.520
As it goes from four degrees Celsius to zero degrees Celsius,

335
00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:33.354
the freezing point,

336
00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:39.050
it begins to expand and become less dense than the water.

337
00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:43.170
So now as the water wants to actually freeze,

338
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.070
it stays on top. When it does freeze,

339
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:51.010
you freeze the top surface of the lake. Well, how about the water below it?

340
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.960
It's insulated from the dropping air temperature and the fish don't die.

341
00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.220
Imagine if ice were denser than water. What would happen?

342
00:21:00.221 --> 00:21:03.280
You'd freeze the top layer. It would sink. The bottom is frozen freeze.

343
00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:05.170
The next layer it sinks and fish.

344
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:10.380
We'd be systematically forced to swim in shallower and shallower waters until

345
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:15.391
they were all freeze dried on the top surface of the lake and all fishes would

346
00:21:17.291 --> 00:21:21.160
be dead every winter. I think it's every lake fish.

347
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.970
What he's suppose to say fishes, fishes is a, is a double plural.

348
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:29.020
You could do that. Yeah. You never heard fish was dead. You never called deer.

349
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:30.700
Would you say all deers? Well,

350
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.220
because generally it's one if you had multiple kinds of deer. Oh,

351
00:21:34.221 --> 00:21:38.030
so have you had like Sitcom, but it's rare that they're all in the same place.

352
00:21:38.031 --> 00:21:39.230
You only have one kind of deal with me.

353
00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.980
But if the ocean has many kinds of fish in the same place. Oh yeah.

354
00:21:42.981 --> 00:21:46.580
That's interesting. So you'd say fishes, fishes, it's a double floor.

355
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:50.810
It's different kinds of plural fish. Oh yeah, the double blow my mind.

356
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.600
You didn't know you didn't know that again. Oh No, no, I didn't know.

357
00:21:53.601 --> 00:21:56.690
I never thought of it that way. There are many fishes in the Oh yeah, yeah.

358
00:21:56.691 --> 00:22:00.700
So sorry. She's in the seat. Yeah. So multiple plurals uh,

359
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.990
different types of fish to get where ocean water freezes.

360
00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.630
Cause that's where it was salt is salt water.

361
00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.870
Did you have the reef fishes up there?

362
00:22:05.871 --> 00:22:10.040
Some weird anomaly that happened where there was too or too little oxygen in the

363
00:22:10.041 --> 00:22:14.150
water and somehow the frozen fish got pushed out in a wall of ice.

364
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.260
Is the South Dakota

365
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:20.960
[inaudible] so there's too little oxygen. I don't know. I can't explain that.

366
00:22:20.961 --> 00:22:22.420
I don't know what happened there. If you look at the,

367
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.120
if you look at the green in the water, most likely it's algae.

368
00:22:26.121 --> 00:22:29.000
So that happens with certain legs that get polluted with certain types of,

369
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.960
you can kill the lake by doing that job. Well you get it in the ocean too.

370
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.090
You get these zones but I don't see how you get frozen fish though.

371
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.350
That's incredible. But Scroll, stop, go back up.

372
00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.320
Scroll down. So we could read it for free fish.

373
00:22:42.321 --> 00:22:46.580
Frozen a wall of ice in South Dakota is Lake Andes. National Wildlife Refuge.

374
00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:51.230
That's incredible man. Is that a video Jamie? The pictures though?

375
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:52.203
I don't know.

376
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.250
I don't know how they froze cause they can just swim to where it's not frozen.

377
00:22:55.251 --> 00:22:58.830
So I'd have to, I'd have to do more homework on that one to see what,

378
00:22:58.831 --> 00:23:00.970
what caused that. Wow. Gotcha. So,

379
00:23:00.971 --> 00:23:05.971
so my point is because of this property of water that ice floats,

380
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.000
it insulates the bottom layers of the lake and fish can survive over the winter.

381
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.040
That's because of this work too. Right? Insulate.

382
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:17.210
So you can inside you get a like a nice dog. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

383
00:23:17.211 --> 00:23:20.120
I mean if you put a barrier between you and the changing elements outside,

384
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.810
that's basically an insulating layer. Have you ever done ice fishing? No,

385
00:23:23.811 --> 00:23:24.644
I never, never.

386
00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:29.390
It's a good one to New York City life person in New York City.

387
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:31.410
People go ice fishing, I'm sure in central.

388
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.620
Do Women go ice fishing to get away from their husbands? They do.

389
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.280
It's like why do people golf? You know,

390
00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:43.040
ice fishing is a particularly weird because you have to continually scoop out

391
00:23:43.041 --> 00:23:45.620
the ice and maybe even drill. Right?

392
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.920
So that works because frozen water is less dense than non frozen water and it's

393
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:53.480
one of the rare ingredients for which that so,

394
00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:58.481
and it's likely there would be no life on land or anywhere on earth if that were

395
00:23:58.581 --> 00:24:00.320
the case, if the opposite of that were the case.

396
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.480
So water is a very special ingredient to life on earth.

397
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.700
It's cited by many religious folks is saying, see Earth is sacred for these.

398
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:13.040
It's in the list of special ingredients for what make earth habitable for life.

399
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.220
That that is a really strange thing though,

400
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:19.430
that if you can contain it somehow or an incredibly strong pipe, yes,

401
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:22.430
it won't freeze. Yes. It will freeze the temperature variant though.

402
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:23.630
Is there a number?

403
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.020
Well that's what doesn't matter why pipes don't freeze when it just hits 30

404
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:28.700
degrees outside. That's not when you hear it.

405
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:32.810
It freezes when it gets really low, when the crack and yeah,

406
00:24:32.811 --> 00:24:36.410
and then it'll just, it'll break the copper like it's paper, tear it.

407
00:24:36.411 --> 00:24:41.120
Like it's like, it's now on the flip side of that,

408
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.590
try this at home.

409
00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.270
Take an ice cube that's like at 30 degrees.

410
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:49.520
Okay. Uh, how would you measure that?

411
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:53.250
Pull out an ice cube and just because there'll be at near zero Fahrenheit if

412
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.910
you, if you have a good freezer, just pull that and leave it on the counter,

413
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.850
put it, put it on a wooden cutting board. Okay.

414
00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.380
And just let it sit there for like 10 minutes and its temperature will come up.

415
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.230
There'll be a point where it hasn't melted yet,

416
00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.780
but you can take it and squeeze the Ice Cube and you can force it to melt by

417
00:25:11.781 --> 00:25:15.920
squeezing it cause you're forcing it into a smaller volume that it currently

418
00:25:15.921 --> 00:25:20.780
contains. And the only way you can accomplish that is if the ice turns to water,

419
00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:23.270
then it will occupy a smaller volume.

420
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:26.390
So the act of squeezing ice can actually melt it.

421
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.310
So if you had some sort of a pipe that could physically construct like something

422
00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:32.310
that had threads in it,

423
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.690
there could wind down to a smaller size and you could stick a cylinder of ice in

424
00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:39.320
it and you could slowly crank it. Oh yeah. Yes, yes. It would melt. Yes,

425
00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:42.590
you can melt if you had some machine that squeezed ice.

426
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.510
And the cold or the ice is the harder, the more the,

427
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.610
the harder it would be for you to squeeze it to, to accomplish that.

428
00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:53.150
So it's sort of fun with ice. In fact, you know what else you can do?

429
00:25:53.151 --> 00:25:58.100
This is a harder experiment to do. If you take a mesh like a screen Mesh,

430
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:02.380
it has to be sort of wider openings then a screen door would, uh,

431
00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:04.390
so what would this be like a fence, like a,

432
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:09.430
a chain link fence and behold horizontally and get a big block of ice and just

433
00:26:09.951 --> 00:26:12.380
place it on top. A block of ice that's heavy.

434
00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:15.470
What'll happen is the ice,

435
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:20.500
the weight of the ice will melt the ice in the contact points of the chain

436
00:26:22.041 --> 00:26:27.041
itself because it's feeling that pressure to squeeze it into a smaller volume.

437
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.700
But by the time it melts,

438
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.880
the ice has now passed through the grate and it will refreeze on the other side.

439
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:39.710
So you can actually pass a block of ice through a chain link fence vertically

440
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.740
just by pushing it. Yeah, it's pretty, it's a pretty cool,

441
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:46.950
it's a slow experiment, but it's wrong. I mean,

442
00:26:46.951 --> 00:26:50.280
it depends on the temperature of the ice and how and how and how much it weighs.

443
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.970
Because the pressure is what, this is why. This is why you can ice skate.

444
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:55.770
Why can you skate on ice?

445
00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:01.190
Because the edge of the blade is very high pressure on the ice and it's melting

446
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:04.500
a bead of water and you're actually gliding on water when you're skating,

447
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.310
you're not skating on slippery ice. Really? Yes.

448
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:12.690
I thought you were just cutting the ice with the blade. Well, so the blade,

449
00:27:12.691 --> 00:27:15.900
have you ever seen a sharpened blade? It's not just flat.

450
00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.710
There's actually a concave cross-section to it. So each edge,

451
00:27:19.711 --> 00:27:23.850
the left edge and the right edge is, is basically a knife edge. Okay.

452
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:27.620
Not quite as sharp as a knife, but it's, you can feel how it's,

453
00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:30.540
it's sharp so that when you lean on that edge,

454
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.190
either your inner edge or outer edge,

455
00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:37.760
your entire body weight is being held up on this on a very narrow surface area

456
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.330
of the blade. So the pressure is extreme. It's like, you know,

457
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.950
thousand pounds per square inch. You don't weigh a thousand pounds,

458
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:50.910
but you're not skating on a square inch. Right? So you,

459
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.230
you do the math on that and what you can have is, uh,

460
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.660
you will skate and you're actually,

461
00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:02.040
what makes it so slippery on ice skates is because you're moving on a beat of

462
00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:05.640
water that freezes right behind you as you go past it, dude.

463
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:09.030
Yeah. So it's possible for ice to be so cold.

464
00:28:09.031 --> 00:28:13.170
You can't really skate on it because even that pressure is not enough to melt

465
00:28:13.171 --> 00:28:15.090
it. How cold would it have to be that I,

466
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:19.500
I last I did a calculation was really cold, like tens of degrees below zero.

467
00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:23.370
How does dry ice work? Oh, it's just frozen carbon dioxide. That's all.

468
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.260
So here's the difference. Here's the difference.

469
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:30.380
You have a block of frozen h two o and a block of frozen CO2.

470
00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.793
So there they are.

471
00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:37.190
It turns out the air pressure on earth is high enough at sea level,

472
00:28:38.131 --> 00:28:43.131
is high enough to allow the ice to melt and sustain a liquid state.

473
00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:47.913
<v 2>Okay.</v>

474
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.300
<v 1>The CO2 under air pressure, normal air pressure.</v>

475
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:58.520
It wants to melt, but it can't sustain a liquid and it goes straight to gas.

476
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:04.040
If we had much higher air pressure, you could,

477
00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:07.100
you could have CO2 melt and have liquid CO2.

478
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.770
So now watch it happen. So, so can I blow your mind again? This is just,

479
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.550
this is really good stuff. Okay. It's good. Like physical chemistry.

480
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.190
So here you go. So Watch, it happens.

481
00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:23.990
So what happens if I reduce the air pressure? Okay,

482
00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.830
well the transition from ice to water is still the same. It's not effected,

483
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.340
but the boiling point is affected. As you know,

484
00:29:31.341 --> 00:29:35.330
cooking times have to be adjusted on mountaintops because when you boil water is

485
00:29:35.331 --> 00:29:38.540
not 212 degrees. Depending on the height of the mountain,

486
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:43.630
there's less air pressing down that Ph preventing it from boiling. Okay?

487
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:46.390
The boiling point is not some absolute fact about the water.

488
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.030
It has to do with what the air pressure is sitting above it.

489
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.100
Do you have an extremely high air pressure?

490
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.360
Water has to go to a much higher temperature before it boils. So our,

491
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:59.320
so the boiling point of water that's reported in all textbooks is at sea level.

492
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.330
At one atmospheric pressure. That's how you get 212 degrees.

493
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.260
If you start reducing the atmospheric pressure, it's 210 degrees, 205 degrees,

494
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:13.420
200 degrees, 190 degrees, 180 degrees. 180 oh yes.

495
00:30:13.421 --> 00:30:17.530
And so that's not as hot as 212 degrees. She got to cook the food longer.

496
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:22.300
All cooking times are increased for this reason. So now watch,

497
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:26.260
I'm not done with you. Oh, let's keep reducing the air pressure.

498
00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.120
Okay. Theoretical possible. No,

499
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:34.300
no Himalayas. Yep. But or take it up.

500
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:38.920
You can ascend in some kind of copter or some kind of device or air balloon or

501
00:30:38.921 --> 00:30:42.340
whatever. But I'm saying you can do this experiment in a, in a, in a laboratory.

502
00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:46.090
Okay. Okay. You keep reducing the air pressure. Boiling point keeps dropping.

503
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:51.430
It's a hard in 70 degrees, 150120100 degrees Fahrenheit,

504
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.680
80 degrees Fahrenheit, 50 degrees Fahrenheit,

505
00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.840
40 degrees Fahrenheit, 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

506
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.890
Holy Shit. What happens?

507
00:31:06.250 --> 00:31:08.560
The ice melts and becomes water,

508
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.500
the water evaporates and become steam.

509
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.260
And all of that's happening at 32 degrees.

510
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:18.460
There is an atmospheric pressure for which water,

511
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:23.500
ice and steam coexist and it's called the triple point of water.

512
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.900
And all ingredients have a triple point. Wow.

513
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:33.460
What is Mars? Mars is very close to the triple point of water.

514
00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:34.810
So you can have,

515
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:39.990
you can have a simultaneous bath in certain regions of Mars,

516
00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.560
a simultaneous bath because the air pressure is so low. It's like one,

517
00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:47.050
100th earth's air pressure. It's very, very low.

518
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.490
So you have a place where a pot of water,

519
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.500
ice cubes and steam are coming out all at once. Is that the triple point?

520
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.941
So, so,

521
00:31:57.941 --> 00:32:02.941
so here's the lesson here is we live life in our world at one atmospheric

522
00:32:04.901 --> 00:32:08.080
pressure at one, um,

523
00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.630
uh, room temperature, atmospheric pressure.

524
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:17.720
And we define what is normal based on that life experience based on how,

525
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:20.380
how our senses interact with that environment.

526
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:26.070
But the actual universe is far freakier than what we,

527
00:32:28.181 --> 00:32:31.330
that what our senses are exposed, our five senses are exposed to on earth.

528
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:37.420
What did you think about Elon Musk's idea about nuking the poles of Mars in

529
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.780
order to make it warmer? Yes. So some of these are kind of pie in the sky ideas,

530
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:44.690
right? But let's, let's get to what he's trying to get at.

531
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:48.410
What you want to do is you want to introduce warmth.

532
00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.750
You want to block the ozone,

533
00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:55.160
you want to block the ultraviolet so that you can protect organic life,

534
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:59.090
right? So we have an ozone layer. It's the three oxygen atoms.

535
00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:04.120
Oh three and oxygen or ozone likes ultraviolet light.

536
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:09.920
So ultra bright light comes from the sun. It gets eaten by ozone, it gets eaten.

537
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.630
And when you do that, the ultra right light doesn't make it to Earth surface.

538
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.470
So even though they say, oh, where, where, uh,

539
00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:22.100
sunscreen and Sunblock, 45? Yes,

540
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.150
that's for the 1% of the ultraviolet that gets through the atmosphere.

541
00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.940
If you're above the atmosphere, you are fried. So the PR,

542
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:36.070
because ultraviolet is highly hostile to organic molecules and what we're made

543
00:33:36.561 --> 00:33:41.180
of as life. So you want to protect, you want to give life a chance.

544
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.610
So you want to not only heat Mars,

545
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.610
you want to find a way to block the ultraviolet light coming from the sun.

546
00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.090
So you need some mechanism, if not ozone, where it just live underground,

547
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.630
for example. Okay. And so, uh,

548
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:58.750
so I don't think we should think of the idea as a literal thing,

549
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:04.100
but just, it's a general principle of what you want to accomplish on Mars.

550
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:05.870
In doing so. Do you want a warm it?

551
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:10.730
You want to protect what could be the future of, uh, biochemistry.

552
00:34:10.731 --> 00:34:15.530
And then you seed it and you, and then you wait. You want to wait too long.

553
00:34:15.531 --> 00:34:19.220
You want it. So to speed it up if you could. And then you terraform Mars,

554
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.310
space x has, I visited him a couple of times. He's,

555
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:26.180
he's got a mug you can buy there. Then it has Mars on it. Okay.

556
00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:31.440
And then you put, put hot liquid in it and Mars turns to an airable,

557
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.630
a blue green marble. So yeah, it's very good.

558
00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.020
And it doesn't tell you that when you, Zoe, I got a Mars Mug, you know,

559
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.660
and you show it off and go, oh my gosh, well what did that happen?

560
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.790
Is it Earth Mug? But it doesn't look like earth.

561
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:47.200
There's a lot of people that go, uh, on, uh,

562
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:52.550
also we think there's a lot of water that was once on Mars,

563
00:34:52.551 --> 00:34:55.940
which is a certainty and we think it's just sitting below in a permafrost.

564
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:59.750
So you wouldn't have to bring water to Mars by the way.

565
00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:00.920
And the really distant future,

566
00:35:00.921 --> 00:35:03.470
you can just redirect a comment and get all the water you need.

567
00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:06.830
But how far distant is that? The comments everywhere, dude.

568
00:35:06.831 --> 00:35:09.230
We're not shooting galleries. That's not what I asked. Oh,

569
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:13.160
how do you think it is before we could read the right, how far away in time?

570
00:35:13.610 --> 00:35:15.050
Okay, sorry. Um,

571
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:22.520
uh, we know how to do it, but there's no real incentive.

572
00:35:22.521 --> 00:35:26.390
So there's no engineering funded engineering plan to do it,

573
00:35:26.391 --> 00:35:29.510
but we know how to do it on paper. We know how to do it in a conceivable way.

574
00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:32.870
Oh yeah. So there, so first of all,

575
00:35:32.871 --> 00:35:37.871
it happens with or without us because we are in the shooting path of countless

576
00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:39.980
thousands of asteroids and comets, right?

577
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:45.170
So what you would do is you'd find one that's headed close to us anyway in the

578
00:35:45.241 --> 00:35:48.180
seventh orbit down the line or the hundredth orbit down the line,

579
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:53.510
and then you slightly deflected in such a way that it would then collide with

580
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:58.740
Mars or even earth if you wanted earth needed to more freshwater. Yeah,

581
00:35:58.741 --> 00:36:00.500
I heard that there's a possible [inaudible].

582
00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:04.920
The problem is if something really big that would fill lakes worth or if that

583
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:06.150
collided with earth,

584
00:36:06.151 --> 00:36:10.080
that would just be bad for life on earth because it's a spontaneous deposit of

585
00:36:10.081 --> 00:36:13.440
energy that can change the climate and do so you want to do that on a planet

586
00:36:13.441 --> 00:36:14.790
that you're trying to terraform.

587
00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.790
Isn't that the speculation of how water got here in the first place?

588
00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:22.590
So the jury's still out on that. There is there tags in the oceans,

589
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.490
uh,

590
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:28.490
in the water molecule that tell you that the water must have come from more than

591
00:36:28.561 --> 00:36:32.280
one source. So that's what's confusing things. We want it to be a simple thing.

592
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:35.910
It all came by comments or it all came from inside the earth through volcanoes,

593
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.050
volcanoes emit

594
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:46.020
lakes, and historically lakes and oceans worth of water just out of their,

595
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.970
out of their calderas. So, so the problem is what,

596
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.600
as we say in science over determined,

597
00:36:51.930 --> 00:36:53.820
there's plenty of comments to have delivered all the water.

598
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:57.390
There's plenty of water that could've come out of, uh, out of, um,

599
00:36:57.690 --> 00:37:01.620
volcanoes to give us all the way. So, but in the oceans, it's clearly a mixture.

600
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.070
And so the final word is still out on that.

601
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:08.730
What do you think about what's going on in Hawaii now with the protesting of the

602
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:13.420
building of this largest and latest telescope? Yes. The, the, the, uh,

603
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:17.700
TMT 30 meter telescope, which should be to, uh, you know,

604
00:37:17.701 --> 00:37:20.730
the largest ever by far of any kind of telescope.

605
00:37:20.731 --> 00:37:25.731
The history of astronomy is one where bigger telescopes become bigger buckets to

606
00:37:27.781 --> 00:37:28.614
collect light.

607
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.100
That's the only telescopes today are the same as telescopes when they were

608
00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:34.380
invented. They're just bigger, right?

609
00:37:34.381 --> 00:37:37.890
The principle behind them is bigger because what they're doing is simple.

610
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:40.470
All you're trying to do is get as much light as possible.

611
00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:44.070
And the more light you get, the dimmer is the object you can detect.

612
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.670
And the farther away is the object you can see.

613
00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:53.040
And so for every generation of new large telescopes that have been built,

614
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.840
it is,

615
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.520
it has increased and deepened our understanding of our place in the universe.

616
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.650
So that's just the, that's the background.

617
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:06.330
The proposal is for a 30 meter telescope, largest ever,

618
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:12.240
um, on the big island of Hawaii and Monica. Were there other telescopes there?

619
00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.940
Other, that's where the CAC is, right? Yeah, I think if where the CAC is,

620
00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:21.080
I think they s they cited it in a place that's sort of tucked behind most sight

621
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:24.720
lines to it, but that's not so much what's important here.

622
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.530
It's that the native Hawaiians, from what I've read, uh,

623
00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.610
view the mountain as a sacred place. And so,

624
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:34.230
uh,

625
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:39.130
to put a telescope yet another telescope there becomes sort of invasion of

626
00:38:39.131 --> 00:38:43.920
sacred land. And so, so yeah, it's, it's,

627
00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:46.510
it's a, there's a standoff. Last I looked, I mean,

628
00:38:46.511 --> 00:38:51.370
people protesting in the streets and there's some native Hawaiians who embrace

629
00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:56.260
this because it means jobs, high, high quality jobs, engineering jobs.

630
00:38:56.261 --> 00:38:58.000
Cause you gotta build it. You've got gotta maintain it.

631
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.190
There's an entire supportive infrastructure for that. That means jobs.

632
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:08.800
Um, and it's done in collaboration with the University of Hawaii. Um, and the,

633
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:12.610
all the other telescopes are partnered with the University of Hawaii where

634
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:16.330
people are educated there. And so, so at the end of the day,

635
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:21.160
you have to ask, well, how are you gonna make decisions going forward?

636
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.510
Are gonna make them democratically then you take a vote or you do you want the

637
00:39:25.511 --> 00:39:29.800
natives to, to be the deciders of their own fate?

638
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:34.090
And is that democratic? OK, so the natives vote okay?

639
00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:38.970
Or is it the few people who are protesting, do they win the day? I mean, it's,

640
00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:41.350
it's complicated and it's very, it's very,

641
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.290
there are a lot of nuanced issues going on there. There's a,

642
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:48.870
there's a branch of thinking that the, the United States government and,

643
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:53.830
and normal municipal, uh, leaders have no authority over it.

644
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:58.900
There are some who claim that this is native Hawaiian property that does not

645
00:39:58.901 --> 00:40:02.800
belong to any municipal entity of the u s government. So therefore,

646
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:07.660
even state representatives have no say, right? So there's a lot going on there,

647
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:13.210
okay. But if I were to weigh in, this is how I would do so.

648
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.620
Okay. I would say first, um,

649
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:20.230
I think what should happen is,

650
00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:24.310
I don't know if they even have the infrastructure,

651
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:27.940
I don't know how the system is set up, but if they could set it up this way,

652
00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:32.470
if the mountain is viewed as sacred by the natives,

653
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:37.720
the natives should have entire say of what happens to the mountain. Okay?

654
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:39.880
That's how I think that should be.

655
00:40:39.881 --> 00:40:44.881
So now what you want to make sure is that whatever decision gets made and voted

656
00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:49.480
upon by the natives, that is fully informed you want,

657
00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:53.710
you don't want to vote being misinformed or under informed in any election,

658
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:57.550
let alone whether you're voting for a telescope on your Sacred Mountain, okay?

659
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.860
Otherwise, you're voting out of nowhere, right? Yet your net, you're,

660
00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:05.590
you're influencing your future based on partial information and decisions based

661
00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:08.530
on partial information or bad decisions no matter what. Okay.

662
00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:13.860
So I would say hold a vote with the natives and make sure everybody's fully

663
00:41:14.711 --> 00:41:16.960
informed. And here's a bit of information.

664
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:20.260
I just want to add to the information. Okay.

665
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.030
You know what we do as astrophysicists?

666
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:30.570
We study the universe rather passively at that.

667
00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.730
We sit there at the end of a telecom and wait for light to reach us.

668
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:40.450
It's not a petri dish where we stir it or heated or freeze it or crack it or

669
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.750
we're just Kinda, they're communing with the cosmos.

670
00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:51.100
My Phd thesis was significantly fed by data that I obtained from mountaintops at

671
00:41:53.031 --> 00:41:56.060
telescopes. I got my data from mountains in Chile,

672
00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:01.400
a set of two Lolo Ma and it employed all the natives, the natives,

673
00:42:01.401 --> 00:42:05.030
the local local people. All right. That's another telescope that,

674
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:09.850
so there's all these telescopes that all have specific um, um,

675
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.360
access points to the universe. They're not all asking the same questions. Right?

676
00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.030
And so it's the collection of all the data that gives us the complete

677
00:42:17.031 --> 00:42:20.390
understanding. What we think is a complete understanding of the universe.

678
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:25.630
So what we do is try to understand our place in the universe.

679
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:31.870
And all I'm going to say is that if you have power over what happens on that

680
00:42:32.061 --> 00:42:35.870
mountain and it's sacred to you,

681
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:41.030
because whatever that is,

682
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:46.340
it is something important to you and your sense of your understanding of your

683
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:47.420
place in this world.

684
00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:51.870
That would be spiritual significance.

685
00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.140
I can tell you that what we learn as astrophysicists from those mountaintops,

686
00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:09.740
it gives us a deeper understanding of who and what we are in this universe.

687
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:17.270
So I would say that would ever is your concept of God,

688
00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:21.300
be it the, the creator of the universe,

689
00:43:21.301 --> 00:43:25.650
the spirit energy that pervades all of space and time, whatever is your concept,

690
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:30.660
the discoveries of astrophysicists bring you closer to it.

691
00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:40.680
I get your perspective. Let me be the opposing view.

692
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:45.810
They feel that I'm not trying to, no, I know this is just information.

693
00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:50.010
I'm putting this information and I walk out of the room and then y'all vote,

694
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:53.940
right? I'm not, you know, we believe in democracy here and majority rules.

695
00:43:53.941 --> 00:43:56.940
That's a, that's kind of a good thing. It's kind of worked all right,

696
00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:00.100
but if it's not majority rules, I don't know how they're going to make decision,

697
00:44:00.101 --> 00:44:04.920
but let's say invent a future where that there, the natives vote. If they vote,

698
00:44:04.921 --> 00:44:09.921
I wanted to make sure they heard what I just said and now take control of your

699
00:44:10.711 --> 00:44:13.230
own fate. I just don't think they care.

700
00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:16.770
I think they've decided that that's a sacred space and they don't want anybody

701
00:44:16.771 --> 00:44:20.580
doing anything to it. Then that's their decision. Then you think that's okay.

702
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:25.440
I know I don't, I don't judge people's.

703
00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.610
Um, but if you wanted to make a convincing appeal to them, no.

704
00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:30.780
All I would say what I just told you, that's it.

705
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.750
That all I would tell them and when they vote,

706
00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:37.080
I want them to understand that fact.

707
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.630
I could take it one step further and say

708
00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:45.770
mountaintops. Because of the access they give astrophysicists and,

709
00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:49.380
and by proxy a Saul to the universe

710
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:53.730
are sacred places to scientist.

711
00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:01.260
Okay. Now, it's not sacred in a religious sense, but it's sacred in a,

712
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.680
in terms of a pathway to knowing and understanding who and what we are in this

713
00:45:06.741 --> 00:45:07.574
universe.

714
00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:08.440
<v 3>Okay.</v>

715
00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:13.270
<v 1>We place great value on that. So, but it's not our land.</v>

716
00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.313
It's we, you know,

717
00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:19.940
[inaudible] Europeans didn't come to Hawaii and find fine legions of scientists.

718
00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.510
They are conducting experiments. Okay.

719
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:26.590
They found native peoples governing themselves. So, so,

720
00:45:26.591 --> 00:45:28.420
so that's that the consequence,

721
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:32.320
if it gets voted down and that's permanent and there's no way around that,

722
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.760
that telescope is still going to be built. It just won't be built in Hawaii.

723
00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:40.160
Well, where will it be built? They have to be built on mountaintops. Yeah.

724
00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.870
So there are other mountaintops, yeah. You want to be above, you know,

725
00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:47.430
some schmaltzy clouds and haze and,

726
00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:52.210
and you want a dry environment so there's less rain, fewer clouds. Oh,

727
00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.160
you've visited very good. Uh, more than 10 years ago. The first time.

728
00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.700
And it was, I got very fortunate.

729
00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.040
It was a night where the moon was not out. Yes.

730
00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:07.810
Moon is not the astronomers favorite thing. Yeah. You want the darkest sky.

731
00:46:07.811 --> 00:46:11.170
You can. We were worried as we were driving up there, that was really cloudy.

732
00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:15.430
But we drove through the clouds and you got to the top and we got to the

733
00:46:15.431 --> 00:46:19.270
observatory and it was the most amazing without telescopes, just we,

734
00:46:19.271 --> 00:46:21.220
there was telescopes there, but without telescopes.

735
00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:26.350
It was the most amazing view of this guy I'd ever seen in my life.

736
00:46:26.351 --> 00:46:30.910
And it changed my perspective of our place in the universe. This is what we do.

737
00:46:30.911 --> 00:46:32.290
We're on a space ship,

738
00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:37.090
like we were flying through the universe because of the diffused lighting in on

739
00:46:37.091 --> 00:46:40.660
the big island because it's all set up so that it doesn't ruin what they're

740
00:46:40.661 --> 00:46:44.740
trying to accomplish at the CAC. Reflections in the wrong place.

741
00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:50.590
Not only that, if there was a moon out and you did ascend up through the clouds,

742
00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:55.660
the moonlight illuminates the clouds and you are an island in the middle of

743
00:46:55.661 --> 00:47:00.220
white cotton. Yeah. And you're not even connected to the earth.

744
00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.530
It's what you imagined Mount Olympus would've been.

745
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:04.420
I've been out there for them when that happens too,

746
00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:08.650
with the gods up there and there's kind of, that's their place. It's there. So,

747
00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:13.200
so, so yes. And so any my,

748
00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:18.130
my brethren, my fellow astrophysicist who have also observed from mountaintops,

749
00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:22.150
by the way, it's becoming a lost art because it's not lost,

750
00:47:22.151 --> 00:47:23.920
but it's becoming something we don't do anymore.

751
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:27.160
There's something called surface observing where you put in your observing

752
00:47:27.161 --> 00:47:31.570
program and it gets handed to a technician at the telescope who point the

753
00:47:31.571 --> 00:47:33.700
telescope, gets the data and sends it back to you.

754
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:38.710
So the next generation doesn't have the experience that my generation did

755
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:42.340
because there was a pilgrimage to the top of the mountain and you converted your

756
00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:46.600
life's path. You've converted your life schedule to become nocturnal.

757
00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:51.470
And in so doing you, you know this is,

758
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.040
the journey was long enough because you're in the middle of nowhere.

759
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.860
Now you've got to go nocturnal. And by the time you're ready for this,

760
00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.210
you are communing with the cosmos. It is you, the detector,

761
00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.660
the telescope and the universe.

762
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.460
And there's an eerie silence up there too, cause you don't hear any,

763
00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:14.710
you do the hum of maybe the, the draw the motor of the telescope. But that's it.

764
00:48:15.490 --> 00:48:19.360
And so, so all I'm saying is if they choose to not have it,

765
00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:22.090
that telescope will go somewhere else. One of them is the Canary Islands.

766
00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.680
These are also volcanic. Um,

767
00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:30.300
hilltops not as high as as Mount of Kenya is at 14,000 feet.

768
00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.300
By the way,

769
00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.420
I should have checked at what temperature water boils at the top of Mount of k.

770
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:38.380
We could have rounded that story out. Uh, but, um,

771
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:41.200
I think it's around 180 degrees actually. Uh,

772
00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:44.410
I think I did actually calculate it one time, but anyhow, so,

773
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:48.070
so you'd find a mountaintop and we'll put it somewhere else and the data won't

774
00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:49.480
be as good. Um,

775
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:52.810
but that'll be a consequence of it and none of that'll go to Hawaii.

776
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.600
How do you think that's going to get resolved though, if you had to guess?

777
00:48:55.780 --> 00:49:00.690
I don't know. Um, I, uh, I,

778
00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.120
I just don't know. A lot of people are against it, including

779
00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:09.070
Jason Momoa Aqua Mans against it. Oh, he's out there protesting. Yeah.

780
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:12.190
And so when you get celebrity types to put the weight of their name behind it,

781
00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:16.720
it magnifies the cause of others. Even if they're in the minority.

782
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.120
And so I, like I said, I think native should I,

783
00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.400
has it been, does everyone know who all the natives are? Is there,

784
00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:28.000
is there some listing so that they can all vote for this one thing you wouldn't

785
00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:31.120
want people voting who are not native if you're voting on whether it's so

786
00:49:31.121 --> 00:49:36.120
sacred, you don't want to put a telescope there. You'd want people who have a,

787
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.090
a, an indigenous, um,

788
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:44.950
an indigenous concern for what goes on there.

789
00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:48.520
And Indigenous in reference to Hawaii is relative. Every,

790
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.560
every usage of the word indigenous is relative,

791
00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.580
especially with Hawaii because I mean the only indigenous people are black

792
00:49:54.581 --> 00:49:58.900
people in Africa. That's okay because life,

793
00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:02.740
human life began in Africa. Everyone else traveled to where they were.

794
00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:06.040
So, so native, it's,

795
00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:08.980
you set a timeframe to declare what is native and what's not.

796
00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.900
And a native in its, in its simplest form is, are you born there?

797
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:15.760
So I'm a native New Yorker. I'm born there,

798
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:18.850
but I wasn't the original settler there. I,

799
00:50:19.090 --> 00:50:22.810
with my species did not form on Manhattan Island.

800
00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:26.380
So everybody traveled to where they are.

801
00:50:26.381 --> 00:50:28.040
They just got there before the Europeans.

802
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:32.210
And so that has become the definition of indigenous art.

803
00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:34.910
Were you there when the Europeans landed? Then you're indigenous,

804
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:40.470
but to other life forms on that, on that rock, on that, uh, um,

805
00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:45.860
uh, Hawaii's or a volcanic, it's a volcanic, um, archipelago.

806
00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.470
Um, uh, you know how that happens. By the way,

807
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.350
you have all these multiple volcanoes in our story, in a string,

808
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.490
you have a wonder why, how that happens. Sure. You did wonder what you do.

809
00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:57.830
You know why? Oh,

810
00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:02.090
because there's a hotspot beneath Earth's crust and it's just sitting there.

811
00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.860
Okay. And when you're beneath,

812
00:51:03.861 --> 00:51:06.680
there's crushed stuff doesn't move around the way it does on Earth's crust.

813
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:08.660
Earth's crust shifts. Okay?

814
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:13.520
So that hotspot gurgles up makes a volcano, then the hotspot goes dormant.

815
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:18.590
But the con, this shelf still drifts. You still have continental drift,

816
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:22.310
so drifts. Then the hotspots says, time for me to Gurgle again. A girl is up.

817
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:25.550
Now you get another volcano, and then it goes dormant.

818
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:28.580
That volcano goes dormant. It shifts. You get another one.

819
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:33.650
Anytime you see a chain of islands jet guarantee,

820
00:51:33.651 --> 00:51:35.030
they're made by volcanoes.

821
00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:40.300
Over enough time for continental shift two it's shifted the plates over the

822
00:51:40.341 --> 00:51:42.320
hotspot of Earth's mantle.

823
00:51:42.530 --> 00:51:47.330
So do you think what they're concerned with is the eventual spoiling of this

824
00:51:47.331 --> 00:51:51.950
beautiful natural resource that slowly but surely people are putting up houses

825
00:51:51.951 --> 00:51:55.790
there and developments and all these different things.

826
00:51:55.791 --> 00:51:57.320
And then the scientists are saying,

827
00:51:57.321 --> 00:52:00.800
we need this sacred land because we're going to put a volcano. And they're like,

828
00:52:00.801 --> 00:52:03.200
look, this is already, there's already a, I mean,

829
00:52:03.201 --> 00:52:06.650
we're going to put a telescope, there's already a telescope up here. Enough.

830
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.361
You think that's what it is?

831
00:52:08.361 --> 00:52:11.240
They're trying to halt the progress of civilization or, I mean,

832
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:14.990
maybe progress is a bad word. The expansion of civilization.

833
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:20.930
Yeah. I mean, let's go back. What did Teddy Roosevelt two he said,

834
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:24.490
we've got to preserve these lands because they're beautiful. And by the way,

835
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:28.790
he said that after he shot all those elephants and tigers and Lions and tigers

836
00:52:28.791 --> 00:52:32.240
and bears. Yeah, I mean, I, I, I hail from a museum,

837
00:52:32.241 --> 00:52:35.750
the American Museum of natural history where he's the patron saint of that

838
00:52:35.751 --> 00:52:36.560
museum.

839
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:39.980
What happened was he realizes how important this land is and how beautiful it

840
00:52:39.981 --> 00:52:43.760
is. And he is the, he's the patron saint of the national park system.

841
00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:48.890
So, so that's the secular version of sacred,

842
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:50.930
right? We don't say it's sacred,

843
00:52:50.931 --> 00:52:54.920
but we've all decided as a community that we care about these lands.

844
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.080
And you don't want to drill on it. You don't want to put housing. Um,

845
00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:01.370
was it Lyndon Johnson's wife, Lady Bird Johnson,

846
00:53:01.371 --> 00:53:05.450
who said our freeways that were so carefully building after the Second World

847
00:53:05.451 --> 00:53:08.840
War, the Eisenhower freeway project. Okay. Hi. You know,

848
00:53:08.841 --> 00:53:13.190
the interstate system is, uh, this is our country.

849
00:53:13.191 --> 00:53:16.640
We want to keep it beautiful. So certain stretches over it.

850
00:53:16.641 --> 00:53:21.290
There are no billboards. Billboards would, you know, um,

851
00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.380
would change your relationship to nature.

852
00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:29.660
So certain stretches of interstate or secularly sacred,

853
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.940
if, if I can say that. So I remember visiting, uh, uh,

854
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:40.650
visiting Australia, and there's the, the famous rock and the, um,

855
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.610
out in the outback. Uh, the old,

856
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:46.210
old Leura Ulu please help me get the,

857
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:49.890
I get my correct pronunciation of this. W O Uluru

858
00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:56.010
[inaudible] I'm told it's one coherent geologic rock.

859
00:53:56.011 --> 00:53:57.690
It's not just an assembly of rocks.

860
00:53:58.050 --> 00:53:59.820
And so I don't know enough about the geology of it,

861
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:04.440
but I do know that the Australian aborigines will room and okay.

862
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:07.140
Iconic Red Rock, look at that cool thing. Okay.

863
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:11.640
So that is one sort of geologic thing.

864
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:16.860
And uh, and climbers want a climate about it. That's cute.

865
00:54:16.861 --> 00:54:21.840
It's miles in circumference. OK. So I, we visited it. I,

866
00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:26.610
I rented a bicycle with my wife and kids and we rode around it. Okay.

867
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.980
So now, um,

868
00:54:30.630 --> 00:54:35.280
that is sacred to the local indigenous peoples.

869
00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:40.710
So they don't want you to climb on it. Well, on a rock climber, I, you know,

870
00:54:40.711 --> 00:54:42.750
what do you care? I'm not going to ruin it. I'm not going to,

871
00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.990
they don't want you to climb on it. And I try to think to myself,

872
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:51.800
is there a counterpart to this that would sort of wake up a Westerner to say,

873
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.230
I get it right?

874
00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:00.800
Not Suppose some people from sub natives from Alaska or from the,

875
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:07.340
some tribes from Africa or some aborigines came up from these remote places of

876
00:55:08.611 --> 00:55:11.670
the world, walked up to the Vatican and said,

877
00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.470
we want to climb the walls of this Vatican just for sport. What would we say?

878
00:55:17.790 --> 00:55:22.790
We want to climb the walls of St Paul's Cathedral in downtown London.

879
00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:27.210
What would you say? No. Yeah, but are those comparable? I mean, wait, wait,

880
00:55:27.211 --> 00:55:31.770
wait. We want to repel down the tower of Big Ben.

881
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:36.120
You're going to say no. Get the fuck are you would say no,

882
00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:39.360
these are important structures to us.

883
00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:40.980
Now are you going to say or the equivalent? Well,

884
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:45.750
we built those and the natives didn't build the rock. Right? Exactly.

885
00:55:45.810 --> 00:55:50.640
Okay. It depends on how important that detail is to you.

886
00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:55.890
All I'm saying is on the level of weeks, say this is sacred.

887
00:55:55.891 --> 00:55:57.090
You say that is sacred

888
00:55:59.070 --> 00:56:01.500
and now you're going to have different rules for who's climbing. What.

889
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:06.190
I think it'll force force you to take pause. So here's an argument in pho,

890
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:12.120
like supporting what you're saying, look at what's going on with the Himalayas.

891
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:17.250
I mean it's the human shit that they ha they leave behind their all the clients.

892
00:56:17.251 --> 00:56:21.480
So disturbing the climbers. It's horrible. It's really horrible.

893
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:26.050
I mean they, there's tons of it. Tons of human waste. Okay,

894
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:29.860
so what you do there is if it's still not a problem that people are climbing,

895
00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:32.860
it's that they're leaving waste. You don't stop the climbers,

896
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:36.340
you tax them at some level so that now you have cleanup crews that come up after

897
00:56:36.341 --> 00:56:40.630
them. Yeah, but it's your solution. No, it's incredibly good.

898
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:44.900
So there you go. You're all texting them. You make it worth it. All right,

899
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:48.100
so you understand like here's what I'm saying to leave the bodies up there,

900
00:56:48.101 --> 00:56:50.950
right. You know that they can't. That's what I heard. That's what I heard. Well,

901
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.950
why do you think they could bring tons of shit when they can't even bring

902
00:56:53.951 --> 00:56:54.910
bodies? Here's what I'm saying.

903
00:56:54.911 --> 00:56:58.510
When they invented cars and cars were killing people in the street,

904
00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.980
cause people that know how to cross the street,

905
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:01.420
they didn't know where to cross the street.

906
00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:04.000
People don't know how to stop the cars. They say, well,

907
00:57:04.001 --> 00:57:08.320
cars are actually a pretty useful thing. Do we ban cars? No. We make stoplights.

908
00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:11.500
Oh, people across [inaudible] we make crosswalks. Oh,

909
00:57:11.501 --> 00:57:16.150
let's put lanes so the cars don't hit each other and let's make airbags so that

910
00:57:16.151 --> 00:57:18.490
you don't fly through the windshield. All right,

911
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:20.860
so there are ways around problems.

912
00:57:20.861 --> 00:57:23.620
If you value the thing that it is that you want to do,

913
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.510
so people are leaving crap up there.

914
00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:30.511
You make them bring it back or you develop a system that enables the stuff to

915
00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:33.130
come back no matter what,

916
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:35.320
and if you can't do that and you don't want it messed up,

917
00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:39.730
then cancel the whole operation. We didn't cancel cars.

918
00:57:39.731 --> 00:57:43.570
We got really innovative about how to keep them a big difference between cars

919
00:57:43.571 --> 00:57:46.090
and human shit that's left from the side of the mountain.

920
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:51.630
I think the real problem too is I think it's you value mountain climbing and you

921
00:57:52.721 --> 00:57:56.950
want to keep doing it. Then you solve the problem. This is what engineers do.

922
00:57:57.010 --> 00:57:59.740
That's all they do is what's your problem? Solve it.

923
00:57:59.741 --> 00:58:03.130
Being able to bring those bodies back because the physical limitations of the

924
00:58:03.131 --> 00:58:07.210
human body, it's barely, you barely have enough juice to climb.

925
00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:10.830
It's so thin. The air so thin, it's so dangerous.

926
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.720
The energy draw on you is so high. Leave those bodies there.

927
00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:17.580
So is that the human shit that you're talking about or is that Oh, there's that.

928
00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:21.730
You're talking about the fact that humans were there that we got when we were

929
00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:25.260
not very clean about our presence. That's what you're talking about, right?

930
00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:28.180
We're just being human. We have to go and you gotta go. You gotta go.

931
00:58:28.181 --> 00:58:32.500
When we got to go up there and just open up the hatch and let her rip down the

932
00:58:32.501 --> 00:58:36.370
side of a mountain and the resulting, do you know what in the space station,

933
00:58:36.371 --> 00:58:38.440
they recycle your urine and your and your crap.

934
00:58:38.530 --> 00:58:42.310
Congratulations to them because they had put engineers on the problem.

935
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:43.780
What I mean by Sakhalin,

936
00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:48.070
they extract all the water from it and then what's left is highly dried and you

937
00:58:48.071 --> 00:58:52.570
drink mineral water is water. It's water molecule. That's the thing about,

938
00:58:52.571 --> 00:58:55.870
by the way, by the way, every glass you see this People's pee is in it.

939
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:59.920
That's correct. So you got a bought a bottle of water here. Okay.

940
00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:03.580
This has napoleons. Yes, yes.

941
00:59:03.581 --> 00:59:07.330
There are more molecules of water in this bottle.

942
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.670
Then there are bottles of water.

943
00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:14.560
This volume of order in all the world's oceans. So in other words,

944
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:18.700
if you drank this and peed it out, okay,

945
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:23.210
you have enough molecules in your pee and your sweat and in the,

946
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:27.200
the moisture that you exhale, all that goes back into the environment,

947
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:29.750
scattering into all sources of water or the world.

948
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:34.870
And there's enough of those molecules to occupy every half liter of water that

949
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:40.640
fit, that covers the surface of this earth. So that given enough time,

950
00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:44.090
you scoop a cup of water out of there. I don't even care if you filter it.

951
00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.590
The h two o is still there.

952
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.070
That is water that is passed through the kidneys of Abraham Lincoln.

953
00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:55.290
Gangas Kahn, Joan of arc. [inaudible].

954
00:59:55.770 --> 00:59:56.603
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

955
00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:00.930
<v 1>Socrates. Plato. No, Jesus.</v>

956
01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:03.330
Can I get a bottle of Jesus? I'm trying to get my,

957
01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:06.540
my bill and Ted's excellent adventure list. Go in here. Okay.

958
01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:11.940
You just ruined it. But yes, Jesus would be included in that. So would Socrates.

959
01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:16.380
Yes. So that is the same. By the way, the same is true with breaths of air.

960
01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:20.730
There were more molecules of air in every breath you take,

961
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:25.440
then there are breaths of air in all the atmosphere of the earth.

962
01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:31.170
So when you exhale, there's enough of those molecules to scatter. And the, the,

963
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:31.630
the,

964
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:36.630
the air currents will do this to scatter into every breath of air that is

965
01:00:37.110 --> 01:00:39.570
inhale. So when you take a breath of air,

966
01:00:39.571 --> 01:00:43.050
you have molecules of air that went through the lungs of Jesus.

967
01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:46.310
<v 0>Okay.</v>

968
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.770
<v 1>We're all connected and there's no way around it.</v>

969
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:53.780
And the water that we have is the water that we have, right? We drink it,

970
01:00:53.781 --> 01:00:57.780
we pee, it goes to the atmosphere. It comes down as rain. Yeah. And the rain is,

971
01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:00.800
is an important differences. A lot.

972
01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:03.550
Most of the water on earth is salt water that you can't drink. Right.

973
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:06.380
And there's a limited amount that's fresh water. How much of a, by the way,

974
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:11.240
all the glaciers are freshwater cause that's frozen rain, right? Frozen rain.

975
01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:14.840
Here's something that no one talks about. When the glaciers melt,

976
01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:19.780
where does the water go? Where's it go? Just tell me, you know the answer just

977
01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:22.780
in the ocean. Back in the ocean. Okay,

978
01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:27.730
so but this is now non salty water going into the ocean.

979
01:01:28.450 --> 01:01:33.100
So you're mixing fresh water with brackish water and they occupied different

980
01:01:33.101 --> 01:01:36.430
places in the vertical profile of the ocean.

981
01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:39.610
And because salt water is heavier than fresh water,

982
01:01:39.611 --> 01:01:42.100
so the freshwater occupies the top right.

983
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:44.080
It's not as salty as the water at the below.

984
01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:49.480
And there are circulations in the ocean, not only up and down,

985
01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.480
you know, northern latitude, southern latitude like the Gulf stream.

986
01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.910
There's also circulation top to bottom.

987
01:01:55.900 --> 01:02:00.190
And the combinations of all these circulations create the stability of the

988
01:02:00.191 --> 01:02:05.090
ocean. If you disrupt that, oh my gosh, they're animals.

989
01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:09.400
Fishes that can't live anymore where they used to be because the salt level is

990
01:02:09.401 --> 01:02:12.640
different. And so some animals might go extinct,

991
01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:16.210
some weather patterns will change because the ocean affects climate.

992
01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:17.890
So these are,

993
01:02:17.891 --> 01:02:22.500
this is why climate modeling is so critical yet so complicated.

994
01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.500
Is it because there are a lot of variables that show up?

995
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.780
Why can't we take the salt out of the water? You can, it just takes energy.

996
01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.740
You can do it. But why hasn't that been being done? You can't.

997
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:36.510
You have to ask you who's paying for the energy?

998
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:38.310
Where are you getting the energy from? It's an energy thing,

999
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:40.080
but I would think that would be very valuable.

1000
01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.930
Let me think about how many people just not valuable enough yet.

1001
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:47.910
That's the point. Well, is it that it's just, it's just money, dude.

1002
01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:52.480
It's just money. You can ask, what does it cost to ship a uh,

1003
01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:56.250
a half pint of water from Fiji? Okay.

1004
01:02:56.251 --> 01:03:00.000
Whatever hell is the square bottle that you buy in Fiji Water? Is it Fiji?

1005
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:04.710
Right? Fiji water. What does it cost to bottle that in Fiji?

1006
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:09.740
Ship it here relative to desalinating the ocean.

1007
01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:16.440
It's cheaper to ship. Like to Fiji. There'll be a day when that's not the case.

1008
01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:20.340
And future wars are going to be fought over who has access to fresh water.

1009
01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.980
And the value of water will go up. And by the way,

1010
01:03:22.981 --> 01:03:27.090
the value of water in space is $10,000 a pound.

1011
01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:33.420
So if you, if you last do a comment and you say this is a lot of freshwater,

1012
01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:36.540
uh yeah, you could, I guess you can bring it back down to earth,

1013
01:03:36.541 --> 01:03:37.380
but that's expensive.

1014
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:41.970
You're better off selling it to NASA for $9,000 a pound cause it cost them

1015
01:03:41.971 --> 01:03:44.160
$10,000 a pound to put water into orbit.

1016
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.180
So you better off keeping it up there and somehow or another,

1017
01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:53.700
if you harness water in space, you're better off trading in space with it.

1018
01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:56.610
Then bringing it back down to a planetary surface at the moment,

1019
01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:00.180
the economics favor that. What is the desalination process? So it's,

1020
01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:04.210
it's simple. You just evaporate the water. It's basically a still, it's, it's,

1021
01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:08.960
it's, it's, it's, it's a distillery, right? So here's, here's a,

1022
01:04:08.961 --> 01:04:13.050
a pocket of water with this highly salty and you just heat it.

1023
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:18.770
The H two o evaporates leaving sodium chloride behind.

1024
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:24.060
And at the end you get this salt deposit at the bottom of your dish at the

1025
01:04:24.061 --> 01:04:26.610
bottom of your vessel. Oh wait a minute.

1026
01:04:26.611 --> 01:04:29.520
What happens to lakes that used to be there that salty lakes that used to be

1027
01:04:29.521 --> 01:04:31.740
there that aren't? There's a salt deposit.

1028
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:35.670
That's the source of our modern day salt. This is what I tweeted the other day.

1029
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.240
That all table salt is, is um,

1030
01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:44.940
all table salt is sea salt. It just came from long buried, uh,

1031
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:48.390
prehistoric evaporated seas.

1032
01:04:48.690 --> 01:04:51.060
So salt mines and, and I was,

1033
01:04:51.061 --> 01:04:53.770
I was told by some geologists I had,

1034
01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:57.230
I had had a narrow and narrow usage of the word mind when I think for mine,

1035
01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.350
I think of a hole in the ground.

1036
01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.710
But mining operations includes surface operations as well.

1037
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.330
So there's surface lakes that are,

1038
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:07.410
that have evaporated and you get salt from that as well as the mines that you

1039
01:05:07.411 --> 01:05:10.950
would dig down deep below. So that whole, all of that is a mining operation.

1040
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:13.800
My tweet only referenced the buried ones, but the,

1041
01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:17.500
it's all but it's all from evaporated waters. It's all from evaporates.

1042
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.930
It's all sea salt is the point. Now,

1043
01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:23.410
nuclear power plants rely on steam, right?

1044
01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.200
Isn't that part of the [inaudible] just to finish the point.

1045
01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:29.860
So you evaporate the water and the salt left.

1046
01:05:29.861 --> 01:05:32.620
Maybe you wouldn't want to use that and make some sea salt out of it.

1047
01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:33.700
Table Salt. Um,

1048
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:38.260
and that evaporated water condenses out over here and that is distilled order

1049
01:05:38.850 --> 01:05:39.041
right now.

1050
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:42.250
You might want to mineralize it so it tastes good cause distilled water doesn't

1051
01:05:42.251 --> 01:05:45.040
taste good. Plus it's not really healthy to drink it. As you probably know,

1052
01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:48.970
you drink distilled water, it goes into equilibrium with your minerals,

1053
01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:54.010
sucking minerals out of you so it has the same minerality that your body does

1054
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:58.030
and then you pee it out and you'll systematically drain yourself of important

1055
01:05:58.330 --> 01:05:59.163
electrolytes.

1056
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:04.200
So generally the water that you would say tastes good and you enjoy has some

1057
01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:08.990
mineral, um, bits, some, some, some kind of mineral, um,

1058
01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:12.430
minerals in it. That'll nuclear power plants, don't they?

1059
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:17.700
The process is using that nuclear energy to create steam to operate turbines.

1060
01:06:18.581 --> 01:06:22.200
And basically all of our electricity today comes from uh,

1061
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:23.660
essentially the,

1062
01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:28.730
mostly electricity's coming from turbines that convert steam to electricity.

1063
01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:32.410
So, so sorry. So you heat water,

1064
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:35.830
the water back steam the steam turns the turbine and the turning turbine

1065
01:06:35.831 --> 01:06:38.290
generates the electricity, isn't it? So, so, so it's,

1066
01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.620
it's a matter of where do you get the energy to boil the water.

1067
01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:45.790
That's what it comes down. Is it coal? Is it oil? Is it, is it nukes?

1068
01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:49.600
Is it wind, is it hydro? All of this.

1069
01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.330
If you get a hydro plant, oh by the way,

1070
01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.020
in a hydro plant they don't have to make steam because they have the water,

1071
01:06:56.500 --> 01:07:01.270
the water pressure at the base of the dam moves through the turbines that turns

1072
01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:05.200
the turbines and they make electricity so you don't have to heat anything cause

1073
01:07:05.201 --> 01:07:06.820
they have the water pressure to do that. Anyway,

1074
01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:09.130
that is also solar power by the way,

1075
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.870
because the sun evaporated ocean water,

1076
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:19.000
the water lifts up, becomes a cloud. The cloud moves over ground over the land.

1077
01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:22.600
The cloud rains into the lake that is above the dam.

1078
01:07:23.890 --> 01:07:28.540
So the energy that got the water up there in the first place is all solar,

1079
01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:33.220
so you should think of hydroelectric has solar as well as wind energy because

1080
01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:34.360
wind is the uneven,

1081
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:38.920
unequal heating of air on earth's surface and that creates air currents.

1082
01:07:39.530 --> 01:07:40.420
That's also solar power.

1083
01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.960
There's also this all solar isn't inconceivable that you could come up with a

1084
01:07:43.961 --> 01:07:48.961
combination of desalination and power plant where you're using the heat to

1085
01:07:49.091 --> 01:07:50.230
combine, you know,

1086
01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:54.880
to make the turbines move and then you steam it off and that's where you get the

1087
01:07:54.881 --> 01:07:56.210
water from. That would be a good,

1088
01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.950
that's an interesting idea and I don't know how much that's been thought about.

1089
01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:04.090
What you're saying is I'm making steam anyway. Yeah. So why don't I do it.

1090
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:07.180
Suck with soap and water out and make,

1091
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:10.150
that's a nice two for one kind of thing. Three for one.

1092
01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:11.980
You get salt and you get salt out the other side.

1093
01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:15.240
Get salt gets all you freshwater,

1094
01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.760
fresh water and you generate electricity. Yeah. It's a dude patented. No,

1095
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:23.690
I'm, it's free for anybody who wants it. Go take that and run with it.

1096
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:27.510
I have high hopes for title energy cause there's certain places on earth where

1097
01:08:27.511 --> 01:08:29.720
tides are very powerful and they're very,

1098
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.050
and you just put some paddles in the air and you'd sort of end it.

1099
01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:35.580
And it works both ways when the water comes in and out. No,

1100
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:36.920
this is battery technology.

1101
01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:40.580
That's the reason why la is and completely dependent upon solar because it seems

1102
01:08:40.581 --> 01:08:43.670
like this is the spot to do it. Like it never rains.

1103
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:47.420
I mean if it rains here 50 days a year, that's crazy. Or any desert. Right.

1104
01:08:47.421 --> 01:08:50.270
And we're, we're next door to the Mojave desert. Right. So,

1105
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.920
so one of the problems is, and by the way, the deserts are,

1106
01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.470
are generally localized to certain latitudes on earth.

1107
01:08:57.530 --> 01:09:01.850
It's because of general circulation on earth. So, uh,

1108
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:06.110
the air pockets on earth, there's a lot going on earth.

1109
01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.300
The air moves into a lot of ways, but there's a,

1110
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:13.870
there's an overriding strict relation of air that has air sort of rising up at

1111
01:09:14.901 --> 01:09:19.750
the equator. Imagine a cylindrical movement of air that,

1112
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:24.650
that girds the earth. Okay. So just above the equator,

1113
01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:29.690
you have a cylinder rotating where you have air rising and just below the

1114
01:09:29.691 --> 01:09:34.640
equator you have a cylinder rotating the opposite, um, weight.

1115
01:09:34.641 --> 01:09:38.210
So that air is still rising at the equator. Okay? So air rise at the equator,

1116
01:09:38.211 --> 01:09:41.750
it's unstable, it makes clouds the equators one is the cloudiest place on earth,

1117
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:44.690
practically one of the cloudiest places. Well,

1118
01:09:44.691 --> 01:09:49.460
how about the other side of those cylinders where the air descends?

1119
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:54.020
Okay. Okay. When you have descending air, you don't make clouds.

1120
01:09:56.010 --> 01:10:00.060
Well, how big is the cylinder? It's about 30 degrees of latitude wide.

1121
01:10:01.890 --> 01:10:06.090
So you're rainiest places on earth or at the equator.

1122
01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:10.110
That's where you get the Amazon rain forest and the lake and you're dry.

1123
01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:14.430
As places on earth are 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south

1124
01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:21.110
because the cylindrical movements of air have descending air there.

1125
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:26.210
So the Mojave desert, the Sahara desert, the Gobi desert,

1126
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.650
they're all around 30 degrees north latitude.

1127
01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:33.600
So this,

1128
01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:38.100
so we live on the surface of the earth where there are forces operating that are

1129
01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:42.540
so much bigger than us that we don't even think about it.

1130
01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:48.000
Why is an India would be a desert? Because it's right in that zone.

1131
01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:52.430
We're not for the seasonal, um, monsoons.

1132
01:10:54.570 --> 01:10:57.300
It doesn't rain much in India except when it's monsoon season.

1133
01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:02.670
So the monsoon is sort of the exception to what would otherwise happen there.

1134
01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.000
And that's why everyone loves the monsoon and they hate it, but they love it.

1135
01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:11.010
It cools the weather. They get sources of water. There it is.

1136
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:15.780
So to ask you the question again, oh, did I not answer it? Sorry. Oh, so, so,

1137
01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:20.340
so battery technology, like what, why isn't La completely solar?

1138
01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:23.730
It should be, it's not. Some of it is cost.

1139
01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:29.010
La is so car heavy. Right? And plus,

1140
01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:29.491
you know the,

1141
01:11:29.491 --> 01:11:33.570
there's a Lamborghini passing me at 20 miles an hour on the four oh five.

1142
01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.830
This was the land of wasted horsepower. Right?

1143
01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:42.780
So any place that has a lot of sunlight should be thriving on solar panels.

1144
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:45.630
And you guys aren't, I looked around, very few have very few homes,

1145
01:11:45.631 --> 01:11:49.290
have solar panels and I don't fully understand that. Um, you could,

1146
01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:52.470
if you did that, then you'd run your own runoff, your own power.

1147
01:11:52.471 --> 01:11:56.670
You can do this, you can do the equation difficult by the way. And so,

1148
01:11:56.730 --> 01:12:01.620
so, um, yeah, I mean the price might have to come down a little further.

1149
01:12:01.621 --> 01:12:06.270
You don't really see the full price of oil. It's uh,

1150
01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:09.810
it's subsidized in ways that are not obvious to us. You know,

1151
01:12:09.811 --> 01:12:14.430
we built the roads with our taxes so that car companies could sell you a car

1152
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:17.850
that you drove on the road that they, that was built for them.

1153
01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.710
If they have to build all their own roads,

1154
01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:21.990
the price of gas to go in the car would have been much higher.

1155
01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:23.580
The price of your car would have been,

1156
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:26.550
all of that would have been much higher if the car companies had to do it.

1157
01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:29.130
What I'm saying is I make a product and I want you to use it,

1158
01:12:29.131 --> 01:12:31.410
but there's no roads. Oh,

1159
01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.430
I convinced you to build the road so you can buy my car and drive on that road.

1160
01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:39.870
That's a weird way of looking, but it's a way, it's, it's full cost accounting.

1161
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:43.080
It's full cost accounting. What is the cost of coal?

1162
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:46.450
It's how many people died of lung disease of new monorail?

1163
01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.530
Ultra microscopic silicone. Campbell County Osis. Okay.

1164
01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:53.070
That's the longest word in the, in the random house dictionary. Yeah.

1165
01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.060
That's basically black long. Yes. Basically black line. But you can break it up.

1166
01:12:57.210 --> 01:13:01.290
The new Mono Ultra Microscopic Silico,

1167
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.980
which the a silicate in a Kennel, Connie osis.

1168
01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:07.170
So there's all medical um,

1169
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.950
bits except stapled together to make that word. So,

1170
01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:15.060
so what is the cost to their health? Their death.

1171
01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.940
They're the air quality asthma.

1172
01:13:18.570 --> 01:13:21.810
The total cost of oil is not what you pay at the gas tank.

1173
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:27.860
It's other things that we shell out that are not realized in the actual cost of

1174
01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:29.130
that source of energy.

1175
01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.210
If you full cost accounted what all this really costs,

1176
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:38.840
then the solar option would look way better than it does relative to it.

1177
01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:42.870
That's all I'm telling you when you're talking about cars and car manufacturers

1178
01:13:42.871 --> 01:13:45.390
having to pay for roads isn't that, they didn't say phones,

1179
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.780
isn't that like restaurants having to pay for toilet paper? No.

1180
01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.890
Restaurants going.

1181
01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:54.920
Restaurants have to pay for land that you would park your car on

1182
01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.740
to go into the restaurant. Not In New York City,

1183
01:13:58.741 --> 01:14:02.680
but in places where everybody has cars. If you don't have valet parking, I,

1184
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:05.940
my restaurant will not occupy the entire plot of land I just bought.

1185
01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.470
It's going to be some,

1186
01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:11.230
it's going to be a fourth of that land and all the rest are going to be parking

1187
01:14:11.231 --> 01:14:11.950
spots.

1188
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:16.950
I have absorbed the cost of your parking your car in me in my acquisition of

1189
01:14:17.891 --> 01:14:20.140
that, of that real estate, for example,

1190
01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.780
to make it convenient so that people could use your facility. Correct. So,

1191
01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:28.330
but I bore that cost as as restaurant tour. Right?

1192
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:32.230
Or maybe I'm renting of course. But that's, that's, it's not relate to someone,

1193
01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:37.920
the car manufacturers being forced to pay for the roads that they should be.

1194
01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.350
That would have been interesting had they because then it would have changed the

1195
01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:43.630
pricing of everything. But why would they be,

1196
01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:47.120
are you going to make a car and no one has a road to drive it on?

1197
01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:52.120
[inaudible] it's what, it's your responsibility then you don't have a business.

1198
01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:56.320
But don't you want a car? Yes. So we all agree cars are good,

1199
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:59.020
they move fast, they get you where you want to go. Right.

1200
01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:02.950
So how do we as a society make it easier for people to get where they want to go

1201
01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.930
while we all chip in and we make roads,

1202
01:15:05.470 --> 01:15:09.030
it's not entirely before there were cars, cars, nobody is thinking, you know,

1203
01:15:09.031 --> 01:15:11.410
I want to go to Chicago tomorrow and I'll be back on Thursday.

1204
01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.680
No one is even having that thought for their email. No one was thinking,

1205
01:15:14.681 --> 01:15:16.930
I'm going to send you an email. These are not thoughts.

1206
01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.850
So I'm just talking about all the forces that had to align to make it actually

1207
01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:25.570
work. Okay, so now what's holding back electric cars? Well,

1208
01:15:25.571 --> 01:15:26.980
I might not be able to charge it.

1209
01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:30.070
It takes a little too long to charge compared to my other vehicle.

1210
01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:33.730
Are there enough chargers along the way? Well,

1211
01:15:33.731 --> 01:15:36.310
these were questions that were asked when people got cars.

1212
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:40.060
If I have cars and it tastes gas, is there a gas station? Oh, standard all says,

1213
01:15:40.061 --> 01:15:43.570
we'll put a gas station there because you're buying cars.

1214
01:15:44.020 --> 01:15:49.020
And so it's a whole family of businesses coming together and you're paying for a

1215
01:15:49.871 --> 01:15:54.520
big part of that. It's not just the car you paid for the roads.

1216
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:59.410
So I'm saying I'm not complaining about it. I'm just describing it as a reality.

1217
01:15:59.411 --> 01:15:59.831
I get it.

1218
01:15:59.831 --> 01:16:04.150
I just didn't understand the comparison to car manufacturers paying for that.

1219
01:16:04.151 --> 01:16:07.660
They say, if I make a car and I want you to buy my car, I need a road.

1220
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:11.140
So I'm going to build the road. Oh wait a minute.

1221
01:16:11.141 --> 01:16:14.830
I convinced you to build a road that's even better. Oh my gosh.

1222
01:16:14.831 --> 01:16:18.520
I made it a national priority. Oh, it's a security problem. We need a,

1223
01:16:18.670 --> 01:16:22.360
we need a military design interstate system.

1224
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:24.820
That's what the interstates, military,

1225
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:27.010
that's why it goes through mountains instead of over them.

1226
01:16:27.610 --> 01:16:30.580
That's why they're long stretches of straightaway so you can land an airplane on

1227
01:16:30.581 --> 01:16:32.710
it. That's why they're built above the road.

1228
01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:35.410
That's why the surface roads are not the same thing as highways.

1229
01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.230
Cause I always are not on the surface. Why? Because they built up why?

1230
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:41.470
Cause tanks can drive on them without decomposing the road.

1231
01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:45.550
What specs did we put this to? To the Autobahn.

1232
01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:49.210
The Germans invented the modern highway system. They invented the cloverleaf,

1233
01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.530
they invented the off-ramps.

1234
01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:54.430
They invented all of that and their armies could move on their roads like it was

1235
01:16:54.431 --> 01:16:58.840
nobody's business. And Eisenhower said, Hey, I'll get me some of that. He comes,

1236
01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:00.730
this is probably not how he said it, I'm guessing,

1237
01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:05.130
but he comes over convinces us all that we need to build an internist.

1238
01:17:05.170 --> 01:17:06.700
I got nothing against the interstate system.

1239
01:17:06.701 --> 01:17:10.730
I'm just giving you the foundational facts for it. And by the way,

1240
01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:12.770
the interstate system costs as much as going to the moon,

1241
01:17:13.670 --> 01:17:15.920
about a hundred billion dollars in total cost.

1242
01:17:16.290 --> 01:17:19.100
It seems like a bargain compared to how many people use it versus having to

1243
01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:23.630
watch the moon. And it grows the economy that has a lot of, a lot of, um,

1244
01:17:23.870 --> 01:17:25.840
but basically it was sold as a, as,

1245
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:29.630
as a security need because if you're at war,

1246
01:17:29.631 --> 01:17:33.290
you need to move material and personnel and you might have to land an airplane,

1247
01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:38.270
um, uh, in an emergency way. And so all freeways do this.

1248
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:42.380
You're going to crash a plane, do it on a freeway happens. Yeah,

1249
01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.200
but do it cause you might land safely. And if you don't land safely,

1250
01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:50.570
the road comes to you to get to the hospital. Don't crash in a forest.

1251
01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:55.130
We can't get to you. Right? You can't get emergency vehicles. Could call,

1252
01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:57.470
you know, uh,

1253
01:17:57.470 --> 01:18:00.710
if you've seen this new Porsche has a new electric vehicle that is about to

1254
01:18:00.711 --> 01:18:04.450
release in the evolutionary, groundbreaking technologies. What's allowed,

1255
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:07.010
what's groundbreak charge much faster.

1256
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:10.790
You could charge up to 80% in 20 minutes because a,

1257
01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:14.600
it's double the well, pull up, pull up the, uh, information.

1258
01:18:14.601 --> 01:18:18.440
Was it wattage or amperage? Well, just, just a couple of things.

1259
01:18:18.441 --> 01:18:21.860
Different battery. You can't cheat physics, so, so yeah,

1260
01:18:21.861 --> 01:18:23.540
some batteries charge faster than others.

1261
01:18:23.541 --> 01:18:28.010
But w what's what really drives the charging speed of battery is the,

1262
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:33.550
is the voltage over which you charge the battery and [inaudible] it goes as the

1263
01:18:34.161 --> 01:18:36.970
square of the voltage, right? So supercharger,

1264
01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:39.410
so if you charge a,

1265
01:18:39.850 --> 01:18:43.790
an electric car in your 120 volt home electricity,

1266
01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:49.520
it could take 30 hours. If you go to 240 volts, okay.

1267
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:51.500
It'll take, you know, 10 hours.

1268
01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.550
If you go to 384 volts, you keep going up.

1269
01:18:55.970 --> 01:19:00.290
That drops precipitously and you can get a voltage where the thing will charge

1270
01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:03.500
in a few couple hours. Yeah. We have a supercharger here.

1271
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:06.470
We do set up here for my Tesla. So there you go.

1272
01:19:06.471 --> 01:19:09.660
Which Tesla has quickly the s yes. Yeah. Cool. Yeah, so,

1273
01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.530
so you'll charge it in at most 90 minutes?

1274
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:16.190
I don't think they call it that anymore. I think they out superchargers. No,

1275
01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:20.960
there's the Tesla, I think they call it a like they have like an s raven.

1276
01:19:20.961 --> 01:19:24.680
They have, did they call it the s anymore? Now? It's not the p one under d.

1277
01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:28.430
That's the, that's the height battery capacity. Okay. Now they,

1278
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:32.510
I think they have it based on whether it's a single engine or double engine.

1279
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:33.680
They've simplified things,

1280
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:38.330
also removed all the labels to make it a little slicker. Sleeker.

1281
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:41.170
So did in the porch, is it just they pull it up,

1282
01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:45.590
they're selling a higher voltage charger to you or is it the battery?

1283
01:19:45.591 --> 01:19:50.330
So completely different. Google 10 interesting things about the new pours.

1284
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:54.620
Ty can, how'd he say a tie can. That's the article I was reading today.

1285
01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:56.720
So that's cool.

1286
01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:01.100
So my concern is batteries are still kind of 19th century technology. Yeah.

1287
01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:05.810
You know, invented the battery Volta. Alexandra Volta. Oh, that makes sense.

1288
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:10.800
Cool. Yeah. Voltage Volvo's volts come from him.

1289
01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:14.790
[inaudible] yeah, yeah. All these guys got, you know, they got famous. So Tesla,

1290
01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.360
we got a car named after him. The guy had it now has a card.

1291
01:20:17.361 --> 01:20:21.650
There's actually a unit of electromagnetism named after Nikola Tesla. Yeah.

1292
01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:26.640
It's a webers per square meter, I think.

1293
01:20:26.641 --> 01:20:27.960
So. It's like the,

1294
01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:33.890
the density of magnetic field strength within a certain area through,

1295
01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:40.110
through a surface. So batteries are charged by an inductive plate.

1296
01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:43.350
The conventional tress ports claims that the Porsche Turbo charging system

1297
01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:49.160
charges at 350,000 watts kilowatts in 15 minutes.

1298
01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:52.170
80% in just 15 minutes. Oh, that's cool.

1299
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.290
It's not clear how various shit will prevent battery overheating.

1300
01:20:55.470 --> 01:21:00.360
Maybe they are all good luck bitch. So it could be vaporware, but we'll see.

1301
01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:03.090
But they've already been done it. Well, but it's game on.

1302
01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:05.880
That's what that means. Yes, it's game on whether it works or not.

1303
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:10.260
It's like people Tesla's on notice. Everybody's on notice. Yeah. Oh my gosh,

1304
01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:13.500
I'm going to lose market share because people want to buy an electric car.

1305
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:17.430
And so you didn't want something that's going to charge fast.

1306
01:21:17.431 --> 01:21:20.790
And that's the number one complaint that most people have over electric cars.

1307
01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:23.130
Will you find a way to, okay, so that's one way.

1308
01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:27.510
But another way is you find a way to swap batteries as quickly as in less time

1309
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:29.650
that it takes to fill a tank. You know,

1310
01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:32.730
how much time do you stand there with your hand on the nozzle waiting for the

1311
01:21:32.731 --> 01:21:33.870
gas to go in? Right.

1312
01:21:33.871 --> 01:21:36.420
So they would have to have a mountain of battery sitting there and waiting for

1313
01:21:36.421 --> 01:21:39.720
people to just come in and does it any worse than a mountain that, than a,

1314
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:43.620
than a sunken reservoir tank of gas. There's no different.

1315
01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.090
Why is that any different? Probably be larger volume, right? Possibly.

1316
01:21:48.091 --> 01:21:50.340
But so what if it's economic? You just do it.

1317
01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:55.380
And if the battery's all at the bottom of the car and you go like NASCAR,

1318
01:21:55.381 --> 01:22:00.000
you run in, pop it up, take out the battery, put the next one,

1319
01:22:00.001 --> 01:22:01.950
you're off. Do you think that's the future? Why not?

1320
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:05.970
It's better than charging the battery. You don't have a car idea. I know I do.

1321
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:09.060
[inaudible] yeah, I do have cars now. I didn't use to, I didn't use to,

1322
01:22:09.210 --> 01:22:12.420
it's expensive as hell to garage it in New York. They just went up.

1323
01:22:12.421 --> 01:22:14.220
The price just went up. The big,

1324
01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:19.250
the big price point of that was when did the average cost to garage a car for a

1325
01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:25.160
month in New York in Manhattan equal the average cost of a two bedroom home in

1326
01:22:25.591 --> 01:22:30.120
the United States. And we've passed that cost of rent. Let's see.

1327
01:22:30.121 --> 01:22:34.200
So cost more. It was like $600 a month or something to rent a parking spot.

1328
01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:38.370
Do you rent a parking spot, right? One spot, one spot a month per month.

1329
01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:43.300
And You can rent the home in many places in the suburbs somewhere for $600 a

1330
01:22:43.450 --> 01:22:48.090
car. You drive. So I now have a Tesla. Yeah. So I, I, I, I ponied up,

1331
01:22:48.450 --> 01:22:51.420
they're expensive by the way. I'm sorry. Yeah. So I have the x,

1332
01:22:51.450 --> 01:22:55.440
so that's my sort of utility vehicle. The x is the SUV, uh,

1333
01:22:55.470 --> 01:23:00.000
very high acceleration as you know. And um, but yeah, I, there's,

1334
01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:03.930
there's no maintenance on it, right? There was no oil change. There was no,

1335
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:09.100
you know, the only moving part is the, what'd you turn in the wheels with,

1336
01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:12.340
right. [inaudible] no pistons, nothing. So, you know,

1337
01:23:12.341 --> 01:23:15.490
cars really should've been this a hundred years ago and then we would've had a a

1338
01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:17.620
hundred years of clever engineering to perfect that.

1339
01:23:17.650 --> 01:23:20.140
You ever see the documentary who killed the electric car? No, I haven't,

1340
01:23:20.141 --> 01:23:23.890
but I know about it and I know some of the background story behind it and the

1341
01:23:23.891 --> 01:23:27.730
electric car was one of the first ones because electricity was all the rage a

1342
01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:30.220
hundred years ago. It's electrify the cities this days. There's Edison,

1343
01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:33.100
there's tasks. Everybody wants to do everything electric.

1344
01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.530
And the car had just come out, let's do it. Electric.

1345
01:23:35.650 --> 01:23:40.650
So this was not a new concept and it's unfortunate that more sort of innovative

1346
01:23:41.770 --> 01:23:45.760
thinkers hadn't been brought to task on how to perfect the electric car.

1347
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.770
Speaking of Tesla and electricity,

1348
01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:53.920
what did you think about Tesla's initial idea that Westinghouse shot down to

1349
01:23:54.821 --> 01:23:59.170
sort of broadcast electricity so that people could just pull it out of the air?

1350
01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:01.090
Yeah, so the people in

1351
01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:08.080
the Nicola Tesla Fan Club somehow feel that he got wronged in his life. Okay.

1352
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:13.560
And surely some of that is true with regard to his business acumen and patents

1353
01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:17.320
and, and who owns the patent and who does, does he have good business sense?

1354
01:24:17.321 --> 01:24:20.470
Is he as savvy or as, as sneaky,

1355
01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:24.010
whatever other words you might apply to Edison. Right. So I get that.

1356
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:29.710
But his contributions to electromagnetism are real and recognized in the world

1357
01:24:29.711 --> 01:24:33.520
of physics. Like I said, there's a unit of electromagnetism named after him,

1358
01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.840
so don't come crying to me. Say he was not recognized by my people. Okay.

1359
01:24:37.930 --> 01:24:38.950
He's recognized,

1360
01:24:39.340 --> 01:24:44.340
he had some ideas that were a little out there and out there on a level where

1361
01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:51.220
it almost certainly would have not worked. And here's why.

1362
01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.170
Okay. Um,

1363
01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:58.420
electromagnetic energy is communicating between us. I see you.

1364
01:24:58.450 --> 01:25:02.950
That's cause visible light is reflecting off of your scalp. Okay?

1365
01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:05.470
To me, it's reflecting off of my nose. Back to you.

1366
01:25:06.130 --> 01:25:08.890
You can ask how much energy is in that. Well, not much.

1367
01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:11.980
There's not much energy in a visible light. Photons,

1368
01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:15.580
if you stay there long enough, you might feel a little warmth where I'm at,

1369
01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.130
but no, you're not going to drive a car with that energy.

1370
01:25:18.131 --> 01:25:23.050
You're not going to run a motor with it. Okay, well, of what good is it? Oh,

1371
01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:25.690
you know what we found? We can use electromagnetic radio waves,

1372
01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.450
which are the lowest form of electromagnetic energy,

1373
01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:31.900
lowest energy level of all of our life. We can trade away.

1374
01:25:31.901 --> 01:25:35.590
It's not to transmit energy. That's not the point of it.

1375
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:41.160
The point is to transmit information and information became what?

1376
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:43.630
Characterize the modern era,

1377
01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:48.670
and that's why in the 1950s and sixties when everyone is imagining flying cars

1378
01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.490
and motorized sidewalks,

1379
01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:54.760
everything is running on energy because they're thinking energy is going to be

1380
01:25:54.761 --> 01:25:56.080
free in the future.

1381
01:25:56.860 --> 01:26:01.860
But what they didn't figure was that information would be free or easy to

1382
01:26:03.471 --> 01:26:06.860
transmit and to generate and to store and to,

1383
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:12.070
to delete and whereas the energy that would take to move things and to drive

1384
01:26:13.521 --> 01:26:17.810
things, that would be a problem. No one saw that coming. Nobody saw that coming.

1385
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:22.700
So as your photons get higher and higher energy, yes,

1386
01:26:22.701 --> 01:26:26.030
you can start doing things with them. You get x-rays and gamma rays,

1387
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:27.980
but that's not what Tesla was referring to.

1388
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:31.880
He was talking about moving radio waves through the space that would charge

1389
01:26:31.881 --> 01:26:32.714
things up.

1390
01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:38.260
You can't pack sufficient energy in your radio wave to do anything we need to do

1391
01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:44.600
mechanically, currently, currently. Well back then,

1392
01:26:44.630 --> 01:26:45.620
would it be sufficient?

1393
01:26:45.710 --> 01:26:48.860
There might've been something you could have done with your radio waves because

1394
01:26:48.861 --> 01:26:51.500
the needs were no, but that no snow, I take that back.

1395
01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.690
That was the height of the industrial revolution.

1396
01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:58.130
That was the age of the machine. The age of the giant turbines.

1397
01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.400
Radio energy is not touching that right,

1398
01:27:01.401 --> 01:27:06.110
but wasn't it possible that he was considering it for things like radios or

1399
01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:08.990
light bulbs or household items?

1400
01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.730
What would it be possible to use that power for that. So now what?

1401
01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:14.300
So what happens? So the radio waves,

1402
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:18.470
if you had enough power and radio waves to generate a light bulb to power a

1403
01:27:18.471 --> 01:27:19.304
light bulb,

1404
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:25.010
well how through the air are you standing in the way of this?

1405
01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.680
This energy has pathways.

1406
01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.180
We now send energy through wires because you're not standing in the way of the

1407
01:27:32.181 --> 01:27:36.500
wire. The wire is buried, the wire has insulation, [inaudible] high suspension.

1408
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:41.690
You want to move it through the air and you want to walk around like no,

1409
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:43.340
that's not how that works.

1410
01:27:44.130 --> 01:27:49.130
But I've heard people moving enough energy through the air to power something

1411
01:27:49.430 --> 01:27:50.870
that itself could kill you.

1412
01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.920
The energy powering through the moving through the air could kill you unless

1413
01:27:54.921 --> 01:27:58.580
you, you bring a little bit amount and then you store it and then use it later.

1414
01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:02.300
You could do it that way. Sure. Some sort of batteries.

1415
01:28:02.490 --> 01:28:03.530
Yes you need a storage system,

1416
01:28:04.170 --> 01:28:07.100
but you would still probably have some sort of residual effect of having this

1417
01:28:07.101 --> 01:28:10.160
stuff broadcast through the air and who knows what it would do to human health.

1418
01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:12.230
If you needed that much energy. Right now,

1419
01:28:12.350 --> 01:28:17.180
the energy to transmit information is so low that it know it has no effect on

1420
01:28:17.181 --> 01:28:20.690
your health. That's why I can pull out my cell phone. I'm in a brick.

1421
01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:22.730
This fake brick that's fake brick.

1422
01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:26.060
I'm in a building that knows and I notice it is. Go touch it.

1423
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:30.950
I don't believe you. Go ahead. That was a real bricks. Go touch the bricks man.

1424
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:34.760
Jesus Christ thinks we got fake bricks. Who Do you think we are?

1425
01:28:36.710 --> 01:28:41.650
Oh you got it. Thought it was a liar. How weird. Now let me be honest here.

1426
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:44.870
So, so it's a veneer. A brick veneer. Okay. It's the whole day thing.

1427
01:28:44.990 --> 01:28:46.730
Got Real building. It's not structural.

1428
01:28:46.731 --> 01:28:51.200
Brick sliced the end of bricks and then the mortar it in and everything. Okay,

1429
01:28:51.201 --> 01:28:56.000
so, so we're both right. It's real. It's real brick, but it's not structural.

1430
01:28:56.430 --> 01:29:01.070
[inaudible] brick. So here I am real fake. So we're inside.

1431
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:03.750
I can pull on my cell phone and have a phone call. Yes.

1432
01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:08.460
These are microwaves of a frequency that can penetrate walls,

1433
01:29:08.790 --> 01:29:11.370
send information to my cell phone,

1434
01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:16.500
and I can communicate using information and not have that energy kill me.

1435
01:29:16.620 --> 01:29:19.830
But it's not enough to power the actual, it is not enough to power the device.

1436
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.420
Correct. So antisocial, intentional Teslas,

1437
01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:25.830
everyone is thinking he's got the solution to the future transmission of energy.

1438
01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:28.380
No, he doesn't. Well, I don't think anyone's saying that,

1439
01:29:28.381 --> 01:29:32.940
but what he does and his fans do. But back then there were no computers.

1440
01:29:32.941 --> 01:29:36.090
Back then. There were no television, but we did have machines.

1441
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:38.280
It was the era of the big machine. Right.

1442
01:29:38.281 --> 01:29:40.590
But I don't think he was insinuating that you could use,

1443
01:29:40.591 --> 01:29:41.560
I don't know what he wanted to power.

1444
01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:43.020
I don't know what he would have powered with it,

1445
01:29:43.021 --> 01:29:45.000
if not light bulbs and other things. You know,

1446
01:29:45.001 --> 01:29:46.500
one thing you brought up that's really interesting.

1447
01:29:46.501 --> 01:29:48.870
You saw talked about light reflecting off of things.

1448
01:29:48.871 --> 01:29:53.580
Are you aware that BMW painted a, they painted one of their cars.

1449
01:29:54.090 --> 01:29:58.650
Vantaa black. I saw this is jet black. Yes. I saw you saw one recently black.

1450
01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:01.840
So light can bounce off of it. Right.

1451
01:30:01.890 --> 01:30:05.610
So not only hint drive it cause people won't be able to see it at night.

1452
01:30:06.570 --> 01:30:08.690
They're literally saying like this is just the theoretical.

1453
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:12.660
I mean like what would you want to do? You can align it with the image of it.

1454
01:30:12.810 --> 01:30:16.380
Cause I saw one in a parking lot. It's fuck, it's very bad. You saw a real life.

1455
01:30:16.950 --> 01:30:21.420
That's not what I saw. I saw a sportscar version saw Vantaa black car.

1456
01:30:21.421 --> 01:30:23.490
They have the, I saw a sports car that was,

1457
01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.920
there was not this the car you have up the, I don't know what that is. What?

1458
01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:28.560
I saw a BMW that they painted vantive black. Okay,

1459
01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:30.780
well then the best black is available. I'm on there.

1460
01:30:30.781 --> 01:30:33.360
Badass low to the ground sports car.

1461
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:38.070
And so I know it's not available commercially. What do you want me to say?

1462
01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:42.360
I'm saying that for BMW it's not, it's not something they're off. I'm an La,

1463
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:45.290
you have all your cars here and everything showcased here. What?

1464
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:48.660
I didn't see it in New York. I saw it here in la. Well I'm sure.

1465
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:52.500
So maybe it wasn't a BMW. Maybe somebody else did. And I'm just saying BMW.

1466
01:30:52.501 --> 01:30:57.090
If someone did it, BMW didn't make it themselves. Okay. Someone must have done,

1467
01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:59.810
I mean you can do it. It's a real thing. Vantaa black. Okay.

1468
01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:05.070
So one of the principles of stealth is that if you send a signal to it,

1469
01:31:06.030 --> 01:31:07.200
it never comes back to you.

1470
01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:11.220
So you have no sort of radar measure of existence.

1471
01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.360
Correct. But there are two ways you can do that.

1472
01:31:15.390 --> 01:31:19.530
One of them is you cannot reflect back. Okay.

1473
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:21.780
But so by absorbing it, right. Okay,

1474
01:31:22.110 --> 01:31:26.760
so jet matte black will absorb it and not reflected back.

1475
01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.720
But if there's enough energy coming at it, it will heat up.

1476
01:31:31.320 --> 01:31:34.680
Cause you can't get something for nothing here. It'll heat up the skin of that.

1477
01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:38.370
And it could be bad for the occupants. That's what they said about the yard.

1478
01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:41.640
The article about Vanta Block. If you put that in the desert, forget it.

1479
01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:44.580
Well they were saying even in Los Angeles, so hot. Exactly.

1480
01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:49.650
So another way to do it is the signal comes to me and I reflect it in a

1481
01:31:49.651 --> 01:31:51.270
direction that is not back to you.

1482
01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:57.590
So the B two bomber is not only non-reflective back to you,

1483
01:31:58.710 --> 01:32:03.710
it takes the signal and reflects it and double bounces it so that all your

1484
01:32:04.481 --> 01:32:06.880
energy gets sent in other directions and knocked back to you.

1485
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.780
So it doesn't then keep the energy that was sent to it.

1486
01:32:11.470 --> 01:32:13.630
So that's another way to do it. Another,

1487
01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:17.140
there's another stealth which was featured in one of the recent,

1488
01:32:17.141 --> 01:32:21.760
not recent four years ago. James Bond movies where light that comes at it,

1489
01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:27.420
the light that's behind it goes around it coherently and continues to come

1490
01:32:28.391 --> 01:32:33.391
towards you so that you think you're seeing what's behind it and it's not there.

1491
01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:37.630
You are seeing what's behind it.

1492
01:32:37.810 --> 01:32:41.590
But the path of that light when around the vessel and continued on its way to

1493
01:32:41.591 --> 01:32:45.670
you. So you think you're just seeing the grass in the tree,

1494
01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:50.800
but there's a car sitting right there. You don't know about this technology?

1495
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:56.350
No. Right now it exists only for very, a look up, a stealth, um,

1496
01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:58.630
light ray stuff.

1497
01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:04.260
And so the material has to be able to know what is behind it.

1498
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:06.550
And you're saying small objects [inaudible] no, no, no.

1499
01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:08.920
Only with that only works in one sight line.

1500
01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.290
Whereas if you needed functional stealth,

1501
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:14.560
everybody looking at it should be every path,

1502
01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:16.540
every sightline two.

1503
01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:19.630
It should be able to see what's behind it on the other side of that side,

1504
01:33:19.631 --> 01:33:22.510
the way it reflects things. No, it doesn't. Yeah. It's,

1505
01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:26.170
it carries the light beam around it and sends it out the other side.

1506
01:33:26.410 --> 01:33:29.710
You able to find it? Yeah. Yeah. But you have,

1507
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:33.520
is it like a solid block in a person who's looking at it and you see their eye

1508
01:33:33.521 --> 01:33:38.050
out the other side? It's really freaky. That's a future of stealth.

1509
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:42.950
What are your thoughts on digital privacy? What do you mean? Well,

1510
01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:45.940
like phones, you know, like phones.

1511
01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:50.020
Like do you ever talk to someone about something and then you see it in your

1512
01:33:50.021 --> 01:33:54.960
Google feed? Do you see ads? Uh, yeah. So, uh,

1513
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:59.290
we don't, I mean I haven't researched this, but uh,

1514
01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:03.490
my wife tell her we were once gifted one of these, you know,

1515
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:08.120
what do you call those things that you talk to whoever the Google one is,

1516
01:34:08.121 --> 01:34:11.710
is that Alexa goes home, Google at home. No, Alexis is Amazon, right?

1517
01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:15.430
So was Google at home and she says, don't turn that on. I said, why not?

1518
01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:18.640
Cause they'll be listening and I didn't believe her at first.

1519
01:34:18.641 --> 01:34:23.530
And then I started hearing stories and so I, so I don't have one, but it's not,

1520
01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:27.320
cause I know that it's listening or not listening. Substantiated.

1521
01:34:27.330 --> 01:34:30.250
I mean actual set up.

1522
01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:35.380
They have apologized for actual human contractors listening in to conversations

1523
01:34:35.921 --> 01:34:40.570
that people have had, having sex, having arguments. Like it's real.

1524
01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:45.100
Yeah. I that seems like it should be a problem. So what's your question to me?

1525
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:49.390
What am I all for it or am I, what's your question? No, my question is,

1526
01:34:49.690 --> 01:34:54.100
one of the things that you're getting out of their ability to scan things is

1527
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:57.800
they're tailoring things to your liking. Like, you know,

1528
01:34:57.801 --> 01:35:00.680
like your phone tells you it's 22 minutes until you get home. I get it.

1529
01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:02.480
And you're like, bitch, how do you know where I live? Exactly.

1530
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:06.410
I didn't tell you where I live. I got it. Here it is. Um,

1531
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:09.710
and I'm just old fashioned about this. Okay.

1532
01:35:09.890 --> 01:35:12.560
I'm get off my lawn about this. Yeah.

1533
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:16.400
I'm the old man in the rocking chair on the porch saying Sonny, get off my lawn.

1534
01:35:16.401 --> 01:35:20.060
But you're also scientist. Okay. But I don't want to, okay.

1535
01:35:20.061 --> 01:35:23.180
I wear multiple hats. I'm also a dad. I'm also a husband.

1536
01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:26.480
I've got all these hats for all those things. In this particular case,

1537
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:31.870
I'm old man and my old man sensibility is if you track what I shop at a store,

1538
01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:40.480
what would I buy at a store and then send me coupons based on what you think I'm

1539
01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:45.860
going to buy next based on what I bought before,

1540
01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:47.750
which is kind of the same thing you're describing.

1541
01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:53.800
You have denied me the chance of stumbling upon something that I never thought

1542
01:35:55.521 --> 01:35:59.880
of buying and that takes away my freedoms and I don't want that. How,

1543
01:35:59.950 --> 01:36:03.580
how have they denied you the chance of stumbling upon something different.

1544
01:36:03.581 --> 01:36:08.380
It's not diabolical. It's just in the casual flow of life. I'll give an example.

1545
01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:11.620
I walked into a wine shop, does it, can I help you?

1546
01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:17.560
And I say, if you help me find what I'm looking for,

1547
01:36:18.460 --> 01:36:22.450
it's a guarantee that I will never find what I'm not looking for

1548
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:26.810
and I'll end up spending less money in your wine shop.

1549
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:31.880
That's a weird way of looking at this. The Art of browsing, dude,

1550
01:36:31.881 --> 01:36:35.150
you're old enough to remember when I got to look up this word in a dictionary

1551
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:38.540
and you get through six other words. Oh, I never knew that word.

1552
01:36:38.541 --> 01:36:42.050
Let me read that. You learn other words on route to the word you're targeting.

1553
01:36:42.170 --> 01:36:43.130
I understand. Okay,

1554
01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:48.500
well that is how I feel and that's how I think about my interaction with this

1555
01:36:48.561 --> 01:36:50.480
world. I'd like the randomness.

1556
01:36:50.690 --> 01:36:53.660
The randomness of it enriches my life.

1557
01:36:54.230 --> 01:36:58.160
And if you're going to advertise to me because you think you know who I am,

1558
01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:59.720
maybe you do,

1559
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:05.950
but I'll ultimately end up spending less money because it's the diversity of how

1560
01:37:06.441 --> 01:37:10.970
I think and what I buy and what I think of buying and how I buy it and how much

1561
01:37:10.971 --> 01:37:15.700
money I spend. That is the richness of the life I lead. You're trying,

1562
01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:20.270
you're trying to channel me into some product,

1563
01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:23.420
so some something that fulfills a,

1564
01:37:23.421 --> 01:37:25.520
what do you call it when they have the w the study,

1565
01:37:25.521 --> 01:37:29.760
whether you're going to buy something or not. [inaudible] no, no. The the, the

1566
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:35.630
table of people. Do you like this product or not a focus group? Yes.

1567
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:40.040
Am I just a focus group to you? If I am,

1568
01:37:40.970 --> 01:37:45.970
you don't know me and I want to experience this world by stepping where I've

1569
01:37:47.331 --> 01:37:50.660
never stepped before and buying something I've never thought of buying.

1570
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:53.360
And if you know my previous habits,

1571
01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:57.480
you're assuming I'm going to stay that way for the rest of my life and maybe

1572
01:37:57.510 --> 01:38:01.950
most people do, and maybe I might do that. But if I do it because I chose to,

1573
01:38:02.070 --> 01:38:05.850
not because you have decided that that's how I should be. Well,

1574
01:38:05.851 --> 01:38:07.380
don't you think they're screaming at you? I'm sorry.

1575
01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:08.700
You're getting a little excited. Sorry.

1576
01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:11.070
Don't you think they're just doing that because they think it would be effective

1577
01:38:11.071 --> 01:38:15.630
to advertise in that way. So if you go googling, um, new Nike's,

1578
01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:20.550
and then as you're looking at something and a Google ad pops up and it's for new

1579
01:38:20.551 --> 01:38:24.230
Nike's, I said, hey, now I know you were looking at the [inaudible].

1580
01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:29.310
We saw an ab a, I just need a little nudge. I mean, it's not,

1581
01:38:29.311 --> 01:38:33.750
I don't think that's that diabolical. I'm s I'm the old man on the porch.

1582
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:36.780
I'm saying the next generation might feel completely different stim. I see.

1583
01:38:36.781 --> 01:38:38.580
I love it. They know exactly what I want.

1584
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.690
You heard about the case where they were there? Uh, I, I read this,

1585
01:38:42.691 --> 01:38:45.820
I haven't re verified it, but it's completely plausible. Uh,

1586
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:50.870
there was a teenage girl who was googling pregnancy tests cause maybe she got

1587
01:38:52.021 --> 01:38:53.250
pregnant. Okay.

1588
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:58.260
And the fact that she had searched pregnancy tests,

1589
01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:03.860
she got coupons in the mail for baby products and our parents said,

1590
01:39:04.491 --> 01:39:06.080
what are the why? What is this?

1591
01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:07.643
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1592
01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:10.610
<v 1>She got outed. That's a little weird. Yeah.</v>

1593
01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:14.460
But it's the kind of thing that can happen that seems, that seems intrusive.

1594
01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:18.780
Certainly there's only because it's pregnancy, it's incredible in every way. No,

1595
01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.920
don't tell me it's not intrusive because you want to buy Nike's,

1596
01:39:22.360 --> 01:39:24.060
you physical things.

1597
01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:28.110
There's not just something that appears on your Google feed that you can quickly

1598
01:39:28.111 --> 01:39:28.944
glance over.

1599
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.040
What's the difference between send you mail to your mailbox and filling your

1600
01:39:34.411 --> 01:39:38.250
advertising space in front of your face with product?

1601
01:39:38.410 --> 01:39:41.690
What's one other people can see it. I walk by your computer. I can see it.

1602
01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:42.803
Don't look,

1603
01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:50.100
I guess I'm arguing in principle rather than in detail. Okay.

1604
01:39:50.101 --> 01:39:55.050
Well let me take the counterpoint in the end. On the positive side,

1605
01:39:55.350 --> 01:40:00.350
what they're doing in terms of particularly Google in terms of your driving,

1606
01:40:01.650 --> 01:40:02.400
right.

1607
01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:07.320
And in terms of using of Google maps and documenting the history of all these

1608
01:40:07.321 --> 01:40:11.070
people driving and especially with things like ways which they acquired as

1609
01:40:11.071 --> 01:40:14.970
they've developed a much more efficient products than apple.

1610
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:19.890
Which what apple does, the apple maps, they shred everything you do.

1611
01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:22.440
Yes they do. They did. They bought where you been and where you're going.

1612
01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.540
See that's correct. But apple maps sucks. So you have to,

1613
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:29.090
cause they don't have enough data, they don't have nearly the amount of data.

1614
01:40:29.091 --> 01:40:32.510
Google has billions. Do Google giving you that apple maps isn't,

1615
01:40:34.770 --> 01:40:37.590
they're telling you you're 22 minutes from home time for you to drive home.

1616
01:40:38.110 --> 01:40:42.600
You valuing that well yes. And also map, wait, hold on.

1617
01:40:42.730 --> 01:40:44.100
There are programs far better.

1618
01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:48.090
I can ask it how long it'll take me to go somewhere rather than it knowing what

1619
01:40:48.091 --> 01:40:52.080
my drug, what my daytime schedule looks like. And then coming in like you said,

1620
01:40:52.081 --> 01:40:56.140
how do you know bitch? You know I had that same reaction as you did. And I said,

1621
01:40:56.141 --> 01:40:59.620
I wonder why, what's causing this? It's a little creepy. And again,

1622
01:40:59.621 --> 01:41:00.640
I'm the old man syndrome.

1623
01:41:00.641 --> 01:41:05.641
So a 10 year old kid that's only ever known this and becomes 15 and 20 that is

1624
01:41:05.741 --> 01:41:07.960
life to them. Right? Why would they even,

1625
01:41:08.650 --> 01:41:12.010
maybe they're not gonna complain about it, but I'm the old man on the porch,

1626
01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:13.960
but you know what I'm saying? Get off my lawn,

1627
01:41:13.961 --> 01:41:16.930
sort of intrusiveness or at the very least,

1628
01:41:16.931 --> 01:41:21.850
this connection that you have to these devices and that they have to your

1629
01:41:21.851 --> 01:41:24.610
patterns and your information, it seems inevitable.

1630
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:28.570
That doesn't mean I have to welcome it with open arms, but I agree.

1631
01:41:28.571 --> 01:41:32.080
It's inevitable. I agree. Plus we have security cameras everywhere.

1632
01:41:32.081 --> 01:41:33.070
Everybody knows where you are.

1633
01:41:33.310 --> 01:41:37.600
If the KGB had access to people the way we in the,

1634
01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:41.950
during the Cold War, the way modern the United States has access to us,

1635
01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:47.170
we would say, oh my gosh, you have taken away your country's freedoms.

1636
01:41:47.170 --> 01:41:50.470
Where the free leaders of the free world and you guys have been prisoned your

1637
01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:53.710
entire population. Oh my gosh.

1638
01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.300
The KGB would give their right arm to have the monitoring devices that are

1639
01:41:58.330 --> 01:42:03.100
actively in place here in the United States today. We know where you are.

1640
01:42:03.101 --> 01:42:05.740
We know how long you stayed there. We have records of it.

1641
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:09.400
We know what streets you were walking on. We don't necessarily monitor it,

1642
01:42:09.401 --> 01:42:13.150
but we can dig it up if we have to. And with facial recognition,

1643
01:42:13.151 --> 01:42:16.240
I can track you wherever you are. I feel like there, use the facial recognition.

1644
01:42:16.330 --> 01:42:18.190
I use it now. It doesn't care if I'm wearing,

1645
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:21.370
if I'm wearing a hat or sunglasses, it still knows who the hell I am.

1646
01:42:23.500 --> 01:42:24.850
It relies on so many points.

1647
01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:29.020
You have so many points of cheekbones and nose eye separations and everything.

1648
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:34.230
I think ratios of numbers are highly powerful probes of the structure in the

1649
01:42:35.981 --> 01:42:39.100
form of things. Just so you know the Fibonacci sequence, right?

1650
01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:43.330
That could be in there if you have a Fibonacci head, doesn't everybody's face.

1651
01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:46.480
She was, I think is a little overplayed. Fibonacci's a little overplayed.

1652
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:49.570
Especially once you get a nose job. So Fibonacci,

1653
01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:51.790
you can find it in nature and say, Oh, isn't this beautiful?

1654
01:42:51.791 --> 01:42:55.900
But you've overlooked all the places where it doesn't show up in nature so pure.

1655
01:42:56.120 --> 01:43:00.860
So many times it doesn't appear in more places than it does appear. Right.

1656
01:43:01.020 --> 01:43:05.560
But in a lot of living things, living fans of course combs, pineapples,

1657
01:43:05.561 --> 01:43:09.350
there's a lot of sunflower seeds. It's very, or sunflowers flowers. Yeah.

1658
01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:12.910
Really Weird isn't it? Yeah.

1659
01:43:13.330 --> 01:43:15.690
I mean it's just this random, I mean not random, but this is,

1660
01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:19.570
well if the next thing you do depends on the previous two things you did,

1661
01:43:19.571 --> 01:43:21.040
you get the Fibonacci series.

1662
01:43:21.790 --> 01:43:26.650
I mean that's often the case with say, you know,

1663
01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:30.520
think of things in your life you do wear.

1664
01:43:30.521 --> 01:43:33.490
The third thing you do depends on you having done the previous two things in

1665
01:43:33.650 --> 01:43:36.070
this exactly the same way. That's not everything in your life,

1666
01:43:36.071 --> 01:43:39.580
but you can surely find some things that do that. Hmm.

1667
01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:43.890
I think it was Camden, New Jersey where they had such a crisis. That's such,

1668
01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:47.890
that was so random. No, it's not talking about surveillance. Camden,

1669
01:43:47.891 --> 01:43:52.891
New Jersey had such a crisis of funding that I think there was a brief period of

1670
01:43:53.121 --> 01:43:54.740
time, at least, I don't know if it's changed,

1671
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:58.400
where they literally didn't have a police force and one of their solutions was

1672
01:43:58.401 --> 01:44:03.401
to put surveillance cameras everywhere and the idea was to sort of try to

1673
01:44:03.621 --> 01:44:06.440
capture all the shit that was going down.

1674
01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:11.550
Here it is the surveillance city of Camden, New Jersey, a community be serious.

1675
01:44:12.650 --> 01:44:15.680
The Guy Crime and the intrusive tools they're using in hopes of stopping it.

1676
01:44:15.850 --> 01:44:17.990
Right? Yeah. This was a, I mean,

1677
01:44:17.991 --> 01:44:21.080
I don't remember reading in class after this happening. It's,

1678
01:44:21.150 --> 01:44:25.430
let me take away your freedoms for your own safety. [inaudible] yeah.

1679
01:44:25.640 --> 01:44:29.360
This is a well known, you know Benjamin Franklin wrote about it,

1680
01:44:30.060 --> 01:44:33.320
which his famous Benjamin Franklin quote about security and freedom. Yeah.

1681
01:44:33.321 --> 01:44:38.321
He knew abandons for freedom for security serves neither is getting neither or

1682
01:44:40.071 --> 01:44:43.730
something. Yeah. Yeah. So, so this is not yet.

1683
01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.830
They that can give up essential liberty to attain a little temporary safety

1684
01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:51.530
deserve. Neither liberty nor safety.

1685
01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:56.480
Those who sacrificed liberty for safety, for security deserve neither.

1686
01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:00.830
He who would trade liberty for some temporary security deserve. Neither liberty.

1687
01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:04.220
He's got all combinations. Yeah man, he covered that bitch.

1688
01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:08.420
All permutations on that one. This is so mean.

1689
01:45:08.421 --> 01:45:12.570
I don't want to leave any room for misquoting. He understood that. So you're,

1690
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:17.900
you're security. You give up some security for privacy I think.

1691
01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:18.560
Yes.

1692
01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:22.490
And I don't know if it's a well known place where that should be drawn and you

1693
01:45:22.491 --> 01:45:27.050
can actually get an entire generation born into a state where they think that's

1694
01:45:27.051 --> 01:45:29.090
normal. We all now think it's normal.

1695
01:45:29.091 --> 01:45:32.630
You have to show id to walk into an office building. Oh my gosh.

1696
01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:34.400
What would that look like during the Cold War?

1697
01:45:34.401 --> 01:45:35.750
You have to show you in the United States,

1698
01:45:35.751 --> 01:45:39.020
you have to show your papers just to walk into a building while they're also

1699
01:45:39.021 --> 01:45:43.850
changing. Oh my gosh. System where if you don't want to travel with a passport,

1700
01:45:43.851 --> 01:45:45.920
you're going to have to have a new 40 been through that.

1701
01:45:46.190 --> 01:45:49.700
A federal driver's license, federally endorsed driver's license.

1702
01:45:49.701 --> 01:45:54.050
I just went through that last week. Right. So when did that go into play?

1703
01:45:54.051 --> 01:45:57.770
When is that going? Um, it's for everybody. Like next year or something.

1704
01:45:57.800 --> 01:46:00.200
It's very soon. If you want to travel in a particular way,

1705
01:46:00.201 --> 01:46:02.600
if you don't drive or anything, then it doesn't matter. Fly. Right?

1706
01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:06.170
We want to fly. Correct. Correct. And I carry my passport wherever I go,

1707
01:46:06.171 --> 01:46:08.770
so it's not really a problem for me. But uh,

1708
01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:10.370
so carry your passport everywhere you go.

1709
01:46:10.371 --> 01:46:14.090
If you want to just jet out of the country that this spot.

1710
01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:18.920
How has your brain wired to escape?

1711
01:46:22.130 --> 01:46:25.580
Uh, no. If I had four passports then you'd say, do I want to leave the country?

1712
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:29.750
Whoever. Anybody in a, you know, espionage movie,

1713
01:46:29.751 --> 01:46:32.980
there's somebody who has five passports and with the,

1714
01:46:32.981 --> 01:46:36.320
with wads of cash of every currency. So,

1715
01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:41.440
so I think I worry that we're sliding towards a state of total monitoring on the

1716
01:46:45.771 --> 01:46:47.480
premise that we're all better off for it.

1717
01:46:48.230 --> 01:46:51.060
And it's like the frog in the heated water.

1718
01:46:51.090 --> 01:46:53.370
We don't feel it day by day,

1719
01:46:53.970 --> 01:46:58.970
but it's happening cause we all agree that we can be hand patted down just to

1720
01:46:59.281 --> 01:47:00.210
get on an airplane.

1721
01:47:00.630 --> 01:47:04.920
We've all accepted that because of a handful of people,

1722
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:08.760
a handful of historically a handful, historically handful,

1723
01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.030
not even a handful in this moment, just historically and field people.

1724
01:47:12.330 --> 01:47:16.080
We all say, yes, take my luggage, X-ray, my luggage, um,

1725
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:20.010
take away my liquids, pat me down and I'm okay with that.

1726
01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:25.780
W that's a transition and I'm okay with security cameras in the street.

1727
01:47:28.290 --> 01:47:30.570
It was okay in banks, we understood that,

1728
01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:36.000
but now when I exit the bank and I'm in the street when I'm walking and walking

1729
01:47:36.001 --> 01:47:39.450
in the park, so I don't know. I don't know the future of that.

1730
01:47:40.170 --> 01:47:40.711
I really don't know.

1731
01:47:40.711 --> 01:47:45.000
I saw the movie 1984 recently and not a very good way where the book is better

1732
01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:47.340
than the movie and I hate to be the one of the people who say that,

1733
01:47:47.700 --> 01:47:52.700
but I was reminded how you can create an entire state where everyone is kept in

1734
01:47:54.781 --> 01:47:59.370
line because somebody is telling you we are fighting this battle out on the

1735
01:47:59.371 --> 01:48:01.980
front lines. I'd forgotten this from the book,

1736
01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:05.070
that they're fighting a war on the front lines. You never see the war.

1737
01:48:05.100 --> 01:48:06.180
You never hear about the war.

1738
01:48:06.330 --> 01:48:10.740
You don't know anything about the war other than it exists and you have to do

1739
01:48:10.741 --> 01:48:15.741
things a certain way in country so that your country can protect itself from

1740
01:48:17.671 --> 01:48:21.540
these evil people that want to take over and destroy your way of life.

1741
01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:24.570
And so everybody's under control. Some big brother. Well,

1742
01:48:24.571 --> 01:48:29.571
what they didn't anticipate though was these social media companies would be

1743
01:48:30.250 --> 01:48:33.570
the, the guards are the gatekeepers of your privacy.

1744
01:48:34.170 --> 01:48:36.960
Cause that's what's interesting is because you voluntarily give them all your

1745
01:48:36.961 --> 01:48:41.030
information. It's not governments, it's Twitter and Facebook, Google,

1746
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:45.540
all the stuff that we use on a daily basis that has access to everything that

1747
01:48:45.541 --> 01:48:47.550
you do. That's almost

1748
01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:53.220
inconceivable to someone outside of this generation that there would be a

1749
01:48:53.221 --> 01:48:55.500
company that would provide a service.

1750
01:48:55.830 --> 01:48:59.880
And through that service you would give up all notions of privacy. Privacy.

1751
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.241
Yeah.

1752
01:49:00.241 --> 01:49:03.480
Because literally you have a microphone that's listening everywhere you go,

1753
01:49:03.610 --> 01:49:07.050
you have a bug there. You can route with you. I mean I don't remember what,

1754
01:49:07.220 --> 01:49:11.580
yeah, you've been, you've been pinned, bucked, right? Yeah. Pinned with a lapel.

1755
01:49:11.581 --> 01:49:15.990
You will get ads for things you talk about and that has been proven.

1756
01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:17.550
So what is that?

1757
01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:21.450
What does is these passive listening devices that only picking up key words?

1758
01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.060
It's no big deal. It's just key words. The frog in the water.

1759
01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:26.220
That's why I'm telling you. Yeah, so I don't know where it's going to go.

1760
01:49:26.250 --> 01:49:28.740
Like I said, I'm a little old folk, old fogy about that,

1761
01:49:29.010 --> 01:49:31.770
but I think we'll resolve it. Do you think there should be regulation?

1762
01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:36.150
Generally if you have something good and it gets abused, you regulate it.

1763
01:49:36.151 --> 01:49:39.660
That's the whole point of right. We're here alive today because of regulation,

1764
01:49:40.110 --> 01:49:45.110
because there are nefarious people who in control of powerful forces operating

1765
01:49:46.561 --> 01:49:51.561
on society would gain at the expense of everyone else and would not be good for

1766
01:49:52.841 --> 01:49:56.290
the progress of civilization. So you regulate, okay.

1767
01:49:56.590 --> 01:50:00.920
Airlines are regulated so that you don't die. All right.

1768
01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:06.130
W we have the safest record now ever for commercial airlines,

1769
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:09.430
American carriers, the safest ever look at,

1770
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:14.110
look at not only how many people have not died relative to when we grew up,

1771
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:16.840
we grew up there with at least one or two planes crashed each year.

1772
01:50:17.050 --> 01:50:19.060
You'd lose between one and 300 people every year.

1773
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:20.830
That was like the baseline number.

1774
01:50:21.370 --> 01:50:25.060
That number is near zero now.

1775
01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:29.830
And way more planes are taking off and landing that at any time when we were

1776
01:50:29.831 --> 01:50:32.230
kids. So it's a double,

1777
01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:35.110
it's a double um,

1778
01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:39.670
progress point for not only the transportation safety administration,

1779
01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:44.770
but uh, engineering technology and everything we care about. We want to fly.

1780
01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.910
So you regulate, you make sure these are inspected this often you don't,

1781
01:50:48.940 --> 01:50:52.930
the pilots don't fly more than this many hours. You, this gets oiled,

1782
01:50:52.931 --> 01:50:57.730
this gets replaced. Um, it's one of the triumphs of modern engineering,

1783
01:50:57.760 --> 01:50:59.830
aerodynamics, uh, um,

1784
01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:04.840
aerospace engineering as a branch of what we do as civilization is one of the

1785
01:51:04.841 --> 01:51:08.620
greatest achievements there ever was a grade. Jamie,

1786
01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:10.540
did you find that a stealth stuff?

1787
01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:15.880
I've found there are cars that have black velvet car.

1788
01:51:15.940 --> 01:51:20.110
This would be a laboratory laboratory. Oh, okay.

1789
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:25.090
Oh look up a laboratory. A

1790
01:51:27.070 --> 01:51:31.810
stealth light. Something try that.

1791
01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:33.753
Yeah. I found the lamp,

1792
01:51:33.790 --> 01:51:37.750
like a cloaks that people wear that sort of seems like video chat. Yeah. Yeah.

1793
01:51:37.751 --> 01:51:42.050
That seems like fuckery. Yeah. There's a lot of, but in Harry Potter, the, the,

1794
01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:43.030
the, the,

1795
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:47.440
what's the cloak that they were the invisibility cloak that would be this

1796
01:51:47.441 --> 01:51:52.420
principle if it existed with that. Here's a bunch of videos of that,

1797
01:51:52.421 --> 01:51:56.800
but it seems like they're just using after effects like Adobe or something like

1798
01:51:56.801 --> 01:52:00.730
that to fuck with the video rather than create an actual product that,

1799
01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:04.570
because there was a woman in an office that had a blanket and she held up the

1800
01:52:04.571 --> 01:52:07.840
blanket and you could only see the whole office,

1801
01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:11.330
you wouldn't see the blanket at all. You'd see what's behind her. Behind her.

1802
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:16.180
She lowered the blanket. You could see her and then from the blanket down,

1803
01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:19.660
just a green screen of the bad thing. But that's what it was.

1804
01:52:19.661 --> 01:52:22.630
I think she was holding up a green blankets.

1805
01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:27.610
This might be it still this dark matter. No, no, no, no, no. Sorry. Sorry. No,

1806
01:52:27.611 --> 01:52:29.680
no, no. There's nothing to do with that. That's,

1807
01:52:29.681 --> 01:52:33.790
that's the math of dark matter in the universe. The three dimensional map.

1808
01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:36.820
I've tried to give that a shot. Yes. No, we don't know what it is,

1809
01:52:36.821 --> 01:52:38.440
so don't worry about it if you don't understand that,

1810
01:52:38.441 --> 01:52:41.500
but it's too God damn confusing for me. No, it's not confusing at all.

1811
01:52:42.370 --> 01:52:44.860
It's like it's something out there that has 85% of the,

1812
01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:48.050
of the universe and we don't know what the hell. It is confusing.

1813
01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:50.990
It's not confusing. It's, it's, if you don't know what it is,

1814
01:52:50.991 --> 01:52:55.280
it's confusing by nature. Okay. I have more nuanced definition of confusing.

1815
01:52:55.970 --> 01:52:59.990
Confusing is I am confused. I don't know how to think.

1816
01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.510
Dark matter is, I don't even know what to think.

1817
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:08.720
I need something in my head to be confused. Right. Dark matter has. There's no,

1818
01:53:08.750 --> 01:53:09.171
we don't know.

1819
01:53:09.171 --> 01:53:13.040
What the hell do you anticipate a solution to that or some sort of, sure.

1820
01:53:13.041 --> 01:53:16.850
I want my eyes in Hawaii. I hope that damned might've been, yeah,

1821
01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:20.370
telescope might've been. Yeah. Listen folks, it's not the GDT.

1822
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:24.790
There'll be the goddamn toast. It's the TMT 30 meter telescope. So yeah,

1823
01:53:24.791 --> 01:53:26.900
solutions too. We, you don't know. Part of the,

1824
01:53:27.170 --> 01:53:32.170
what it is to explore is not knowing what it is that you will find and all these

1825
01:53:33.321 --> 01:53:36.650
telescopes, the launched ones as well as the ground based ones.

1826
01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:38.180
We have an a foresight,

1827
01:53:38.210 --> 01:53:42.770
we're mature enough as a field to know that even though it's designed to look

1828
01:53:42.771 --> 01:53:45.980
for certain things that were part of the program that you set up for it,

1829
01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:50.930
you want to have a serendipity mode for it. You want to be able to say,

1830
01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:54.380
let's point it in some random direction and see what shows up.

1831
01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:57.980
Without that you could miss something in plain sight.

1832
01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:02.330
If you're only looking for one thing that you think is there extrapolated from

1833
01:54:02.331 --> 01:54:05.400
what you knew before. And the way I think of it is, you know the,

1834
01:54:05.401 --> 01:54:09.140
there's the old saying as the area of our knowledge grows,

1835
01:54:10.130 --> 01:54:13.040
so too does the perimeter of our ignorance.

1836
01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:19.900
So as that area goes there more places to look over the fence and stare into the

1837
01:54:21.111 --> 01:54:24.110
abyss of ignorance that awaits you.

1838
01:54:25.370 --> 01:54:26.203
So

1839
01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:31.280
dark matter is sitting on the other side of the fence that the way I've heard it

1840
01:54:31.281 --> 01:54:35.330
described as the bonfire of our knowledge grows brighter.

1841
01:54:35.360 --> 01:54:38.000
The area of our ignorance is illuminated.

1842
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:45.690
Okay. That I had to think about that. Yeah. Now it's similar to what I said.

1843
01:54:45.691 --> 01:54:49.000
I'm more things are eliminated to bonfire is your knowledge.

1844
01:54:49.300 --> 01:54:53.470
That's lighting the way as it grows bigger, you go see more stuff you've never,

1845
01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:57.430
you've never noticed before. It's the same principle. That's a giant one though,

1846
01:54:57.431 --> 01:55:00.490
man. 85% it's 85% of gravity. So yeah,

1847
01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:05.290
and you add that to the dark energy. We don't know what that is either. Right?

1848
01:55:05.670 --> 01:55:06.850
Dark matter,

1849
01:55:06.851 --> 01:55:11.851
dark energy comprise 95% of everything that's driving the universe.

1850
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:17.950
So everything we know and love the chemistry, the physics, the biology, life,

1851
01:55:17.980 --> 01:55:22.780
planets, stars is 5% of the universe now.

1852
01:55:22.900 --> 01:55:24.970
So people sort of theologians and folks say, well,

1853
01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.870
maybe God is in the other 95% maybe. Okay. But yeah,

1854
01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:32.590
made God's dark matter. Wouldn't it be crazy? Well, people say that. Surprise.

1855
01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:33.433
Yeah.

1856
01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:38.530
But I don't know why dark matter would care about gay people, whether

1857
01:55:40.210 --> 01:55:42.990
or not checks drive cars. Yeah. Yeah.

1858
01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:44.860
Depending on which religion you're in right now,

1859
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:49.630
all the religions got their thing wearing God. She know him. God, I'm on,

1860
01:55:50.250 --> 01:55:55.210
I'm dark matter. Yeah. Um, we, by the way,

1861
01:55:55.260 --> 01:56:00.120
it just, it, um, in, in letters from an astrophysics physicist,

1862
01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:03.660
uh, which isn't out yet, but again, I don't know how the hell you got the book,

1863
01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:05.600
but it's, um, there's, I,

1864
01:56:05.650 --> 01:56:10.650
there's an entire chapter where I am conversing with people who are strongly

1865
01:56:11.131 --> 01:56:13.810
religious. There's a conversation I have in there with a,

1866
01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:17.880
an orthodox Jewish person, a Muslim, multiple, um,

1867
01:56:18.630 --> 01:56:19.111
fundamentalist Christians.

1868
01:56:19.111 --> 01:56:22.500
And we're talking about the age of the earth and why and why do we think one way

1869
01:56:22.501 --> 01:56:24.870
or another. And so that's,

1870
01:56:24.900 --> 01:56:28.410
there's a lot of intimate stuff in there that I generally don't go public with,

1871
01:56:28.740 --> 01:56:32.700
but I did it one on one with those who had written to me about these challenges

1872
01:56:32.701 --> 01:56:35.820
they were facing in life and they wanted to know what an astrophysicist had to

1873
01:56:35.821 --> 01:56:36.600
say about it.

1874
01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:41.600
What's the youngest version of how old a religious person thinks the earth is?

1875
01:56:42.631 --> 01:56:46.930
What's the, how? What's the 6,000 years? That's the question. Yes, Christian.

1876
01:56:47.310 --> 01:56:51.500
Well, oh, of all. Uh, not all Christians by the way. No, no.

1877
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:56.040
Of all religions. I don't know. The age is like a month old.

1878
01:56:56.690 --> 01:57:01.590
I D I don't know enough about how old all the religions think the universe is

1879
01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:02.940
the youngest.

1880
01:57:02.941 --> 01:57:06.860
You're going to get the youngest university and you get from a devout Christian

1881
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:07.703
6,000 years.

1882
01:57:08.190 --> 01:57:12.390
The oldest is around 10,000 and but as far and away from billions,

1883
01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:15.540
Mormons are a unique one because they think you get your own planet when you

1884
01:57:15.541 --> 01:57:20.280
die. Yeah. And what's, what's funny horn on that?

1885
01:57:21.930 --> 01:57:25.400
I want my own planet. Nobody told me that. Uh, I,

1886
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:28.410
it's odd how one religious group would,

1887
01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:34.800
would comment on how preposterous another religious groups comments are.

1888
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:37.980
I love that. You know, I was once, I don't know if you know this,

1889
01:57:37.981 --> 01:57:39.750
I was once quoted after,

1890
01:57:39.751 --> 01:57:44.010
I think the Scientology documentary came out on HBO and everybody was talking

1891
01:57:44.011 --> 01:57:45.810
about at least I think that was it.

1892
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:50.990
And there was a lot of chat about it for a couple of weeks and one of the news

1893
01:57:51.061 --> 01:57:55.500
outlets, I forgot who called me up and said,

1894
01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:59.820
do I think Scientology should be a religion

1895
01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:06.210
classified as a religion, as an authentic religion? And you can ask, well,

1896
01:58:06.211 --> 01:58:08.310
why are they calling me? Why? Well,

1897
01:58:08.311 --> 01:58:13.311
because in Scientology there aliens and if there's space beatings that comes to

1898
01:58:14.341 --> 01:58:17.700
give up this information. Oh, sorry. I know.

1899
01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:23.360
So that's how I got brought into this conversation because of the sectors of

1900
01:58:25.111 --> 01:58:29.100
Scientology that involves space beings. Okay. All right.

1901
01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:35.360
So my answer was we live in a country that protects the free expression of faith

1902
01:58:38.461 --> 01:58:43.461
based systems provided they don't subtract from the rights of others.

1903
01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:49.680
So I will not sit here and judge whether they tens from space exude souls from

1904
01:58:55.721 --> 01:58:59.470
volcanoes, at least a third of what I just said is accurate.

1905
01:58:59.950 --> 01:59:01.630
It's from from Scientology

1906
01:59:03.190 --> 01:59:08.190
or whether a man born of a woman is the son of God who died and rose from the

1907
01:59:11.381 --> 01:59:12.214
dead.

1908
01:59:12.430 --> 01:59:17.020
I'm not going to compare those and judge whether one of them is more authentic

1909
01:59:17.021 --> 01:59:20.590
than another when they're both founded on belief systems.

1910
01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.410
And so in this country,

1911
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:27.340
belief systems are protected and we've all bought into that.

1912
01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:32.320
And so you know what the headline was? Tyson defense,

1913
01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:39.070
I'll tell you, that was the clickbait of my comment there.

1914
01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:41.010
You got to distort there.

1915
01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.560
There are some rational people who in the comment thread said,

1916
01:59:44.770 --> 01:59:47.260
that's not what he said. Of course. Yeah.

1917
01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:49.210
But isn't it more interesting when they do do that?

1918
01:59:49.211 --> 01:59:51.400
And then inside the actual article itself,

1919
01:59:51.401 --> 01:59:53.980
they give you full quote so people can see the deception,

1920
01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:58.830
the real confusing things when they take a chunk of your quote out of context.

1921
01:59:58.940 --> 02:00:01.240
Yeah, take it out of context with they love to do so. You know what,

1922
02:00:01.241 --> 02:00:05.200
I just go to jail for that, by the way. So That's interesting. So for me, I,

1923
02:00:05.290 --> 02:00:08.020
I'm an observer of that, not a complainer about it.

1924
02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.060
So is that how they're doing it? Okay.

1925
02:00:10.061 --> 02:00:13.900
So maybe I can shape this phrase differently to minimize the chance of that

1926
02:00:13.901 --> 02:00:17.980
happening in the future. You being lied about. Correct.

1927
02:00:17.981 --> 02:00:21.310
So for me that is a landscape. There's some landmines here.

1928
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:25.390
There is some trap doors here. There is some things. And so for me,

1929
02:00:26.230 --> 02:00:28.510
one who communicates on that landscape,

1930
02:00:28.990 --> 02:00:33.990
that's just information for me to navigate it slightly more nimbly in the

1931
02:00:35.741 --> 02:00:40.720
future. Got It. Interesting. Gravity.

1932
02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:42.940
This is one thing that I was still hooked. Hookup on gravity.

1933
02:00:43.450 --> 02:00:47.710
I'm always hooked up on gravity. Um, cause uh, as you should be.

1934
02:00:47.920 --> 02:00:49.660
Well since we've talked last,

1935
02:00:49.661 --> 02:00:52.630
I've been reading a lot about it and one of the things that confuses me the most

1936
02:00:52.631 --> 02:00:55.960
is that we don't really understand what gravity is,

1937
02:00:56.310 --> 02:01:01.090
but we know it's effects. We can measure them, we know how to measure them,

1938
02:01:01.091 --> 02:01:04.420
we know what that mass is involved,

1939
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:07.360
but we don't really know what gravity is.

1940
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:08.860
There's a similar question in the book,

1941
02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:11.710
but they got a little more philosophical than you just did.

1942
02:01:12.340 --> 02:01:14.020
But they both lean philosophical.

1943
02:01:14.021 --> 02:01:17.950
It's science can describe how gravity works,

1944
02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:23.440
but can they describe why it works 10 weeks. So this is the how,

1945
02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:28.840
why duality here and allow me to just answer it from a how,

1946
02:01:29.110 --> 02:01:33.550
why point of view. And then we can apply it to gravity after I say that. Um,

1947
02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:34.810
in science,

1948
02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:38.410
if we can describe how something works and predict its future behavior,

1949
02:01:38.770 --> 02:01:43.520
we claim to understand it and we move on. You can ask deeper questions about it.

1950
02:01:43.521 --> 02:01:46.580
Why is there gravity and what is the meaning? What is the purpose?

1951
02:01:47.210 --> 02:01:48.770
And Go ahead.

1952
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:53.830
But I'm good with what I've done and I can land a spacecraft on Mars inside of a

1953
02:01:54.351 --> 02:01:58.160
crater, in a hole in one using my understanding of gravity.

1954
02:01:58.161 --> 02:01:59.870
So I'm pretty good with it. Okay,

1955
02:02:01.250 --> 02:02:05.510
so I'm not distracted by the more philosophical side of that.

1956
02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:10.640
Why does it work? Okay. Einstein is though,

1957
02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:15.050
so Newton was deeply puzzled by how you can have something called [inaudible] in

1958
02:02:15.190 --> 02:02:17.990
which he coined the phrase action at a distance. Okay?

1959
02:02:18.650 --> 02:02:23.390
He wrote down the equation that worked. He wants any equation.

1960
02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:25.400
The moon goes around the earth, earth grows on the sun.

1961
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:29.150
The moons of Jupiter Go-round Jupiter, he

1962
02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:34.410
accurately described that with his equations of gravity. Okay?

1963
02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:36.990
He said one day,

1964
02:02:37.050 --> 02:02:39.630
I think we're going to find some way that they're connecting to each other,

1965
02:02:39.631 --> 02:02:42.570
but I don't know what that is right now, but I know my equations work.

1966
02:02:43.770 --> 02:02:46.380
He called it spooky. It was spooky to him. That's his word.

1967
02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:49.050
Spooky action at a distance. All right.

1968
02:02:50.010 --> 02:02:52.110
Fast forward 300 years.

1969
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:58.530
300 no. Fast forward 250, 230 years. Get to Albert Einstein.

1970
02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:04.970
Um, gravity is the curvature of space and time

1971
02:03:06.940 --> 02:03:11.050
and you're moving on the curvature of that fabric. That's gravity.

1972
02:03:11.890 --> 02:03:13.600
Oh my gosh. Is it even a fortune then?

1973
02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:17.860
Is it even so there's no need to think of it as an action at a distance.

1974
02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:23.950
And in a phrase, first uttered by, I think it was John Archibald Wheeler,

1975
02:03:23.951 --> 02:03:26.770
a student of Einstein, and he,

1976
02:03:26.860 --> 02:03:30.400
I learned relativity from John or showboat wheel effect.

1977
02:03:30.401 --> 02:03:34.760
That's where I met my wife in relativity class in graduate school. Um,

1978
02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:41.080
it's space matter.

1979
02:03:41.410 --> 02:03:45.220
Tell space how to curve space tells matter how to move.

1980
02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:51.750
It moves on the curvature of space. You don't need an action at a distance.

1981
02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:55.710
There was no action. It, no it can't do anything else but do that.

1982
02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:01.230
It's like you have a funnel and you take a ball and you're rolling on the

1983
02:04:01.231 --> 02:04:02.064
funnel.

1984
02:04:02.730 --> 02:04:07.730
The ball can only do what that funnel tells it to do and it'll Cirque,

1985
02:04:08.010 --> 02:04:11.280
if you give it a sideways motion, it'll start spinning around.

1986
02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:13.890
There is no magic hand coming in there.

1987
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:19.230
It is following the curvature of it's space, time, continuum,

1988
02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:22.770
this construct that you provided for it.

1989
02:04:23.550 --> 02:04:27.840
So now I can describe what gravity is doing.

1990
02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:29.640
I even have a mechanism for it.

1991
02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:34.070
Are you going to still ask me why is there gravity?

1992
02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:39.750
Is that answered not enough to you? Even in the y department

1993
02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:44.490
you can say, well why would a particle curves space?

1994
02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:47.370
You can just keep doing that. That's fine,

1995
02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:53.190
but is there a point where we where you'll be satisfied with the answer? Oh,

1996
02:04:53.191 --> 02:04:57.140
that answers my why. I can say,

1997
02:04:57.141 --> 02:05:02.141
well why did this half liter of water drop off the edge here?

1998
02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:06.230
Well, it's no longer, the forces are imbalanced and it's a no,

1999
02:05:06.250 --> 02:05:09.440
but why did it fall? Well, there's nothing holding it up. Why did it?

2000
02:05:10.850 --> 02:05:15.170
There's a point where it's not especially productive to continue to think about

2001
02:05:15.171 --> 02:05:18.810
the world that way because I what I'm,

2002
02:05:18.840 --> 02:05:22.080
what I'm claiming is answers to the how.

2003
02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:23.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2004
02:05:23.630 --> 02:05:25.490
<v 1>When you understand the, how enough</v>

2005
02:05:27.290 --> 02:05:32.150
are tantamount to having answered the why question. That's all.

2006
02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:35.420
That's what I'm telling them out in terms of the ability to measure it and

2007
02:05:35.421 --> 02:05:39.400
accurately use it. Correct. So we can say, okay, but isn't it,

2008
02:05:39.580 --> 02:05:43.940
you've got a board. Yes. We can say, well why did you go bald? Well, okay,

2009
02:05:43.941 --> 02:05:47.390
the hair follicles ad when you start in your late twenties and early,

2010
02:05:47.391 --> 02:05:49.070
what'd you go bald? When did you start losing your hair?

2011
02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:51.950
Probably late twenties early thirties yeah. That's common.

2012
02:05:52.280 --> 02:05:55.880
If you have your hair when you're 30 you'll probably have it for the rest of

2013
02:05:55.881 --> 02:05:59.030
your life. That's the how that goes. You start losing it up, right?

2014
02:05:59.031 --> 02:06:01.340
Going up until you're 30 so you can say,

2015
02:06:01.341 --> 02:06:03.800
well the hair follicle begins does not producing the dead,

2016
02:06:03.801 --> 02:06:06.950
the Keratin or whatever. We get the explanation. Then you say,

2017
02:06:06.951 --> 02:06:10.760
well why does the hair follicles stop doing that? Then you say,

2018
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:15.320
oh well because the DNA has a pre coded about the hair.

2019
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:18.890
Kind of say well why does the DNA have the hair?

2020
02:06:19.010 --> 02:06:20.950
Well because so right,

2021
02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:25.960
but we know far more about how and why people go bald than we do about what

2022
02:06:26.691 --> 02:06:28.310
gravity really is. Correct.

2023
02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:32.510
I'm telling you gravity really is the curvature of space and time

2024
02:06:35.170 --> 02:06:39.400
that gets us the Big Bang and everything we've ever known and just space and

2025
02:06:39.401 --> 02:06:41.140
time. But it's also based on mass, right?

2026
02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:45.850
It's based on the amount of any concentration of matter and energy and or energy

2027
02:06:45.851 --> 02:06:47.650
will curve the fabric of space and time.

2028
02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:52.920
And the more the movement of matter on that fabric of space and time we call

2029
02:06:54.671 --> 02:06:58.840
gravity. And I'm good with that.

2030
02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:03.100
Okay. But you seem a little oddly defensive about something that's scientific.

2031
02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:06.210
No, I have to say I'm good with that. But you, you,

2032
02:07:06.211 --> 02:07:10.270
you are cause you kinda defending it. No, you can say, well why does matter?

2033
02:07:10.290 --> 02:07:13.680
You need to know why. Why does say no?

2034
02:07:13.690 --> 02:07:18.690
I'm saying why does matter and energy curve the fabric of space and time.

2035
02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:23.290
You can ask that. Okay. Why? And I don't have an answer. If I can say,

2036
02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:26.950
well that's all I'm asking. Well, no one watches. What I'm telling you is okay,

2037
02:07:26.951 --> 02:07:29.500
you don't need to know what got you to the point, right?

2038
02:07:29.890 --> 02:07:34.890
We had to walk to that point where your y got unanswered.

2039
02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:38.980
I understand that, but before we got to that point, I answered otherwise,

2040
02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:40.810
but I'm not disputing that. Good. Good.

2041
02:07:40.930 --> 02:07:45.760
So what I'm telling you is that I can answer your why question most of the time,

2042
02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:51.130
but then you'll come back to a point where there's a point where there's the why

2043
02:07:51.131 --> 02:07:54.040
doesn't have the answer. So you say, why did it fall?

2044
02:07:54.041 --> 02:07:57.040
I say there's a force of gravity operating on it. Why did it fall that way?

2045
02:07:57.041 --> 02:08:00.010
Because of the curvature of space and time. I'm answering your whys.

2046
02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:04.630
I understand. Then why does matter and energy, Kurt? Space and time.

2047
02:08:05.230 --> 02:08:08.800
Okay, that's a frontier. We're still working on that, but that's all I'm asking.

2048
02:08:08.830 --> 02:08:11.800
That's good. That's fine. You are a man of science.

2049
02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:16.860
So you are a person that should probably embrace wise except that many people

2050
02:08:16.961 --> 02:08:19.630
who ask why questions, they really want to know.

2051
02:08:19.631 --> 02:08:22.200
Purpose of not asking purpose.

2052
02:08:22.270 --> 02:08:25.990
Well then that distinguishes you from many other people who ask why questions.

2053
02:08:26.050 --> 02:08:28.180
Oh, okay. I don't think, I don't know if this is get up.

2054
02:08:28.630 --> 02:08:31.120
Why did you bang the table? I was angry. There's purpose,

2055
02:08:31.150 --> 02:08:34.360
there's a purpose behind it. So, so yeah,

2056
02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:38.500
if your why is just a curiosity of what's going on,

2057
02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:42.100
that's one thing. If you are inquiring about purpose,

2058
02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:46.270
then it gets theological. Okay. Because when you're theological,

2059
02:08:47.250 --> 02:08:50.180
then religions give purpose to life. Really. I'm not doing that right.

2060
02:08:50.410 --> 02:08:55.410
But I just think it's amazing that something that is such a massive part of life

2061
02:08:56.260 --> 02:09:00.640
on this planet that we stayed glued to the ground because of gravity.

2062
02:09:00.670 --> 02:09:02.110
Can you pull up my Instagram account?

2063
02:09:02.890 --> 02:09:06.700
I only post you have an Instagram account now cause you had a fake one for

2064
02:09:06.890 --> 02:09:09.610
awhile. Yeah, I took it over and actually I know that guy. I took it over.

2065
02:09:09.611 --> 02:09:13.120
He gave it to you. Oh, do you? The Guy who had it? Yeah. No, no, no. Actually,

2066
02:09:13.121 --> 02:09:14.860
I sorry, I went to Instagram,

2067
02:09:15.090 --> 02:09:18.040
said people think this is a real account and it's not, can I have it back?

2068
02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:23.140
And if it's an account that's an impostor and followers don't know it,

2069
02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:27.010
it's illegal. So, uh, so there's,

2070
02:09:27.040 --> 02:09:31.170
there's one that says fan of Neil Tyson and that's a different one. Okay. Okay.

2071
02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:34.930
So I only post art house photos, okay. That I've taken most of which I've taken.

2072
02:09:35.170 --> 02:09:39.490
So just scroll down and look for muscle beach. There it is. Click on that.

2073
02:09:40.150 --> 02:09:43.310
Okay, so here's my cap. Go to my caption, go full screen on that.

2074
02:09:43.370 --> 02:09:46.480
And then my captain. Okay. For most of our life on earth,

2075
02:09:46.750 --> 02:09:51.750
we either resist or succumb to the force of gravity at Muscle beach.

2076
02:09:52.690 --> 02:09:57.400
Gravity loses every time. That's not true.

2077
02:10:00.010 --> 02:10:03.280
I was proud of that caption. You Go, you call me out on that caption.

2078
02:10:03.281 --> 02:10:06.700
That's nonsense. Gravity never lose this.

2079
02:10:07.330 --> 02:10:09.940
Gravity doesn't even have like little tiny losses.

2080
02:10:10.600 --> 02:10:12.840
It's not like this is a war and gravity loses a battle.

2081
02:10:12.841 --> 02:10:15.070
I was just listening to this. So I was at, I was in Venice,

2082
02:10:15.071 --> 02:10:18.220
California and the sun was setting behind some guy who was doing,

2083
02:10:18.490 --> 02:10:23.490
who was doing a hand pressed hand presses suspended up on this chin up bar.

2084
02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:29.740
Right. And it was real. So it was cool. He was silhouetted. There's a palm tree,

2085
02:10:29.800 --> 02:10:33.070
there's the beach. He's there. He's going to beat that motherfucker.

2086
02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:36.620
Let me tell you eventually. But while he is, while he is there,

2087
02:10:37.130 --> 02:10:39.980
he's conquering gravity. Are you getting too old?

2088
02:10:39.981 --> 02:10:42.920
You haven't called your gravity lately? No, I work out all the time.

2089
02:10:42.921 --> 02:10:47.840
I'm not buying it. No, I ain't conquered shit. He's pulling rank now.

2090
02:10:47.930 --> 02:10:51.920
He said I work out and you don't cause I see your middle age man. Belly.

2091
02:10:55.130 --> 02:11:00.010
Um, well when I've talked to other astrophysicists and signs, let me ask,

2092
02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:04.910
are these conversations supposed to have like a theme or purpose or is it just

2093
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:08.230
you sit there and just whatever comes to your head, you send my way? Yeah.

2094
02:11:08.420 --> 02:11:10.520
Well clearly it's just whatever comes to mind.

2095
02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:15.290
How do you say this episode is about, you can't say that. I don't ever do that.

2096
02:11:15.380 --> 02:11:18.650
You don't do that. Okay, fine. That's just episode number two. My success.

2097
02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:23.480
I've got no obligation, no commitments. The fucking I ever have a thread.

2098
02:11:23.660 --> 02:11:25.760
Think about all the different people that of course, yeah, of course.

2099
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.781
It's like impossible.

2100
02:11:26.781 --> 02:11:31.340
Of course fighters and scientists and scholars and crackpots

2101
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:36.110
bunch of different people coming through here. Man, I can't have any agenda.

2102
02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:40.340
I mean that's probably the only reason why this thing is successful as it is,

2103
02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:46.310
but that's a weird one for people that this one thing that is so powerful.

2104
02:11:46.500 --> 02:11:50.090
What is, oh gravity. That's a weird one for people. Yeah.

2105
02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:53.330
I mean it seems like you're frustrated by all the various questions,

2106
02:11:53.860 --> 02:11:56.480
so it's like, no, you seem a little, a little defensive there.

2107
02:11:57.130 --> 02:11:59.900
Cause I thought that I thought you were taking your why to ultimately mean

2108
02:12:00.520 --> 02:12:01.940
purpose. If it's just why I'm,

2109
02:12:02.030 --> 02:12:07.030
I'm claiming that many responses to how are also responses to a why that that's,

2110
02:12:10.730 --> 02:12:14.690
that's the point I'm making and I don't like splitting definitions.

2111
02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:17.450
People ultimately understand gravity. I think we do.

2112
02:12:17.480 --> 02:12:20.240
That's why we can land things on Mars. We understand what we do,

2113
02:12:20.241 --> 02:12:25.241
which is why your cell phone gets time from GPS satellites.

2114
02:12:25.730 --> 02:12:29.720
That is pre corrected for Einstein's general theory of relativity because

2115
02:12:29.870 --> 02:12:33.290
they're at a different gravitational field than you in orbit than you are on

2116
02:12:33.291 --> 02:12:36.620
earth surface. We got this,

2117
02:12:39.800 --> 02:12:43.070
we guide Stein is triumphing. We're running short on time here.

2118
02:12:43.070 --> 02:12:47.720
So I sent you something that I wanted to ask you, which sent you a, an email.

2119
02:12:47.721 --> 02:12:51.800
Did you get that email? I did. I did a black hole that landed in a, in a,

2120
02:12:51.801 --> 02:12:55.850
in a mysterious place in our understandings. Yeah. So let me,

2121
02:12:55.880 --> 02:12:58.550
let me just give the, I'll give the, the,

2122
02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:01.970
the sort of Reader's digest version of this. Okay. Okay.

2123
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:06.710
There are black holes that are t Jamie.

2124
02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:11.980
They're black holes that are formed at the consequence of the death of stars.

2125
02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:14.780
Okay? Okay.

2126
02:13:15.350 --> 02:13:19.190
And we think we understand the formation of stars well enough to say with stars

2127
02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:23.810
born with this much mass and it'll lose certain amount of mass over its life.

2128
02:13:23.811 --> 02:13:27.650
All stars lose mass because there's so much pressure and so much energy coming

2129
02:13:27.651 --> 02:13:30.890
out of carries particles with it. So they they lose mass.

2130
02:13:31.170 --> 02:13:34.830
The son is losing mass as we speak. It's called the solar wind.

2131
02:13:35.070 --> 02:13:37.680
So everybody loses mass out there. The question is,

2132
02:13:37.681 --> 02:13:39.210
at what rate are you losing mass?

2133
02:13:39.211 --> 02:13:42.420
Is it a lot compared to your total mass is it's small.

2134
02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:47.850
So very high mass stars are not especially stable objects.

2135
02:13:48.580 --> 02:13:53.580
They remained stars for 100,000 at most a million years and they'll explode and

2136
02:13:54.901 --> 02:13:57.840
become a supernova if your more massive than that,

2137
02:13:57.870 --> 02:14:02.460
they will not explode because the gravity is so strong that it cannot explode

2138
02:14:02.461 --> 02:14:05.460
against the strength of the gravity and it collapses into a black hole.

2139
02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:11.180
So we expect black holes to have slightly less mass,

2140
02:14:11.551 --> 02:14:16.260
somewhat less mass than the most massive stars that we know how to make.

2141
02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:21.060
So if you have a hundreds times the mass of the Sun Star,

2142
02:14:21.850 --> 02:14:23.400
it'll lose half of its mass over its life.

2143
02:14:23.401 --> 02:14:27.950
And you have a black hole that's 30 times the mass of the center.

2144
02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:32.140
50 Times the Matheson fine put a pin in that it,

2145
02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:35.160
the centers of galaxies, there are super massive black holes,

2146
02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:40.320
hundreds of thousands, millions times the mass of the sun.

2147
02:14:41.610 --> 02:14:43.650
And we call, they're super massive and they're black holes.

2148
02:14:43.651 --> 02:14:45.210
We call them supermassive black holes.

2149
02:14:45.570 --> 02:14:50.010
Cause that's how we roll as astrophysicists. Alright, well,

2150
02:14:50.011 --> 02:14:53.400
could you have black holes somewhere in the middle of these two extremes?

2151
02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:59.420
We do not know a phenomenon that will give you a black hole that's in between,

2152
02:15:02.730 --> 02:15:05.790
that will birth a black hole that's in between these two,

2153
02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:08.100
these two categories.

2154
02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:12.720
You can make a black hole that eats its way there fine.

2155
02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:17.550
But we don't know how to make one. And we think we,

2156
02:15:17.580 --> 02:15:22.260
my colleagues who've done this think they've discovered a black hole that is

2157
02:15:22.261 --> 02:15:27.261
sitting in this sort of netherworld where there's no evidence that at eight to

2158
02:15:27.781 --> 02:15:32.781
become that massive and we don't know how to explain it by the formation and

2159
02:15:33.001 --> 02:15:36.990
death of stars and is nowhere near the supermassive black hole in the center of

2160
02:15:36.991 --> 02:15:40.830
the galaxy. So it's the frontier of research at this moment.

2161
02:15:41.490 --> 02:15:46.490
So it's just a newly discovered type of black hole in a mash regime that they

2162
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:51.240
say physically impossible. You know, headlines. We're weeding the headline out,

2163
02:15:51.241 --> 02:15:55.980
black hole shock. The, show me the, the, uh, where this appears,

2164
02:15:56.780 --> 02:16:00.210
uh, or express. So this, this a British, uh, I think they're British.

2165
02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:03.000
There's anyhow, uh, it's a news digest for science.

2166
02:16:03.150 --> 02:16:07.650
So black hole shock theory swirl around the discovery of a physically impossible

2167
02:16:07.651 --> 02:16:08.484
black hole.

2168
02:16:08.490 --> 02:16:13.490
So scientists don't use the word impossible unless it's violating a known law of

2169
02:16:13.711 --> 02:16:15.330
physics. Um,

2170
02:16:15.360 --> 02:16:20.360
so I th I bet that was a editor editors title and I don't have a problem.

2171
02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:22.740
I don't mind a little bit of sensationalism there.

2172
02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:26.490
You can say it is a black hole that comes from an,

2173
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:28.350
if it comes from an object,

2174
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:30.910
it is an object we know nothing about and have yet to discover.

2175
02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:33.730
We're not gonna say it's an impossible on j [inaudible].

2176
02:16:34.060 --> 02:16:36.190
Every time we point the telescope to the universe,

2177
02:16:36.191 --> 02:16:39.490
we find something that we'd never predicted or understood.

2178
02:16:39.700 --> 02:16:42.250
And it adds to the knowledge base of where do you have,

2179
02:16:42.251 --> 02:16:43.720
whenever they do discover things,

2180
02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:48.780
and then that becomes what we know and understand like the supermassive black

2181
02:16:48.881 --> 02:16:50.740
holes at the center of every galaxy.

2182
02:16:50.741 --> 02:16:53.530
That was a fairly recent discovery in terms of,

2183
02:16:53.531 --> 02:16:57.250
it was hypothesized because we saw the centers of guys who were behaving really

2184
02:16:57.251 --> 02:17:01.150
weirdly things stars are moving faster than they should've given how much

2185
02:17:01.151 --> 02:17:05.050
gravity was tugging on them. And we said, dude,

2186
02:17:05.051 --> 02:17:08.950
something's got to be there and it's gotta be really small because we're

2187
02:17:08.951 --> 02:17:12.340
tracking stars really close to the middle. Well,

2188
02:17:12.620 --> 02:17:15.460
if it was made of ordinary matter, how big it would have to have to be really,

2189
02:17:15.461 --> 02:17:18.820
really big. So this has to be really, really small in order for this to happen.

2190
02:17:19.030 --> 02:17:21.520
The only thing we know that could fill that small volume and have that much

2191
02:17:21.521 --> 02:17:24.910
gravity is a black hole. So it was suspected for a long time.

2192
02:17:25.030 --> 02:17:30.010
It was confirmed that as a common thing by the Hubble telescope and first

2193
02:17:30.011 --> 02:17:35.011
photographed by this recent result in the galaxy m 87 MSCI 87 is what is,

2194
02:17:36.610 --> 02:17:37.443
that's the name of the galaxy.

2195
02:17:37.490 --> 02:17:42.190
You can determine how big the black hole is based on the size of the galaxy.

2196
02:17:42.191 --> 02:17:45.760
We can determine the mass of the black hole by how fast stars are moving at the

2197
02:17:45.761 --> 02:17:49.000
distance they are from it. So in other words, so,

2198
02:17:49.150 --> 02:17:52.900
so were earth orbiting the sun and we have a certain speed we're going about,

2199
02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:58.090
I forgot how to what? Uh, 18 miles per second.

2200
02:17:58.440 --> 02:18:01.900
I think that's the number. 30 kilometers a second. And that's our speed around.

2201
02:18:02.500 --> 02:18:06.400
That's a speed around the sun. That's pretty fast. Okay. Um,

2202
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:11.440
if the sun had more mass instantly,

2203
02:18:12.310 --> 02:18:14.530
that speed is not enough to maintain our orbit.

2204
02:18:14.800 --> 02:18:19.660
It will start spiraling in towards it. If the sun had less mass,

2205
02:18:20.110 --> 02:18:24.700
that speed is too high to be in this orbit,

2206
02:18:25.810 --> 02:18:29.200
it'll take it to there. Sorry. It's too fast to maintain this orbit.

2207
02:18:29.320 --> 02:18:32.770
It'll climb us out to a higher orbit, slowest down,

2208
02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:37.030
and we'll be in a higher orbit with a slower speed. So in other words,

2209
02:18:37.031 --> 02:18:40.270
for any object at any distance,

2210
02:18:40.271 --> 02:18:44.020
there's only one speed you can maintain and have a stable orbit around it.

2211
02:18:44.350 --> 02:18:47.830
So when we see stars orbiting something in the center of the galaxy,

2212
02:18:48.190 --> 02:18:53.190
it is a straightforward astro one oh two equation to calculate how much mass the

2213
02:18:54.461 --> 02:18:58.360
thing is orbiting and you get the mass and you can't see it. It's small,

2214
02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:03.220
it's a black hole. And that ladies and gentlemen is the end of the podcast.

2215
02:19:04.540 --> 02:19:09.190
This buck will be available when it comes out in October, first week of October.

2216
02:19:09.310 --> 02:19:13.480
I'm very proud of this book. It's my most heartfelt thing that I've ever done.

2217
02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:14.471
Well when it comes out,

2218
02:19:14.471 --> 02:19:17.970
I will take a photograph and put it up on the Instagram and the Twitter and

2219
02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:20.650
everybody know. Yeah. And it's, it's a, um,

2220
02:19:21.220 --> 02:19:24.130
it also has letters from people in prison.

2221
02:19:24.550 --> 02:19:28.010
The person who had just learned that they were had terminal cancer.

2222
02:19:28.011 --> 02:19:31.460
I mean there's a lot of people reaching out, responding to letters. Yes.

2223
02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:34.100
It's me responding and their letters, I can't fit all of their letters.

2224
02:19:34.101 --> 02:19:36.600
Some are very long tomes, but most of the,

2225
02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:40.200
their letters in there and all of my correspondence is in there. So it's,

2226
02:19:40.220 --> 02:19:43.430
it's my most heartfelt contribution to this universe.

2227
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:48.230
And Star talk is still a pilot. Still going, still go. It's Dar talk.

2228
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:52.430
We'd pump it up. 50 episodes and a television show. Oh yes.

2229
02:19:52.431 --> 02:19:55.900
So we can see if we're going to have a new season. We don't know yet. Uh,

2230
02:19:55.970 --> 02:19:58.120
that's to be announced. But we're going through,

2231
02:19:58.130 --> 02:20:00.950
it's always a podcast and we've got a youtube channel,

2232
02:20:01.580 --> 02:20:02.450
start talk youtube channel.

2233
02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:06.530
And we're thinking of branching out into other kinds of, uh,

2234
02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:10.850
of educational product that's still fun and comedic and the like. And I,

2235
02:20:10.851 --> 02:20:13.670
and I love your support for this, cause you're, you're also a comedian,

2236
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:15.050
so you know the value.

2237
02:20:15.080 --> 02:20:18.830
And I love comedians that have their fundamental part of how we deliver science

2238
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:22.580
to the public on star talk. So thanks for, for that plug. My pleasure,

2239
02:20:22.581 --> 02:20:24.200
my friend. Yeah, thank you. Always good.

2240
02:20:24.490 --> 02:20:26.990
<v 0>Good. Thanks very much. Bye. Bye Buddy.</v>
