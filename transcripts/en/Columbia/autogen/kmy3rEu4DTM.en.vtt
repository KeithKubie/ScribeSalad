00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.960
intellectual engagement so that is rapid
and I think we are we're really not even

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:03.970
and I think we are we're really not even
 

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:07.050
and I think we are we're really not even
aware the scale of this kind of thing

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:07.060
aware the scale of this kind of thing
 

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:15.510

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.110
think you've you've raised some very
personal questions and maybe one of the

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120
personal questions and maybe one of the
 

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.600
personal questions and maybe one of the
reasons for the silence initially after

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:33.610
reasons for the silence initially after
 

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.210
reasons for the silence initially after
your talk is because we are all

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220
your talk is because we are all
 

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.940
your talk is because we are all
educators and in some ways this is what

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:38.950
educators and in some ways this is what
 

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:42.150
educators and in some ways this is what
we do and you're really asking us to

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160
we do and you're really asking us to
 

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:44.700
we do and you're really asking us to
think much much more broadly here we are

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:44.710
think much much more broadly here we are
 

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:48.770
think much much more broadly here we are
sitting at an exclusive institution that

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:48.780
sitting at an exclusive institution that
 

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:52.860
sitting at an exclusive institution that
absolutely regulates who can be within

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:52.870
absolutely regulates who can be within
 

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:54.720

the space of the institution and outside
 

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:56.520
the space of the institution and outside
of it so I think you're posing some very

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:56.530
of it so I think you're posing some very
 

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:58.020
of it so I think you're posing some very
very profound questions about other

00:15:58.020 --> 00:15:58.030
very profound questions about other
 

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.390
very profound questions about other
kinds of possibilities but as you say

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:00.400
kinds of possibilities but as you say
 

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.950
kinds of possibilities but as you say
the time of democracy but it's also

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:01.960

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:31.400
education and you've kind of brought us
to the present where you talk about

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:31.410
to the present where you talk about
 

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:33.270
to the present where you talk about
credentialing and the fact that

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:33.280
credentialing and the fact that
 

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.300
credentialing and the fact that
everybody in some sense has given up on

everybody in some sense has given up on
 

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.130

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:40.240
I guess the question that I want to ask
 

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.360
I guess the question that I want to ask
you which kind of takes you outside of

just sort of picking up on what you said
about either the space that some of

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:57.670
about either the space that some of
 

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:59.330
about either the space that some of
these students were in where they were

00:16:59.330 --> 00:16:59.340
these students were in where they were
 

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.100
these students were in where they were
tremendously sort of

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:01.110

Siddhant and who they became
self-respect as we said because they

00:17:04.610 --> 00:17:04.620
self-respect as we said because they
 

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.910
self-respect as we said because they
were in spaces of kind of chosen or not

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:07.920
were in spaces of kind of chosen or not
 

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.069
were in spaces of kind of chosen or not
chosen segregation right which actually

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079
chosen segregation right which actually
 

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.650
chosen segregation right which actually
was a was an enabling space for them or

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660
was a was an enabling space for them or
 

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.590
was a was an enabling space for them or
they were at a particular historical and

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600
they were at a particular historical and
 

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.720
they were at a particular historical and
political moment where the university

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:17.730
political moment where the university
 

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:19.579
political moment where the university
came together with let's say DSS for

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:19.589
came together with let's say DSS for
 

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.530
came together with let's say DSS for
political awakening if we're not in that

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:21.540
political awakening if we're not in that
 

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:26.030
political awakening if we're not in that
moment anymore now oh yeah I agree then

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040
moment anymore now oh yeah I agree then
 

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.630
moment anymore now oh yeah I agree then
the question is who is that the next

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:29.640
the question is who is that the next
 

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.240
the question is who is that the next
student in that multicast classroom and

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:32.250
student in that multicast classroom and
 

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:34.640
student in that multicast classroom and
what does she do there is she there

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:34.650
what does she do there is she there
 

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.750
what does she do there is she there
merely to say I am in this I mean does

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760
merely to say I am in this I mean does
 

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.430
merely to say I am in this I mean does
it become a kind of insurgence of

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440
it become a kind of insurgence of
 

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.630
it become a kind of insurgence of
presence does she force another kind of

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640
presence does she force another kind of
 

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:47.200
presence does she force another kind of
knowledge on the classroom as a whole

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:47.210
knowledge on the classroom as a whole
 

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.490
knowledge on the classroom as a whole
just what are the possibilities from

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500
just what are the possibilities from
 

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.100
just what are the possibilities from
within the context of the classroom

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:51.110
within the context of the classroom
 

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:55.610
within the context of the classroom
space for in any way pursuing the kind

00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620
space for in any way pursuing the kind
 

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:59.240
space for in any way pursuing the kind
of the place that you left us in which

00:17:59.240 --> 00:17:59.250
of the place that you left us in which
 

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.060
of the place that you left us in which
is the question of real education and

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:01.070
is the question of real education and
 

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.320
is the question of real education and
because this is such a contentious issue

00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:03.330
because this is such a contentious issue
 

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.780
because this is such a contentious issue
not just in elementary school and so

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:05.790
not just in elementary school and so
 

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.610
not just in elementary school and so
forth clearly in the context of the

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:07.620
forth clearly in the context of the
 

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.980
forth clearly in the context of the
University I'm just wondering what you

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:09.990
University I'm just wondering what you
 

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:13.970
University I'm just wondering what you
think is happening in those multi multi

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980
think is happening in those multi multi
 

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:16.130
think is happening in those multi multi
class classrooms today because they're

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:16.140
class classrooms today because they're
 

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.740
class classrooms today because they're
such broad spaces of spaces where there

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:18.750
such broad spaces of spaces where there
 

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.260
such broad spaces of spaces where there
is an intensive unspoken conversation

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:21.270
is an intensive unspoken conversation
 

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:27.320
is an intensive unspoken conversation
around sexuality desire so what what is

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:27.330
around sexuality desire so what what is
 

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.990
around sexuality desire so what what is
the space of that classroom today oh I

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000
the space of that classroom today oh I
 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:42.950
the space of that classroom today oh I
guess the short answer is no and I think

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960
guess the short answer is no and I think
 

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.130
guess the short answer is no and I think
the reason I see this so bluntly is

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140
the reason I see this so bluntly is
 

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.900
the reason I see this so bluntly is
because one of the things I am

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:47.910
because one of the things I am
 

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:51.080
because one of the things I am
suggesting is the government classroom

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.090
suggesting is the government classroom
 

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.260
suggesting is the government classroom
particularly in say the urban areas but

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:54.270
particularly in say the urban areas but
 

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.169
particularly in say the urban areas but
increasingly also in rural areas and

00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.179
increasingly also in rural areas and
 

00:18:57.179 --> 00:19:00.380
increasingly also in rural areas and
I'll come to that one instance again in

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:00.390
I'll come to that one instance again in
 

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:05.229
I'll come to that one instance again in
a moment are not anymore multi class

00:19:05.229 --> 00:19:05.239
a moment are not anymore multi class
 

00:19:05.239 --> 00:19:08.229
a moment are not anymore multi class
the upper castes have more or less

00:19:08.229 --> 00:19:08.239
the upper castes have more or less
 

00:19:08.239 --> 00:19:10.599
the upper castes have more or less
entirely withdrawn and have exercised

00:19:10.599 --> 00:19:10.609
entirely withdrawn and have exercised
 

00:19:10.609 --> 00:19:13.029
entirely withdrawn and have exercised
the privilege of going to you've done it

00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039
the privilege of going to you've done it
 

00:19:13.039 --> 00:19:15.369
the privilege of going to you've done it
some withdrawing it's not as it lets out

00:19:15.369 --> 00:19:15.379
some withdrawing it's not as it lets out
 

00:19:15.379 --> 00:19:17.139
some withdrawing it's not as it lets out
many but the minute they can afford

00:19:17.139 --> 00:19:17.149
many but the minute they can afford
 

00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:19.269
many but the minute they can afford
something even slightly better they

00:19:19.269 --> 00:19:19.279
something even slightly better they
 

00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:20.709
something even slightly better they
themselves are withdrawing from these

00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:20.719
themselves are withdrawing from these
 

00:19:20.719 --> 00:19:23.499
themselves are withdrawing from these
phases so it's really only those who can

00:19:23.499 --> 00:19:23.509
phases so it's really only those who can
 

00:19:23.509 --> 00:19:25.810
phases so it's really only those who can
afford absolutely nothing else nothing

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:25.820
afford absolutely nothing else nothing
 

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.349
