smile or force a frown and were then
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.890
smile or force a frown and were then
shown the same photos of people and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900
shown the same photos of people and
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:37.310

triggers emotions based on the physical
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.810
triggers emotions based on the physical
sensations in our body so you might

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
sensations in our body so you might
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.670
sensations in our body so you might
think that when you feel nervous your

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680
think that when you feel nervous your
 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.039
think that when you feel nervous your
body shakes but actually your brain

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049
body shakes but actually your brain
 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.590
body shakes but actually your brain
notices your body shaking and then

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
notices your body shaking and then
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.260
notices your body shaking and then
activates your fear emotion weird right

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
activates your fear emotion weird right
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.600

so if we're feeling down and then we

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610
so if we're feeling down and then we
 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.050
so if we're feeling down and then we
force a smile our brain notices this

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
force a smile our brain notices this
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.880
force a smile our brain notices this
physical action and then activates your

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890
physical action and then activates your
 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.600
physical action and then activates your

up for debate but what if faking it

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480
up for debate but what if faking it
 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.270
