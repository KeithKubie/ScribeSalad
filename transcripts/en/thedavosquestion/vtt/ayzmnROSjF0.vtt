&gt;&gt; My opinion India definitely can become
a superpower.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.210
It, in fact, already is in many ways in terms
of its power and having

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.990
amazing influence.
And I think it's a matter of time that the

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.090
economic prosperity in India
catches up and it plays its role in the world

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.330
stage.
It has one-sixth the population, it's a given

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.270
that it will be a
superpower to reckon with either which way.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.220
So that's -- that's my take on it.
