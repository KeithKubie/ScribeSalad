00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.380
&gt;&gt; Greetings and welcome.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.880
I'm Libby Smigel, the dance
curator in the Music Division,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.870
and I'm delighted to have all
of you here at today's talk

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.000
which is titled Discovering
Creative Connections,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.190
choreographer Eric Hawkins and
composer Lucia Dlugoszewski.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.130
First I want to introduce you
to my co-presenter, Kate Doyle,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.680
a doctoral candidate in musicology
at Case Western Reserve University.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.800
It is in large part due to Kate's
expertise in experimental music

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.640
and her service as a fellow in
the music division last summer

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.000
that we are able to make
this presentation today.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.430 position:56%
We'll be handing the microphone back
and forth during what we estimate

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.050
to be about a 30-minute talk,
after which we hope you'll stay

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.560
on for questions and discussion
and also look at the sampling

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.710
of fascinating materials
we've selected

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.080
from the Hawkins-Dlugoszewski
special collection which is

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.000
against the windows over there.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.060
The papers of modern dance
choreographer, Eric Hawkins,

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.190
came to us in the Music
Division in 2001

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.660
and the materials were
organized and processed

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.440
in 2007, or about 10 years ago.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.190
Much of the collection concerns
the Eric Hawkins Dance Company

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.150
which he founded in 1951 after
leaving the Martha Graham Company.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.920
The collection is well-suited
to the Music Division.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.820
A music lover and pianist from
childhood, Hawkins was dedicated

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.030
to having new music
composed and performed live

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.730
for modern dance choreography.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.300
He commissioned numerous scores
for his company from composers

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.450
such as Toru Takemitsu,
Virgil Thompson,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.210
Henry Cowell and Lou Harrison.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.910
The library houses most of
those scores and this body

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.460
of commissioned music is one

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.860
of the reasons why this
collection is distinctive,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.390
but the hidden treasure in
this collection is the material

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.360
of a musician whose work Hawkins
commissioned more than any other.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.940
The scores and papers
of Lucia Dlugoszewski,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.320
an experimental musician,
poet, inventor and author,

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.690
who was also Hawkins'
intellectual collaborator and wife.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.660
Last summer Kate and I sorted

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.930 position:56%
through Dlugoszewski's materials
including holograph scores, letters,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.710
family scrapbooks, to
organize her papers

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.800
within the Hawkins collection.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.600
Here you can see the
now complete collection

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.750
of Lucia's scores written
for the Hawkins company.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.910
Today we're going to discuss
the dynamic partnership

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.250
of these two innovative artists.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.350
Dlugoszewski's philosophies
about art

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.230
and aesthetics align
closely with Hawkins'.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.150
She saw a clarity, energy and
potency in his choreography

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.910
and she strove for these elements
in her own writing and composing.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.700
Hawkins in turn felt a
kinship of vision and purpose.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.760
The following is an excerpt
of a letter from Hawkins

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.580
to the philosopher
F.S.C. Northrup in 1958

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.430
in which Hawkins describes
Dlugoszewski's artistry.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.400
He writes, "Since Lucy first
came to work with me in 1951,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.220
she has devoted herself almost
entirely to writing for the dances

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.010
in a way unprecedented in the
history of modern movement.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.730
No artist of first rank other
than her has really collaborated

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.370
with enough knowledge or love
to fathom the problem of seeing

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.120
and hearing at the same time".

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.020
During our talk this afternoon
we will point out some

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.860
of these unique points of
collaboration in Hawkins

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.580
and Dlugoszewski's creative
relationship and a bit about Eric.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.700
Much of Eric's background,
education and early experience

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.380
in the performing arts would
shape his creative trajectory.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.420
Born in Trinidad, Colorado,
Frederick Hawkins was raised

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.950
in the Midwest, actually
Kansas City, Missouri,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.120
by his working-class parents.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.220
A hard worker who distinguished
himself in science, math and music

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.520
in the public high school.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.160
Fred, as he was then called,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.660
joined the rarefied
university culture at Harvard.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.230
There he found his preparation
deficient against that

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.310
of his Harvard peers, so he
turned to classical studies.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.290
Already proficient in Latin, he
immersed himself in Greek drama

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.680
and lyric poetry, mythology
and philosophy in aesthetics,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.850
studies that influenced his
understanding of the functions

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.920
of art, his preferences for
flow in movement and his search

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.740
for unity between music and dance.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.050
He discovered dance
after university.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.870
Ultimately he would find kindred
spirits in the Greek aesthetics

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.340
of Isadora Duncan and reverence for
Asian culture that the [inaudible].

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.240
But initially Hawkins was intrigued

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.370
by German expressionist
choreographers.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.360
He was counseled by
one, Harald Kreutzberg,

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.710 position:56%
to discipline his untrained body in
ballet before pursuing modern dance.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.200
There it is.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.190
Ballet training in New York led to
his performing with Ballet Caravan

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.850
under George Balanchine, who also
gave Eric his first opportunities

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.150
to choreograph.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.430
Shown here on the left is his first
known choreography titled Showpiece

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.360
and on the right a playful solo

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.700
for himself performed
to a Mozart [inaudible].

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.170
He returned to the modern dance
by becoming the first male dancer

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.330
in Martha Graham's company.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.440 position:56%
Here you see Eric in two of
Martha's adaptations of Greek myths.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.710
These photographs, however,
also depict what Eric rejected,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.210
what he called neurotic
treatment of Greek myths,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.770
a kind of melodramatic enactment.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.570
Hawkins' treatment of Greek
classicism instead showed respect

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.440
for the beauty of the human body
and an organic way of movement

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.820
which had inner intensity and
feeling rather than outer tension.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.700
The photograph of Great Dreams

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.960
on the left shows the seemingly
effortless flow of a leap.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.670
On the right is a puckish
Hawkins behind the minotaur's mask

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.750
from his work, The
Opening of the Eye.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.590
Hawkins' period of choreographic
activity at Ballet Caravan

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.970
and during his Graham
years did develop a way

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:49.340 position:56%
of choreographic note taking, early
evidence of which we can see written

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.490 position:56%
within this score for Eric
Standt's [phonetic], Steven Acrobat.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.170
You can barely see now
the faded pencil notes

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.810
in the empty staff lines, a
combination of description,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:07.270
spatial diagrams and dance
figures, and we have a page of that

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.140
over on the side if you
want to take a closer look

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:13.830
because I don't think you could
probably see that faded pencil

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.790
from your back seats there.

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.890
Yet lacking, however, was an
effective creative process

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.120
for working with composers.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.430
In the case of Steven Acrobat,

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.790
Hawkins had encouraged composer
Robert Evett to experiment

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:35.280
with time signatures and tempos, a
request Evett followed so willingly

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.900
that Graham's conductor, Louis
Horst, declared it unplayable

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.240
and undanceable in the
rehearsal time allotted.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.720
Evett reluctantly simplified
the score to what he described

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:54.460
as undistinguished, the harmony
stock, the counterpoint nonexistent

00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:01.740
and etc. and on and on, concluding
with this damning sentence -

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.540
"I haven't shown it to
any of the musicians here,

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.520
professional or student".

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.620
Which brings us to 1951 as Hawkins
sought to form his own company

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.280
and find a composer with whom
he could develop a collaborative

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:24.330 position:56%
process for music and dance creation
- and I pass the podium to Kate.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.330
&gt;&gt; This is Lucia "Lucy"
Dlugoszewski,

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:32.390
who was born in Detroit in 1925.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.130
She was the only child
of Polish immigrants.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:40.130
Her father was a dye maker at
a Detroit auto body workshop

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.680
and her mother was a homemaker.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.470
They both encouraged Lucia to
pursue her artistic interests,

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.860
and they themselves were
amateur artists and philosophers.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.970
After studying science and
mathematics in college,

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.050
she received a fellowship
from the Berkshire Foundation

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:00.990
in the late 1940s to live
and study in New York

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.250 position:56%
with the pianist [inaudible] as well

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.000
as composers Edgard
Varese and John Cage.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.670
We are able to know about
this time in her life

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:12.190
from her almost daily
letters to her parents,

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.470
sometimes more than once a day.

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.950 position:56%
These are now housed in our archives
here at the Library of Congress.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.880
Here is an excerpt from one letter.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.010
It's difficult to see
but you can maybe notice

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.440
that she's describing a birthday
party that her roommate Mary threw

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.980 position:56%
for her, and she lists the attendees
at the party and they include Mary,

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:42.270 position:56%
Miss Sultan, that's [inaudible]
Sultan, John Cage and Edgard Varese.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.540
These letters also reflect her
developing philosophy about art

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.050
and sound and her early experiment

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.020
with found sound objects
and composition.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.040
This is one of my favorite letters
and it's an excerpt from a letter

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:58.740
to her father in which she explains
the nature of her composition

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.330
and defends why it is not
reliant on beautiful melodies.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.870
She says it's just like it was
for the people in Galileo's time,

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.460
who always thought that the world
was flat, and then he told them

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.760
that the world was round.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:20.470
In 1950, 1951, Dlugoszewski met
Hawkins because his studio was next

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.560
to her teacher [inaudible]
Sultan's space.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.280
And Sultan recommended Dlugoszewski
as an accompanist and composer

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.940
for Hawkins' newly formed company.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.240
Here's another letter
in which Lucia writes

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:38.850
to her mother describing an
early interaction with Eric.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.650
Here she's saying that she's going
to meet Hawkins and Martha Graham

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:46.120
to work with them on a new piece.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.030
In another letter she
writes to her mother,

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.990
she describes her growing
friendship with Eric Hawkins

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.090
and she includes a picture of him.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.280
We don't have that picture
unfortunately in our collection.

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.460
We have a very early score of
Dlugoszewski's from the first years

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.540
of her companionship with Hawkins.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.310
They became fast friends and
they shared each other's contacts

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.320
in the art world and New York City.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.430
This is one of those early scores.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.070
It's from about 1952.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.630
It was dedicated to their friends,
Mary and Ralph [inaudible],

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.750
that was Mary, Lucia's
former roommate.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:31.670
Ralph [inaudible] was a sculptor in
New York City and they had a loft

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:36.980
in which artists would come to
perform and this was a score

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:38.790
to one of those performances.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:41.340
You can see here that
she's using a variety

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.860
of found instruments including
glass rolled on a frying pan,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:52.500
beans poured, silver dropped, water
splashed and crushed cellophane.

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.720
This would not be the last
time that Lucia used found

00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.050
or self-fashioned instruments
to accommodate the unique sound.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:04.320 position:56%
In fact [inaudible], the [inaudible]
of this piece, designed a number

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.220
of percussion instruments
specifically

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.110
for Dlugoszewski to play.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.810
Some of them are featured
in this photograph here.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.120 position:56%
That is Lucia and she's playing some
of Ralph [inaudible] instruments

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.720
that he designed for her.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.260
After Dlugoszewski began
composing for Hawkins,

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.380
she did indeed devote herself
almost entirely to his company.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.690
She was specifically
attracted to his way of dancing

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.760
and designing movement that
enacted a present vital

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.650
theatrical experience.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:39.740
In 1963 she wrote "In my experience
the most beautiful answers

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.520
for theater came from Eric Hawkins

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.230
because he asked the most beautiful
questions not only of movement

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.710
and choreography and design,
but also of music and sound.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.570
The elegance of his questions and
the innocence of his answers made

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.260
for a wonderful playfulness
of theater

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.550
that could challenge
music for many decades.

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.830
The transparent movement poetry of
his theater demanded a sensitivity

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:07.870
from sound that music
seldom pursued."

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.770
Dlugoszewski had been
searching for such questions

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.750
and answers regarding
theater and sound herself,

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:18.540
a quest that she describes in her
notes on New Music For The Dance,

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.350
an essay written for
Dance Observer in 1957.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:25.690
The Library of Congress
holds an earlier version,

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:29.250 position:56%
a more complete draft of this essay.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:34.720
In the essay she establishes that
for her music is a form of theater.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.240
She identifies Gertrude
Stein as "prophet of theater"

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.120
because Stein identifies
two important ideas.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.370
One, the conveyance of
time in a motion via sight

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.380
and sound rather than
story and action.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.320
Two, temporal immediacy, where
the idea of a theater happening

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.010
and sensed only in the
present and immediate moment.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:02.170
That is why Gertrude Stein
theater is so exciting Lucia says.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.290
It forces the instant
by instant quality

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.890
of making something happen
before your eyes moment by moment

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.470
with the constant preclusion
of image fixing

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:15.840
since each future instant
is unpredictable.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.200
Just as Stein accomplishes
this immediacy with image then,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.400
Dlugoszewski sets out to
do the same with sound.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.100
She's influenced by Eastern
philosophy and poetry

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.120
which she says helps to promote
this radical immediacy through its

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.080
"total commitment to the aesthetic
component, to [inaudible],

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.000
to the dimension of
aliveness and consciousness".

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.860
She's also influenced by James
Joyce's descriptions of epiphany

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.800
which she calls unexpected
pure moments in which all time

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.390
and consciousness is subsumed

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:55.040
in one dynamic immediate
moment of sensation and being.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:58.740
For Dlugoszewski, Hawkins'
choreography

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:02.580
and artistic process
accomplish all of these kinds

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.830
of immediacy and clarity.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.370
She admires the way that Hawkins
creates all of his choreography

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:12.440
in silence, then works
to incorporate sound.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.640
In her notes on New Music
For The Dance she writes

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.050
"Modern dancers make beautiful
use of the archaic position

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.690
when they choose to
search their own identities

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:25.170
in silence before the
sound is added."

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.660
All of Eric Hawkins
choreography is composed this way

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.540
and when she says archaic position
she means an older kind of theater,

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:36.440
one that embraces this kind
of in the moment aesthetics.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.400
What underlines Hawkins'
choreography,

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:44.220
and indeed everything
Dlugoszewski says is pulse.

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:47.980
Heard or unheard her
pulse is always there.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.080
Choreography, especially that of
Hawkins', makes use of this pulse

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.460
because it comprises
movement organized

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.750 position:56%
through time and metrical structure.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:02.410
Dlugoszewski calls the organizing
principle of this pulse structure

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.000
of the pulse, a kind of
compositional baseline

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.400
for his choreography and her works.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.730
The pulse creates a neutral
and delicate ground upon

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:20.200
which to build other sonic material
such as pitch, rhythm and dynamic.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.180
All of these elements
Dlugoszewski writes are juxtaposed

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.730
against a backdrop of timbre.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:29.640
The building of musical material
allows for the kind of immediacy

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:34.200
that Dlugoszewski desired in
her composition as she writes:

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.630
"Music composed on the
structure of the pulse is music

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:41.360
that happens instant by instant
on the ground of each pulse

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.590
and so each instant of hearing
becomes momentarily the nonrelative

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.090
instant of sound poetry".

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:52.880
So her music resides
in and beyond time.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:56.660
Every pulse with its accompanying
sonic elements should be able

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.930
to exist as a work
on its own she says.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.930
She writes "Each pulse is separated
from the rest by an envelope

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:09.150
of timbre so that each moment
could be performed alone,

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:13.780
could possibly qualify
as the sudden instant".

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:17.890
Former Hawkins dancers
confirm that Dlugoszewski sat

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:21.780
in Hawkins' rehearsals and took
notes while his dancers danced

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.780
at first in silence.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.690
Several pages of her notes that
we hold here in the Library

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:33.280
of Congress, allow insight into the
stage of Dlugoszewski's process.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:39.090
So you'll see here a number of
notes from the piece Early Floating

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:44.910
and in this example Dlugoszewski
writes down metrical counts,

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:48.950
then later on she applies
subdivisions

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.070
and then finally she starts
building that composition

00:17:52.070 --> 00:17:55.870
by layering timbre
and instrumentation.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.430
This way of composing Dlugoszewski
says is the only one that allows

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.040
for dance to exist
in its own movement.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.850
She feels that though connected
to the music, the dance thrives

00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:11.040
as a theater all on its own,
separate from the theater

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.510
of the sound, and the beauty
of the experience comes

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.080
from the two theaters
existing side-by-side

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.670
in the immediate moment.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.540
The music is not superimposed
on the dance, she insists,

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:24.710
but rather works alongside
it simultaneously,

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:31.070 position:56%
and in its most compelling instances
exists in radical juxtapositions.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.840
As you can see here,
music took on a sort

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.450
of spatial dimension
for Dlugoszewski.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:43.830
It increasingly did so as she
moved into the 1960s and 70s

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.440
and her compositional
style became solidified.

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.730
After 1960 she experimented

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:55.430
with composing via a
kind of x/y graph system.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:58.320
Hitch could be mapped
onto a vertical line,

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.960
meter and rhythm could
be mapped horizontally.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.220
She says "It would seem that high
and low or an up-and-down journey

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:08.090 position:56%
of which the many various scales all

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:13.060
over the world are very
special gradations or graphs".

00:19:13.060 --> 00:19:17.750
We see an example of this mapping
procedure in a score of her piece,

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:22.550
Angels of the Inmost Heaven,
and we have actually an example.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:26.130
We have a score for you
here laid out on the table,

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:30.830
but I want to point out a couple
of interesting things about this.

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:34.710
So this falls in the first
two pages of the score

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:36.340
and then the score is notated

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:39.070
as you would expect
another score to be notated.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.810
It's fairly traditional, but here
you can see she's using this sort

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:45.110
of x/y graph.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.610
On the bottom there
are markings of time.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.540
On the side there are
markings of dynamic

00:19:53.540 --> 00:20:00.750
and in this next instance you see
pitch, so midrange, high, very high

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:04.960
and then low, gradations of low.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.900
These markings in the middle
indicate a kind of decay,

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:12.430
so the circles are
where the note is struck

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.350
and then she allows
the note to decay.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:20.580
The piece co-titled
Densities, Supernova,

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:25.350
Corona and Clear Core is built
on Dlugoszewski's distribution

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:29.970
of sonic materials across a
designated time and space.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:44.570
I want to play an example from
this so that you can hear the score

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:49.290
and what I'd love for you to listen
to is listen to how each sort

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.100
of phrase and each note decays.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.970
You can actually hear the decay
of all of the individual pitches.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:23:00.880
[ Music ]

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:08.580
For Dlugoszewski, sonic and
gestural materials move, juxtapose,

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.110
consolidate and evaporate
based on density.

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:14.260
They wane and grow in time.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.370
In pieces such as Angels
of the Inmost Heaven,

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.390
the composer exploits a huge
scale of timbrel possibility,

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:23.010
usually through stretching
the limits

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.020 position:56%
of the instrumentalist to a maximum.

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:29.510
From what she calls static,
the pinnacle of timbrel density

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:34.240
to extreme clarity or transparency,
words that she uses very often

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.280
in her writing and scores.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.330
Adjustments along this timbrel
scale are most often presented

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:42.690
in terms of gesture and movement.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.650
Again, she always roots
sonic elements

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:49.510 position:56%
in physical sensational materiality.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:53.960
Her conception of sound
then is tied directly

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.880
to Hawkins' [inaudible]
practice and philosophy.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.610
Both artists use material, moving
bodies of sound and moving bodies,

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:06.410
within and along the ebb
and flow of rhythm and time.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:10.250
The density and transparency of
timbre and space and the growth

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:12.870
and wain of energetic production.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.400
Just as their conceptions of
gesture and sound are organic

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.040
in their development over
time, so was their partnership,

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:23.740
evident through the synthesis
of their creative process.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.400
Dlugoszewski continued
this compositional work

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.350
on a greater basis after
Hawkins died in 1994 and she took

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:34.060
over the company as its director.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.760
She herself died six years
later after suffering

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.760 position:56%
from a congestive heart condition,
but she left a vibrant body of work,

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.890
a repertoire revolutionary
in its synthesis

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.270
of sonic and gestural elements.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.400
Hawkins' and Dlugaszewski's papers,
which live together in the archives

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.020
of the Library of Congress,
reflect a dynamic partnership

00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.920 position:56%
and an innovative perspective on the
sculpting of sound for modern dance.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.670
&gt;&gt; This -- thank you for being here
and this ends the formal component

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.940
of our talk and discussion and
I hope that this little taste

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:25.430
of the materials that show
the richness of the Hawkins

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:30.430
and Dlugoszewski collaboration
might give you some thoughts

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:36.020
about questions to ask or
thoughts about how they were able

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:41.180
to sustain this kind of
creative collaboration

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.950
over more than four decades.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:48.910
One thing to note perhaps
is that Eric Hawkins was one

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:53.630
of three male dancers who left the
Martha Graham Company and branched

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:59.820
out in a kind of rejection of
the way of composing dances,

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.220
the subject matter, the technique,

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.520
the other two being Merce
Cunningham and Paul Taylor.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.110
Both Merce and Paul Taylor
have survived both --

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:15.330
you know even though Merce has
now passed on as has John Cage,

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:17.920
the repertoire is being performed.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:23.120
Paul Taylor's company is still
active, and we might wonder why

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:26.440
with this kind of vibrant
creativity,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:31.230 position:56%
how it came that the
Hawkins-Dlugoszewski approach didn't

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:36.270
manage to get the kind of following
and I have some ideas myself

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:41.060
and you may have some, and I know
we have at least one person here

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:47.290
who has met both Lucia and Eric
and may have some thoughts herself

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:53.760
as a creative artist, but it
is unfortunate that this body

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.570
of work is really not being
celebrated or even taught often

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.500 position:56%
as part of dance history these days.

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:07.190
And as far as Lucia's
music, because Eric required

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:12.390
that she not publish her scores,
he didn't want to be beholden

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:18.540
to the music publishing industry
charging unreachable amounts

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:25.510
of money to perform what was really
created for his company as well,

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:29.850
we may have the only reel to
reel recordings which were used

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:34.590
for rehearsals as well as the
scores themselves and that

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:40.410
in itself makes it more
difficult for people to access it.

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.740
But I'm hopeful that by the end

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:46.010
of this summer we'll have
our finding aid online

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:50.570
so that you can look further
into what it is we have.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:55.000
This is just a small amount and
perhaps you have some comments

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.970
or thoughts that you'd
like to share.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.930
&gt;&gt; If you could just wait for the
microphone, sorry, we're recording.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:12.400
&gt;&gt; And this is [inaudible]
Withers, professor of dance

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.260
at George Washington University

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:19.880
and I took her dance history
class the one time she offered it,

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.010
never to do it again.

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:26.630
It was -- I thought everyone
did it that way [laughing].

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:31.940
&gt;&gt; Anyway, Eric was a great
influence on my life for sure

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.080
because I was very young when
I met him and the first person

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:42.810
that I met was Anna Halperin and
then when I went to study with her

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:47.000
in San Marin County I was just 18

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.530
and it was the first summer
dance [inaudible] that they had

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:54.970
with John Cage and Merce
Cunningham coming to the Will

00:28:54.970 --> 00:29:00.000
and Lathrop Studio in San Francisco
and she was starting to work

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.550
on Lawrence Halperin and right now

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.240
at the National Building Museum
there's a Lawrence Halperin

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:10.140
exhibition that shows them on
the deck and some of the drawings

00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.020
that show where the
dancing is to take place.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:19.940 position:56%
So in the midst of that introduction
coming from doing tap dance and jazz

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:27.140
and bad ballet, I was quite in awe
really of all of this information.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.890
The important -- it's
just so many things

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:35.290
with Eric, some very funny stories.

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:40.570
He insisted that of course people
didn't need to wear brassieres

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:44.930
or shoes or anything else that
would compromise the beauty

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:50.560
of the human body and he felt very
strongly about that and so one

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.080
of the jokes that he and I
had together was he smoked

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.720
and I said well I'll give up
my brassiere when you give

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.470
up your cigarettes if
that's a good deal.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:06.670 position:56%
I needed a brassiere [laughing], but
his tremendous interest in nature

00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:12.220
and the human body as a gorgeous,
beautiful instrument of life

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:18.060
and passion and Lucia
was a small, quiet woman,

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:22.500
and one of the stories I remember
from her was when she was living

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.530
in Europe as a child without money

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:28.850
and she said her parents
would take her every week

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.420
when possible, wait
outdoors for her.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.830
She would go into Symphony
Hall to learn

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.260
about music and what music was.

00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:39.890
So she came from a
traditional background of music

00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:45.300
so I think it's even more
astounding that both Lucia

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:51.290
and I think John Cage, that
inclination toward revising writing

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:56.200
about music and what
symbolic ways there were

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:03.660
to actually record
and motivate sound.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.500
His technique was extremely
sort of a rejection

00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:10.680
of Martha Graham's technique but
it had a lot of the same elements,

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.530
work on the floor and
sitting in a sort

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.810
of forward/backward leg situation.

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:22.240
However, his work was extremely
intricate, very nuanced

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.360
and very, very demanding.

00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:29.050
And I think one of the things
about why maybe his work

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:35.180
and their work didn't continue
was it was very intricate

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.950
and delicate and very, very exact.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.220
And that was the time when the
generations, my generation sort

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.850
of heading toward more
blatant forms of movement

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:50.890 position:56%
and more easily achieved forms of
movement, and I taught his technique

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:54.650
for several years until nobody
wanted to learn it anymore

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:58.970
because it took too much time,
too much demand, too much beauty,

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:03.410
too much philosophy,
just too much philosophy.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:06.240
And so even the dancers
that danced with them,

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.400
many of them my good friends,
they had to sort of give

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:14.190
up teaching it too, so there's not
a lot of it being taught today.

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.900
It does happen though.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:19.180
There's a lot of people teaching
his technique in New York

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.650
and I think important, important
that it has been quite a mystery

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:27.360
to me too that two of my very
good friends, Alvin Nicolai

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:34.990
and this beautiful duo,
they were never accepted

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:39.180
and never acknowledged for
some reason I never understood.

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.800
And I'll tell one more story which
I think is pretty interesting.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:47.720
Anna Halperin was in Washington
and I had agreed to present her

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:53.620
at Marvin Theater at TW and at
that time Watts had had the --

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:55.850
Watts was on fire we'll say,

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.410
and so she brought together a
multi-cultural group of people

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:03.230
that studied and danced together
all day every day to sort of look

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:08.920 position:56%
at what was happening in our culture
that made this terrible chasm

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.510
between the cultures of Koreans
and African-Americans and so forth.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:19.580
And so she wanted to be
presented in Marvin Center

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:23.870 position:56%
and Eric had asked me see if I could
present them in Lisner Auditorium.

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:28.710
And he wanted to do his sort
of nude dance at the time

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:32.830
and she was asking -- they
were dancing naked as well.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:36.990
They had all their rehearsal
sessions naked in California

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:41.980
and so I said well I know that
I can't do it at Marvin Center

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:45.310
because it's a theater in the round
and people can reach out and touch

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:50.180 position:56%
and I felt it was a little dangerous
for me to put my reputation

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.060
on the line and so I
said no to Anna Halperin.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:56.550
She had been arrested in New York
City as those of you that recall,

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:58.820
and she had to leave New
York City to not be arrested,

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:00.820
and then she was performing
in Washington,

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:07.720
and then Eric Lisner was
performing and when I went there

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:11.660
and I saw the work and I said
well this is not a nude ballet

00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:15.460
and he said well yes
it is, certainly it is,

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.950
because the women were naked.

00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:22.420
The men were wearing a covering,
a jockstrap, and he said well

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.670
who would ever want to dance
without that being held

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:30.200
into place [giggling] and I
said well a lot of women might

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.220
like looking at that [laughter],
maybe the men might not,

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.660
but anyway there are
some wonderful stories

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:39.930
and really Lucia just
watching her on stage,

00:34:39.930 --> 00:34:42.850
because she performed
in a visible way.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:49.690
She taught me that because I've had
only live music for about 120 works

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.210
that I've created, all music
played live for the work,

00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:57.370 position:56%
and that takes you to
improvisational artists a lot rather

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:02.790
than people who do notation and
so forth, but I think watching her

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:06.250
on stage live while
they were performing

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:11.510
so profoundly influenced
my life that I always knew

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:15.270
that a musician needed to be seen
so we could watch their movement

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.770
and watch the concentration
of their mind

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:23.700
and the way they felt
for the performance.

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:28.060 position:56%
And she taught me that, and
watching her was quite an incredible

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:30.050
experience honestly.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:32.280
And he's a big man.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:37.580
You can see then from the images of
him his large thigh and so forth.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.960
And I have only one
more story, I apologize.

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.540
This is like reminiscence for me
because nobody knows who he is

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:47.520
so to speak and when you
teach them the people look

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.720
at you like where are you from?

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:53.590
I've never seen any books about
this or I've never seen any videos

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:56.950
or films of this and
so something got left

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:58.500
out that was really,
really important.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:01.720
But I was teaching at Howard
University the first year I moved

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:06.600
to Washington, DC, and he came
there to do the piece about --

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:13.060
what's the name of it --
out here in West Virginia

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:15.310
where it was -- someone took --

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.610
&gt;&gt; John Brown or --

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:17.910
&gt;&gt; John Brown.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.210
&gt;&gt; Or God's Angry Man.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, John Brown, you all
know the story of John Brown,

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:26.440
and so Eric Hawkins came out on
the stage at Howard University

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.920
and started talking and he talked
and he philosophized and he talked

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:35.010
and he talked more and 45 minutes
later he was still talking.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.910
And little by little the audience
had left and there was really

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:45.690
about 20 of us left because he
just insisted that conceptual ideas

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:52.800
and philosophy should be able to be
talked about with dance, that dance

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.580
and that had a deep
reservoir of relationship.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:02.680
So I know he was accused a lot of
talking too much about philosophy,

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.830
but if you took his class you'd
stand in place and wait and watch

00:37:06.830 --> 00:37:09.230
and watch and wait and be
there and be there and be there

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:13.480
and be there while he talked about
the body and about philosophy.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:18.860
And so now we had a --
dance is very physical.

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.160
It's very athletic.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:21.460
People are impatient.

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:22.760
They want to learn quickly.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:27.330
It's a different time than
that, so anyway, thanks.

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:28.630
&gt;&gt; Thank you [inaudible].

00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:30.210
[ Applause ]

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:35.060
&gt;&gt; The other thing that has
your comments reminded me --

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.530
especially talking about
Alan Nicolai and the two

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:41.260
of them not being celebrated
the way they are.

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:45.550
They really didn't have a technique
that was codified and of course

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:48.690
when we think about Martha Graham
technique or Balanchine technique,

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:53.280
they've even tried to copyright it
or trademark it, and really it was

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.160
about using the body
is an instrument much

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.660
as she was using musical
instruments in different ways

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:03.140
than perhaps you had
been taught by technique.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:07.110
So the technique if it
were called the technique

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.810
and maybe we should be calling it,
was really about what do we need

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:16.780
to do to create what the artist
is imagining rather than lots

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.010
of physical exercises
and I think for both

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:25.360
of them it's meant less
transmission and so --

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.170
&gt;&gt; A really important thing

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:32.880
about his technique is
that he wanted beauty.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.710
He really wanted beauty
to be the basic thing

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:42.190
that you were [inaudible] and not
sexual beauty or not indulgent --

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:44.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, he used the word
sensuous in that sense.

00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:49.140
&gt;&gt; Very abstract, pure
form of beauty and power

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:55.760
and I think it's idealistic and
maybe unrealistic for most of us.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I think probably -- although when
you hear her scores probably a lot

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.580
of you didn't feel well
that is beautiful music.

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.770
I would not be playing
that to go to bed

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:09.630
and get a good night's
rest necessarily.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:16.770
It was more active because it's
not -- it isn't predictable.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:20.800
So it's an interesting, even a
definition of what is beauty,

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:27.110
and I think that's part
of the challenge too

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:33.630
that really shakes our
premises of what is possible.

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.180
Other thoughts?

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.480
Yes.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.780
&gt;&gt; I'm going to put this down.

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.580
Can you hear me?

00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:44.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:46.980
&gt;&gt; My name is Gregory
Velasco [phonetic].

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:53.310
In 1968 I read Isadora
Duncan's "The Art of the Dance"

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:57.470
and I decided that's the kind of
dancing that I was going to do,

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.770
but I wasn't going to
repeat what she did.

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:04.140
I wanted to do the
germ of what she did.

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.010 position:56%
Several years later I was on a
train with Carla Perloyle [phonetic]

00:40:08.010 --> 00:40:12.430 position:56%
up to the American Dance Festival
and I was trying to decide what kind

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:15.800 position:56%
of dancing I was going to do because
Cunningham didn't fit the bill

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.730
for me, Limone sort of did,

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:23.480
and she said well you probably
should do Lester Horton

00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:28.820
because you're so big and she
says whatever you do stay away

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:30.880
from Eric Hawkins.

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.340
So I thought well that's exactly
what I'm going to go towards

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:39.120 position:56%
and I read an essay he wrote and
the intelligence with which he wrote

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.950
about Isadora Duncan's vision

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:46.720
of transcendental eroticism
and the body caught me.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:51.830
I went to study with
Nancy Mayhan for two years

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:57.000
and she was his partner early in
the 60s, and then I went to study

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.950
with Hawkins himself for 12 years
at his studio and supplemented

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:09.050
with Miriam Rosen's instruction
at the University of Maryland.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.980
I have never done anything else.

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:16.910
I refused to subject my body to it.

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:24.080 position:56%
As a result, I was able to model
the technique at the 92nd Street "Y"

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:29.850
in New York in -- let's
see, it was in 2010,

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:36.590
and I modeled until about a
year ago and I'm 61 years old.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:40.150
As a result of his tutelage
I have been able to dance

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:45.820 position:56%
for a very long time and to actually
better myself in my dancing.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:51.260
I'm dancing better than
I did at 20 or 30 or 40.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.520
The body is certainly not
in the same shape it was

00:41:54.520 --> 00:42:01.060
but the spirit is there and
the body is actually willing.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:05.690
I owe a great debt to
him for what he did

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.720
for the enormous amount
of work he did.

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.990
I'm sorry I missed the beginning
of your discussion here,

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:18.820
but he had a vision of the body

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:22.330
which in America has
always been difficult.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:26.960
America never accepted Isadora
Duncan until after she died.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.560
These are people who were a
little bit ahead of the game.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.730
He was low impact before
low impact was [inaudible].

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:38.000
He was dealing with
biomechanics before [inaudible].

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.220
He had a book which he used
to quote from all the time

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:48.390
which is very interesting
called "The Thinking Body"

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:53.750
by Mabel Ellsworth-Todd, where
you actually stood with the image

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:56.140
of the dancer you wanted today

00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:01.100
and you saw yourself
eventually become that.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.230
&gt;&gt; No its -- thank you so much.

00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:08.170
That's a really wonderful comment
because he's sometimes known

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.600 position:56%
for that low impact and the adoption

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:17.980
of kinesiology principles before
it really affected other dancers

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:22.410 position:56%
and everyone in the history seems to
say well he had an injury and he had

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:27.630 position:56%
to seek something but it's so
clearly aligned with a larger vision

00:43:27.630 --> 00:43:32.300
that yes it does mean that you've
taken care of your Stradivarius

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.300
so that you can dance or
play it four your full life

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:41.330
and he also though was
subjected sometimes to criticism,

00:43:41.330 --> 00:43:46.550
that his free-flowing leaps
weren't those that we think

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.620
of for Baryshnikov at his
height or something, but --

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.510
&gt;&gt; The body for him was --

00:43:52.510 --> 00:44:05.580
[ Inaudible ]

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:08.540
&gt;&gt; Well there are a few because
we have some here [laughter]

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:09.840
which is fabulous.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:11.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you Gregory.

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.740
&gt;&gt; I have a question for you.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.040
I'm wondering just a bit
more about the collection,

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:18.460
in particular the notation.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.010
Transmission of these
pieces you mentioned

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:21.660
that there's some standard notation

00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:26.660
and also mapping pitches
differently and things like that.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.390
Maybe you could just speak a bit
more about the different ways

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:33.350
that that information is both
transmitted to the musicians

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:36.840
and to the dancers and
how that intersects.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:38.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.930
That's an excellent question.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:44.120 position:56%
So if you look through the scores in
this collection, by and large most

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.590
of them are traditionally notated.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:53.890 position:56%
The example that I showed you here
was unusual and it allows us insight

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:59.180
into her process, how we get
from the early floating sketches

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.970
that I showed you to the
traditionally notated scores

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:07.070
that you'll find in
most of this collection.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:13.790
So in terms of transmission to
the dancers, from my knowledge

00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:18.600
of Lucia's process,
she was again sitting

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:23.300
in these rehearsals watching
Eric go through the choreography

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.680
with his dancers, and there
are other people who can speak

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.620
to this much more articulately
than I can,

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:32.390
but I can just tell you what
I've found from Lucia's scores.

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:35.120
So she's taking notes,
she's building

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.620
on what she calls the structure of
the pulse, this kind of baseline,

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.150
and then she's layering
these sonic materials.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:44.660
This is what I think
is just so exciting,

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:48.650
that she's using these
musical elements.

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:52.680 position:56%
We think of timbre rhythm, whatever,
these regular musical elements,

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:57.320
and she's using them in
a totally sculptural way.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.350
She's literally building them one
on top of another and she talks

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:02.550 position:56%
about them in her extensive writings

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:05.990
in a very material
and sculptural way.

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:10.000
So she's synchronizing
herself with Eric in that way.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.130
She really is writing for the dance

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:16.360
in a totally revolutionary
way in my opinion.

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:20.680
But back to your question about
the scores, yes most are --

00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:26.410
end up being traditionally notated
but examples like this get us

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:33.280
as scholars to provide
insight into that process.

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:37.770
&gt;&gt; And also they are
heavily annotated.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:43.960
Initially we see more choreographic
notes or cues, but ultimately

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:47.250
as she's becoming more
sophisticated in the way

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:53.050
that she's preparing the scores,
you'll see put hairpin in mouth,

00:46:53.050 --> 00:46:55.420
these little cues where you know

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:59.590
that there's something that's
being prepared, sort of the notes

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:05.370
to herself to make sure that that
next special effect or density

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:10.050
or timbre, whatever
it is, is prepared.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.220
But she was active.

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.520
I mean what [inaudible]
said is very true,

00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:18.050
that she was almost choreographed
in the sense that she had

00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:20.020
to be doing these other things.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.770
&gt;&gt; And actually -- so we
have an example of one

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:25.960
of the really valuable
things about the scores

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:28.800
and about this collection
is that she performed

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.660
as [inaudible] mentioned,
she was on stage or close

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.440
to the stage when she performed.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.140 position:56%
So some of these are her performance
parts so we have a part of hers,

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:43.730
the piano part, which she
called the timbre piano

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.930
which we did not have
time to talk about today,

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:51.620
but it was basically a kind of
prepared piano although it was sort

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:56.350
of like a compilation of
prepared piano plus sort

00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:59.670
of almost a found object sculpture
in which she was using things

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:03.950
like jars and placing
wild, unusual things --

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:06.320
combs and things like
that, inside the piano.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:11.260
So we have one of her
parts from Black Lake,

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:14.410
that's the timbre piano part, and
this is what Libby was referring

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:18.410
to when she says -- she's
written in put hairpin in mouth.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:22.340
So she had the hairpin somewhere
in the piano and then she's --

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.250
it's almost like a kind
of choreography in itself

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:29.430
because she's negotiating the jars
and the combs and all the stuff

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.790 position:56%
that she's putting in -- she's
putting in the piano and taking out.

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:35.860
So I would advise all
of you to look at it.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:40.930
It's just such a fabulous
slice of history there

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:44.100
and such a beautiful example of
the kind of innovative things

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:46.440
that she was doing
just all on her own,

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.430 position:56%
literally right there in the moment.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.480
So it's over there on the table.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:54.960
&gt;&gt; Did that answer most of your
question or did you also want

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.110
to know about like the
choreographic notation?

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:03.040
Okay, most of his dances
are not [inaudible],

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:08.200
which is a very formal system
that you get a certified person.

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:11.250
But what we do have is
astonishing notebooks,

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:15.120
usually more than one,
of Eric's process.

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.470
So he starts with notes.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:23.500 position:56%
Sometimes these are narrative
things copying from poetry or ideas,

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:27.970
and then it starts going into
little movement motifs and he had

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.750
that strange way of creating
a little bit of narrative,

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:36.620
a little bit of stick figure,
and then these things started

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.740
to jog his memory and then
they become more and more --

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:44.280
maybe we could scroll
up to one of those

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:47.210
which I didn't really
have time to talk about.

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:54.040
But you kind of see here it's very
faint but he would divide these,

00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.580
make these columns which are
[inaudible] notation effect

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.730
because [inaudible] notation scores
actually have the person start --

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:05.960
the notation starts at the bottom

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:11.050
and it works forward the way we go
sort of forward so it doesn't go

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:15.080
from top to bottom but from the
back, the bottom to the top.

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:18.660
And on the left-hand side
he has notes about space

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:23.560
and so you can see the sort
of curly cues over there

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:28.040
so that each one marked by which
dancer and then he has columns

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:34.530
for each dancer and so he has
these and by the end of his career

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:39.700 position:56%
and his life he had taught a lot of
his dancers to be able to read these

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.860
and also to make notes
in the same system.

00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:47.710
So we still have some people
who are amongst us who are able

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:53.130
to reconstruct pretty well and
you see these notes on the side.

00:50:53.130 --> 00:51:00.850
There's a little square box here,
those little squares have numbers

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:04.560
in them and those have the
pulses, they are counting,

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:09.350
and one of the dancers, Laura
Pettibone, who actually lives

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:13.040
in southeastern Virginia right
now and is working on a biography

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.490
of Hawkins, said that we
were counting all the time

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:21.040
because there weren't
traditional time signatures.

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.850
And of course we know
that that was the thing

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:27.050
that got Louis Horst
[phonetic] upset in one

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:30.120
of Eric's first experiments
trying to commission,

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:34.380
that all these time signatures,
it didn't matter with Lucia

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:37.800
because she had it all in
these pulses which meant

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:41.100
that it was countable for
the dancers and it wasn't

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:45.390
about switching from
3-8 to 3-4 and --

00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:50.610
&gt;&gt; The interesting thing about the
mutual construction of the music

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:54.650
and the dance -- the music
and dance were actually

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:57.150
constructed separately.

00:51:57.150 --> 00:52:01.710
They agreed on the pulses
and then they went off

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:06.070
and did their own thing without
any kind of communication.

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:12.200
This is similar, I was there,
this is similar to what Cage

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.630
and Cunningham did but
slightly different.

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:23.860
As they started to converge they
finally began to come together.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:29.510
It became very difficult to dance
the dances because the subdivisions

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:36.790 position:56%
of the beat which are a major detail
of this work often were different

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:41.170
within the pulse so you would
have a subdivision of six going

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:45.120
on in Lucia's music and you have
a subdivision of eight going

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:51.970
on in Eric's dance [chuckling], so
you had to have that pulse going.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.340
&gt;&gt; Time for one more
if anyone's got one --

00:53:07.070 --> 00:53:09.560
&gt;&gt; I don't have anything
intellectually to offer you,

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:16.110
but was Eric Hawkins on tour
at college towns around 1972?

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:17.650
Does anybody know that?

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:22.940
&gt;&gt; Yes, in the age of
touring, the 60s and the 70s,

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:28.810
it looks as though he was just
going wherever he had an offer.

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:34.160
I don't know how they all managed
to stay awake and stay alive.

00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:36.850
&gt;&gt; I actually saw Eric
Hawkins in 1972

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:39.960
in my college town at
Indiana University --

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.260
&gt;&gt; Very likely.

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.390
I could -- if you gave me the --

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:45.250
&gt;&gt; When I saw this lecture
today my memories --

00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:49.610
you know the box came back and
it had quite an impression.

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:52.550
I can tell you just
from a layman's point

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:56.870
of view the man was very muscular.

00:53:56.870 --> 00:54:02.710
The music was very, very
bizarre at the time, in 1972.

00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:05.680
I have to tell you
sadly people walked out,

00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.700
a lot of people walked out.

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:15.980
I do recall him with trees
being carted around the stage

00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:22.090
and I do recall that the man
had a very muscular body.

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:25.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:54:25.550 --> 00:54:26.850
&gt;&gt; That's my reaction to Eric --

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:30.620
&gt;&gt; And if you let me
know how to contact you,

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.800
I've been organizing the
programs and that's where I saw --

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:38.220
just I don't know what small
college he hadn't performed at.

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:40.080
He had such support.

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:45.500
I'd be happy to photocopy the
program and let you take a look

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.890
at it to jog your memory further.

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:54.270 position:56%
But you also mentioned the trees and
nature was a huge effect, influence,

00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:57.200
on both Lucia whose
mother was a gardener,

00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:00.390
and we have Lucia's
mother's scrapbook,

00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:04.530
and also Eric because he
loved the Southwest states.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:08.210
He had originally been in Colorado

00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:13.340
and of course studying
classics and others.

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:16.730
There's a very important sort of
spiritual connection to nature

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:24.140
as well and so they were making
masks and dancing the giant squash

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:28.850
and all sorts of very
[inaudible] ideas [chuckling].

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:30.580
Thank you.

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:32.910
&gt;&gt; Well I saw the entire concert.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:39.760
I didn't walk out but it was freaky
and I definitely remembered it.

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.060
&gt;&gt; [Laughing] Thank you.

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:44.650
And I just want to thank Kate
Doyle who came down from Cleveland

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:48.750 position:56%
and Case Western Reserve so that she
could share her research with you

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:54.120
and thank you very much for coming
and if you have a few minutes

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:58.540
to see the exhibits here
that would be delightful.

00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:00.340
Thank you.

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:06.070
[ Applause ]

00:56:06.070 --> 00:56:09.720
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
