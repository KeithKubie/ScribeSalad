Thanks so much for

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.920
giving us that extra insight into
how you use websites Victor.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.790
&gt;&gt; Sure my pleasure.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.780
&gt;&gt; If you could have our students take
away just two things from this lesson

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.370
what would they be?

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.190
&gt;&gt; First of all make sure to
use meaningful headings and

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.250
link text as well as good pay structure.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.930
Secondly, as a general rule,
you shouldn't try to control

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.370
the experience a screen
reader user will have.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.130
They will use the information
available to them

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.370
because the tool they're using to find
that information on the web page.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.980
Things such as trying to control or fine
tune exactly what a screen reader says,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.780
or make an elements focusable
which shouldn't be,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.720
generally lead to more confusion and
worse experience for users.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.360
&gt;&gt; That's really helpful
advice thank you.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.023
Now and our next lesson, we're going to
take a look at what we can do if HTML

00:00:54.023 --> 00:00:57.932
doesn't have the precise semantic we
need or if, for some reason or other,

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:01.811
the HTML element we'd usually use isn't
a good fit for some other reason.
