00:00:05.518 --> 00:00:08.435
(soft piano music)

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.264
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:14.764
Bipedal. Naked. Large-brained.

00:00:17.482 --> 00:00:21.282
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:24.699
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:29.187
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:31.354
Yet, filled with optimism,

00:00:32.294 --> 00:00:35.794
we grow up slowly. We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:39.522
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.905 --> 00:00:42.277
We shape the future from

00:00:42.277 --> 00:00:45.360
our shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:50.015
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:54.598
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.897 --> 00:00:58.751
An exploration made possible by the

00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:01.251
generosity of humans like you.

00:01:19.992 --> 00:01:22.575
(upbeat music)

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.703
Thank you very much.

00:01:36.703 --> 00:01:39.252
What I want to talk
about is dealing with the

00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:40.848
organization of human society

00:01:40.848 --> 00:01:44.297
and the nature of human society.

00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:47.880
And I believe that if we think of it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.822
in general evolutionary terms,

00:01:50.822 --> 00:01:54.598
we see that the organization
of human society

00:01:54.598 --> 00:01:57.333
is really quite different to that

00:01:57.333 --> 00:02:01.333
of our nearest primate
cousins, the chimpanzees.

00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:08.621
I think that manifest the
results of the difference

00:02:09.947 --> 00:02:12.114
are clear and they're two.

00:02:13.042 --> 00:02:17.459
One of them is that we are
able to build up societies

00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:21.758
at far greater size than we find

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:26.091
in the other close primates,
and greater complexity.

00:02:27.936 --> 00:02:29.924
And the second one

00:02:29.924 --> 00:02:33.747
is that we think of
our social organization

00:02:33.747 --> 00:02:35.914
as lasting far, far longer

00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:39.175
than the life of the people

00:02:40.776 --> 00:02:43.609
who might be part of that society.

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:49.032
I believe that both these differences

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:51.056
are due to the fact that

00:02:51.056 --> 00:02:54.723
many aspects of human
society are imaginary.

00:02:56.862 --> 00:03:01.009
And therefore I'm going to
start to look at imagination

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.100
in the certain art of detail.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.967
The notion of imagination
isn't very often linked

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:11.431
with creativity and quite rightly.

00:03:11.431 --> 00:03:16.073
And it is also linked
with individual creation.

00:03:16.073 --> 00:03:18.922
That's not what I'll be talking about.

00:03:18.922 --> 00:03:21.515
I'll be talking about
something quite different.

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:24.255
Which is shared imagination.

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:29.088
How the same imaginary features
are shared within a group.

00:03:32.114 --> 00:03:36.614
And how that comes back is
due to a number of factors,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.361
but I think already if we
remember the slide we've seen

00:03:42.361 --> 00:03:46.763
about pretend pay, we can
see that both there seems

00:03:46.763 --> 00:03:51.763
to be a general predispositions
in humans for pretend play.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.360
But that pretend play gets
slot-in with things which are

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:01.229
instituted within the
culture and the society

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.650
of people who are doing this pretend play.

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:10.847
So I think we have to
think of predispositions

00:04:10.847 --> 00:04:15.430
enabling us to take on
historically created structures.

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:23.863
Like schools was obvious
in the last picture

00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:28.356
in that series about pretend playing.

00:04:33.157 --> 00:04:35.396
We have to think of this
articulation between

00:04:35.396 --> 00:04:37.396
the two kinds of things.

00:04:40.797 --> 00:04:43.897
How, as I was saying,
how is articulates...

00:04:43.897 --> 00:04:46.950
So, what I'll be talking
about is not individual

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.500
imagination, though
obviously it's involved,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.083
but the sharing of imagination.

00:04:54.507 --> 00:04:59.147
And let me go back to
what I started off with,

00:04:59.147 --> 00:05:01.068
saying that there are many aspects

00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:05.735
of human social organization
which have to be imaginary.

00:05:07.383 --> 00:05:10.800
First factor of this I want to talk about

00:05:11.803 --> 00:05:16.553
is the notions of the groups
we often think we belong to.

00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:21.705
Let me start off with
the examples of clans,

00:05:21.705 --> 00:05:26.288
which we find in various
forms in many human societies.

00:05:27.792 --> 00:05:30.587
Now, one of the interesting
things about humans,

00:05:30.587 --> 00:05:34.711
about clans, is that they're
thought of as lost in time

00:05:34.711 --> 00:05:38.461
far longer than the
life-span of individuals.

00:05:40.935 --> 00:05:44.249
That already means that
they have to be imaginary

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:48.220
because obviously if they were
attached to the individuals

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.470
they would sort of end or
have no great continuity.

00:05:54.405 --> 00:05:57.811
But this would also be true of nations.

00:05:57.811 --> 00:06:02.789
For example, one can think
of the Greeks as a nation,

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.731
quite apart from their
territory, having gone on

00:06:05.731 --> 00:06:10.731
for very, very long periods
in time the Greeks continued,

00:06:10.917 --> 00:06:15.167
they passed on from one
another something called...

00:06:16.187 --> 00:06:20.514
a vague Greekishness that
is very difficult to define

00:06:20.514 --> 00:06:22.826
what that might be and
very interesting, it is

00:06:22.826 --> 00:06:25.370
difficult even for the
people who think this is

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.599
extremely important to define it.

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:33.016
So, again we imagine, and
I think I can use the word,

00:06:34.598 --> 00:06:36.431
that there is a level,

00:06:38.722 --> 00:06:41.055
a twitch, a social continues

00:06:44.123 --> 00:06:47.357
on quite a different time-scale

00:06:47.357 --> 00:06:50.274
than the life, our biological life.

00:06:52.065 --> 00:06:54.007
That doesn't mean...

00:06:54.007 --> 00:06:59.007
And there is another factor
which is even more important.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.907
We continually think of as an

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.286
important part of our society

00:07:05.286 --> 00:07:08.036
is that we have instituted roles.

00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:12.070
Husband, a wife, to use an example which

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.574
was used by the philosopher Searle.

00:07:15.574 --> 00:07:17.657
But policemen, and so on.

00:07:20.164 --> 00:07:24.581
Now, there is something
rather odd about these roles.

00:07:27.988 --> 00:07:31.103
Because they can't, they
don't seem to have very little

00:07:31.103 --> 00:07:34.603
to do with what people actually get up to.

00:07:35.886 --> 00:07:39.525
People may hate each other,
husbands and wives may

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:43.258
hate each other, but we think
there is something about

00:07:43.258 --> 00:07:47.008
being husband and wife
independently of this.

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:54.783
So, if we think of our
society as systems of roles,

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:59.047
as a large number of roles,

00:07:59.047 --> 00:08:02.833
we realize we have to
think on another level,

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:04.666
on an imaginary level.

00:08:06.823 --> 00:08:09.822
Other than the
interactions, which has been

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:14.086
the greatest focus in
psychology when people

00:08:14.086 --> 00:08:16.174
are thinking of the social.

00:08:16.174 --> 00:08:21.007
We have to think of how it is
possible that these systems,

00:08:22.003 --> 00:08:25.490
that they're shared systems of the social,

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:29.240
which don't correspond
to anything empirical.

00:08:30.739 --> 00:08:32.906
I should've mentioned that
when I was talking about clans,

00:08:32.906 --> 00:08:36.001
that clans, you know, if
people can imagine themselves

00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:39.503
as belonging to clans
without anything obvious

00:08:39.503 --> 00:08:43.393
marking them out from people
who belong to other clans,

00:08:43.393 --> 00:08:45.723
that they usually do not live together,

00:08:45.723 --> 00:08:48.189
that they're dispersed,
it's somehow there is

00:08:48.189 --> 00:08:51.939
a level, an imaginary
level that which people

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:55.714
can think of themselves as one.

00:08:57.557 --> 00:09:00.057
So, this is really presents...

00:09:02.707 --> 00:09:04.814
This is something which we do not find

00:09:04.814 --> 00:09:07.395
in any other primates.

00:09:07.395 --> 00:09:12.395
This is why I would argue
that we should stop thinking

00:09:12.587 --> 00:09:16.754
of human society as a sort
of incremental business

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:23.717
of getting better and better
at knowing other people

00:09:23.717 --> 00:09:26.103
and knowing the world.

00:09:26.103 --> 00:09:30.436
There is also a discontinuity
which I would identify

00:09:32.147 --> 00:09:35.314
with the presence of that imagination.

00:09:36.736 --> 00:09:41.416
Having said that, however,
this presents a problem.

00:09:41.416 --> 00:09:45.920
How, with what I started
off with talking about,

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.160
which is I was saying
something very different about

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.464
human societies is that
they seem to be able

00:09:51.464 --> 00:09:54.841
to be expanded to
extraordinarily large size

00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:59.465
in a way that doesn't
apply to other primates.

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:02.221
And that there's also this idea

00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:04.471
of them continuing in time.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.942
Of course, this is not
a problem if by society

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:13.048
we mean these imaginary representations

00:10:13.048 --> 00:10:14.907
that I was talking about.

00:10:14.907 --> 00:10:16.778
They can be as large as you like.

00:10:16.778 --> 00:10:20.361
Or as and, indeed,
their systems, which are

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.323
not tied to particular moments.

00:10:25.362 --> 00:10:28.087
But I was talking about practical results.

00:10:28.087 --> 00:10:32.420
How can this imaginary level
have practical results?

00:10:34.309 --> 00:10:37.586
Which are tremendously
important if we want

00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:41.914
to understand the
evolution of human society.

00:10:41.914 --> 00:10:44.925
I think we answer comes from the fact that

00:10:44.925 --> 00:10:49.027
this imaginary level is not as imaginary

00:10:49.027 --> 00:10:51.333
as it might seem at first.

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:54.508
There are what I've called emergences.

00:10:54.508 --> 00:10:58.091
That is moments when
the shared imagination

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.258
is actually acted out,

00:11:03.258 --> 00:11:07.175
where people can live in
the shared imagination

00:11:08.753 --> 00:11:13.221
as well as they live in the
practical, interactional world

00:11:13.221 --> 00:11:16.804
which is normal, sort
of every day leveled.

00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:21.783
These are very largely
rituals which involve

00:11:21.783 --> 00:11:26.388
people losing many of
the aspects of themselves

00:11:26.388 --> 00:11:29.325
as individuals in that what characterizes

00:11:29.325 --> 00:11:32.990
rituals is their
repetitions of previous...

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:36.332
People say the same things
other people have said.

00:11:36.332 --> 00:11:38.752
They, therefore, lose
their intentionality.

00:11:38.752 --> 00:11:43.117
They become kind of elements
in an abstract structure,

00:11:43.117 --> 00:11:44.901
but it is acted out.

00:11:44.901 --> 00:11:46.818
And at other moments...

00:11:49.492 --> 00:11:52.991
In normal life, or in
normal traditional life,

00:11:52.991 --> 00:11:56.741
people step in and out
of the imaginary level

00:11:57.755 --> 00:11:59.922
to an interactional level,

00:12:00.788 --> 00:12:05.326
and they're able to hold
two quite different ways

00:12:05.326 --> 00:12:07.493
of thinking about society.

00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:12.038
This is what is not
found in other primates.

00:12:13.783 --> 00:12:16.366
And this has practical results.

00:12:17.632 --> 00:12:21.215
For example, if you
imagine yourself living

00:12:22.357 --> 00:12:24.860
in a pre-Neolithic village
and you want to set up

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.884
another... to move to another village,

00:12:27.884 --> 00:12:30.803
you have to move to this imaginary level

00:12:30.803 --> 00:12:35.220
in order to be able to build
up kinship relationships

00:12:36.711 --> 00:12:40.378
with other people, people
in that other village.

00:12:40.378 --> 00:12:42.941
Convince them somehow
that there is something

00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:45.744
in common and that is
moving to another level,

00:12:45.744 --> 00:12:47.240
to that imaginary level.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.733
And then you can move
to that sort of place.

00:12:49.733 --> 00:12:53.900
This, I think, explains
how pre-ape humans managed

00:12:55.051 --> 00:12:57.134
to have very far-reaching

00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:02.004
and distant trading relationships.

00:13:02.004 --> 00:13:05.337
And, also, to the other practical level,

00:13:06.982 --> 00:13:09.242
to the other practical
factor, which is imagining

00:13:09.242 --> 00:13:12.411
that your society lost in time,

00:13:12.411 --> 00:13:15.994
that somehow we imagine
that we have a social

00:13:15.994 --> 00:13:18.859
which lasts in time quite independently

00:13:18.859 --> 00:13:20.817
of our biological life.

00:13:20.817 --> 00:13:24.067
It means that there is some point in...

00:13:24.938 --> 00:13:28.665
First of all, in passing
on, and accumulating

00:13:28.665 --> 00:13:32.415
either objects because
we are passing them on

00:13:33.764 --> 00:13:38.764
to people that we don't know
with who are our continuation

00:13:39.072 --> 00:13:41.281
but only in imagination.

00:13:41.281 --> 00:13:45.081
And, perhaps, passing
on knowledge which then

00:13:45.081 --> 00:13:49.414
becomes the basis of what
the evolutionary biologist

00:13:51.605 --> 00:13:55.547
Michael Thomas Seller has
called the wretched effect

00:13:55.547 --> 00:13:57.540
that is building up

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:00.457
on knowledge which is already there

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:04.048
so that it can be then

00:14:04.048 --> 00:14:07.793
be used for evermore complex systems.

00:14:07.793 --> 00:14:12.090
This is the basically the
ability in human culture

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.840
to continue and to
accumulate and to advance.

00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:23.108
So the possibility of
stepping in to moments of

00:14:24.285 --> 00:14:27.411
what is normally shared imagination

00:14:27.411 --> 00:14:31.126
explains, I think, the most
fundamental differences

00:14:31.126 --> 00:14:34.376
between our society and the society of,

00:14:35.944 --> 00:14:37.550
as I said, the chimpanzees.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.491
Thank you.

00:14:38.491 --> 00:14:41.658
(audience applauding)

00:14:47.223 --> 00:14:50.056
(peaceful music)
