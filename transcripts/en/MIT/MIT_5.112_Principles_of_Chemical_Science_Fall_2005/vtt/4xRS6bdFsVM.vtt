00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.598
Continuing our discussion of
acid-base theory,

00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:30.832
I have just drawn here on the
board for you the structure of a

00:00:30.832 --> 00:00:36.545
popular indicator molecule.
Indicator molecules are used

00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:40.727
for titrations.
And titrations will be of focus

00:00:40.727 --> 00:00:45.272
of today's lecture.
This is the indicator molecule,

00:00:45.272 --> 00:00:49.000
phenolphthalein.
It is easier to draw this

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
molecular structure than it is
to spell phenolphthalein,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.545
but you should know how to do
both of these things,

00:00:58.545 --> 00:01:06.061
or at least recognize them.
Now, how do indicator molecules

00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:09.991
work?
Well, during a titration,

00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:17.851
you are mixing chemicals in a
way that leads to a changing pH

00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:25.187
throughout the experiment.
And an indicator molecule like

00:01:25.187 --> 00:01:32.000
phenolphthalein is,
in fact, a Bronsted acid.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.592
And, if you inspect the
structure that I have drawn here

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:38.859
for phenolphthalein,
you should be able to begin to

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.974
understand just how it is that a
molecule like this can serve as

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:45.783
a Bronsted acid.
If I write out the formula,

00:01:45.783 --> 00:01:49.311
you will see that we have quite
a number of carbons and

00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:52.839
hydrogens in the molecule.
And we have oxygens as well.

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:56.497
Those are the three elements
present in a phenolphthalein

00:01:56.497 --> 00:02:00.875
molecule.
And two of the hydrogens in

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:07.476
this molecule possess Bronsted
acidity that makes them valuable

00:02:07.476 --> 00:02:13.439
for the function of this system
as an indicator molecule.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:19.828
And what happens is when you
have this in solution at low pH,

00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:23.342
it is in this form.
It is neutral.

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:29.625
And then, as you begin to raise
the pH, at some point a base

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:35.375
that has a lone pair of
electrons comes along and takes

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:41.444
one of these two protons in a
molecule, either this one or

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:45.589
this one.
Those two protons are

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.768
equivalent.
And what I am now going to draw

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:52.932
is a sequence of arrows
representing the electronic flow

00:02:52.932 --> 00:02:57.625
in the phenolphthalein molecule
that occurs when H plus

00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:03.000
is transferred over to the base
with its lone pair of electrons.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.362
So, I am starting these arrows
at pairs of electrons and I am

00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:11.311
showing the flow of how they
move.

00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:15.333
And this is a pretty
interesting rearrangement

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:19.355
because it is complicated.
It is an electronic

00:03:19.355 --> 00:03:23.376
rearrangement that is
transmitted through this

00:03:23.376 --> 00:03:28.828
molecule such that here in the
center, this four coordinate or

00:03:28.828 --> 00:03:34.101
sp three hybridized
carbon, which is bonded to this

00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:40.000
oxygen, has a pair of electrons
that migrates to it.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.385
And, if I draw now the product
of this reaction,

00:03:45.385 --> 00:03:51.000
what you should be able to see
quite clearly --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.210
And I am not always explicitly
drawing out the lone pairs of

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.068
electrons on each of the
electronegative oxygen atoms in

00:04:09.068 --> 00:04:12.512
the molecule,
but the sequence of double

00:04:12.512 --> 00:04:17.723
bonds and single bonds in the
molecule has been altered in a

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:23.199
profound manner because of the
base coming along and removing a

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:26.997
proton from one of these
peripheral oxygens,

00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:32.399
namely, that one here.
So, we have now a singly

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:37.800
negatively charged system.
And that charge is balanced,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.500
over here, by the base that has
the proton attached to it.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.600
That is the structure-function
relationship that is typical of

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.300
indicator molecules.
And indicator molecules can

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.000
either be naturally occurring,
as they are in some plants.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.915
Or, alternatively,
they can be molecules that are

00:05:06.915 --> 00:05:13.693
synthesized to respond to
factors like pH in a given way

00:05:13.693 --> 00:05:18.746
that might be desired.
And, in the case of

00:05:18.746 --> 00:05:24.538
phenolphthalein,
this change takes place between

00:05:24.538 --> 00:05:30.947
8.2 to 10.0 pH units.
And the color change associated

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:36.000
with this is colorless to pink.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.611
Looking at the structure of the
anionic form of the

00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:55.945
phenolphthalein molecule that
results from its deprotonation,

00:05:55.945 --> 00:06:00.063
what you can see is that this
sp three hybridized

00:06:00.063 --> 00:06:04.541
carbon atom at the center of the
molecule, which in the neutral

00:06:04.541 --> 00:06:08.803
form is acting as an insulator,
preventing the pi-systems of

00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:12.054
the three six-member rings from
communicating,

00:06:12.054 --> 00:06:15.738
is converted into a
three-coordinate sp two 

00:06:15.738 --> 00:06:20.000
hybridized carbon atom here at
the center, --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.680
and provides a conduit for a
communication between the

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.500
pi-systems of the three
six-membered substituted benzene

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.384
rings that are in this molecule.
And that change in electronic

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:36.742
structure is what leads to the
production of this pink

00:06:36.742 --> 00:06:40.606
Chromaphor in the anionic
deprotonated form of a

00:06:40.606 --> 00:06:44.964
phenolphthalein molecule that is
important at high pH.

00:06:44.964 --> 00:06:48.582
All you have to do,
in fact, is to change the

00:06:48.582 --> 00:06:53.515
substituents on this molecule in
order to get a response at a

00:06:53.515 --> 00:06:56.886
different pH value.
Bromothymol blue is an

00:06:56.886 --> 00:07:00.504
indicator with a structure
similar to that of

00:07:00.504 --> 00:07:04.368
phenolphthalein,
but with a sulfur here in place

00:07:04.368 --> 00:07:08.969
of this carbon.
And in bromothymol blue,

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:13.728
we also have some isopropyl and
bromine substituents on the

00:07:13.728 --> 00:07:16.682
aromatic rings.
And that modifies its

00:07:16.682 --> 00:07:21.358
properties such that it goes
from yellow to blue as the pH

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:24.558
rises above 6.0 to about a value
of 7.6.

00:07:24.558 --> 00:07:29.399
So, if you go to a textbook and
look in a table of indicator

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:34.076
molecules, you will be able to
select an indicator that is

00:07:34.076 --> 00:07:39.000
appropriate for a particular
type of titration.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.757
And just to give you a very
simple schematic of a classic

00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:50.000
type of titration,
I am going to show you here --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.690
-- the type of system that you
may need to think about in

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:06.110
connection with this next
problem set.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:13.278
And it is a system like this,
where we have a flask down here

00:08:13.278 --> 00:08:19.849
at the bottom that contains,
initially, some volume of a

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:22.000
weak acid.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.569
And that weak acid might be,
for example,

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:34.228
acetic acid,
as we talked about last time.

00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:36.727
And we will say,
for example,

00:08:36.727 --> 00:08:41.545
that this could be 0.1 molar CH
three COOH.

00:08:41.545 --> 00:08:45.740
That is acetic acid.
And the calculation that we

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:51.362
left off with at the end of last
hour is one that we will get to

00:08:51.362 --> 00:08:56.538
solving today that had to do
with what is the pH of a tenth

00:08:56.538 --> 00:09:01.000
molar acetic acid solution in
water?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.745
Or, in other words,
what is the pH of this solution

00:09:04.745 --> 00:09:09.241
down here containing the acetic
acid at the beginning of this

00:09:09.241 --> 00:09:12.237
titration that we are going to
carry out.

00:09:12.237 --> 00:09:14.859
We might have a weak acid down
here.

00:09:14.859 --> 00:09:17.856
We might also have our
indicator present,

00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:22.052
so that we will see a color
change when we pass through a

00:09:22.052 --> 00:09:27.032
particular pH.
And we are going to make the pH

00:09:27.032 --> 00:09:30.750
rise by putting into this
burette here,

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:36.717
which will allow us to control
a dropwise addition of a strong

00:09:36.717 --> 00:09:42.782
base solution that we are going
to add in and slowly neutralize

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:47.380
our acetic acid that is down
here at the bottom.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.391
So, this is strong base.
And, for example,

00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:55.500
that might be tenth molar
sodium hydroxide.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.000
So, there is a typical
titration.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.347
And, if you think about it,
because we are adding one

00:10:04.347 --> 00:10:07.859
solution to another,
we are going to have a

00:10:07.859 --> 00:10:12.876
constantly changing volume in
this bottom solution throughout

00:10:12.876 --> 00:10:16.555
the experiment.
And so ultimately what we are

00:10:16.555 --> 00:10:21.070
going to be interested in,
in our questions such as the

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:25.000
following, as the volume
increases --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.211
And we will give the volume,
for the purposes of today's

00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:42.656
lecture, the symbol the lower
case letter m -- As the volume

00:10:42.656 --> 00:10:44.583
increases, what happens to the
pH?

00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:47.795
We know that we are using a
strong base to neutralize an

00:10:47.795 --> 00:10:51.007
acid, so the pH is going to
start out low and somehow is

00:10:51.007 --> 00:10:53.226
going to rise.
But what if we wanted to

00:10:53.226 --> 00:10:56.905
predict the mathematical form of
the rise in pH as a function of

00:10:56.905 --> 00:11:00.000
this increasing volume of the
solution?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.115
Then we would have to have some
equations that would be useful

00:11:04.115 --> 00:11:08.027
for describing this physical
property as a function of this

00:11:08.027 --> 00:11:11.198
increasing volume.
This is what we often want to

00:11:11.198 --> 00:11:15.043
be able to do in chemistry.
We want to be able to describe

00:11:15.043 --> 00:11:18.956
properties that change either as
a function of time or as a

00:11:18.956 --> 00:11:21.924
function of some other variable,
here volume,

00:11:21.924 --> 00:11:24.892
in a titration.
And we want to be able to see

00:11:24.892 --> 00:11:28.873
if we can come up with a set of
equations that would predict

00:11:28.873 --> 00:11:34.000
that change as a function of
this variable that is changing.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.500
And, in order to do that,
here, I am going to first point

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.000
out that we can put together
some titration equations.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.899
And, ultimately,
we are going to want to

00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:05.000
generate a mathematical model
for this titration.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.826
And then, if you are
experimentalist,

00:12:07.826 --> 00:12:12.223
you want to go ahead and take
that mathematical model and

00:12:12.223 --> 00:12:15.206
compare it to actual
experimental data.

00:12:15.206 --> 00:12:18.582
But let's work on getting a
model generated,

00:12:18.582 --> 00:12:21.173
here.
First we are going to have a

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:27.719
set of chemical equations.
These correspond to the acid

00:12:27.719 --> 00:12:35.690
HA, which is acetic acid in our
example, in water reacting to

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:43.527
give some concentration of H
three O plus plus the

00:12:43.527 --> 00:12:49.239
anion A minus,
which is acetate ion,

00:12:49.239 --> 00:12:55.350
in this particular case.
We have a strong base,

00:12:55.350 --> 00:13:01.769
which is sodium hydroxide.
And when you put sodium

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:05.384
hydroxide in water,
because it is a strong base,

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:09.461
it ionizes completely.
And I am signifying that with a

00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:13.923
single forward arrow rather than
with an equilibrium arrow.

00:13:13.923 --> 00:13:18.230
This going into water is going
to be Na plus and

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.538
hydroxide, OH minus.
Now, at certain points in a

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:25.384
titration curve,
you would not need to

00:13:25.384 --> 00:13:30.000
necessarily go much further than
this in order to have enough

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.846
information to start solving for
the pH at a particular value of

00:13:34.846 --> 00:13:40.096
a volume m.
But at some points along that

00:13:40.096 --> 00:13:45.113
titration curve,
that is not enough information.

00:13:45.113 --> 00:13:50.879
And that is because water
itself can sometimes get into

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:54.615
the equation.
Here is an interesting

00:13:54.615 --> 00:14:01.234
equation, which is H two O plus
H two O going to H three O plus

00:14:01.234 --> 00:14:07.000
plus O minus.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.010
That is a conceivable reaction
that could be occurring even in

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:17.021
pure water, but the value of the
equilibrium constant for that

00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:21.046
reaction is very small.
And I will draw that as an

00:14:21.046 --> 00:14:26.057
equilibrium to distinguish it
from the irreversible ionization

00:14:26.057 --> 00:14:30.000
of sodium hydroxide in aqueous
solution.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.055
I have a pair of equilibria
that I have written.

00:14:34.055 --> 00:14:38.543
I have one forward reaction.
And I want to point out,

00:14:38.543 --> 00:14:43.893
too, that this third equation I
have written here has a special

00:14:43.893 --> 00:14:47.000
name, which is autoprotolysis.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.852
I will tell you more about the
equilibrium constant associated

00:14:55.852 --> 00:14:59.703
with autoprotolysis in a moment.
But because this equilibrium

00:14:59.703 --> 00:15:02.685
constant is very small,
meaning that there is very

00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:06.518
little H three O plus
and OH minus present in

00:15:06.518 --> 00:15:10.351
pure water, because of that pure
water itself is not a very good

00:15:10.351 --> 00:15:12.785
electrolyte.
Meaning pure water itself is

00:15:12.785 --> 00:15:15.949
not a very good conductor of
electricity, because the

00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:19.539
autoprotolysis reaction lies
mostly over here to the left in

00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:23.248
pure water.
But at certain points along a

00:15:23.248 --> 00:15:26.893
titration curve,
such as the one we are going to

00:15:26.893 --> 00:15:31.391
want to develop on this panel
here, we are going to need to

00:15:31.391 --> 00:15:36.200
include autoprotolysis in order
to get the right answer because

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.000
it is there, it can occur.
Let's continue.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.323
Another type of equation that
we can use to put this into some

00:16:08.323 --> 00:16:14.440
kind of a mathematical footing
is the balance of charge in a

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:20.764
solution like the one that we
are talking about in that beaker

00:16:20.764 --> 00:16:25.740
to which we are adding sodium
hydroxide solution.

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:31.235
And the charge balance
consideration tells us that the

00:16:31.235 --> 00:16:37.663
concentration of hydronium ion
plus the concentration of sodium

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:43.365
ion must be equal to the
concentration of hydroxide plus

00:16:43.365 --> 00:16:50.000
the concentration of acetate
ion, A minus.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.546
Because what I have done here
in the charge balance

00:16:53.546 --> 00:16:57.730
consideration is I have said
okay, what are all the possible

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:01.682
charged species in solution?
I can make a list of them.

00:17:01.682 --> 00:17:05.113
It is those four things.
And I know that the number of

00:17:05.113 --> 00:17:08.802
positive charges must equal the
number of negative charges

00:17:08.802 --> 00:17:12.362
because this is overall a
neutral beaker in which we are

00:17:12.362 --> 00:17:15.275
putting things.
But everything that you put in

00:17:15.275 --> 00:17:18.381
is charge neutral,
so the positives have to equal

00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:22.777
the negatives.
That is a very nice limiting

00:17:22.777 --> 00:17:27.737
equation that helps us
understand how the different

00:17:27.737 --> 00:17:33.986
competing chemical reactions and
equilibria will all settle down

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:39.045
and arrive at the physical
result, which will be our

00:17:39.045 --> 00:17:43.112
observable.
And then, in addition to that,

00:17:43.112 --> 00:17:46.683
we have a mass balance
consideration.

00:17:46.683 --> 00:17:50.453
And in this mass balance
consideration,

00:17:50.453 --> 00:17:57.000
we will be able to write that
our HA initial value --

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.591
-- that is square brackets,
once again, denoting

00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:06.086
concentration -- will be,
at any point in time,

00:18:06.086 --> 00:18:11.752
equal to the actual value of HA
plus the concentration of A

00:18:11.752 --> 00:18:15.856
minus.
And that just says that when

00:18:15.856 --> 00:18:20.350
you have acetic acid and you put
it into water,

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:25.235
it ionizes partly to hydronium
ion and acetate ion.

00:18:25.235 --> 00:18:31.000
And that which does not ionize
is unionized HA.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.990
And so, the ionized A minus
concentration plus the

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:43.087
unionized HA concentration is
equal to the sum total of the

00:18:43.087 --> 00:18:47.186
acetic acid that is present in
solution.

00:18:47.186 --> 00:18:51.705
And, similarly,
we have another mass balance

00:18:51.705 --> 00:18:57.906
equation, which is just that the
sodium hydroxide initial is

00:18:57.906 --> 00:19:03.582
equal to our sodium ion
concentration because all of it

00:19:03.582 --> 00:19:09.676
is ionized.
That is a little simpler than

00:19:09.676 --> 00:19:13.985
the situation with the acetic
acid.

00:19:13.985 --> 00:19:20.577
And then, in addition to those
equations, we have our

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:24.000
equilibrium equations.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.322
And we are going to have two of
these because there are two

00:19:42.322 --> 00:19:47.829
equilibria that I wrote over
there under titration equations.

00:19:47.829 --> 00:19:53.243
The first of these is going to
have the equilibrium constant

00:19:53.243 --> 00:19:58.658
Ka, and that is going to be H
three O plus times A

00:19:58.658 --> 00:20:02.787
minus,
which is acetate in the case of

00:20:02.787 --> 00:20:09.056
acetic acid, all over HA.
That is the expression for the

00:20:09.056 --> 00:20:14.558
equilibrium of acetic acid
ionization in dilute aqueous

00:20:14.558 --> 00:20:18.633
solution.
And I will give you a value for

00:20:18.633 --> 00:20:23.218
this in a moment.
I won't write it right here.

00:20:23.218 --> 00:20:28.822
Well, why don't I just do that.
It is 1.8x10^-5 for this

00:20:28.822 --> 00:20:35.372
specific example of acetic acid.
And then, if you were working

00:20:35.372 --> 00:20:39.788
with some other weak acid,
you would be able to go to a

00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:44.778
table and look up the Ka value
for it, if it has been measured

00:20:44.778 --> 00:20:48.704
and reported and tabulated.
And then, we have Kw.

00:20:48.704 --> 00:20:52.385
And this is the equilibrium
expression for the

00:20:52.385 --> 00:20:56.556
autoprotolysis reaction that I
mentioned over there,

00:20:56.556 --> 00:21:00.728
the other equilibrium,
which is H three O plus times

00:21:00.728 --> 00:21:06.414
OH minus.
And that is equal to 1x10^-14,

00:21:06.414 --> 00:21:09.312
so a very small equilibrium
constant.

00:21:09.312 --> 00:21:13.176
And some of you may be
wondering why water is not

00:21:13.176 --> 00:21:17.764
appearing in an expression like
this one or like this one.

00:21:17.764 --> 00:21:22.513
And the reason for this is that
in the expressions that I am

00:21:22.513 --> 00:21:26.055
deriving here,
we are using concentrations in

00:21:26.055 --> 00:21:30.000
place of activities for these
species.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
In the derivation of the
equilibrium constants,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.978
the activity of pure water at
very high concentration is

00:21:40.978 --> 00:21:46.304
approximated as one.
And so, this is simplified as

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:50.108
shown here.
And having put all these

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:55.543
equations together,
what we are going to want to do

00:21:55.543 --> 00:22:01.551
is take the following approach.
We are looking at the

00:22:01.551 --> 00:22:04.359
expression for
electro-neutrality here,

00:22:04.359 --> 00:22:08.793
the equal number of positively
and negatively charged species

00:22:08.793 --> 00:22:11.305
in solution.
And I want to get this

00:22:11.305 --> 00:22:15.960
expression rewritten in terms of
things that I know at any point

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.024
along the titration curve,
with the exception of the one

00:22:20.024 --> 00:22:22.463
thing that I want to know,
the pH.

00:22:22.463 --> 00:22:26.748
And the pH we can calculate
easily if we know the H three O

00:22:26.748 --> 00:22:32.396
plus concentration.
So, I am going to be seeking to

00:22:32.396 --> 00:22:35.410
get Na plus,
OH minus,

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.661
and A minus rewritten
in terms of H three O plus

00:22:39.661 --> 00:22:44.067
and constants using
the equations that I have up

00:22:44.067 --> 00:22:46.000
here on the board.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.596
First, let's attempt to do that
for A minus using this

00:23:05.596 --> 00:23:10.000
Ka expression.
And I am going to rearrange it.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.632
And it is going to be equal to
Ka times HA divided by H three O

00:23:27.632 --> 00:23:32.662
plus.
But I still have a problem with

00:23:32.662 --> 00:23:37.470
this expression for A minus
because I am going to

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.108
need to replace HA with
something that will allow me to

00:23:42.108 --> 00:23:47.174
get everything in terms of just
H three O plus and

00:23:47.174 --> 00:23:50.609
constants.
And so, if I look over here at

00:23:50.609 --> 00:23:55.418
the mass balance equation,
I can use this one and replace

00:23:55.418 --> 00:24:01.000
HA with HA initial minus 
A minus.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.246
Now I have A minus
written in terms of an initial

00:24:47.246 --> 00:24:49.565
concentration of HA itself and
constants.

00:24:49.565 --> 00:24:52.000
I need to rearrange this a
little bit.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:00.395
I am going to multiply through
by H three O plus so

00:25:00.395 --> 00:25:08.650
that I can write A minus times H
three O plus is equal to Ka

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:16.905
times HA initial minus Ka times
A minus.

00:25:16.905 --> 00:25:24.041
And hopefully I have done that

00:25:24.041 --> 00:25:30.281
right.
And, if so, I will be able to

00:25:30.281 --> 00:25:39.583
say that A minus is going to be
equal to Ka times HA initial all

00:25:39.583 --> 00:25:45.932
over H three O plus.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.179
Does that look good?
Plus Ka, thank you.

00:26:03.179 --> 00:26:08.226
H3O+ plus Ka.

00:26:08.226 --> 00:26:15.000
And let's bring
that down here.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.500
Because now,
I would like to go ahead and

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:32.000
make this substitution for the
charge.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.146
We have our A minus.
The other ones are a little

00:26:38.146 --> 00:26:41.945
easier.
We now have this equation H

00:26:41.945 --> 00:26:48.203
three O plus.
And we were going to replace Na

00:26:48.203 --> 00:26:53.343
plus by NaOH initial.

00:26:53.343 --> 00:27:00.160
And we are going to recognize
that we can use the equation for

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:06.306
autoprotolysis to replace
hydroxide with Kw divided by H

00:27:06.306 --> 00:27:14.391
three O plus.
And then now we have the A

00:27:14.391 --> 00:27:21.826
minus being replaced
by Ka HA initial all over H

00:27:21.826 --> 00:27:29.000
three O plus plus Ka.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.013
And at this point,
you have actually done a really

00:27:34.013 --> 00:27:39.844
nice thing, because you have
generated a general titration

00:27:39.844 --> 00:27:45.574
equation for the titration of
interest in this particular

00:27:45.574 --> 00:27:49.052
case.
You can see that at any point

00:27:49.052 --> 00:27:54.884
along that curve for a given
volume m, we can now stop and

00:27:54.884 --> 00:28:00.000
walk along in one milliliter
increments.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.743
And, in each spot along that
curve, we could go ahead and

00:28:03.743 --> 00:28:07.286
solve this equation to get the
value of H three O plus.

00:28:07.286 --> 00:28:09.959
And then we would just have to

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:13.770
take the negative log of that,
and we would have the pH at

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.644
that position.
And we are interested if this

00:28:16.644 --> 00:28:19.786
type of a model for the
mathematical form of the

00:28:19.786 --> 00:28:23.529
titration curve bears any
resemblance to what one sees in

00:28:23.529 --> 00:28:27.414
reality.
And, if so, one could then be,

00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:31.841
at least for the time being,
until your theory no longer

00:28:31.841 --> 00:28:36.187
fits, satisfied that you have
accounted for the various

00:28:36.187 --> 00:28:41.177
equilibria that could be present
in a system such as the one we

00:28:41.177 --> 00:28:44.879
are describing here.
This happens to be a cubic

00:28:44.879 --> 00:28:48.420
equation, and it has,
therefore, three roots.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:53.490
And when we solve it at each of
these points along the titration

00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:57.917
equation, because of the
physically realistic quantities

00:28:57.917 --> 00:29:00.895
that we are going to be
interested in,

00:29:00.895 --> 00:29:05.000
only one of the roots is
positive.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.192
We are talking about H three O
plus concentration.

00:29:09.192 --> 00:29:11.735
It cannot be a negative
concentration.

00:29:11.735 --> 00:29:15.859
The positive root is the one we
want, and then we can convert

00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:19.226
that to pH and can see what kind
of result we get.

00:29:19.226 --> 00:29:22.938
And so, I will show you how we
can do that using a tool

00:29:22.938 --> 00:29:25.000
available on Athena.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.555
First of all,
let me tell you that for the

00:30:07.555 --> 00:30:13.111
purposes of doing this,
I am going to replace these

00:30:13.111 --> 00:30:17.777
various quantities by some
simpler symbols,

00:30:17.777 --> 00:30:21.222
here.
I am going to go x plus a,

00:30:21.222 --> 00:30:27.000
a is our NaOH initial,
is equal to (b over x) plus (c

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:35.000
times d) over (x plus d).

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.035
So, I am going to use those
simpler symbols for this

00:30:38.035 --> 00:30:40.297
equation.
I could rearrange it and show

00:30:40.297 --> 00:30:43.630
you how it is a cubic equation,
you set it equal to zero,

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:46.071
and then you solve,
and you get the roots.

00:30:46.071 --> 00:30:49.166
Just like a quadratic equation
but with another term.

00:30:49.166 --> 00:30:52.500
And, instead of doing that,
we are just going to leave it

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.940
in this form,
which is simpler to look at.

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:56.904
And we are just going to use
that.

00:30:56.904 --> 00:31:00.000
And so, let's go ahead and
define A.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.761
That is the initial
concentration of sodium

00:31:03.761 --> 00:31:06.716
hydroxide.
We are going to go 0.1.

00:31:06.716 --> 00:31:12.358
And remember I need to get this
in terms of the quantity m here,

00:31:12.358 --> 00:31:16.746
which is the volume.
And so, I am going to take m,

00:31:16.746 --> 00:31:20.686
minus 20 over m.
And the reason I am doing is

00:31:20.686 --> 00:31:26.328
this is I am saying that we have
an 0.1 molar solution of sodium

00:31:26.328 --> 00:31:32.257
hydroxide that we are adding.
But there is a dilution factor

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:36.546
that you have to take care of.
So, at every value m we are

00:31:36.546 --> 00:31:41.060
saying that we are starting with
a volume of 20 in the acetic

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:44.597
acid flask at the bottom there
at the beginning.

00:31:44.597 --> 00:31:48.584
And then we are starting to add
volume units of sodium

00:31:48.584 --> 00:31:50.691
hydroxide.
And so the volume,

00:31:50.691 --> 00:31:53.927
m, is increasing.
That is how I take care of

00:31:53.927 --> 00:31:57.087
that, there.
And then our value of b is Kw,

00:31:57.087 --> 00:32:01.000
so that is 1 E minus 14.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.394
That is for autoprotolysis.
And then we have c,

00:32:05.394 --> 00:32:09.980
that is our initial
concentration of acetic acid.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:14.184
And we happen to have a
dilution factor here,

00:32:14.184 --> 00:32:18.388
too, but it is simpler,
just 20 divided by m.

00:32:18.388 --> 00:32:23.070
And there is that.
And then d, what did I say that

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.414
d was?
d is our equilibrium constant

00:32:26.414 --> 00:32:31.000
for HA, 1.8 E minus 5.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.805
There is our acidity constant
for acetic acids.

00:32:35.805 --> 00:32:40.716
Now I have the four things in
there that I need,

00:32:40.716 --> 00:32:46.880
and those are four things that
I know because of the initial

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.686
conditions that I am defining
for this problem.

00:32:51.686 --> 00:32:57.955
And then I am going to define
my equation as being equal to x

00:32:57.955 --> 00:33:03.910
plus a is equal to (b over x)
plus (c times d) all over (x

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:07.696
plus d).
There is my equation.

00:33:07.696 --> 00:33:11.090
And this nice calculator,
all I have to do,

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:14.565
in principle,
is tell it what the value of m

00:33:14.565 --> 00:33:17.151
is.
And then it is going to solve

00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:21.111
that cubic equation,
give me back the three roots.

00:33:21.111 --> 00:33:25.717
I take the positive one and I
take the negative log of it,

00:33:25.717 --> 00:33:30.000
and then I know the pH at that
value of m.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.112
I can develop a whole titration
curve based on the equations

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:38.225
that we have been discussing.
And so let's choose a value of

00:33:38.225 --> 00:33:41.641
m here to start with,
and I am going to choose 30.

00:33:41.641 --> 00:33:45.127
We are starting at 20.
At the very beginning of the

00:33:45.127 --> 00:33:48.752
titration, we are at 20.
Let's see what happens at 30

00:33:48.752 --> 00:33:52.237
given the particular value of m.
Here is what I do.

00:33:52.237 --> 00:33:54.608
There may be other ways to do
this.

00:33:54.608 --> 00:33:59.000
I am defining this thing called
the solution set.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.782
Because the solving of that
equation is going to give us

00:34:03.782 --> 00:34:07.434
three values.
And then I want to be able to

00:34:07.434 --> 00:34:12.130
pick the one that I want.
We would use sol-set is equal

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:16.826
to, we are going to solve that
equation, and we want x,

00:34:16.826 --> 00:34:21.260
which is our H three O plus
concentration.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.347
And sometimes it chokes.
Let's see what happens.

00:34:25.347 --> 00:34:31.301
Sometimes it is a little slow.
But it takes a lot longer if

00:34:31.301 --> 00:34:35.000
you actually try to work it all
out by hand.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.096
I have a picture of an image of
this that I grabbed.

00:34:44.096 --> 00:34:46.827
I can show you if this fails on
me.

00:34:46.827 --> 00:34:49.156
Don't fail on me.
There we go.

00:34:49.156 --> 00:34:54.056
You can see it got the answer.
And so here is a positive root,

00:34:54.056 --> 00:34:59.036
and then there are two negative
roots to this cubic equation in

00:34:59.036 --> 00:35:03.050
x.
And I want to find out the pH.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:07.728
When we are up to 30 volume
units, m equals 30.

00:35:07.728 --> 00:35:13.932
And so, I will define p here as
equal to the negative log base

00:35:13.932 --> 00:35:18.915
10 of the first of the answers
in my solution set,

00:35:18.915 --> 00:35:23.186
sol-set one,
which is the positive x value.

00:35:23.186 --> 00:35:27.966
And, bingo, there is the pH,
4.745 whatever dot,

00:35:27.966 --> 00:35:32.786
dot, dot.
That is now the pH at a volume

00:35:32.786 --> 00:35:36.037
of 30.
Now, you figure I am starting

00:35:36.037 --> 00:35:40.216
with 20 volume units of 0.1
molar acetic acid.

00:35:40.216 --> 00:35:43.931
And by the time m equals 30
volume units,

00:35:43.931 --> 00:35:49.040
that means I have added ten
volume units of strong base,

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.662
enough to quench half of my
acetic acid.

00:35:52.662 --> 00:35:57.027
And what if I had just only
quenched none of it?

00:35:57.027 --> 00:36:02.029
I can change m now.
Once you have this in here,

00:36:02.029 --> 00:36:04.810
you don't have to retype these
things.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:07.667
I can go back here and say let
m be 20.

00:36:07.667 --> 00:36:11.200
And, if I do that,
now I am actually at the zero

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.831
point, before I add any strong
base.

00:36:13.831 --> 00:36:16.011
And there is the pH now,
2.87.

00:36:16.011 --> 00:36:20.371
The answer to the expression
that we had at the very end of

00:36:20.371 --> 00:36:24.731
class last time that was going
to tell us what is the pH of

00:36:24.731 --> 00:36:28.038
tenth molar acetic acid,
there is the answer,

00:36:28.038 --> 00:36:33.000
2.87, because that is what we
have when we start.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.129
Now you can see that you could
just go through and use that to

00:36:40.129 --> 00:36:46.558
get the pH at any value of m
along this titration curve.

00:36:46.558 --> 00:36:52.519
And when you do that,
let's show you what the result

00:36:52.519 --> 00:36:57.428
is, now what you see here is a
set of data.

00:36:57.428 --> 00:37:02.166
I start at 20.
And I'm going up in single

00:37:02.166 --> 00:37:04.833
volume units,
21, 22, 23, and 24,

00:37:04.833 --> 00:37:09.583
I am showing what the pH is at
each of those choices of m.

00:37:09.583 --> 00:37:13.000
And I have gone all the way
from 20 to 60.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
And you take that data set --

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:51.000
And then you can take a file,
like the one I just showed you,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:00.000
which just had values of m and
corresponding values of pH.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.894
And you can go ahead and just
plot that thing.

00:38:02.894 --> 00:38:05.789
And, when you do that,
you get the form of the

00:38:05.789 --> 00:38:09.070
titration curve here,
which is the classic form of a

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.929
titration curve for titrating a
weak acid with a strong base.

00:38:12.929 --> 00:38:15.824
And you see that here,
m was 20, and we let it

00:38:15.824 --> 00:38:18.269
increment through all the way up
to 60.

00:38:18.269 --> 00:38:21.807
And what you see initially,
and you are going to need to

00:38:21.807 --> 00:38:25.538
study this one and the other
cases of titration curves that

00:38:25.538 --> 00:38:29.204
are in that chapter of your
book, is how the little subtle

00:38:29.204 --> 00:38:33.000
features differ from one case to
another.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.159
They do differ.
A much simpler titration curve

00:38:36.159 --> 00:38:40.372
than this one is obtained if you
titrate a strong acid with a

00:38:40.372 --> 00:38:43.110
strong base.
This is titration of a weak

00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:46.691
acid with a strong base.
And you see that initially,

00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:50.904
we have that 2.87 initial pH
value, that it kind of shoots up

00:38:50.904 --> 00:38:54.555
quickly here at the beginning.
There is a steep rise,

00:38:54.555 --> 00:38:57.434
initially.
And then it kind of levels off.

00:38:57.434 --> 00:39:01.014
And in this region here,
the pH is not changing very

00:39:01.014 --> 00:39:06.000
rapidly at all as you are adding
more sodium hydroxide.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.654
Until you get out here,
and the pH just shoots up.

00:39:09.654 --> 00:39:13.830
And you will notice that it is
around where we get to 40.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:18.081
Because we started with 20 mLs
of tenth molar acetic acid.

00:39:18.081 --> 00:39:22.257
And, when we get out to m
equals 40, we have added 20 mLs

00:39:22.257 --> 00:39:26.508
of tenth molar sodium hydroxide.
At that point the pH just

00:39:26.508 --> 00:39:29.945
shoots up.
And then over here it turns

00:39:29.945 --> 00:39:33.261
over and just goes kind of
slowly for a minute.

00:39:33.261 --> 00:39:37.225
And it just approaches an
asymptotic limiting value over

00:39:37.225 --> 00:39:39.891
here on the high pH side of the
scale.

00:39:39.891 --> 00:39:44.216
One thing you will notice here
is that at this point where we

00:39:44.216 --> 00:39:48.540
have added the same number of
equivalence of sodium hydroxide

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:52.504
molecules as we had acetic acid
molecules to start with,

00:39:52.504 --> 00:39:56.540
this occurs over here at
greater than 8.0 pH units rather

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.000
than at the neutral value of
7.0.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.953
And I would like you to think
about why that might be.

00:40:03.953 --> 00:40:08.502
And that will be something that
will be covered in recitation,

00:40:08.502 --> 00:40:12.082
but it is important.
If we had derived here today

00:40:12.082 --> 00:40:16.707
the expression for the titration
of a strong acid with a strong

00:40:16.707 --> 00:40:19.765
base, then at 40 we would be
right at 7.0,

00:40:19.765 --> 00:40:23.494
but when we were using this
weak acid, acetic acid,

00:40:23.494 --> 00:40:27.000
it comes up here over 8.0 pH
units.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.358
This point where we have added
as many strong base molecules as

00:40:31.358 --> 00:40:33.888
we started with,
weak acid molecules,

00:40:33.888 --> 00:40:38.036
is called the equivalence or
the stoichiometric point in the

00:40:38.036 --> 00:40:40.566
titration.
Moreover, where would your

00:40:40.566 --> 00:40:43.800
indicator molecule change color?
At what point,

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.979
at what value of m,
for example?

00:40:45.979 --> 00:40:49.283
It would be close to there.
It would be because,

00:40:49.283 --> 00:40:53.360
in the case of phenolphthalein,
it changes between right in

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.680
here.
It might change right around

00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:00.071
maybe 41 or so.
m equals 41 might be where the

00:41:00.071 --> 00:41:04.075
color change from colorless to
pink occurs, for the reasons

00:41:04.075 --> 00:41:07.044
that we have discussed.
And then right here,

00:41:07.044 --> 00:41:11.187
it turns out at this value of m
equals 30, the pH is equal to

00:41:11.187 --> 00:41:14.915
the pKa of acetic acid.
And that is a relationship that

00:41:14.915 --> 00:41:19.126
I would like you to think about.
And it is a relationship that

00:41:19.126 --> 00:41:22.648
comes into play very strongly
when we talk about the

00:41:22.648 --> 00:41:25.893
preparation of buffer solutions
according to the

00:41:25.893 --> 00:41:30.113
Henderson-Hasselbach equation.
At m equals 30,

00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:34.197
the pH value of the titration
is the pKa of acetic acid,

00:41:34.197 --> 00:41:37.018
which is right here at about
4.7 or so.

00:41:37.018 --> 00:41:41.250
We did that one a moment ago.
We found out what that value

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.626
was.
And, in plus or minus 1.0 pH

00:41:43.626 --> 00:41:46.373
units of that,
we have the part of the

00:41:46.373 --> 00:41:50.160
titration curve that is called
the buffering region.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.278
In here we have generated a
buffer in situ.

00:41:53.278 --> 00:41:57.658
And buffers help the pH not to
change too much when acids or

00:41:57.658 --> 00:42:02.627
bases are added in solution.
That is what buffers do.

00:42:02.627 --> 00:42:06.694
They try to help you keep in a
constant pH range because lots

00:42:06.694 --> 00:42:10.355
of things are dependent upon a
particular pH for proper

00:42:10.355 --> 00:42:12.864
functioning.
And you know that this is

00:42:12.864 --> 00:42:16.525
important in the world's oceans,
it is important in our

00:42:16.525 --> 00:42:19.644
environment, and it is important
in our bodies.

00:42:19.644 --> 00:42:23.440
So, the pH considerations for
aqueous solutions are quite

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.901
important.
And I hope that today I have

00:42:26.901 --> 00:42:31.043
been able to give you a nice way
of thinking about some of the

00:42:31.043 --> 00:42:33.691
math that goes behind a
titration curve.

00:42:33.691 --> 00:42:35.157
Have a nice Halloween.
