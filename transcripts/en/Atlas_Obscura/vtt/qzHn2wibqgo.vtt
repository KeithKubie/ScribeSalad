00:00:01.596 --> 00:00:04.046
- A coelacanth is a very primitive fish.

00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:06.949
Some people refer to it
as a "living fossil."

00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:09.526
There are two species
that exist in the wild.

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:13.787
Sometimes they're caught
by long-line fishermen.

00:00:13.787 --> 00:00:15.830
It had been known from fossils at least

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.830
a hundred years before they
found a living specimen.

00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:23.672
My name is Kevin Swagel,

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:26.888
I am an Assistant Collections Manager

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:29.428
in the Fish Division at the Field Museum.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.946
And today we're going to
be unboxing the coelacanth.

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:35.848
We have got three coelacanths
in our collection.

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:38.855
We obtained them in the
'60s, '70s, and '80s

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:40.724
from the Shedd Aquarium.

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:45.183
When we received 'em, they
were put in formaldehyde.

00:00:45.183 --> 00:00:47.029
And formaldehyde is a fixative,

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:51.023
it actually toughens the
tissues, hardens the tissues.

00:00:51.023 --> 00:00:54.134
Then once the formaldehyde does its thing

00:00:54.134 --> 00:00:56.708
and the specimen is real tough,

00:00:56.708 --> 00:01:00.783
we wash out the formaldehyde
with water baths

00:01:00.783 --> 00:01:03.674
and transfer it to 70% ethanol.

00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:06.341
That's what we keep our fish in.

00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:13.450
Coelacanths are a very oily fish.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.422
Their flesh is nasty,
it's filled with urea,

00:01:16.422 --> 00:01:18.672
and oil and wax and esters,

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.275
so people do not eat them.

00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:23.643
If we look at the top of the
tank where they're stored,

00:01:23.643 --> 00:01:28.113
there's actually an oily
film on top of the alcohol.

00:01:28.113 --> 00:01:31.701
That oil is coelacanth oil
and it actually smells,

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:34.325
and when I go home after
handling coelacanths

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:37.755
I usually get a train seat, because people

00:01:37.755 --> 00:01:39.922
don't want to sit near me.

00:01:40.954 --> 00:01:42.742
So, yeah, they do smell a little bit,

00:01:42.742 --> 00:01:44.659
but you get used to it.

00:01:47.595 --> 00:01:51.217
Sometimes fish populations
may be reduced over time

00:01:51.217 --> 00:01:55.306
through pollution or
draining of rivers or lakes,

00:01:55.306 --> 00:01:59.852
but our collection here
is like a time capsule.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:03.532
We know what fish were living
in those rivers or lakes

00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:06.052
before they were polluted or drained.

00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:09.302
The detail in the specimens is amazing.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.960
Under a microscope you
can see all the little

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.960
fin connections and vertebrae
connections and scale counts.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.831
Everything is preserved so beautifully.

00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:22.700
A specimen can be 200 years old and

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.732
you have this beautiful preservation.

00:02:24.732 --> 00:02:26.299
You can still do all the measurements

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.122
and photographs and everything

00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:30.622
of that specimen for research.

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:34.334
It's kind of like The
Shape of Water moment.

00:02:34.334 --> 00:02:35.599
(group laughs)

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.770
I watched it last night,
by the way, I rented it.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:38.612
So, it's cool.

00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:41.945
- [Voice Offscreen] I haven't seen it yet.
