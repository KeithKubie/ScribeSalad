Hey it's me Destin. This week on Smarter Every Day I'm gonna trick you into learning science using a gun

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.040
and a high speed camera. You remember the old pistols underwater video?

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.050
Well this week I'm gonna do it with a better high speed camera, and a bigger gun.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.080
[music]
[power tools]

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.230
OK here's the setup. This is my dad's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.310
AK-47. First things first. The weapon is clear.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.340
So, on the back of this thing there's a little tab that the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.400
stock for the weapon, you can see it's captured right here, so all I've done

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.430
is I've created the reciprocal of that out of metal. So we have that

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.470
on this side, and on the other side we capture it with a J-bolt.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:08.510
So you can see, clicked in position.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.530
And here, captured with a J-bolt.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.560
If you don't know your way around an AK-47 it's pretty simple. You just take the top cover off,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.580
take this spring out, and then you can pull the bolt back. And when you pull the bolt back

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.610
which is located right here you see this large piston. Now this piston is

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.670
what operates the mechanism that re-chambers the next round. It's pretty simple the way these things

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.680
work. As a bullet travels down the barrel, it passes

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.700
a port right here, and this port allows gases to flow into a cylinder

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.730
which drives this piston back, which moves the bolt and the

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.770
bolt re-chambers another round out of the magazine. So here's the question. As the gas flows

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.800
into the cylinder and begins pushing down this piston, what

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.830
happens to all this water? My hypothesis is that it's going to slow the bolt down

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.870
but we're gonna use the high speed footage to determine if this is correct. We have a

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.890
little bolt cover here and we've painted the end of it white so that we can measure the velocity of it in

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.910
a high speed video. First shot, air. As you can see here

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.920
we're firing directly into this dirt burm.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.930
3..2..1.. [gunshot]

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.970
[several gunshots]

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.000
[slowed down gunshot]

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.100
Alright, time for water.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.130
[music]

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.290
3..2..1.. [gunshot]

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.320
[laughs]

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.360
That's a lot more water than last time.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.380
[music]

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.650
OK we're gonna see if it still works. See if I owe dad another weapon.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.680
[gunshot] Still works. Alright so what's the answer?

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.710
Does the bolt come back faster when the gun is in the air, or when the entire

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.730
thing is under water? Before I show you the answer I need to apologise to you. If you look back at the pistols

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.740
underwater video you can see that I just blew out the back side of the aquarium but the

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.780
sides stayed intact. On this one I used tempered glass instead of

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.800
normal plate glass. On tempered glass if you just break the edge the entire pane will shatter

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.810
so obviously I messed up the experiment. I apologise for that. So here you go.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.840
Look at the difference between air and water. Enjoy.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.860
[music]

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.930
So I've got two theories about why water is faster.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.940
Well if you think about it, if you have a round in the chamber you have a big column of water in front of it.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.980
So you have to accelerate all of that mass instead of just the mass of the bullet.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.020
That makes sense because you can look here and see that the primer's blown out, indicating

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.050
that there's higher chamber pressure when we do that. That means that there's more force

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.060
pushing on this piston. Also water is incompressible whereas air is compressible.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.110
That means that the pressure information gets to the piston faster. Alright

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.130
well I hope you enjoyed that. My intent was to make something that you not only learn from that you enjoyed

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.140
and earn your subscription, but unfortunately I kind of goofed up the aquarium thing so maybe I can earn your subscription

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.190
on part 2 of this video. If you want to see that, just click where I'm at now or click the outtakes

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.220
and you can check it out. Don't try this. I've got a little bit more experience than you might think. Anyway,

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.260
I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.300
[music]

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.340
(Destin) I think now is a good time to discuss the terms of our agreement.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.370
- You replace the gun if it harms it in any way.
[laughs]

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.370
- Now wait, this doesn't sound like a discussion, it sounds like a mandate. [laugh]

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.420
3..2..1.. [click].. [laugh]

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.430
Oh it was a bad round.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.530
- Yeah your tarp idea was terrible. [laugh]
Completely in the wrong spot.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.560
(Destin) The tarp, to catch all the glass.
[vacuum cleaner] It's a lot more fun if you pretend you're an elephant,

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.580
picking up peanuts. Now you may have noticed there was a bubble

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.610
of air that came out here through these ports. We'll talk about that in part 2 of the video.
