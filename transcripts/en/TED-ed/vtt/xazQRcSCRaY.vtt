00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:09.486
What do an ancient Greek philosopher

00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:11.895
and a 19th century Quaker

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:17.140
have in common 
with Nobel Prize-winning scientists?

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.135
Although they are separated 
over 2,400 years of history,

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:25.134
each of them contributed 
to answering the eternal question:

00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:27.059
what is stuff made of?

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:31.224
It was around 440 BCE 
that Democritus first proposed

00:00:31.224 --> 00:00:35.424
that everything in the world 
was made up of tiny particles

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:37.733
surrounded by empty space.

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:41.547
And he even speculated 
that they vary in size and shape

00:00:41.547 --> 00:00:44.320
depending on the substance they compose.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.701
He called these particles "atomos,"
Greek for indivisible.

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:53.767
His ideas were opposed by
the more popular philosophers of his day.

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:57.160
Aristotle, for instance, disagreed completely,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.372
stating instead that matter 
was made of four elements:

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:03.438
earth, wind, water and fire,

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:06.837
and most later scientists followed suit.

00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:12.227
Atoms would remain 
all but forgotten until 1808,

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:18.090
when a Quaker teacher named John Dalton 
sought to challenge Aristotelian theory.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.564
Whereas Democritus's atomism
had been purely theoretical,

00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:26.396
Dalton showed that common substances
always broke down into the same elements

00:01:26.396 --> 00:01:28.407
in the same proportions.

00:01:28.407 --> 00:01:30.573
He concluded that the various compounds

00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:33.957
were combinations of atoms 
of different elements,

00:01:33.957 --> 00:01:36.446
each of a particular size and mass

00:01:36.446 --> 00:01:39.580
that could neither be created 
nor destroyed.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.679
Though he received 
many honors for his work,

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.159
as a Quaker, Dalton lived modestly 
until the end of his days.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.500
Atomic theory was now accepted 
by the scientific community,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.936
but the next major advancement

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:53.599
would not come 
until nearly a century later

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:59.991
with the physicist J.J. Thompson's 
1897 discovery of the electron.

00:01:59.991 --> 00:02:03.357
In what we might call 
the chocolate chip cookie model of the atom,

00:02:03.357 --> 00:02:07.726
he showed atoms as 
uniformly packed spheres of positive matter

00:02:07.726 --> 00:02:11.044
filled with negatively charged electrons.

00:02:11.044 --> 00:02:15.583
Thompson won a Nobel Prize in 1906 
for his electron discovery,

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:18.866
but his model of the atom 
didn't stick around long.

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:24.858
This was because he happened 
to have some pretty smart students,

00:02:24.858 --> 00:02:27.362
including a certain Ernest Rutherford,

00:02:27.362 --> 00:02:31.378
who would become known 
as the father of the nuclear age.

00:02:31.378 --> 00:02:34.049
While studying the effects 
of X-rays on gases,

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.546
Rutherford decided 
to investigate atoms more closely

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:43.292
by shooting small, positively charged 
alpha particles at a sheet of gold foil.

00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:44.673
Under Thompson's model,

00:02:44.673 --> 00:02:47.049
the atom's thinly dispersed 
positive charge

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.897
would not be enough 
to deflect the particles in any one place.

00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:53.170
The effect would have been 
like a bunch of tennis balls

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.729
punching through a thin paper screen.

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.488
But while most of the particles 
did pass through,

00:02:58.488 --> 00:03:00.801
some bounced right back,

00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:05.951
suggesting that the foil was more 
like a thick net with a very large mesh.

00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:09.920
Rutherford concluded that atoms 
consisted largely of empty space

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.941
with just a few electrons,

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:14.992
while most of the mass 
was concentrated in the center,

00:03:14.992 --> 00:03:17.426
which he termed the nucleus.

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:19.379
The alpha particles 
passed through the gaps

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:24.396
but bounced back from the dense, 
positively charged nucleus.

00:03:24.396 --> 00:03:27.381
But the atomic theory 
wasn't complete just yet.

00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:31.617
In 1913, another of Thompson's students 
by the name of Niels Bohr

00:03:31.617 --> 00:03:34.115
expanded on Rutherford's nuclear model.

00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:38.326
Drawing on earlier work 
by Max Planck and Albert Einstein

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:41.151
he stipulated that electrons 
orbit the nucleus

00:03:41.151 --> 00:03:44.400
at fixed energies and distances,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.569
able to jump from one level to another,
but not to exist in the space between.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.936
Bohr's planetary model took center stage,

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:56.034
but soon, it too encountered 
some complications.

00:03:56.034 --> 00:03:59.928
Experiments had shown that rather than 
simply being discrete particles,

00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:04.086
electrons simultaneously 
behaved like waves,

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:07.670
not being confined 
to a particular point in space.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.796
And in formulating 
his famous uncertainty principle,

00:04:10.796 --> 00:04:14.220
Werner Heisenberg showed 
it was impossible to determine

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.781
both the exact 
position and speed of electrons

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:20.581
as they moved around an atom.

00:04:20.581 --> 00:04:23.007
The idea that electrons 
cannot be pinpointed

00:04:23.007 --> 00:04:26.027
but exist within 
a range of possible locations

00:04:26.027 --> 00:04:29.877
gave rise to the current 
quantum model of the atom,

00:04:29.877 --> 00:04:33.063
a fascinating theory 
with a whole new set of complexities

00:04:33.063 --> 00:04:36.496
whose implications 
have yet to be fully grasped.

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:39.546
Even though our understanding 
of atoms keeps changing,

00:04:39.546 --> 00:04:42.223
the basic fact of atoms remains,

00:04:42.223 --> 00:04:45.103
so let's celebrate 
the triumph of atomic theory

00:04:45.103 --> 00:04:46.772
with some fireworks.

00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:50.142
As electrons circling an atom 
shift between energy levels,

00:04:50.142 --> 00:04:55.195
they absorb or release energy in the form
of specific wavelengths of light,

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:58.242
resulting in 
all the marvelous colors we see.

00:04:58.242 --> 00:05:00.931
And we can imagine Democritus 
watching from somewhere,

00:05:00.931 --> 00:05:03.720
satisfied that over two millennia later,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.420
he turned out 
to have been right all along.
