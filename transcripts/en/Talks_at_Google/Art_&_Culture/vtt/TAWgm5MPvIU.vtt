[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:06.850
ALAN SEALES: You know
who he is, widely

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.470
regarded as one
of the major music

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.510
influencers of our
generation, he's

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.540
created an enormous body
of genre bending music that

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.200
includes pop albums with Ben
Folds Five, multiple solo

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.480
albums, and numerous
collaborative records.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.490
His last album was
a blend of pop songs

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.560
and his concerto for
piano and orchestra

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.620
that soared to number one on
the Billboard classical and

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.289
classical crossover
charts for over a decade.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.330
He's performed with some
of the greatest symphony

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.910
orchestras in addition to being
a judge on NBC's the "Sing

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.410
Off."

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.890
Continues to have cameos
all over cable network TV.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.270
Everybody, please help me
welcome to the stage Mr. Ben

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.770
Folds.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.995
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:51.390
BEN FOLDS: How you doing?

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.200
ALAN SEALES: Hi.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.700
Good.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.978
You can sit over here.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.510
Welcome to Google.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.635
BEN FOLDS: Good to be here.

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:02.290
ALAN SEALES: Are you enjoying
your Diet Cokes and snacks

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.290
from our micro kitchens?

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.284
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:06.890
It's good snack and
a good Coke, yeah.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.930
ALAN SEALES: Born in North
Carolina in Winston-Salem.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.307
I want to start at the
beginning of your life,

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.890
before we get to the career, to
talk about a little bit of who

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.670
you are as a person.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.970
So you started playing
piano at age nine.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.590
When did you walk
up to piano and say,

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.660
this is what I want to do.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.856
BEN FOLDS: Well, I had
sort of done that before.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:34.120
Before I had a piano,
I was interested in it.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.164
There was one at school,
and every once in a while,

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:38.080
I got to play on that.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.770
I had a friend who his
mother was a piano teacher.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.960
And she was trying to get
him to learn "Silent Night"

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.410
on the piano for Christmas.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.540
And maybe seven or
eight, I picked it out

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.240
by ear in the living
room and was playing.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.800
And she came running
in very excited

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.920
that her son had finally
learned that song.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.010
And she told my mother,
he probably needs to play.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.210
He seems to be good at this.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.120
ALAN SEALES: So you always
had a natural gift for piano,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.599
or just music in general?

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.640
BEN FOLDS: I loved music.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.490
When I was two years
old, I sat on the floor

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.270
and listened to 45s records
up to eight hours a day.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.530
That's a lot for 2-year-old.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.940
It prompted my
grandmother to spring

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:38.080
for a child psychologist, who
confirmed that I was slow.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.790
I'm glad they got a laugh.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.392
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:02:41.392 --> 00:02:42.100
Was that serious?

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.244
You actually saw somebody?

00:02:43.244 --> 00:02:43.910
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.210
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.050
BEN FOLDS: Mm-hmm.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.530
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.155
BEN FOLDS: Yep.

00:02:46.155 --> 00:02:51.690
Yep, I guess it was that square
pegs in round holes stuff.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.790
I don't know what he did.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.170
It was play therapy probably.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.640
And he said I should
be held back in school.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.730
My mother doubled down
in the opposite direction

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.907
and put me in early.

00:03:01.907 --> 00:03:02.740
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.550
BEN FOLDS: Mm-hmm.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.990
ALAN SEALES: And
obviously, it worked.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.698
BEN FOLDS: It seems
to have worked, yeah.

00:03:06.698 --> 00:03:07.420
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.640
And as a two-year-old, you
didn't let it hold you back.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.223
BEN FOLDS: No.

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:14.272
But I was obsessed with records.

00:03:14.272 --> 00:03:15.730
I mean, that's an
actual obsession,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.630
like eight hours
a day for a kid.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.810
And right now, I'm
finishing up my memoirs.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.770
And yeah, I was
spending some time

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.710
remembering that and wondering
if that I can remember so much

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.360
from when I was
two years old, it's

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.610
possible it has to do with
stimulation of the brain

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.180
from music.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.170
ALAN SEALES: Mm-hmm.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.170
BEN FOLDS: Because
my parents will say,

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.940
you couldn't remember
two years old.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.520
Well, I'll tell them the
house plan of the place

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.240
that we lived in.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.830
We moved once a year.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.160
So at any year, I can tell
them where all the rooms were.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.660
If I'm two years
old, I can remember

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.700
where they put
the Christmas tree

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.920
and where the lights were
and the room addition

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.040
and where they had stuff stored.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.490
It's I can remember.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.030
It's good.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.380
And I'm not that damn smart.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.850
It's just that I
remember really early.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.590
ALAN SEALES: Wow.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.161
Yeah, well, if what you were
obsessed with as a two-year-old

00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:15.910
is any indication of
what my kids will be,

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.504
they're going to be barn
yard animals or marbles.

00:04:18.504 --> 00:04:19.170
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.980
ALAN SEALES: Basically.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:21.920
But North Carolina.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.045
So I can get them in music.

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:24.310
That's the lesson here.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.810
BEN FOLDS: Marbles
fit in the mouth.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.394
Records don't.

00:04:26.394 --> 00:04:27.601
You might stick with records.

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:29.500
ALAN SEALES: Oh, that's
a very good point.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.060
North Carolina
itself isn't exactly

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.400
known for producing a steady
stream of mainstream artists.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.980
How did you navigate
the North Carolina scene

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.752
and get into mainstream culture?

00:04:41.752 --> 00:04:43.210
BEN FOLDS: Well,
when you say that,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.460
do you mean that
most of the artists

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.540
there are known to be
out of the mainstream,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.680
or that it's just not
that they play music?

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.470
What's the?

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.450
ALAN SEALES: That they're not--
well, it's a lot of bluegrass.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:56.320
It's a lot of country.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.210
It's not-- well, I guess,
country is more mainstream.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.751
But like your
alternative, your rock,

00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:04.481
the genres that you're known
for are not popular, not common

00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:05.230
in North Carolina.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.490
BEN FOLDS: Right.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.760
Well, I think, when
I was a kid, there

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.456
was a real healthy sort
of original band scene.

00:05:13.456 --> 00:05:14.830
There was a group
called the dB's

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.000
that went to my school
a couple years earlier.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.300
And they were all sort of
tied in with R.E.M. And Mitch

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.654
Easter, and great, great.

00:05:26.654 --> 00:05:28.570
They made one-- well,
they made a few records,

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.790
but they made one record
that topped "New York

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.290
Times" new record list.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.100
And they were from
Winston-Salem.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.850
And that was really
inspiring to me

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.450
to see that they could
actually get out of town.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.250
I think the thing
about living anywhere,

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.900
unless you live
in New York or LA,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.130
is that it seems like all
the famous stuff comes

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.210
from somewhere else.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.876
You don't think of
it coming from there.

00:05:50.876 --> 00:05:54.220
But I mean, Ryan Adams,
who we were talking about,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.440
he was from Raleigh.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.459
And just within a few
blocks of my house

00:06:00.459 --> 00:06:02.250
was a band called the
Squirrel Nut Zippers.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.790
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:03.730
BEN FOLDS: They were pretty big.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.938
And then there was a band
called the Archers of Loaf.

00:06:05.938 --> 00:06:08.010
And they sold a lot
of records and was

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.320
one of Kurt Cobain's favorite.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.530
There was a lot of original
bands that were very stubborn.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.080
You know, they weren't
out to be mainstream.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.850
It was more sort
of left of center.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.330
ALAN SEALES: So walk me
then through where you

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.880
went to form Ben Folds Five.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.160
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, I
had been in New York,

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:35.340
and it was tough up here for
me, because I play piano.

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.950
Like my options
were to play places

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:41.760
like The Bitter End, which
is great, has a piano,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.530
but it's not the most creative.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.980
It's not where you
would go to really hear

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.160
something new that was good.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:01.170
And I met my manager by breaking
a piano string at The Bitter

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.370
End.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.510
And I couldn't afford to pay
for it, and he took care of it

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.602
for me.

00:07:07.602 --> 00:07:09.560
And then the next night,
I played [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.685
I don't know if anyone
remembers Cafe [INAUDIBLE],,

00:07:11.685 --> 00:07:13.309
but they didn't have a piano.

00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:14.850
And so I had to play
an electric one,

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:16.740
and I always sucked
on electric piano.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.250
So he told me, you
sucked tonight.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.840
And I was like, great.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.173
Would you like to be my manager?

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.071
ALAN SEALES: But you also
play drums and guitar, right?

00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:26.070
BEN FOLDS: I mean, yeah.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:27.360
Yeah, I play drums, guitar.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.410
I started on the drums.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.060
I started thinking
that I was going

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:36.840
to be a percussionist in an
orchestra, timpani, [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.420
or battery percussion.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.770
I thought that was what I
was going to do with my life.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.490
And so I had plan B
as a piano player,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.470
but I had always
written and made up

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.277
my songs from a very young age.

00:07:48.277 --> 00:07:50.360
Before I was playing piano,
I was making up songs.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.960
And so when I started
playing piano,

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.850
the piano promised to
facilitate my ideas.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.700
It took a long time,
because I had to--

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.570
it was very frustrating
having an idea

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.190
that you know that you
could play on the piano

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.273
if you could only play it.

00:08:03.273 --> 00:08:05.340
So I had to learn how
to play the piano.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.990
ALAN SEALES: So then
you sucked in New York,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.090
or didn't do well in New York?

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.340
BEN FOLDS: It was tough, yeah.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.810
I found it tough,
because the places

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.370
I wanted to play, I had
to get a piano into,

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:17.190
which is obviously not something
you just carry around New York.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.151
So when I met this guy
who became my manager,

00:08:20.151 --> 00:08:21.900
we just sat down, and
were like, you know,

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.870
why don't I just go back
to North Carolina where

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:30.360
I will have some space and
can put my piano in a house

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.230
and practice?

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:35.220
And so that's when
I moved back, I

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.500
met Robert and Darren,
who are the other two

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.270
guys from Ben Folds Five.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.780
We met within a month, and we
had a record out within a year.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.260
We just moved really quickly.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.590
So once I got there,
things became very easy.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.330
I think in New
York, it was always

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.020
going to take a year for me to
figure out how to do anything,

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:53.480
like just get somewhere.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.480
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:58.200
And when you met
the other two guys,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.519
I guess, how did the
collaboration work?

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:03.060
Were you writing all the songs,
and they were adding into it?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.070
BEN FOLDS: I'd
written everything

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.640
that we put on the first record.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.740
And I'd had that
in my back pocket

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.172
for maybe up to 10 years.

00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:14.880
So some of the songs
on the first record,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.400
I wrote when I was
18, 19 years old.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.540
And I was waiting tables
over most of my 20s.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.180
And so when we got
together, at first,

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.686
we were going to just
do all new stuff.

00:09:27.686 --> 00:09:29.310
And then I think it
just became obvious

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:30.726
that a lot of these
songs that I'd

00:09:30.726 --> 00:09:35.110
been sitting on for 10 years
were hard to beat quickly.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.310
So the first album is
all, like it usually

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.990
is, it's all the songs that
you had since the beginning.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.960
And then the second album,
"Whatever and Ever Amen," all

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.730
had to be basically new stuff.

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.090
So then that was
like, that started

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:54.906
a terrible habit of mine
of writing in the studio.

00:09:54.906 --> 00:09:56.810
It was a terrible habit.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.690
ALAN SEALES: And you compose,
but you compose a lot of songs

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.364
live during your concerts.

00:10:01.364 --> 00:10:02.030
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.920
ALAN SEALES: Do you
have a track record

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.310
of having things that
you've done in the concerts

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.810
make their way back
onto recorded records.

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:11.660
BEN FOLDS: I have
a couple times.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.450
There are a couple of notable
ones that are really close.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:22.100
A song called "Cologne"
was originally

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.240
freestyled on stage in Cologne
as rock this bitch in Cologne.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.060
And it turned out to be
kind of a sad, soft song.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.995
It came about because
I was on drugs.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.130
I had pneumonia,
and I was taking

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.530
a lot of these codeine drops.

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:41.750
And I didn't think they
were doing anything,

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.059
so the doctor said, you
know, take six codeine drops,

00:10:45.059 --> 00:10:46.100
and you'll stop coughing.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.183
And it didn't really work.

00:10:47.183 --> 00:10:49.850
So the next night in
Cologne, I took like 20.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:57.090
And so I was trying to freestyle
a song, and all I could do

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.877
was laugh.

00:10:57.877 --> 00:10:58.460
I had nothing.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.126
It was terrible.

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:02.750
It was a total waste of
everyone's time and money.

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.520
And after about five
minutes, and you

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.400
can find this on YouTube,
if you're really bored,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.740
but the first three to
five minutes is terrible.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.310
And then all of a
sudden, something hit me,

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.150
and it becomes this song
"Cologne," and it's about 75%

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.227
there freestyled.

00:11:18.227 --> 00:11:20.060
Like almost everything
that's on the record.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.436
The chorus is a
little different,

00:11:21.436 --> 00:11:23.726
because I didn't want to say
rock this bitch in Cologne

00:11:23.726 --> 00:11:24.470
for the chorus.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.150
But there's another
one called "Effington,"

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.970
which was, I'd say,
I don't know how

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:36.370
do you quantify these things,
80% composed freestyle.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:41.230
And usually, they're
not that tidy.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:45.820
And I'll take an idea that came
about at a show often use that.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.710
Because I think that
you're in a different

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.110
headspace to sort of freestyle
in front of an audience.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.610
You know?

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:54.330
Usually, if I've been
playing for an hour,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.930
feel comfortable
with the audience,

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.780
and that's the
point that I do it,

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.740
that's a different headspace
than sitting by yourself

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.510
and writing.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.040
So I've found a lot of good
stuff has come that way.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.470
But recently, I was thinking
about this, because there

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.890
was a comedian in the UK.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:11.790
I guess he's famous.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:13.980
He had a shit ton of followers.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:18.940
And he accused me of
ripping off one of my songs.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:20.580
And all these people
were piling on.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.170
This was a couple of years ago.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.850
And the person they said
that I'd ripped off,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.380
I'd never heard of.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.690
So I went and listened to this
person that I had ripped off.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:35.830
And I realized that this
song that I had supposedly

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:39.520
ripped off was from
way later than when

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.420
I had come up with it on stage.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.720
So I just went to YouTube, and
I found when I freestyled it,

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.050
and I sent it to this comedian.

00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:49.690
I was like, look,
this is from 2011.

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.710
I made most of this up on stage.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.975
So stop.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.260
He's like, oh, sorry, mate.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.540
ALAN SEALES: So you were many
years with Ben Folds Five.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.930
And then, can you
talk about why you

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.540
guys decided to
go separate ways?

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.490
Is that something you
want to talk about?

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:14.530
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, I
mean, I think overall,

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:21.290
it was because, as I described,
we got together really quickly.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.360
It was a mercenary thing.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.530
I wanted to start a band.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:26.710
These are the first
two guys I met.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.840
I didn't even hear them
play when I committed

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.440
to play in a band with them.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:29.830
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.850
BEN FOLDS: I was
just in that space.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:31.820
I was like, I gotta get it done.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:32.653
I gotta get it done.

00:13:32.653 --> 00:13:33.970
They looked like rock stars.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.710
I heard they were pretty good.

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:42.160
And we didn't have necessarily
all that much in common,

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.930
so it was six years of being
in each other's back pockets

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.860
financially.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.690
You're living in a bus two
inches from the other guy.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.270
We got along fine, but we
just didn't have all that

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.570
much in common.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.340
And so I think after
our third album,

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.300
although it wasn't a
great commercial success,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.990
it was also not a
great critical success.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.340
Usually, you get one of the two.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.160
We didn't manage one of them.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.610
And it just looked
like, yeah, OK, well, we

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.400
should probably sell
while stocks are not

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.900
as low as they will get.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.000
And so we just called it.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.410
I think it was three
emails, and we were done.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.380
And I didn't expect it, but
one day, Darren wrote and said,

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.839
I don't think I
want do it anymore.

00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:33.130
And then Robert said, well,
if he doesn't want to do it

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:34.150
anymore, then I don't want to.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:35.524
And I was like,
OK, well, I guess

00:14:35.524 --> 00:14:37.010
I don't want to do it anymore.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:41.950
So then I took all my songs
which were meant for the band,

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.050
I did them myself for
"Rockin the Suburbs."

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:47.050
ALAN SEALES: So "Rockin
the Suburbs," actually,

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.211
was released on 9/11.

00:14:48.211 --> 00:14:49.210
BEN FOLDS: That's right.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:52.480
ALAN SEALES: Which do
think was it the album,

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.832
was it the songs that you
think were responsible for it

00:14:55.832 --> 00:14:57.790
not doing well commercially,
or was it all tied

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.900
to the 9/11 happenstance?

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.620
Because "Rockin the
Suburbs," by the way,

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.840
is one of my all
time favorite albums.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.980
BEN FOLDS: Thank you.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.870
Thank you.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:15.490
Well, it didn't do well
over its first year,

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:20.040
but it had an interesting way
of hanging on for a long time.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:24.890
And so it's become
one of my, you know,

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.720
if I had to run out of a
burning building with two

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.870
albums to my name, it would
have to be "Rockin the Suburbs"

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.570
and the band's first album.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.130
I don't think I
could have a career

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.480
without either one of those.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.022
Those are necessary for
me to exist, I think.

00:15:42.022 --> 00:15:42.730
But I don't know.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:44.860
I mean, a lot of
it was the release.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:50.920
I mean, already when
you go solo from a band,

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.660
it's not an easy place.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:59.396
It's assumed that you're not
going to do well, I think.

00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:01.270
ALAN SEALES: I feel like
people want soloists

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.680
to fail when they
leave the band,

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.190
because they'd
rather have the band.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:05.360
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, I think so.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.318
I mean, I think I've
always been like that too.

00:16:07.318 --> 00:16:10.300
So I knew that when
I put the album out.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.980
I was like, OK, have at it.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.040
But also you feel
like, you know,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.820
I made that record
when I was 33.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.510
I felt like I'd aged out
of the music business.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:27.880
I don't know why I thought that
was aged out at 33, because I'm

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.820
older than that now.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.210
And I'm OK.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:36.940
But yeah, I think, too,
the other thing was

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:44.420
at the end of each decade,
there is a obvious changing

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.450
of the rock and roll guard.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:51.020
All the hairy chest,
screaming guys in the '70s

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.470
were out as of the '80s.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:59.120
And all the sort
of new wave artists

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.740
were out as of the '90s.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:04.520
And the grungers were
out when the aughts came.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.970
It's just always too, and when
you put out a record like 2001,

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:12.528
and you're a '90s
band, it's uphill.

00:17:12.528 --> 00:17:13.319
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.860
BEN FOLDS: But I think what's
really been good for me is just

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.410
doing different things.

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:23.869
At that point, I didn't try
to just do solo records.

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:25.130
I tried to do other things.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.240
ALAN SEALES: Well, that's
what I was going to get into.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.760
That's a good segue.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:28.260
Thank you.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:28.926
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:17:28.926 --> 00:17:29.600
I had a feeling.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:33.680
ALAN SEALES: That you've
done tons of collaborations.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.180
Collaborations
with other artists,

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.610
but also you're crossing genre
boundaries all the time often

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.470
with these collaborations.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:46.390
Like you've helped William
Shatner produce a record.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.270
You've worked with Weird Al,
Amanda Palmer, Sara Bareilles,

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.930
which of course, has done her
own Broadway to pop crossover.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:56.580
Cake and, of
course, Nick Hornby.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.770
How do you choose what
you want to work on,

00:17:59.770 --> 00:18:01.270
and who you want
to work on it with?

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:03.311
BEN FOLDS: Well, it's
usually it's the who first.

00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:06.400
And it's usually circumstantial.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.870
Like Weird Al, he was
buying frozen pizzas

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:14.770
at the grocery store.

00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.380
And we were standing next
to each other in line,

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.610
and he's like, oh, I'm
a fan of your music.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.970
ALAN SEALES: And I imagine
it like, Weird Al, Ben.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.070
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.050
ALAN SEALES: Weird, Ben weird.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:26.290
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:29.390
Yeah, it was just that weird.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:30.700
ALAN SEALES: [DRUM ROLL SOUND]

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.050
BEN FOLDS: And I think that is
like I like the personal first.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:39.280
Because like with
William Shatner,

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.630
I was interested in him.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.670
And in what did we
really know about William

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:49.330
Shatner at that point?

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:52.000
He's an actor, and he's odd.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:52.720
You know?

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:55.860
So you don't really know who
you're who you're talking to.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:01.540
And I thought an album of a
75-year-old man who everyone

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.000
knows who he is, but
don't really know him,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.820
gives him a chance
to tell a story.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.870
And a musical story
is a compelling story

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:09.870
if it's done well.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.570
And I think Shatner is a
great recording artist.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:15.859
He was one of my favorite.

00:19:15.859 --> 00:19:17.900
He's not a musician, but
he's one of my favorites

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:24.080
to ever work with, because
he's so brave about every take.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.560
It's always different.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.980
And yeah, I really
enjoyed working with him.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:28.880
ALAN SEALES: Do you
have another favorite?

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.110
I was going to ask
who your favorite was.

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.650
But--

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.950
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:31.820
ALAN SEALES: --he's one of them.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.403
BEN FOLDS: He's
certainly one of them.

00:19:33.403 --> 00:19:36.280
I mean, they're
all my favorites,

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.290
because it's you always pull
something really interesting.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:43.100
I mean, one thing I think
that all artists have

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.300
in common, a few things, one
is I think we're all hacks.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.380
And it's really great to see
your favorites hacking around

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.230
in the darkness.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:55.070
They don't seem to know
what they're doing.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:56.570
And that's a wonderful
thing to see.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.390
Because if you're collaborating
with someone who's not famous,

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:02.480
it's good to remember that
they may have a good idea.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.730
They seem like bad ideas
when they come out at first,

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:05.870
you know?

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.310
I noticed that
about Joe Jackson,

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:09.740
who was one of my favorites
when I was growing up.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.110
And working with him,
I was like, well,

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:14.090
that's an abysmal idea.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.760
That's terrible.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:18.147
Then I thought, you know,
I like everything he does.

00:20:18.147 --> 00:20:19.480
Maybe there's something to this.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.160
But when you allow the idea
to see the light of day,

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.782
I think I learned from
collaboration that way.

00:20:25.782 --> 00:20:27.490
ALAN SEALES: Who do
you think that you've

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:31.540
worked with that's influenced
you the most as a solo artist?

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:35.970
BEN FOLDS: Well, I
certainly learned

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:42.060
from watching Shatner do every
take completely different.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:46.140
That that's really something
that we all need to learn from.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:49.190
If you've already
done the past one way,

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:51.750
really, you don't
need to do that again.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.930
And I think that that's
really interesting.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:59.580
Working with Sara Bareilles
is inspiring and slightly

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:06.980
depressing, because she nails
everything absolutely perfectly

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.590
on the first pass.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:12.380
She's the most technically
proficient performer

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.132
I've ever worked with,
and that there's nothing

00:21:15.132 --> 00:21:17.090
that you want more out
of it than what you hear

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:18.920
on the first past in any way.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.260
And that made me really,
really have to work hard.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.200
Because if I don't
find something wrong,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:28.200
I was producing her record, if
I didn't find anything wrong,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.080
then I got skewered.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.780
It's like so I got
really careful about it.

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.446
She'd do a pass.

00:21:33.446 --> 00:21:35.850
I'd be reading the lyrics,
and I'd circle stuff.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:41.060
It's like, slightly flat, not
really, but OK, slightly flat.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.180
OK, she's making some kind
of mouth smacking noise.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:47.120
You're going to the salad bar
here, and a couple things.

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.180
And then when she'd
come out, I'd say,

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.650
here are your problems,
and I'd list them.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:52.579
She's like relieved.

00:21:52.579 --> 00:21:54.620
I'm glad someone's listening
with a critical ear.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.495
And then I'd say, and
we're keeping the pass,

00:21:56.495 --> 00:21:58.900
because it's beautiful.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.590
But that's the only way
someone that good you can.

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:05.780
And I've played with plenty
of classical musicians

00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.270
and all sorts of
musicians, but she's just

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.720
sort of a freak that way.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.280
ALAN SEALES: Freak and an
amazingly talented person.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.738
BEN FOLDS: And
she's also talented.

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.480
ALAN SEALES: And so you've
performed solo with bands.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.010
You've obviously got a love for
orchestras and acapella music.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.584
Do you have a style?

00:22:24.584 --> 00:22:26.000
I mean, you're
known for the rock,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.340
but do you have a style that if
you could just live forever--

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.840
You have water over
there somewhere.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.131
BEN FOLDS: Is that where it is?

00:22:32.131 --> 00:22:33.125
That was obvious.

00:22:33.125 --> 00:22:35.360
Where's water?

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.310
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
if you had a style

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:40.560
that you could do forever and
just make unlimited money,

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.549
which one would it be out of
everything that you've done?

00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:45.590
BEN FOLDS: I'm still on
the unlimited money part.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.585
I never thought about that.

00:22:48.585 --> 00:22:49.460
You know, I wouldn't.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.840
I don't have a
favorite anything.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.790
I don't have a favorite style.

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:56.240
I don't rage against style.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:58.154
I mean, I think it's cool.

00:22:58.154 --> 00:22:59.570
Because when I go
to buy a record,

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.330
I like to know if it's a
country record or a jazz record.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.680
I don't know when this artist
is like, I can't be defined.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:09.155
But I do think that
not worrying about that

00:23:09.155 --> 00:23:12.320
and residing somewhere between
them all is a nice place.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:16.250
So I like being
able to not worry.

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.130
I mean, that's very low
resolution creativity

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:21.940
if you're thinking about
you've got five styles,

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.800
and there's so much that falls
between the cracks of all

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:25.430
those.

00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:27.770
If you're just going to
pick those five points

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.550
and live inside it, I'm not
sure how that could happen.

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:36.230
I made a little single recently
for the "Washington Post"

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:37.390
of all projects.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.431
I thought it was interesting,
because they wanted

00:23:39.431 --> 00:23:42.477
me to be a reporter
as a songwriter, which

00:23:42.477 --> 00:23:43.560
I thought was fascinating.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.470
I liked the idea of doing that.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:48.764
And what wasn't
noticed, which I thought

00:23:48.764 --> 00:23:50.180
was interesting
about the song, is

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:58.100
I felt like it was resoundingly
it resided in folk music.

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:58.790
And no one said.

00:23:58.790 --> 00:24:01.460
Most of time, I make something
that I feel like is in a style,

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.582
and people will comment.

00:24:02.582 --> 00:24:04.040
And I felt, well,
that either means

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.950
that I can do whatever
style I feel like and no one

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.240
even notices it anymore,
or I don't know what.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.990
But I thought it was
an interesting thing,

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.670
because I expected.

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.480
I mean, it's like I got a
tap dancer being the drummer.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.854
It had fiddle and banjo in it.

00:24:18.854 --> 00:24:21.020
And I would've thought that
would have been notable.

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.390
Like, you know, the peanut
gallery been like, oh, now,

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:24.848
he's going to make
country records.

00:24:24.848 --> 00:24:26.036
But no one said a thing.

00:24:26.036 --> 00:24:27.620
So maybe I can do what I want.

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.199
I don't know.

00:24:28.199 --> 00:24:29.990
ALAN SEALES: For your
next album then, I'll

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.840
plant the idea to write
the song as an engineer.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.550
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:35.420
It's not a bad idea.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.769
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, right?

00:24:36.769 --> 00:24:38.060
You can call it ones and zeros.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:38.345
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:24:38.345 --> 00:24:38.630
ALAN SEALES: There you go.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:39.421
There's your title.

00:24:39.421 --> 00:24:40.940
BEN FOLDS: That's pretty good.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.870
ALAN SEALES: In 2009, you were
a judge on "The Sing Off,"

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.500
and you also released "Ben
Folds Presents Acapella."

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.722
Do you have a special
place for acapella music?

00:24:48.722 --> 00:24:51.180
BEN FOLDS: I was really, I
mean, still am interested in it.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:56.800
But my interest in
acapella was self-centered,

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.280
because so many
university acapella

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.300
groups were covering my music.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.920
And when I started a little
bit before Ben Folds Five,

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.020
my ambition was
to be a songwriter

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.090
that other people covered.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.296
That's what I want.

00:25:11.296 --> 00:25:12.670
That's what I
thought I would do.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.070
And Bette Midler
covered one of my songs.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.260
And then no one else did.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.120
And that's not bad.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.280
I mean, Yellow Card did.

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:24.970
So Bette Midler and
Yellow Card, that

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:29.770
has been the extent and hundreds
and hundreds of acapella groups

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.620
from universities.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:40.430
So I just wanted to visit
these acapella groups,

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:44.780
bring some microphones, and a
sound engineer, and record it.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:48.290
And that's where the album came
from that university acapella

00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:49.070
record.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.010
When I was a kid, I really
loved National Geographic field

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.130
recordings.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:58.160
And this was molded and I
tried to make it like that.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.920
Because they were, obviously,
just a couple of mics, and they

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:07.310
were in the natural habitat
of the natives, which

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:09.410
is what I wanted to do
with these college kids.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.020
I wanted to record it in
their natural habitat, which

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.140
would have been
like, the lunchroom,

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.650
or there was a
synagogue on campus

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.780
that we recorded one in
that sounded really great.

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.490
I didn't mind about
external noise.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:26.720
And I didn't mind about
it sounding like a record.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.600
Oddly enough, there
was an acapella scene

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.840
it turns out of
people who were really

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.100
into acapella recordings.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:35.877
And they didn't like what I did.

00:26:35.877 --> 00:26:36.710
ALAN SEALES: Really?

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.000
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, because
it wasn't perfect.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.720
They were cultivating a style
that involved perfection, which

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.020
had all the singers
doubled and tripled

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.780
and auto tuned within
an inch of their lives.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.805
And they were
imitating instruments.

00:26:55.805 --> 00:26:58.550
It was like, but what I
love about the voice is

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.140
it sounds like the voice.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.610
That's what's
interesting about it.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.650
So that's where
I went with that.

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.980
And my interest in that
led to being recruited

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.440
for NBC's "Sing Off" show.

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.590
So those two were kind
of connected in a way.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.810
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:12.820
Did you enjoy that?

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.390
Do you enjoy being
on TV like that,

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.840
or is that like, I don't want
to be on the big screens.

00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:24.080
BEN FOLDS: It was interesting,
because it's so cheesy.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.770
ALAN SEALES: But so
many people love it.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:30.686
BEN FOLDS: But that's
what I was going to say,

00:27:30.686 --> 00:27:33.270
like, I actually kind
of embraced that.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.269
Because I had asked
myself, because I

00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:37.560
was trying to decide whether
I was going to accept this

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.420
or not, and at the end of the
day, listening to great music

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.940
and commenting on
it with the hopes

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.520
to possibly improve
it or add perspective

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.847
for the people who performed
it didn't seem cheesy at all.

00:27:50.847 --> 00:27:51.680
ALAN SEALES: Mm-hmm.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.513
BEN FOLDS: You know?

00:27:52.513 --> 00:27:55.140
And the format
itself is a formula,

00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:59.890
and so I was judging it
from that perspective.

00:27:59.890 --> 00:28:00.910
And I was hard on it.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.060
But once I got in it,
I really did enjoy it.

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:08.670
You have a very short period
of time, a window with which

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:13.360
to hear precisely what's going
on with the entire group,

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.670
like the whole rhythm section.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:17.530
It's not like "American
Idol" or something

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:21.270
where they're not judging
the bed, the arrangement.

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.030
They're just judging whether
the singer brought it or not.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:28.530
And in this case, I got
to really listen and do

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:31.150
what I feel like is one
of the things I'm best at,

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:35.970
which is listening
to a performance

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.531
and having some clarity as to
what might be the next step.

00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:42.780
Because people that perform,
especially on television,

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.330
they don't know what
they've just done, no idea.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:48.000
They feel like they've just gone
backwards through a car wash

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.124
with a bag over their head.

00:28:49.124 --> 00:28:50.730
They have no idea
where they are.

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:52.246
And they come out,
and they're like,

00:28:52.246 --> 00:28:53.370
it seemed like two seconds.

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.600
And it was 2 and 1/2 minutes.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.710
And they're like, tonight,
what the hell just happened?

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.000
You know?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.920
To have someone in
front of you say,

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.990
I know you were wondering
where you were sliding.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.280
Your tenor wasn't flat.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.554
Your basis was sharp.

00:29:06.554 --> 00:29:08.220
And so then you started
moving that way.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.660
You got nervous, and
these things, the legs got

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:11.910
pulled out from underneath it.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.730
And over, of course, the 2
and 1/2 minutes, you rushed.

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.870
So just tell them the basics
that are really, really obvious

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:23.160
to the obstacles to
communicating the songs were

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.220
really interesting to me.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:25.687
And I really enjoyed doing it.

00:29:25.687 --> 00:29:28.020
It's really hard too, because
you have two other judges,

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.820
and they're noticing things.

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.700
And you never know what order
you're going to get chosen in.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:37.330
So the host of the show would
say the two others first,

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.690
and they'd say everything
that I was going to say.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.790
So then I'd just have to make
up some stupid joke and move on.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.960
But if they got to
me first, then I

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:48.536
had a wider field
of what to say.

00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:49.410
But no, I enjoyed it.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:50.570
I thought it was good.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:53.340
It lasted, I think I
did it for four seasons.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.610
And then they replaced
me on the last one.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.681
And then I think they threw
the set away and that was it.

00:29:59.681 --> 00:30:01.680
ALAN SEALES: So talking
about education as well.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:05.160
You're a outspoken champion
for arts education and music

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.510
therapy funding in our
nation's public schools.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:14.010
2016, you were the only
one to hold the distinction

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:17.430
to appear in both national
political conventions

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.380
advocating for arts education.

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.910
How did that happen?

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:25.470
BEN FOLDS: Well,
Americans for the Arts,

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:29.790
who I work with a lot,
had a slot on both.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:34.470
And said, it's kind of weird,
but if you want to do both,

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.180
that might be a good idea.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.027
And I thought it
was a good idea.

00:30:38.027 --> 00:30:39.610
And in fact, I learned
a lot that way.

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:47.550
I mean, my buddy for the day was
Mike Huckabee at the Republican

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:48.930
National Convention.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:56.040
And I found him to be a really
very eloquently spoken about

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.950
arts funding.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.600
Outside of that, I don't know.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.240
But for that, he's very good at.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:09.880
And it made me realize, it
drove home that as a musician,

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:15.060
if I'm going to go and
sit across from senators

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:23.520
and congressmen and try
to convince them to keep

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.760
arts education healthy in
public schools and arts

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.970
funding in general,
it's best if I also

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:34.010
can come from the
economic perspective.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.320
And it's actually more
interesting in a way.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.570
I mean, everyone knows
everyone likes art.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:42.840
Every senator's
son and daughter is

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.730
going to go to a
school somewhere that

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.710
has good music and good art.

00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:49.112
They're going to make sure
that they have access to it.

00:31:49.112 --> 00:31:51.570
So you don't have to convince
them of the importance of it.

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:53.028
What you're trying
to convince them

00:31:53.028 --> 00:31:54.792
is the importance
of investing in it

00:31:54.792 --> 00:31:56.250
and the importance
of the symbolism

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:57.570
of having invested in it.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.970
ALAN SEALES: Right.

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.800
So if anybody has
questions for Ben,

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:05.850
please start lining
up at the mics there.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:07.370
Great.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.140
I want to go back real quick.

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.990
Tell us about what you're doing
with the Kennedy Center in DC.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.300
BEN FOLDS: My main
project, well, they

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.940
call me the artistic
advisor, which was nice.

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:18.780
I got a three year--

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.014
ALAN SEALES: First ever.

00:32:20.014 --> 00:32:21.180
BEN FOLDS: First ever, yeah.

00:32:23.766 --> 00:32:25.140
They made the
position up for me.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:25.973
That's kind of cool.

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:29.490
I do a lot of stuff.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:36.810
But my main project that I
could bite off what I wanted

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:41.900
is a series hoping to
improve, not hoping,

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.620
improving pops concerts.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:51.080
Because symphony orchestras
have to bring in new audiences,

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.720
and there's a lot of
ways you can do it.

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.990
One of the models has been
the pops concert, where

00:32:55.990 --> 00:33:01.024
they bring in a rock
musician or a pop musician,

00:33:01.024 --> 00:33:02.440
and the orchestra
plays with them.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.410
And they're riddled
with problems.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:06.880
And they're systemic.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.982
They're stubborn
embedded, easy answer

00:33:11.982 --> 00:33:13.690
sort of solutions that
they've got going.

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:17.080
And they're not
getting anywhere.

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:23.020
And so what I've aimed
to do is almost create--

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:26.230
I have a group that's
willing to experiment.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:27.250
I've got their budget.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.620
And I've got all my
rowdy rock friends,

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:32.040
like Sara Bareilles,
who I can bring in,

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.270
and we can do pop
shows the way that I

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:36.280
think that should be
done, and creating

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.380
a manifesto as how you do that.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:44.230
Because combining the two
is a technical nightmare.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.450
It lies over a
cultural fault line

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:48.700
that we don't think
of that the pop

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.130
world and the orchestral
world, even in terms

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.110
of their contracts
and their language,

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:56.290
are almost just they're
just raring for a fight.

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:57.770
They really don't get along.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.280
And so I felt like
there are enough

00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:05.050
cultural divides these days
without having one be in music,

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:09.590
so maybe my job could be to
sew those things together.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.920
And I think we've done a
lot of really good stuff.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.900
The shows are working.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.100
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
they're on YouTube.

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:16.989
I watched a few.

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:20.170
And I also watched a
clip of you composing

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:24.040
a full orchestral piece
in under 10 minutes live.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:26.469
Just like he rocks this
bitch in his concerts,

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:29.684
he rocked the bitch of
the orchestra, I guess.

00:34:29.684 --> 00:34:30.350
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:31.090
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:32.173
ALAN SEALES: It was crazy.

00:34:32.173 --> 00:34:34.630
What you read, you read
something from the program

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:36.940
about like, emergency
exits are to be

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.690
used in case of fire
only, or whatever

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:39.670
it was that were the lyrics.

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:40.350
BEN FOLDS: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:41.290
ALAN SEALES: That
was incredible.

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:42.150
Yeah.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.060
OK, let's do a question here.

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:45.429
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:47.110
I really, really
like your music.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.429
BEN FOLDS: Thank you.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.530
AUDIENCE: But your lyrics--

00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:53.020
BEN FOLDS: Are terrible.

00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.510
AUDIENCE: That's actually
what I'm going to ask.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:57.490
I don't think they're
terrible, but I

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:01.850
wonder if they are you
always, or when they're not?

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:06.370
And when they are about you
and your life, is it true?

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:11.605
BEN FOLDS: It's either true,
or sometimes, it's not true.

00:35:11.605 --> 00:35:12.820
ALAN SEALES: Next question.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:16.650
BEN FOLDS: And but
it's always something

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:18.720
that I'm interested in.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:24.300
I think when it comes
to lyrics, the things

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.760
that we notice that
are observations,

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.590
and when they're
observations, I feel

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:32.910
like if you follow those
really faithfully to when

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:36.450
they occur to you,
a picture forms

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:37.840
that it is a picture of you.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.540
But if an event
occurs, and I'm going

00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:44.790
to like I just did with
the "Washington Post"

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.980
piece, if something
happens and I'm

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:52.230
going to relay that
in song, your problem

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:58.860
is that just the real estate
for the syllables involved

00:35:58.860 --> 00:35:59.740
is really limited.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.240
You know?

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.960
Like you've got three minutes,
and you're expected to rhyme,

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.080
and you're expected for it to be
in iambic pentameter sometimes.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:08.730
And the cadence is difficult.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:11.190
So you have to cheat
with the lyric.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.910
You know?

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:17.860
You have to do things that put
the listener in that place.

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:21.000
So I have a song
about my father dying.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.310
He's still alive.

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:26.400
But the song isn't
necessarily about that,

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.260
but it's about the
feeling of that.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.290
And it needed to
sound literal for me

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.620
to be able to extract
the abstract part of it.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.070
So all that to say, there's
always something of me in it.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.860
There's always something
that I'm very interested in

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:42.210
or want to say.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:43.860
Probably, it is about myself.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.600
But often, I'll make up
a complete false scenario

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.620
in order to get it across.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.600
One thing I would
say is that I think

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:59.150
it's a fascinating
and really interesting

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:03.770
opportunity for a rock
lyricist, especially in the US.

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:10.750
Our culture here, we
expect our rock writers

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.670
to be singing the truth.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:15.250
You know, if Bruce
Springsteen says something

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:17.950
about starting his car,
breaking up with his girlfriend,

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.560
going to the badlands,
whatever, you expect

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.700
there's some truth in it.

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:22.330
You know?

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:25.340
But if David Bowie sings
about going to Mars,

00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:27.880
we can guess that that's
probably not true.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.850
And the thing is
that in America, we

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:35.221
like our songwriters to
have credibility to what

00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:36.220
it is that they've said.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.620
And I love exploiting
that by saying

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.380
things that aren't true, but
sound like they could be true.

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.125
I like that.

00:37:42.125 --> 00:37:42.730
Yeah.

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:44.080
ALAN SEALES: Question over here.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.700
AUDIENCE: Hey, thank you
so much for coming today.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:46.280
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.905
AUDIENCE: My name is
actually also Ben,

00:37:47.905 --> 00:37:50.940
so I've always felt
a special connection.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.720
BEN FOLDS: Is it
spelled the same way?

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.345
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:58.390
So there's that saying
that good artists borrow,

00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:59.710
and great artists steal.

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.140
And there's a lot of--

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.130
BEN FOLDS: I steal all the time.

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:04.630
AUDIENCE: There's
a lot of musicians

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:08.110
that get accused of theft or
rip offs, like Led Zeppelin

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.467
"Stairway to Heaven."

00:38:09.467 --> 00:38:11.800
Do you think there's a concrete
distinction between what

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.590
constitutes a rip off,
what constitutes a remix,

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:17.920
and what is truly original work?

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.420
BEN FOLDS: Well,
there are certainly

00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:25.070
a lot of musicologists
that the guys

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:30.830
that are brought in
to these lawsuits that

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:33.020
have parameters about it.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:39.534
And at the risk of
sounding kind of rude,

00:38:39.534 --> 00:38:40.950
because I don't
mean it like that,

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:44.600
but I literally don't care.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:50.090
Because I've had people rip me
off before, and really close.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:53.930
And I can safely say, I just
was flattered, that was all.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:58.340
In one case, it was so close
where they had kept the key.

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.450
They kept some of the lyrics.

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:04.070
They had changed
certain important parts

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:09.100
and kept other really
distinct things.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:12.670
This fellow was up
for a Grammy in Brazil

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:13.940
for record of the year.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.370
I've never won anything
like that before.

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:21.760
So out of jealousy, I might have
been inclined to sue this guy,

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.670
like a lot of people
said I should.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:27.760
But all I could think was,
one, I was really flattered.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.700
And secondly, I kind
of felt bad for him

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.940
that he didn't have
any better ideas.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.410
Because I think it is more fun
to steal from a lot of things

00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:41.200
and try to get something
that's personal across.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.050
That strikes me as empty
and sad that you do that.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.750
But really, I don't mind.

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:47.590
I really don't mind.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.200
I was listening to some
blues music the other day,

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.079
and it was one of those it was
like a kind of a Pandora style

00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:55.870
station of some kind
that was just playing.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.600
I guess it was on
satellite radio.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.470
And I don't know.

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:00.703
I'm sitting there
waiting for my latte,

00:40:00.703 --> 00:40:03.078
and I must have heard three
songs that started with, woke

00:40:03.078 --> 00:40:05.410
up this morning.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:06.400
Awesome.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:09.684
Why is one thing
almost like all?

00:40:09.684 --> 00:40:11.350
You have to say you
woke up this morning

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:15.800
in this same chord, same melody,
and everything, and I enjoy it.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.260
I think it's totally fine.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.220
People can rip off.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.178
I mean, look, my lawyer
wouldn't agree with me,

00:40:20.178 --> 00:40:23.290
but I don't mind for myself.

00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:26.980
And I just think it's
about expressing yourself.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:30.100
And if expressing
yourself uniquely,

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.850
oddly for some reason, would be
copying someone note for note

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:37.000
and changing one note, and that
particular note said something

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.010
really solid, I'm down.

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:40.480
I'm fine.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.610
I don't like this
ownership stuff,

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.830
even though the ownership
stuff, obviously,

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.120
affects my livelihood.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.470
So it's hard for me
to reconcile the two.

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:51.640
But no, I don't mind.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:55.210
Like I don't see
any distinctions.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:58.550
I think ripping off,
borrowing, it's all the same.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:59.230
It's all music.

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.017
I'm fine with it.

00:41:00.017 --> 00:41:00.850
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:01.730
Thank you so much.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:02.140
BEN FOLDS: Thank you.

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.764
ALAN SEALES: But something that
I've always respected about you

00:41:04.764 --> 00:41:07.210
actually is it's
never come across

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:09.620
to me as you've been doing
things just for the money.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.930
It's because you love the arts.

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:11.860
You love music.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.900
You love helping and educating.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:14.800
So I--

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.270
BEN FOLDS: Thank you.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:16.360
ALAN SEALES: --I
applaud you for that.

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:18.010
And I also want your
help with my song.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.110
I thought, it starts with,
I thought about the Navy.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.710
BEN FOLDS: Oh, yeah.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.370
You've got it.

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:21.953
You've got it.

00:41:21.953 --> 00:41:22.810
Put it in A flat.

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.160
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.870
Question over here.

00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:28.120
AUDIENCE: So "Lonely
Avenue," your collaboration

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:32.080
with Nick Hornby, I think is one
of the maybe greatest concept

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.025
albums of all time.

00:41:33.025 --> 00:41:34.330
BEN FOLDS: Why, thank you.

00:41:34.330 --> 00:41:37.630
AUDIENCE: Brilliantly executed,
and that bridging an author

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.590
and a musician into this thing.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.796
So A, is there are going
to be a Lonely Avenue two?

00:41:42.796 --> 00:41:44.170
It seems like
there's a whole lot

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:45.940
of stories he wants to tell.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.120
And if there were another author
you were going to collaborate

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.724
with, who would that be?

00:41:50.724 --> 00:41:52.140
BEN FOLDS: Well,
Neil Gaiman and I

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.797
have been talking about making
a record for a long time.

00:41:54.797 --> 00:41:55.380
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.620
Yes, do that.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:59.410
Leave now and do that.

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:01.590
BEN FOLDS: It's good advice.

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:03.020
ALAN SEALES: It would sell.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.060
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.430
Two bits.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:10.360
Yeah, I mean, Neil's
actually got a neat voice.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:16.390
And Neil thought he might want
to be a rock star when he first

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:19.930
started out, when he
started out making

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:24.250
comic books or graphic pieces.

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:27.040
And that's where his
heart was, and he thought

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.780
he would be a rock star.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.241
And his voice is, I
think, outstanding.

00:42:32.241 --> 00:42:32.740
I love it.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:35.350
So I would just
play piano for him.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:38.310
We'd write the songs together.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:40.940
I see him once a
year on average,

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:43.720
and we talk about how we're
going to make the record.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.470
And this has been
about 10 of those now.

00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.920
So we really do need to do it.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.060
Thank you for reminding
me and encouraging me.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:55.600
And as far as Nick Hornby,
it's the same with us.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.780
We talk a lot about
making another thing.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.360
I think that we felt
like the next step would

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.410
be to make a musical.

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.190
And so we've been
procrastinating

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.050
on that for some time.

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:11.470
But I think we're both scared.

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:14.200
Probably have, unfortunately,
have the same fear

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.580
of musicals, which is not good.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.480
One of the two has
to be fearless,

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:24.100
but we're really both scared
to death of the genre, both

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:28.191
for how it could get out of
control and be like that.

00:43:28.191 --> 00:43:28.690
You know?

00:43:28.690 --> 00:43:31.750
Some people have control
over it, like I mean,

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:37.097
there's nothing at all
cheesy about Hamilton.

00:43:37.097 --> 00:43:37.930
It's just brilliant.

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:40.970
And there are some that can
be big without the gestures.

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.660
But I don't think Nick and
I know enough about it.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.447
Anyway, that's--

00:43:44.447 --> 00:43:46.030
ALAN SEALES: You
need a creative team.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:47.380
BEN FOLDS: We need
a creative team.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.755
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
I mean, that's

00:43:48.755 --> 00:43:51.130
actually one of my final
questions for you was,

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:51.760
what's next?

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:55.040
And I know that Broadway has
been on and off your radar

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:55.540
for--

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:55.780
BEN FOLDS: A long time.

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:57.250
ALAN SEALES: --a
long, long time.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:43:58.542
And you were originally asked--

00:43:58.542 --> 00:44:00.208
I don't know if I'm
allowed to say this.

00:44:00.208 --> 00:44:01.330
Sorry if I'm not--

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:05.794
to write the whole
score for SpongeBob.

00:44:05.794 --> 00:44:06.460
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:07.510
ALAN SEALES: "SpongeBob
SquarePants The Musical,"

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.380
which just recently closed.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.463
That would've been a
completely different musical.

00:44:10.463 --> 00:44:11.475
BEN FOLDS: I know.

00:44:11.475 --> 00:44:12.850
ALAN SEALES: Why
did you not want

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:14.950
to get into that at the time?

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:18.760
BEN FOLDS: That was one of
many I've been approached with.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.960
It looked, I mean, I like
SpongeBob and everything.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.120
And those guys are they're hip.

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.010
They get it.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:27.820
I don't know.

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.380
I mean, it has to
really be something

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:33.280
that resonates with me.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:33.820
That's all.

00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.670
I don't know.

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:36.239
I don't know what
it's going to take.

00:44:36.239 --> 00:44:37.030
But it's something.

00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:46.300
I mean, I've had lunch meetings
with them all since like 1997.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.624
I've been thinking about
this for a long time.

00:44:48.624 --> 00:44:51.040
And I think the longer it goes
and the more choices I get,

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.730
the less likely it
is I'll ever do it.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:57.310
Because if I just walked
into town as a 20 something,

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:59.840
and I got any one of these
offers I've ever gotten,

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.840
I would put everything
into making that musical.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:03.782
But then you're like,
that guy's pretty good.

00:45:03.782 --> 00:45:04.990
And that one was pretty good.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:06.198
And that was a great musical.

00:45:06.198 --> 00:45:07.865
And I really like this one.

00:45:07.865 --> 00:45:08.740
I don't know anymore.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:09.790
I'm totally confused.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:10.525
ALAN SEALES: You got
to find a producer

00:45:10.525 --> 00:45:13.554
or set of producers that's going
to light a fire under your ass.

00:45:13.554 --> 00:45:15.720
How many people here want
to see him write Broadway?

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:15.980
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:16.479
Yeah?

00:45:16.479 --> 00:45:17.346
Yeah.

00:45:17.346 --> 00:45:18.880
So a couple people.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.660
Couple people.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.130
So we're running short on
time, so quick questions?

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.630
Yeah?

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:24.338
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think it's a quick one.

00:45:24.338 --> 00:45:26.440
So I'm a big fan of the
show "You're the Worst,"

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:29.100
and in particular your
performance on the show.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.240
And I'm just curious
how you ended up there,

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.150
and any sneak peeks
into the next season?

00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.750
Are you alive?

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:41.880
BEN FOLDS: Has the last one
that we filmed come out?

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.470
Oh.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:45.380
I did another one.

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.046
I'm sure they don't
mind me saying that.

00:45:47.046 --> 00:45:49.580
I think it's towards
the end of the season.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.410
And yeah, I still have
a pulse in this one.

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:56.080
And we've also talked
about if it ever

00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:02.950
goes further, how close we
can get to me not being alive.

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:04.660
But for anyone
that doesn't know,

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:07.037
they just turned my
character into some guy

00:46:07.037 --> 00:46:09.370
who moves straight from North
Carolina, where I'm really

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:16.460
from, to LA is very jealous that
Moby is recognized and I'm not.

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.900
And I'm just really
impressed with mixed drinks.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:24.280
The weird thing about that
is just this sort of he

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:28.660
creates this weird little
world where, for some reason,

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.940
they don't have mixed
drinks in North Carolina.

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:34.760
I'm like, wow, you
can get alcohol here.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.190
And I just drink everything.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.700
Yeah.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.770
This next one, we went crazy.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:39.730
Yeah.

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:40.677
Yeah, it's fun.

00:46:40.677 --> 00:46:41.510
Thanks for watching.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:42.570
I enjoy it.

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:48.830
I had a kid the other day
ordering coffee, she goes,

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:53.580
are you the guy that plays
Ben Folds on you're the worst?

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.616
That's me.

00:46:56.616 --> 00:46:58.130
It's the best way
to get recognized.

00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.879
ALAN SEALES: Yeah?

00:46:58.879 --> 00:46:59.379
Over here.

00:46:59.379 --> 00:47:00.712
AUDIENCE: Another Ben over here.

00:47:00.712 --> 00:47:01.300
Hello.

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:02.030
BEN FOLDS: Are you Ben?

00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:03.020
AUDIENCE: I'm also a Ben.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.500
I think most of your fans
are named Ben apparently.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:05.780
BEN FOLDS: That's awesome.

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.710
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:09.293
If the time is short, maybe you
can choose one or combine them

00:47:09.293 --> 00:47:11.270
into one mega
answer of some sort.

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:12.950
One question is that you're
one of the few people who's

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:14.575
been on the radio
for the last 30 years

00:47:14.575 --> 00:47:16.640
and knows lots of
chords and jazz chords

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.866
and knows how to drive
in reverse to a chorus.

00:47:18.866 --> 00:47:20.990
How do you feel that pop
music has sort of left all

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:22.304
these different chords behind?

00:47:22.304 --> 00:47:22.970
BEN FOLDS: Yeah.

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.880
AUDIENCE: With songs of one
repeating chord progression.

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.620
Number two, quite
different, I always

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:30.120
admired that when you sang, I
felt like it was actually you,

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.560
like your voice, a part of
you're talking but on notes.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.900
How did you find
your singing voice?

00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:36.900
BEN FOLDS: Well, thanks.

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:41.490
I think those are two
really neat points

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:43.460
about music in general.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:47.860
The singing thing is
that I didn't think

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.002
I was going to be a singer.

00:47:49.002 --> 00:47:50.960
I thought I would write
songs for other people.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:53.230
So the bands that I
played in to begin with,

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:57.520
I made sure they had singers.

00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:59.620
I always played
in various bands,

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.570
and one or two of
the guys in the band

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.720
would have great voices, and
they would do singery things.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.310
They sang loudly.

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:07.330
They used vibrato.

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:08.950
They did little riffs and stuff.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:12.340
And I thought that
would be a good thing.

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.470
I hear the song in my
head, and I think, oh,

00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:17.490
if this has a great singer,
then that'll be a great thing.

00:48:17.490 --> 00:48:20.860
But it wasn't that satisfying
to hear them do that.

00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:22.870
I would make tapes for
them where I would say,

00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:24.520
here's how the song goes.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:29.260
And the song would
just be humbly speak

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.000
singing would be it.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:35.200
And I think that the
recordings started

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.332
showing themselves to be a
lot more interesting than what

00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:39.290
we were coming up with.

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:44.200
And so I would try to get
the singers to not sing,

00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.380
to speak on pitches.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:51.210
I also had a little
bit of a piano mentor

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:52.980
for about a year at school.

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:54.540
I wasn't majoring in piano.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:58.960
But for one year before
this guy retired,

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:03.357
he gave me a full scholarship
to just study piano with him.

00:49:03.357 --> 00:49:05.190
And most of the time,
we didn't study piano.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.540
We just talked about music.

00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:10.040
And he asked me if I'd
considered how great this guy

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:10.990
he had just heard.

00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:13.590
He goes, I recently
heard a young man

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:15.764
by the name of Eric Clapton.

00:49:15.764 --> 00:49:16.680
Have you heard of him?

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.030
Like, yeah, I've
heard of Eric Clapton.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:23.460
And he said, he seems to me
to speak on pitches, which

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.490
is interesting, because it
gives more weight to the things

00:49:26.490 --> 00:49:27.960
that he's singing about.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.930
Why would a man like
that be singing at all

00:49:30.930 --> 00:49:32.552
unless he had something to say?

00:49:32.552 --> 00:49:34.260
And I thought that's
kind of interesting,

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:36.690
and I think that those things,
I adopted those things.

00:49:36.690 --> 00:49:43.260
As far as chords go, I've
always loved harmony and chords.

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:49.170
And it can be its
own puzzle, you

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:53.220
know, the harmony and moving,
even moving key centers,

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:55.470
and they mean different things.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:50:01.530
And I think that rock
and roll music has,

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:05.760
sort of like with the voice,
there can be an assumption

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.100
that someone who just plays one
chord must have more to say,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:16.582
and that by distracting yourself
with the frivolity of trying

00:50:16.582 --> 00:50:18.540
to drive yourself through
different key centers

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:22.710
and you're making music
into a Rubik's cube somehow,

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:27.030
or it's too much ornamentation.

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:32.190
I think Bob Dylan might have
had a lot to do with that.

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:35.960
In that, you hear
someone like Dylan,

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.110
the simplicity is
part of what's great.

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:40.880
He seems like he knows
what he's talking about.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.290
And he sounds wise,
and almost sounds

00:50:44.290 --> 00:50:46.670
like, I can't be bothered
with all these chords.

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:47.920
And I've got something to say.

00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:50.480
I don't have time for
this little hobby.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.480
And so by the time
I came through,

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.240
it was really not cool to
play any more than a couple

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.490
of chords, couple,
three chords, and this

00:50:57.490 --> 00:50:59.450
was during the grunge period.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.920
And so that's all I
needed to use more chords.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:04.070
That kind of pissed me off.

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:06.340
I felt like, oh,
I'm not allowed?

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:08.650
All right, punk
rock, let's do this.

00:51:08.650 --> 00:51:12.010
So I would just really
flex that part, because I

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:13.000
thought it was pretty.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.600
And there's all
sorts of subversion.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:23.680
And in the punk rock culture,
playing piano in itself

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:26.080
was offensive.

00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.270
So we would play.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:28.300
That's what we booked.

00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:32.470
We just booked punk rock grunge
clubs during most of the '90s.

00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:38.830
And I loved looking out and
playing jazz chords and like--

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:39.400
That's nice.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:41.380
I enjoyed that.

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:42.130
ALAN SEALES: Cool.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:42.796
All right, yeah?

00:51:42.796 --> 00:51:44.110
Final quick question.

00:51:44.110 --> 00:51:45.560
Then we get to
some performances.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.290
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:50.530
So I was always interested
in how just creative a lot

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:51.520
of your music is.

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.290
And I'm a hobbyist composer.

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:56.050
And sometimes, I get stuck
into doing similar song

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:58.270
structures or similar chords.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:52:01.330
So I was wondering if you
had any tips that maybe you

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:04.960
used to try and get yourself
to be more creative?

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:09.460
BEN FOLDS: Well, I don't think
that using the same structure

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:15.670
over and over again
necessarily has to do anything

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:16.930
with the creative part.

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:19.420
I think you can be really,
really creative within a really

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.010
confined sort of structure.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:25.750
You could decide that you
were the guy who was AB guy,

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:28.120
and you were going to write
it all in the same key,

00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.850
and that would be fine.

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:36.480
If you feel like that's
limiting you in some way,

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.720
then I don't know.

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.420
I think it's
important to remember

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.420
that a song is there
to communicate a thing,

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:51.160
and that it needn't
do anymore than that.

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.930
I think that can free you
up a lot in form and key

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:58.290
and everything, because the
necessity to communicate

00:52:58.290 --> 00:53:02.160
the thing that you're coming
up with means that that drives.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:04.020
That drives things.

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.620
You might have a cadence
where you thought you were

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.320
going to end on I don't know.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:11.850
If you had gone--

[PIANO MUSIC]

00:53:14.334 --> 00:53:15.500
And that was really similar.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.870
It's just like that's all it is.

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:23.462
And then you get stuck in
something way too long.

00:53:23.462 --> 00:53:25.170
There's something
complicated about that.

00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:27.670
But the fact that you got stuck
in it so long says something

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:30.800
about how you were stuck in your
life, or your ideas, or the way

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.490
you felt about it, or that
you were scared to progress

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.660
in your life, or you were
scared of what's next,

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:39.400
or you just you were
high and you couldn't

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:40.400
remember the next chord.

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.290
Who knows what it might be.

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:45.530
But if always your--

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:48.840
that was really nothing.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:51.770
I shouldn't even
have played that.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:57.050
I think that's the first thing
is always, how do you feel?

00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:58.900
How does this moment feel?

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:01.690
How can you get that across?

00:54:01.690 --> 00:54:06.080
Then if you need more
vocabulary, you'll find it.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:08.710
If you can't find the
word, it doesn't come out,

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:11.630
then that's when you
reach for the thesaurus.

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:12.190
You know?

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:13.430
You think about those things.

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:16.550
And I think the same is
true of song structure.

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:21.450
I always like to play
with song structure.

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:25.940
I like to question it too much.

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:29.170
So while I'm writing, it's
always a concern of mine

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:32.470
that it doesn't have
the same structure.

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:36.760
And a lot of times I find that
the effect that the song was

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:40.540
having on me emotionally
before I messed with it so much

00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:41.062
was there.

00:54:41.062 --> 00:54:42.520
And then I messed
with it and tried

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.300
to do something odd with it.

00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:46.180
So what I do then
because I'm not

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.730
getting the chill at that point,
or I'm not hearing applause

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:51.070
in the back of my head
at the end of the song,

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:53.290
it's not doing the
thing, I go back

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:56.240
and I put it into a really
predictable song structure.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:55:01.600
And I mean down to the point
where I'm timing the intro.

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.540
Because if the intro is not
falling between 12 and 15

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:08.662
seconds, then maybe I
should lay out the songs

00:55:08.662 --> 00:55:10.120
so that it falls
at the right time.

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:14.240
For some reason, we want to
hear a chorus at one minute.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.120
I don't know why.

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.240
But sometimes,
you want to hear--

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.656
so there are certain songs
that work so well, because they

00:55:18.656 --> 00:55:21.120
start with the chorus.

00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.870
And like I don't know, something
like "Dancing Queen" by Abba,

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:30.360
which that's a fun song, because
it starts with the bridge.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.540
You can dance.

00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:35.850
It's like the party
was just going.

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:39.210
And then the doors
open, and you're in it.

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.850
And there's something really
compelling about that.

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:43.650
That's when you mess with form.

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:46.260
Otherwise, I think the
form can be your friend.

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.500

my whole upload on form there.

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:40.437
And there's a middle
part, and I don't

01:02:40.437 --> 01:02:41.520
know if I can remember it.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.650
But we'll find out.

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:45.840
I always said, I hate
when I play with,

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:48.287
by the way, with musicians
who make disclaimers.

01:02:48.287 --> 01:02:49.370
And I've made two of them.

01:02:49.370 --> 01:02:51.350
So smack myself.

[BEN FOLDS SINGING "LULLABY"]

01:05:14.736 --> 01:05:17.226
That's the part.

There we go.

01:06:55.882 --> 01:06:56.625
Thank you.

01:07:07.610 --> 01:07:12.170
That little riff, I
totally screwed up,

01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:15.060
was something that I came
up with when I was about 13.

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:17.640
And I could do when I was 13.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:20.276
My mother had
taken me to a piano

01:07:20.276 --> 01:07:22.400
teacher, seemed like the
fun piano teacher in town.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.320
He was a younger guy
who played rock music.

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.990
And she heard outside
the door as I showed him

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:32.060
how to do this riff for
half an hour, she fired him.

01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.630
But it's funny, because
for anyone who plays piano,

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:38.875
it involves hitting the
same note several times

01:07:38.875 --> 01:07:39.750
with the same finger.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:42.917
But it's a-- god,
listen to that.

01:07:42.917 --> 01:07:43.500
I can't do it.

That's what I was doing at 13.

01:07:54.896 --> 01:07:55.880
OK, anyway.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.101
All right, next.

And this one by request as well.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.570
And I guess that's the
third and last one.

01:08:07.570 --> 01:08:10.300
I'm not going to count the riff.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.930
