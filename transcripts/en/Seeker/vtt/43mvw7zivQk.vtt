00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.730
Banish your fears
while you sleep.

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:02.730
It could be possible.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:03.365
Here's how.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.140
Hey, this is Annie for D News.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.730
Now, all of us are scared of
something, rational or not--

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.170
spiders, snakes, flying,
needles, heights, clowns,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.932
umbrellas.

00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:19.390
OK, that last one
might be just me.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.181
But think about it.

00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:21.540
They're all pointy, and ugh.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.350
Anyway, according to a new study
from Northwestern University,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.731
the secret to overcoming
fear could lie in your sleep.

00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:28.980
We all know it's important
to get a good night's rest.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.355
As we talked about before on
the show, getting enough z's

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:33.520
can improve attention
span, physical and creative

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.600
performance, among
many other benefits.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.890
But new research indicates
that sleep can also

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.760
play a role in eradicating fear.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.890
Here's how it worked.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.630
The research team
showed adult subjects

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.210
a photo of different faces.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.050
But for two of those, they
also received small shocks.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.920
They also smelled a sense for
each photo-- clove, lemon,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.832
mint, et cetera.

00:00:50.832 --> 00:00:52.290
And they eventually
learned to fear

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.390
the faces that were
associated with the shock,

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.080
as measured by sweat
levels and neuroimaging.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.570
Then the subjects went to sleep.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.340
And once they were in the deep
phase known as slow wave sleep,

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.080
they were re-exposed to some
of the smells associated

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.540
with the pictures
and the shocks.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.774
Well, the researchers found
that after being exposed

00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:09.440
to the smells during
sleep, the subjects

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.450
had a less fearful
response to those

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.242
faces that they
linked with shock.

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:14.700
The study is based
in what's called

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.354
exposure therapy for phobias,
where you're gradually

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:19.770
exposed to something until you
become comfortable with it,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.710
starting with say, a
picture of a spider,

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.200
then slowly working your way
up to actually holding one.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.950
And in this case,
the exposure happened

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.700
during the phase of
sleep that is believed

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.970
to play a role in memory
consolidation, where

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.050
the memories you accumulate
throughout the day

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.970
are solidified.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.970
Now, granted, the fears in
the were engineered, unlike,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.912
for example, that
intense fear of clowns

00:01:37.912 --> 00:01:40.120
you've had ever since that
first grade slumber party,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.890
where you watched
It that one time.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.030
But the researchers are
hopeful that down the road,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.080
sleep could be used to treat
existing phobias or even

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.850
conditions like PTSD that
deal with traumatic memories--

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:50.480
pretty cool.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.610
So do you have any phobias?

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.820
Let us know in the comments.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.350
I already told you my
weird umbrella thing,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.450
so now you have
to tell me yours.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.080
Till then, thanks
for watching D News,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.220
and I'll see you next time.
