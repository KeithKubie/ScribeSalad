00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:07.496
Voiceover: I painted the F-111 in 1964.

00:00:07.496 --> 00:00:11.663
F-111 was the latest American
Fighter Bomber in the planning stage.

00:00:11.663 --> 00:00:14.999
Its mission seemed obsolete
before it was finished.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.114
It seemed the prime
[forest] of this war machine

00:00:18.114 --> 00:00:21.959
was to economically keep people
employed in Texas and Long Island.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:26.436
At the time, I thought people involved
in it's making were headed for something

00:00:26.436 --> 00:00:28.019
but I didn't know what.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.265
By doing this, they could
achieved two and a half children,

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:33.107
three and a half cars, and
a house in the suburbs.

00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:37.856
In the painting I incorporated
orange spaghetti, cake,

00:00:37.856 --> 00:00:41.245
light bulbs, flowers
and many other things.

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:45.102
It felt to me like a plane flying
through the flack of an economy.

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:48.693
The little girl was the
pilot under a hair dryer.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.161
The swimmer gulping air was like searching
for air during an atomic holocaust.

00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:59.131
I had heard that the Chinese had
originally invented income taxes

00:00:59.131 --> 00:01:01.038
as a donation to static community.

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.979
Now that taxes were in demand, I
thought if I sold this painting

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.143
the joke would be that the
buyer had already bought

00:01:07.143 --> 00:01:09.270
a real F-111 with his taxes.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.853
I was concerned with peripheral vision.

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:16.194
I wanted to specify that whenever
one looked at would exist

00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:20.605
because of the peripheral vision that
extends from the corner of the eye.

00:01:20.605 --> 00:01:24.102
Thus one would question,
one's own self-consciousness.

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:29.292
In the 1960s the painting was
critically taken as an anti-work protest

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:33.457
but there were a multiplicity of
ideas that caused its existence.
