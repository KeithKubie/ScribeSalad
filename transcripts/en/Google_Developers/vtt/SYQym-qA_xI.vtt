BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
Good morning.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.265
Everyone looks up from
their tablets.

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:07.700
This is great.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.000
Yeah, thank you guys
so much for coming.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.810
We were a little worried Friday,
midday, either you

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.110
guys are all over hungover from
last night or just came

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.450
here for breakfast.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.540
So this is great.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.590
I'm Bridgette Sexton.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.920
I work on the Global
Entrepreneurship Outreach Team

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.650
here at Google.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.630
I've been at Google for about
years and focused on a lot of

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.040
different things, aka not
focused too much.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.590
I worked in advertising, and
then actually spent two years

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.000
working on our emerging markets
team in Ghana, and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.030
focused on Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.090
And I've spent a lot of time
at Google traveling.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.770
I think I hit my 50th country
last week, which is a little

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.180
exhausting I still
look this good.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.530
It's a joke, you guys need
to work on this.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.620
JON BRADFORD: You're
allowed to laugh.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.580
These are jokes.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.050
So our team--

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.120
lots of people ask about global

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.390
entrepreneurship, what we do.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.250
We really focus on developing
ecosystems around the world.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.560
There's a question from the
earlier session about Mexico.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.940
How How do we actually develop
our ecosystem there?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.400
And the guy said-- one of the
panelists up here said, it's

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.760
all about having good leadership
on the ground who's

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.330
investing and building that
infrastructure and building

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.360
that community.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.810
And we're very, very privileged
and lucky to have

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.030
five of those such people on
this panel with us today.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.830
I've pretty much interacted
with most of these people

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.150
through a lot of Google's
projects and partnerships that

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.010
we do globally in the
entrepreneurship space.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.750
Looking at, how can we help
with partnerships, and

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.080
products, and also with our
Google-specific programs to

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.230
encourage entrepreneurship?

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.210
And particularly, startups.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.490
UPS

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.890
I'm actually going to

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.590
introduce each of our panelists.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.030
The format is basically
we're going to have

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.200
some discussion here.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.660
These guys are quite lively.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.250
We've had a pretty hilarious
morning already.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.160
So feel free to ask
questions as well.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.790
We're going to have
about 15 minutes

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.490
at the end for questions.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.810
So please keep them.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.610
If you can, even write them down
so you're ready we have

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.120
that set up.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.030
So with that, we have, on my
left, Jonathan Bradford.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.450
Brad Is your name Jonathan
or just Jon?

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.290
JON BRADFORD: Well--

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.250
sorry.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.520
Everybody awake?

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.490
It's Jon and/or Jonathan
depending upon

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.170
whether you're my mother.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.030
So I prefer Jon.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.060
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: So Jon is
actually the founder of

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.340
Springboard, which is a
13-week Accelerator

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.830
program in the UK.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.600
He's actually helped found 13
Accelerator programs around

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.910
the world, from Moscow all
the way to Montreal.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.660
And he personally runs five of
them, which I am not sure how

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.230
he does that since I mostly
see you at conferences.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.670
And he is actually a former
accountant, which we are not

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.980
going to hold him to today.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.450
JON BRADFORD: Bad.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.400
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Yeah,
it's pretty sad.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.440
JON BRADFORD: Bad.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.630
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Eden is a
general manager, general

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.460
partner at Genesis, which is
an Israeli VC in Tel Aviv

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.600
that's focus on early
stage investment.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.275
He has had a number of good
exits, we'll say.

00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:01.010
He's been founder of
a few companies--

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.620
face.com, Aternity.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.870
And recently started an
incubator called The Junction

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.420
in Tel Aviv.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.630
And then we have Jehan, which
she is part of Pasha, which is

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.350
Pakistan-focused IT education
and training program.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.790
And they work to develop links
internationally for Pakistan

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.570
in the tech community.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.380
She's had 29 years of experience
working in this

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.155
field, helping bridge the tech
community in Pakistan to

00:03:28.155 --> 00:03:30.320
places like Dubai, Hong
Kong regionally and

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.590
the Valley as well.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.240
She's a huge advocate for
entrepreneurship and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.730
technology development
in Pakistan.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.760
Erik Hersman, the guy
with the big, red

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.070
daunting beard over here--

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.030
he's much friendlier
than he looks.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.520
You guys are a really
tough crowd.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.890
He's co-founder of Ushahidi,
which is a

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.040
crowdsourcing platform.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.490
Many of you have probably
heard of it.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.760
He started the iHub, which is an
innovation hub based out of

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.570
Nairobi, Kenya.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.840
He grew up in Sudan and
Kenya, has been a

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.980
long time in Africa.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.070
Although his Swahili is not that
good, which I found out

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.040
last night.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.100
And he's a senior TED Fellow
and is currently raising a

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.930
fund focused on technology
startups in Africa.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.589
Jeffrey Paine is the founder,
one of the founding partners

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.100
of Golden Gate ventures based
out of Singapore.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.050
He's focused on early stage
investments across the region

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.940
of Southeast Asia and also some
up into the rest of Asia.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.350
And he's also one of the
founders and managing partners

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.050
of Founders institute
and has helped that

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.670
grow across the continent.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.920
And also, a long-time VC.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.870
So please welcome me in
joining our panelists.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.400
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: All right,
so we're going

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.780
to get started here.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.530
In 142 characters or less, tell
me what is unique about

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.650
your market, your home market.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.995
Starting with you, Jon.

00:04:53.995 --> 00:04:55.330
Jonathan.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.960
JON BRADFORD: Jon.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.580
Definitely Jon.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:06.810
Interesting statistic: London
has 260 nationalities in it.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.910
The next largest city in the
world close to that is New

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.990
York, which is 150.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.700
It's a massive, massive
melting pot.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.470
And it's got great
entrepreneurial visas for

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.570
those that are interested.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.750
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Eden, what's
unique about your market?

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.360
EDEN SHOCHAT: Anyone here from
Israel, so I'll know whether--

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.580
OK, we do have.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.435
Bridgette asked for
a great statistic.

00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:31.495
So just the funny statistic is
that the general time to an

00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:33.970
exit is 5.8 years.

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.720
Average marriage in
Tel Aviv is 5.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.330
Anyways.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.000
So the interesting thing about
Israel, I think it's a very

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.310
small country.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.710
Depending how you count, it's
six, seven million people.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.990
Virtually almost zero
local market.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.970
We don't get along too
well with our region.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.600
So there's no regional
market either.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.320
So every startup from
the get-go is

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.500
international in nature.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.870
The stats are you have about
40,000, 50,000 engineers

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.850
working at any given point at
about 2,000, 3,000 startups.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.730
So basically, the issue, if
there is an issue in Israel

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.000
about entrepreneurship, it's
mostly that everyone wants to

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.940
be an entrepreneur, and
does not want to

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.820
be the first employee.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.730
So that's the biggest
problem that we want

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.380
and that we're tackling.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.960
Israel is the third largest
country in the NASDAQ.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.210
So we actually get many
companies out, IPO

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.040
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.450
So we are very international in
nature, and I think that's

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.340
pretty unique about
the country.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.950
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Yeah, you've
expanded your character limit.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.920
Jehan?

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.870
JEHAN ARA: OK, we have 187
million people, 60% of them

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:51.230
below the age of 30.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.620
We have only 25 million internet
users, but we have

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.490
about 120 million mobile
subscribers.

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.480
So I think that, in itself,
is a great opportunity.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.340
Many of the people who have a
mobile device or a mobile

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.500
phone have never
had a landline.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.140
And the country is vast.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.020
The youth bulge is an
opportunity, and yet can also

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.690
be a challenge.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.480
So many of us realize that there
will never be enough

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.760
jobs for all the people that
we have in the country.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.410
And it's growing by about
4% every year.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.530
So we're going to have many more
people before we stop.

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.580
And so we need to create
entrepreneurs.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.790
And I think everybody in the
country realizes that.

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.930
And so I'm very passionate
about doing what I can to

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.380
increase the number of
entrepreneurs in Pakistan.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.990
ERIK HERSMAN: So though I live
in Kenya, I'll speak for

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.330
Africa as a region, which
is always a mistake.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.780
But I'll try anyway.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.310
So we have a billion people
in the continent.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:55.900
And we have about 140 million
internet users,

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.170
which isn't very big--

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:00.500
14% of the population.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.910
And then the phone penetration
though, is

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.170
north of 700 million.

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:08.590
So over 70% mobile phone
penetration.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.220
So it shouldn't come as a
surprise to most people that

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.320
about 96% plus of all internet
traffic goes through the

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.350
mobile phone.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.290
And so the paradigm in Africa is
mobile first and everything

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.540
else would be second.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:22.700
JEFFREY PAINE: Hi.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:28.760
Just show of hands, who is
from Southeast Asia?

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.230
OK, great.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.650
So I'll speak on behalf
of Singapore.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.620
Singapore is also a very
small country.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.280
Our local domestic market
is very small.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.230
So in Southeast Asia, the
population is around 620

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:50.830
million, which is fairly massive
if you really count

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.780
the countries that are opening
up, like Myanmar right now.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.330
It's pretty interesting.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.660
Indonesia has just
over 250 million.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:06.690
And I think, as of last month,
the first ever $40 US Android

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.180
phone has come out from China.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.510
So what's going to happen?

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.880
I think in general, in Southeast
Asia, the mobile

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.660
penetration will keep going and
the PC penetration will

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.340
also keep going.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:24.020
So in general, mobile
penetration is always roughly

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.840
around 50% to 70% and PC
penetration is always below

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.370
50% for emerging markets.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.860
Take aside Singapore, Singapore
is a bit crazy.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:40.170
So it is extremely interesting
right now for Golden Gate.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.710
We have investors from the
Valley that is interested in

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:47.170
Southeast Asia because it is
showing signs of early stage

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.480
China and early stage Vietnam.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.725
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Thank
you so much, guys.

00:09:51.725 --> 00:09:53.850
So now we're going to move
into a round of specific

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.870
questions for each of them.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:57.090
Eden, you've had
many successful

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.750
startups, a lot of exits.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.670
And also, a lot of investments
in the region.

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.160
What made you start
The Junction?

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.040
It's kind of co-working
incubator space, why didn't

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.745
you start that in Israel,
the Startup Nation?

00:10:09.745 --> 00:10:11.700
EDEN SHOCHAT: So part of the
ecosystem in Israel in the

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:16.100
'90s, I think a major part of
'90s and early 2000 was

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.250
telecom type companies, security
type companies.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.530
Very strong back end processing,
mostly resulting

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.950
from the Israeli army.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.960
I'm not sure whether you know
we have mandatory service in

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.820
Israel, so 18 to 21.

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:33.050
And the good news is that there
are the intelligence

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:35.430
Corps units that actually
train some of the best

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.980
computer scientists worldwide
in actual

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:40.920
mission-critical systems.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:44.440
So that actually created awesome
companies that came

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.780
out, but the army doesn't do
e-commerce or mobile much.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:54.670
So there are certain things that
you don't get trained as

00:10:54.670 --> 00:11:00.360
well, which are now the biggest
potential growth

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.350
engines for pretty
much any startup.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:06.610
So when I moved over to the dark
side, as some would say

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.000
of VCing, I thought what you
just need to modify, is find a

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.720
way to invest in early
stage startups.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:18.030
So syndicate, make sure that
money is readily available,

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:19.530
get great deal flow.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.340
So just the basics of
venture capital.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.520
The truth was though, and I
think that's part of the

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.320
ecosystem of any international
country right now that wants

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.370
to create those kind of startups
is there weren't good

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:35.520
consumer-oriented startups.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.590
They were sporadic.

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.100
There was no information
sharing between them.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.440
And they just couldn't do what
you can do in Silicon Valley.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.470
So The Junction was kind of a
prototype that we thought, how

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:49.400
can we get better companies?

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.650
So there are just three
questions that you get asked

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:54.670
before joining.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.980
The first one is,
are you working

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.320
on the venture full-time?

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.310
The second one is, is
the entire team

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.590
going to work together?

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:04.350
And the third one is, are you
willing to work 90% of your

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.020
time on your own startup and
10% of the time on other

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:10.120
people's startup that are
siting just next to you?

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.650
And surprisingly, not many
people actually answer yes to

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.790
all of these.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.500
But once you do answer yes,
you actually create an

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.810
interesting critical mass.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.150
And that's what The Junction
is all about, .

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.980
it's creating a pay-it-forward
economy where

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.210
we don't take anything.

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.180
As a VC we can take a very
long-term look, so we can look

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.200
10 years ahead.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:37.150
And we don't care about
short-term revenue.

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.900
So what we actually
do is we don't ask

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.920
anything from the companies.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.370
And in return, we ask them
to help each other.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:47.520
So the gist of this is, The
Junction is all about to

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.800
create that kind of
companies, the

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.520
consumer, the B2C companies.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:54.660
Which, I believe, is a huge
opportunity for any

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:56.260
entrepreneur outside
of the US.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.450
What you care about in a B2C
company is analytics, funnel,

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.580
things that everyone is familiar
and you can get all

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.020
the resources that you want.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.990
Even outside of the Valley.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.700
But to achieve that,
you actually need

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:07.670
to create that ecosystem.

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:09.140
And The Junction is
all about that.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:09.940
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Cool.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.600
Thank you.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:14.000
I think Jon's been working in
this field for a while--

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.840
12, 13 Accelerator
programs now.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.630
What do you see these
guys producing?

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:21.770
What has surprised you about
working with all these

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:23.640
different programs globally?

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.540
And do you think any of them
are better or worse, any of

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.000
these particular ecosystems
you're working with?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.790
JON BRADFORD: So the one thing I
personally and very strongly

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.540
believe is no particular country
or geographic region

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.910
has a monopoly on
entrepreneurs.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.880
I believe that there's a
balance, there's a proportion

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.470
that exists that mad, crazy
people who want to do stuff,

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:51.030
which is totally irrational and
start their own business

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:54.570
when the chances of ever
achieving are nil, are the

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:57.130
same the world over.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.770
The subtle differences in
certain other geographic

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.360
regions, they may be
doing other things.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.370
And one of the things that I've
discovered is, actually

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.030
if you give them the tools and
the support from the community

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:12.600
and other entrepreneurs, you can
kind of guide them down a

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.800
path which is what I
call product-led.

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.440
So moving away--

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.730
[INAUDIBLE] recently
in this room.

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.340
But in the world I exist in, I
see a lot of people building

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:25.020
stuff for other people,
service-led stuff.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.380
It has no impact.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.410
It's unscalable.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:29.580
You can't export it.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.370
Or if you do, it's really
difficult to create any value,

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.200
or meaningful value.

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.370
What I've noticed is in all of
the countries I've worked in,

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:44.580
as I described from Montreal to
Moscow, entrepreneurs exist

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:48.350
and they have the same passion,
and the same hunger,

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:50.630
and the same desires.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.740
They just want to find soulmates
to work alongside,

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.400
which is kind of what's being
achieved in Israel.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.230
And when you give them
that opportunity,

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.330
they run towards it.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.936
And they run toward
it really quickly.

00:15:04.936 --> 00:15:06.960
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: I almost made
a dating reference there

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.030
from the soulmates comment,
but I held back.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.470
You guys are a really tough
crowd, actually.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.400
JON BRADFORD: Yeah.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.390
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: We've been
warming up all morning.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:17.570
JON BRADFORD: Yeah, the
other one I actually

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.250
use is fellow travelers.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:22.120
That's the big advantage that
Silicon Valley has, is there's

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.190
so many more fellow
travelers who are

00:15:24.190 --> 00:15:26.200
moving in the same direction.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.390
That doesn't necessarily mean
that you can't achieve that in

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.050
other places.

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:32.610
It's just you have to create
critical mass around something

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:33.630
to make it happen.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.226
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Yeah,
I definitely agree.

00:15:35.226 --> 00:15:37.250
You know, Jeff, you've done
a lot of investing

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.650
in Southeast Asia.

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.560
And there's not as many
incubators and Accelerator

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.500
programs as developed.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.350
What are you guys investing in
at Golden Gate Ventures given

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.862
that every country has its own
culture, every country has its

00:15:48.862 --> 00:15:51.700
own language, and it's
very segmented?

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.360
And particularly, without kind
of these ecosystems as quite

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.880
as evolved.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.290
JEFFREY PAINE: Right.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:01.210
So basically, Golden Gate
Ventures, we look at more

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.880
towards consumer-facing
companies.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:10.020
So we do look at mobile a lot,
consumer internet, games, and

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:13.110
also software as a service.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:18.380
What's been challenging is
obviously within a four-hour

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.510
flight, you get to see many
countries, different

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.360
languages, different cultures.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.330
Singapore is a developed
country.

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.080
We are right smack
in the middle

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.240
of developing countries.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:34.140
And we kind of get along
with them quite well.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.020
I think, yeah.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.690
So the challenge is
a few things.

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.330
Number one, they tend
to think very small.

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.990
So division-wise, it's
fairly small.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.260
They tend to think very
local or hyperlocal.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.830
They need to be a little
bit crazy.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:56.080
And what's also missing is a
layer of mentors that have

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.760
been there, done that.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.200
And not been there, done
that 10 years ago.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.770
Been there, done that within
five years because technology

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.589
changes so fast.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.569
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Jeff, can I
ask you, what's your latest

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.109
investment?

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.849
And why?

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:15.329
JEFFREY PAINE: Sure.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.160
So I think, let's see.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:22.530
The latest one was sort of
an enterprise company.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:29.080
They do flight operations, ERP
for small aviation companies.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.880
It's pretty interesting.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.190
They originate from Malaysia.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:36.110
But they have client base
all over the world.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.050
So that's kind of different
in that sense.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.680
They go global from day one
because they know if they go

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.360
hyperlocal they will die.

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.465
They don't have enough
money to survive.

00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:51.050
And in general, in Southeast
Asia, maybe in the other parts

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.810
of emerging countries,
there is a pressure

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.360
to make money fast.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:57.710
To survive quickly.

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:03.810
So sometimes innovation
takes a second seat

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.580
to surviving quickly.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.270
JON BRADFORD: I actually would
disagree with that.

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.980
So one of the things that
actually gets pushed really

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.390
hard around in Europe
is the fact that we

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.210
get to money faster.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.010
Because there's less capital
in the market, we actually

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.520
have to go and say, well, do
customers want to actually pay

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.480
real, cold, hard cash
to make this happen?

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.320
And a really good example of
that is Huddle, which is based

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.300
in San Fransciso are split
between London and the Valley.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.740
Just closed out at
$23 million.

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.880
But they aggressively
went after--

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.680
forget the bloody
freemium model.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:40.712
It's like somebody has to pay
me cash to make this happen.

00:18:40.712 --> 00:18:42.930
And actually, in smaller--

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:45.880
whether it's restrictions around
capital, I actually

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.330
personally think that
that's a good thing.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.280
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Erik, you've
been working in a very early

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.050
stage market, many would say.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:54.680
What's the technology
ecosystem?

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.011
What are you talking
about, Africa and

00:18:56.011 --> 00:18:56.970
the technology ecosystem?

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.400
Is that even possible?

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.050
And you started iHub, which is
a technology innovation hub.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.020
And you're also working
on a fund.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:06.530
I'd love to know what the role
of iHub is in that community

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:07.910
and what you're looking at--

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:10.540
and you start to raise
this fund as well.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.370
ERIK HERSMAN: So we first
started the iHub because we

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:14.480
had this really--

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.060
we did have a vibrant tech
culture in Nairobi, but it

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.210
wasn't centered anywhere.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.730
So people hardly met.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.930
And so we thought, well, what if
we just built a place that

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.460
we could call our own, have a
coffee shop in it, and guys

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.040
got to hang out?

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:31.020
So we have over 8,000 members
now all from Nairobi, about

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:32.670
95% from Nairobi.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.090
And what they're doing is
they're just getting together

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:35.950
and meeting.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:38.140
And so a lot of people
say, well, what's the

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:38.890
value of the iHub?

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.880
Actually, Google Africa is
based out of Nairobi.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.740
So Google Africa is
a partner of ours.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.240
And I remember going and seeing
Joe Mucharu who was the

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.240
Africa director at the time, and
talking to him about this

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.330
place and saying, hey, we
need your support here.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.850
And he and his team
they said, so--

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:56.980
being Google.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:58.710
So how are you going
to measure success?

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.951
And we sat there, we were like,
we don't even have paint

00:20:00.951 --> 00:20:02.550
on the walls yet.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.360
And we're thinking.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.500
I said, well, we think if you
just put enough smart people

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.010
in a room, good things
will happen.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.150
And so after about a minute of
quiet, everybody looks at each

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.640
other and starts smiling and
saying, OK, well, we'll back

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.490
it anyway, even though
we don't really

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.670
know how it will work.

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.710
And the truth is you have to
experiment things when you're

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.700
in a new market like this
because there's just no way to

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.810
know what's actually
going to work.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.970
So getting a bunch of smart
people in a room did work.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:30.550
We have about 45 companies have
been kind of born out of

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.890
it over the last two years.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:34.210
Some of them have
failed already.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.170
Some of them have gone on
and gotten more funding.

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:39.830
Some of them have actually
gotten funding from Bay Area

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.730
VCs and are getting bigger.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:46.400
So when you're in a new space
like that, in a nascent

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:48.210
market, you're building
everything.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:51.270
You actually are building the
market many times, itself.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.600
Which is exciting, but it
has a lot of challenges.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.600
And for us, it's really just
about bringing people together

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.150
and seeing what happens.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.950
And then going onto the seed
funding side, which is what

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.490
we've done with the
Savannah Fund.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:07.820
Is just saying, can we apply the
Accelerator model that's

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.060
from the Bay Area, from
Europe, something

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.360
like that, to Africa?

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.420
Will it work there?

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.360
Again, an experiment.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.750
We'll find out.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.680
We have about half the fund
raise right now and we'll find

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.180
out by probably this time next
year how well it does.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.910
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: If anyone's
interested in writing checks,

00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:24.843
you can see Erik after this.

00:21:24.843 --> 00:21:27.010
EDEN SHOCHAT: Actually,
Bridgette said not to talk

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:28.280
about the specific event called

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.210
GeeCON, which we're doing.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:35.080
Or not to turn the panel into
a discussion about GeeCON.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.870
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Eden's
passion is

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:37.720
actually really in GeeCON.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.680
So if we let him, he
will [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.570
If you guys want to riot at some
point, we're OK with it.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.070
EDEN SHOCHAT: So anyway,
it's a three-day event.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.720
And Google is sponsoring it, so
I'm actually allowed to--

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.030
it actually gives something
back to Google.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:52.190
But I would very much agree with
the point that you need

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:53.270
to create critical mass.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.400
I think I've heard three times
already that word mentioned.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.950
And it's all about being able
to create those teams.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:02.410
The question is, in every
country is, how do you create

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.040
those teams that they'll be able
to do something together?

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.520
The most important thing for
every entrepreneur is to be

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:11.360
able to convince the team
members that they actually

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.570
should be doing whatever that
he thinks or they think that

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.460
they should be doing, and way
before they have funding.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:22.170
So when you actually have that
burn rate, when every month

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.990
you have a reduced amount in
your bank account just because

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:26.570
you're doing your passion.

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:28.960
And the question is, how do
you build those teams?

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.960
That's a huge question
in every market.

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.920
GeeCON as a three-day event,
just brings people as the

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.180
hardware, and software, and
art, and just get them to

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:37.830
build stuff.

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:38.735
There's crazy stuff.

00:22:38.735 --> 00:22:39.840
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Do you want
to tell us what the

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.100
purpose of GeeCON is?

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:41.890
EDEN SHOCHAT: Oh, yeah.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:43.670
The purpose is to create
useless projects.

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.275
So think--

00:22:45.275 --> 00:22:47.930
no, no, and that's the
actual definition.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.180
Because people are so much more
creative when they are

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.430
told to do something that is
not meaningful versus--

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.980
OK, I have the socially
acceptable.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.680
I need to make money.

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:57.820
I need to do something else.

00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.440
So things like a trampoline
that you jump and your

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:02.230
silhouette becomes your
login password.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.820
So if you want to get back to
your PC, you need to jump

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.660
exactly that same way again.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.900
Which could be productive
in some fashion.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.800
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: It's a
weight loss program.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.750
EDEN SHOCHAT: Weight
loss program, yeah.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.520
Or really, really crazy stuff.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:24.010
But from that, you actually had,
as of last month, seven

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.820
teams that started companies
as of right now, about 11.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:29.950
So it actually had
a good success.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:32.600
And that's the basis, in my
mind, to just starting things

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.340
up, is critical mass.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.930
ERIK HERSMAN: Just a little
thing to kind of

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:37.020
pivot off that, too.

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:38.810
I think here in the States--

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:40.900
I lived in the States for
about six, seven years.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.860
And it's interesting because
here in the States it's

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.950
socially acceptable within the
culture for you to wear jeans

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.540
and a t-shirt and be at work.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.300
And that could be at
a coffee shop.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:55.156
But in Kenya, or in many places
in Africa, if you don't

00:23:55.156 --> 00:23:57.630
wear a suit and tie, you don't
go to the city center, you're

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.230
family doesn't consider
that you have a job.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.815
And so it's really difficult.

00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:04.880
You have to create this culture
about it being that

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.420
you do this other
kind of stuff.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.320
So I guess we're a little bit
further down the stack than

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.590
some other countries.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.010
But it's really interesting to
see how you can build that

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:16.250
kind of a culture out in
whatever part of the world

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.930
that you're in.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.380
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Yeah, I always
love when people come

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.370
to Google in suits.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.820
It's like the first time anyone
feels so awkwardly

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.960
dressed up at a business
meeting.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.260
JON BRADFORD: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:29.790
actually wrote a really
interesting essay on startup

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:31.230
cultures and communities.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:34.690
And actually, one of things he
described in that essay was,

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:37.660
how do you make being an
entrepreneur really cool and

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.920
being the most normal
thing in the world?

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.590
And the problem is,
entrepreneurs exist, but

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.130
they're such a minority within
the overall population.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:50.090
When they actually all clamber
together and work alongside

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:51.950
each other, they can, as
I describe, stare at

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.880
the window and point.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.770
Look at all those weird
people outside.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.290
They work for other people.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:58.800
And it's kind of that notional
idea of turning something

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.960
which is considered unacceptable
culturally in

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.230
certain instances, into just the
most normal, boring, this

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.950
is what we do.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.240
This is the coolest stuff
in the world.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:08.660
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Yeah.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.060
And that's actually what Jehan's
trying to do right now

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.690
in Pakistan, is create the
culture where entrepreneurs

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:14.030
are celebrated.

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.710
And you've actually been
running a fund

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:16.580
for the last year.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.640
I've love to hear-- it's the
Social Innovation Fund focused

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.780
on these kind of social
impact startups.

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.360
Can tell us a little bit
about the impact of

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.790
that fund so far?

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:25.080
JEHAN ARA: OK.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.220
So historically in Pakistan,
the tech sector has

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.380
concentrated on building
applications

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.390
for people with money.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.650
So mainly for the financial
sector, whether domestically

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.020
or internationally.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.420
But there are a lot of problems
within the country

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.960
that need to be solved.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.960
And many of the young people
living in the country know how

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.560
to solve those problems.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:51.800
What we did was just to open
their minds to the fact that

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.410
you can do it using
technology.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:58.410
And so Google helped us, seeded
a fund in Pakistan,

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:02.070
which is $250,000 fund.

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:06.050
And we've been managing
it for the last year.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.800
The reason that it was needed,
sometimes I don't even think

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.600
you need money to start
working on an idea.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.100
But these young people at
universities and fresh

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.910
graduates think that without
money you can't do anything.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:22.370
So we figured, OK, let's get
rid of that mindset and

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.700
actually give them the money.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:29.190
Actually, what they need is
guidance, mentoring, helping

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:30.730
them sort of put a
team together.

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:33.110
Because very often what happens,
and I think this

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.840
happens all around the world,
is geeks who work together

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.500
sort of try and put together a
team without having anybody

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.440
with any business knowledge,
or anybody with

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.450
any marketing knowledge.

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:45.520
And so they create things that
they find exciting, but they

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.820
don't know what the consumer
will like.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.900
And so with the Social
Innovation Fund what we've

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:54.030
done is we ask for ideas
and we got--

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.420
within the first week, we had
300 people sort of write in

00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.040
with ideas that they thought
were really cool.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.460
And we chose--

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.990
our jury actually chose five of
those ideas and said, OK,

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:09.240
we'll fund this but we will
attach it with milestones.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.680
And we will attach them to
mentors who will guide them

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.010
through the process.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:16.490
So we know that many of them
may fail, but that failure

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.430
will teach them a lot.

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:20.530
Some of the ideas that
came out was--

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:22.560
that you may not even consider
social innovation.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.350
So one of them was the
resurgence of the national

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.220
language, Urdu.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.580
Because many of us think it's
cool to speak English and so

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.560
we're forgetting our culture,
we're forgetting our heritage.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:37.470
We don't know all the
literature, the rich culture

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:38.330
that exists.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:40.830
And so two of the young
people said, we want a

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:41.820
resurgence in this.

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.700
And the reason that kids prefer
not to speak in Urdu,

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:50.460
or not to read Urdu literature
is because it isn't cool.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.720
There's nothing innovative
that exists.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.980
There's nothing that you can
download onto your iPod, or to

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.900
your mobile phone
and listen to.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.450
And so they started recording
some of these stories, and

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.970
some of these songs, and some
of the poetry onto these

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:09.560
devices and making it
downloadable from a website.

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.230
And that has created a lot of
excitement, not only in the

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.450
kids within Pakistan, but
amongst expat Pakistanis in

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.950
the US, in Europe, et cetera,
who think that the kids and

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:22.390
losing touch with their heritage
and their language.

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:23.390
So that was one.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.950
Another one was that there are
several diseases still in

00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:30.030
Pakistan that may have
been eradicated

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:30.940
all around the world.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.770
And blood is often needed,
blood donations.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.810
And it's very difficult
to find them.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:39.640
And sometimes it's really
critical that it be found

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.300
immediately.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:44.010
So this one young man who has
a network of about 200,000

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.150
already on social media said,
I know all these people.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:49.950
I'm going to create something
using technology which will

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:53.980
connect blood donors to
hospitals, and to people who

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:54.610
need blood.

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:56.560
And so he's working
on that project.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.450
And already, we had a Dengue
attack where he was able to

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:04.320
connect people to blood donors,
and was able to save a

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:04.860
lot of lives.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.700
So those kind of projects, I
think, are helping kids not

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:13.590
only solve problems for the
community, but they're also

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:16.850
getting them to think about how
to take a project from an

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:20.290
idea stage onto an actual
implementation stage.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:22.660
And then they can work on
commercial ideas using the

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.320
same logic.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.830
So I think that it's really
amazing what it has been able

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:27.580
to do so far.

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.080
We've funded about five ideas.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.800
Only About $10,000 each.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.520
And we're looking at funding
the next five

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.750
within the next month.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:36.940
The first year was difficult
because we were sort of

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.530
learning as we went along.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.530
But now we think that that
process will be accelerated.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.310
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Yeah,
I think it's amazing.

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:46.505
Something I'm always struck by
now living in the Valley and

00:29:46.505 --> 00:29:49.190
then still getting to travel
a lot is, actually a lot of

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.540
startups here--

00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:51.880
no offense--

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.900
are actually just creating
features.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.760
And another thing for
me to log-in to that

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.780
I'm going to forget.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.230
And I'm going to type that
little forgot password thing

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.590
every single time.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.510
What I've found in a lot of
the emerging markets and

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.563
internationally is people
are actually

00:30:05.563 --> 00:30:06.480
trying to solve problems.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.600
And there is actually revenue
behind many of these

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.380
opportunities.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:13.640
And a social focus, or actually
solving a real

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.890
problem can create sustained
revenue.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:18.710
You're not going to be pushed
out of the market quite as

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:19.520
easily I think.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.410
JEHAN ARA: So one of the things
that we haven't funded,

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:25.650
but that has also started off
as a social idea, but has

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.085
being able to generate revenue
for the people who started it

00:30:28.085 --> 00:30:30.060
is something like
what happens--

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:32.250
what already exists
in Kenya is the

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:34.970
M-Pesia Branches Banking.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:38.310
In a population of 187 million,
we only have 20

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.490
million who have
bank accounts.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.790
So how do the rest
of them operate?

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.980
They don't seem to have any way
of transferring funds or

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.870
paying for things.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:52.150
And so Easypaisa is a solution
that came on

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.170
and they have been--

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:54.910
BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
Great naming.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.840
JEHAN ARA: Yeah.

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:58.690
What they do is enable payments

00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:59.890
through a mobile phone.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.480
And it's a very easy process.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.420
And every kiosk selling
cigarettes or anything is a

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.650
certified Easypaisa vendor.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:10.870
And all you do is show them an
identity and should give them

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.400
their mobile number, and they
can transfer the funds to

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.190
somebody with another mobile.

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:18.000
So 120 million people having
access to mobile

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.950
phones, it sort of--

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.400
suddenly everybody has that
power of transferring funds,

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.730
paying for things, paying
utility bills, all that.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.040
And it's a very easy solution.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.120
It's a social solution.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.610
And yet, it generates revenue
for the people who funded it.

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:34.250
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Yeah,
it's great.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:35.860
I think one thing you
mentioned is around

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.910
milestones.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.450
And I was talking with these
two, I think two days ago, and

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:41.350
you guys were mentioning that
you like to do really small

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.310
seed investments, and lots
of them despite how

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:44.960
much work they are.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.340
Something along the
milestone marker.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.060
Why do you do that?

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.140
Why do you do a lot of small
seed investments despite the

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.890
amount of work?

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.770
JON BRADFORD: Because
I'm not lazy.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:56.780
So I used to be a VC,
as I described for

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.450
about 3 and 1/2 minutes.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.115
I used to do a lot
of seed funding.

00:32:00.115 --> 00:32:02.600
I had this really weird thing
that happened, which was the

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.510
smaller the investment, the more
progress the teams made.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.660
When I wrote them a big check,
they bluntly [INAUDIBLE] where

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:14.780
am I. They didn't progress as
well as they should have.

00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:16.900
They spent more time
concentrating on product and

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:20.750
not enough time spending with
kind of customer-facing time.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:23.620
When I wrote people really
small checks, I suddenly

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.830
discovered the first thing they
did was they went to see

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.450
a customer.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:30.590
That creates a massive
amount of work.

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:33.050
I mean, our friend Mr.
McClure knows what

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:34.870
that now looks like.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:37.590
Seemed like a good
idea at the time.

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:41.030
And we've done something very
similar in Bulgaria,

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:42.810
interestingly alongside
Google.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.110
But we've just created
a 12 million

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.410
euro fund as I describe--

00:32:47.410 --> 00:32:50.395
and I'll get shot for this when
I get back to Europe--

00:32:50.395 --> 00:32:52.030
it's a desert.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.060
It's an absolute desert.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.620
There's no funding.

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.680
And there's lots of smart
people, but they just don't

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.300
know how to get started.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.200
In the next three years we're
going to fund 200 teams to

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.170
start their businesses.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.850
Or actually, take their ideas
or products, make

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:09.960
real things from them.

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.350
We expect a massive amount
of fallout of that.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:14.090
But that's essentially what you
guys have been doing for

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.412
the last 30 years.

00:33:16.412 --> 00:33:18.090
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: So you're
going to lose Google's money

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:18.250
is what you're saying?

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.955
JON BRADFORD: You didn't
put any money.

00:33:19.955 --> 00:33:21.846
JEHAN ARA: Can you bring
some of it to us?

00:33:21.846 --> 00:33:22.662
JON BRADFORD: No.

00:33:22.662 --> 00:33:24.550
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: This is the
way you get positive PR, you

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:27.684
give everyone tablets and
phones, and-- just kidding.

00:33:27.684 --> 00:33:28.161
JON BRADFORD: No.

00:33:28.161 --> 00:33:30.546
EDEN SHOCHAT: Aren't we
getting enough shit?

00:33:30.546 --> 00:33:31.030
JON BRADFORD: Yeah.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.360
You don't have to go through
customs and explain what all

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.820
this stuff is.

00:33:35.820 --> 00:33:38.120
But essentially, I will
swear now, so I

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.650
apologize in advance.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.910
The approach is throwing a lot
of shit at the wall and seeing

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:43.980
what sticks.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:48.180
And in markets where there are
limited funds available, it's

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:52.770
better to try and to not
succeed, but at least try.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.910
I have also this big thing
about what I call the

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.690
entrepreneurial compost heap.

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:00.160
I don't know whether that
translates into American.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.460
But essentially, if you take a
very gardening analogy, you go

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.700
through and you weed, and
you take stuff out.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:07.060
You don't throw it over the
fence, you stick it in a

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.239
compost heap.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.699
And then you mulch the plants
and the rest of

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:11.989
the garden as well.

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:14.340
So actually, what you do is you
embrace failure and you

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.610
say, actually, just
because you failed

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:18.739
doesn't make you bad.

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:20.489
But what we want to do is you've
learned a whole bunch

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.520
of really interesting stuff
because of that.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.330
We're going to feed you
back into the system.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.790
So when the stuff that actually
works really well, it

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:31.250
takes hold much stronger because
you're retaining the

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.610
talent, the experience, and the
knowledge that you gained

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.170
through not just the successes,
but the failures

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.199
that you have.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:41.670
Where you can build cultures
which embrace that attitude,

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.770
where you want people to try.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.920
And even if that ultimately
leads to failure, the fact

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.800
that you push it back into the
system and say, that's not

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.820
socially unacceptable.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.030
That's actually much smarter
because we want to try and do

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.489
something to actually make it
better and to actually help

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.202
the ones that do take root.

00:34:58.202 --> 00:35:01.880
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Eden, in
Israel there's lots of money,

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.360
lots of capital flow there.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.450
And you probably have a lot of
opportunities for series A,

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:06.520
series B investments.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.760
Why are you doing seed?

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.610
EDEN SHOCHAT: Who here
took VC money?

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:13.930
Raise your hands.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:14.990
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: [INAUDIBLE]
who want some,

00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:17.920
see Eden after this.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.480
EDEN SHOCHAT: I think it's
an important distinction.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.790
So the one thing that you need
to figure out, and part of the

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:29.190
basic issue is, the way that
the VC system works is that

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:32.540
you actually need to deploy a
good amount of capital because

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.410
your LPs, your limited partners
are looking for a

00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:36.320
specific return.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:42.400
So if you run $100 million fund,
you're expected to give

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.430
back about x3 returns if
your fund is good.

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:49.090
Now x3 returns, that's
$300 million.

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:54.910
Generally, a VC would own about
25% of the company at

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.420
the point of exit.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.810
So that means that you actually
need to generate $1.2

00:35:59.810 --> 00:36:06.410
billion worth of value to return
to your LPs the kind of

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:08.030
returns that they're
expecting.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:11.420
Which is virtually impossible
if you do not deploy

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.530
significant amount of capital.

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.790
So if you deploy $100,000,
which I just did

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:17.490
in an awesome company--

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.740
we haven't announced it yet.

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:24.960
But basically, you take three
pictures of your legs or of

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:28.770
your feet and you can then
generate insoles for it.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.550
Just internet based insoles.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:32.900
Which I needed insoles for
like three years, but I

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.780
haven't done that because you
need to go to a doctor and

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:36.470
measure your feet.

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:39.610
And so this guy just
needed $100,000.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:43.980
But if you think about that, the
VC model, say I now get a

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.130
significant return on that.

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:48.170
He sells his company, instead
of $1 million worth, he's

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:50.330
selling it for $10 million.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:53.620
The amount of money that I, as
a VC, just made is almost

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:54.280
ridiculous.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.710
It's not good for
my [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:58.780
That's why VCs don't do those
investments other than buying

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.120
options, which I strongly
advise you not to.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.770
For a variety of reasons, all
of them are the internet.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:11.050
Now, I think the model needs
to be different.

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:17.940
And I encourage you to also do
that in your local groups by

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.520
not giving away money,
or giving

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.890
$20,000, that's the same.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:24.680
But my perspective is
don't take anything.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:29.560
Give them the value that
they can use in order

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:30.470
to build that company.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:33.200
So if you need a place to sit
for three months, six months--

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:34.870
hey, get that for free.

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.310
If you need to have the
information that you need of

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:41.070
what it means to-- what a cap
table is, or other such things

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.740
that you must be educated about,
just get that for free.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:47.250
If you need connections in
Google, Twitter, Facebook, or

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.000
whatever, get that for free.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.080
Basically, reduce the cost of
entrepreneurship in those

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.340
critical customer development
six months cycles.

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.690
Give that for free and
just make sure

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.930
that people fail fast.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:03.540
If your idea then actually
sticks, if it makes sense,

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.000
then you can raise the
A rounds, et cetera.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.400
And as a VC, in my VC hat, we
can give you that money.

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:11.450
But to create a community,
to create an actual

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:15.520
infrastructure in every country,
every even city or

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.850
state in the US, right
now you have Mecca,

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:20.270
which is San Francisco.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.390
You have a few other, like
New York is finally

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.470
becoming like that.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.120
But in every state that you
are coming from, I would

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.820
encourage you to try to build
those groups and reduce the

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:29.810
cost of entrepreneurship.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.290
And that's what we
are trying to do.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.390
And then, if we can make money
off of it, that's great.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:40.250
But the reason why I'm doing
that, and the short answer is

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:41.810
just because you
can build that.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.890
You can actually create-- you
can make a difference.

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:45.850
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Cool.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:47.650
I'd love to switch
to another topic.

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.530
So we have this whole
idea of mobile

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:51.760
tablets, is it a desktop?

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.600
Is it a PC?

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.930
Is it going to be your laptop?

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:55.140
Is it your iPad?

00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.860
Where is this next wave of
technology for your region?

00:38:58.860 --> 00:38:59.710
And tell me why.

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.520
And we're going to do
in like a one-minute

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:02.690
sort of rapid fire.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:05.150
So we can start with
Jeff at the end.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:08.110
I mean, mobile?

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.180
JEFFREY PAINE: Yeah.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:12.470
From where I'm from, I think
mobile is the number one thing

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.330
that's growing right now.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.030
For a certain segment of market,
I think the iPhones

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:20.330
are still the sort of--

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.060
something that people
aspire to have.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:26.610
But what we are seeing
is Android is taking

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:29.350
over Asia big time.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.720
So Japan is now already--

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.280
they don't build the [INAUDIBLE]
phones anymore,

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.890
it's all Android now.

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:42.390
China has their own versions
of Android that they built

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.780
that is much interesting
for Chinese people.

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.390
Some of you from China, you
probably have seen them.

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:54.130
And the cheap manufacturers from
China are churning out

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.220
really, really cheap handsets.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:59.540
And that's going to be flooding
India, Middle East,

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:01.510
and North Africa.

00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:06.250
And that will certainly change
a lot of things.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.200
But that's one think, that's
just the device, right?

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:10.770
The next thing is the data.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:13.280
So that is still a little
bit nascent.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.120
They have the device.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.920
They kind of know that
it's cool looking.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:19.730
But then when they want to
switch on data, they kind of

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:21.530
like, OK, I have to pay.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.770
Majority of the markets are
prepaid, so they get a little

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.230
bit stuck when they'll like,
oh, I have to pay for this?

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.690
So they kind of get stuck.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.250
So some emerging countries
and the mobile

00:40:33.250 --> 00:40:34.640
operators are pretty--

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.630
they take risks.

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:39.770
So in Indonesia, they are kind
of quite cool in taking risks.

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:43.600
So what they do is they
will package a

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.720
mobile phone and a plan.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.060
And then they'll tell
you there's

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.980
three apps on the phone--

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.010
Facebook, Twitter, and
[INAUDIBLE], which is the

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.930
local regional mobile
social network.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:57.420
If you use that, the
data is free.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:02.710
So that creates a ton of people
using social media.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:05.840
And when you meet these people,
when you ask them,

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.750
what is Facebook?

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:09.740
They will just show you
the app in the phone.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:10.335
That's it.

00:41:10.335 --> 00:41:13.600
They have no clue what or where
Facebook come from.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.970
This is Facebook, right.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:15.795
So that's very interesting.

00:41:15.795 --> 00:41:17.110
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Jeff, do you
have any suggestions for

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.700
developers, maybe looking
at Asia as a market?

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:21.000
JEFFREY PAINE: Yeah.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.040
So if you're building games
right now, I think Japan is

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:25.970
interesting.

00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:27.570
China is also interesting.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:31.260
There's over 100 Android
app stores in China.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:35.640
I think the top 20 you can kind
of find them, and then

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.600
get them to market it for you.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:39.540
But I think if-- a lot
of you are Android

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.880
developers I take it.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:44.730
It's a very, very good
place to be.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:46.120
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Erik?

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:46.700
ERIK HERSMAN: Yeah.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.500
So most people think that
we don't have any data

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.140
connectivity in Africa.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.040
Or very limited.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.440
You think maybe it's edge.

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.310
The truth is I can get off the
plane in Nairobi and have

00:41:57.310 --> 00:41:59.610
better 3G connectivity than I
can when I get off the plane

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:01.440
in San Francisco.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.140
And that goes up country
in Kenya as well.

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.780
So it's not just in the city,
in the capital city.

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.490
But it's also in the towns and
cities across the country.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:14.900
And this is actually quite
common in a lot of countries

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:16.240
across Africa.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.950
So there's a lot of preconceived
notions about

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:23.550
what technology in Africa
is, and where it's at.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.900
And it's usually not true what
you've been hearing.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.490
M-Paisa was brought
up earlier.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:32.860
So obviously it's mobile in
Africa, I said that earlier.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:36.690
The biggest mobile payment
organization in

00:42:36.690 --> 00:42:38.370
the world is in Kenya.

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:39.670
We move more money.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:42.930
1 out of every 25 mobile
payment users in

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.340
the world is Kenyan.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:49.180
We move 25% of our GDP through
mobile payments.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.690
And it's the only--

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:51.700
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: I think
it's every day.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.700
Actually, almost every day.

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:54.220
ERIK HERSMAN: It could be.

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:58.236
Yeah, it's like $1.4 billion has
been moved as of December

00:42:58.236 --> 00:42:59.870
of this last year.

00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:02.240
So it's a lot of money going
through the system.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.280
And the interesting thing about
that is if you think

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:10.120
about it, who's really
innovative in the US or in

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.660
Europe on mobile payments?

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:14.560
Well, not very much, actually.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:18.450
Most of it's just a new skin or
face paint on credit cards.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:19.820
It's in places like Kenya.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.620
It's in places like the
Philippines, where you're

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:26.690
seeing really new forms
of money movement.

00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:28.580
Where it has nothing to do
with a bank account, has

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.900
nothing to do with
a credit card.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.250
The only thing it has is air
time, or just agent to agent

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.730
kind of money, or person to
person kind of money movement.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:39.270
And this is phenomenal.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:42.390
There's a groundbreaking kind
of innovation happening in

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.280
places that are well
at the edge.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.140
While everybody's paying
attention to the US, or

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:47.980
Europe, or Asia, sometimes
there's things happening in

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.300
places like Africa that are
really shocking that

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.810
Microsoft--

00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.000
shocking them, too.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.560
But shocking the Visas and
Mastercards of the world.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.190
So I think you can look at
Africa and you see mobile, and

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:02.220
you can see new things happening
there that you won't

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.974
find anywhere else.

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:04.880
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Great.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:05.220
Jehan you want to start?

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.090
We're actually going to start
questions here in a minute.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.350
So if you guys have questions,
please feel free to line up

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:13.130
behind the two mics here.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:17.450
JEHAN ARA: OK, so in Pakistan
I think mobile definitely,

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:18.900
much like Africa.

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:23.550
It's the way that we're going
and it's the place we are at.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:27.030
Voice activated, any kind of
applications that uses voice

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:32.450
or SMS is working
very well there.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:34.050
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Do you have
any great local apps that are

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.750
really strong in the markets?

00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:39.780
JEHAN ARA: One of the problems
that developers in Pakistan

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:44.110
faced was market access because
of the negative image

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:46.240
of the country.

00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.450
5% of the narrative of Pakistan
is spread around 95%

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:50.510
of the time.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:59.340
But the online stores, like the
Google store and the App

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:02.890
Store, Apple App Store, has
meant that it doesn't matter

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.410
where the app is develop.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.130
As long as it's good,
people like it.

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:06.890
They download it.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:10.710
So some of the top apps on the
BlackBerry store have been

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:11.460
from Pakistan.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.650
And they've been there for--

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:15.020
they've been productivity
apps.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.250
They've been gaming apps.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.850
Some of the top apps, top 10
Apps on the Apple store in

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.040
terms of games happen
from Pakistan .

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.860
And even in China, there have
been millions of downloads of

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.420
some of the games that have
been developed there.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.910
So that's pretty exciting
because young people who are

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:33.700
fresh out of university, maybe
two years out of university,

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.880
and they're developing games,
and they're selling them and

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.230
making millions of dollars.

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:41.820
One of our guys actually, during
his holidays, decided

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.300
to build an app because it was
a problem that he was facing.

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.350
And he built an app and
it was selling for

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:48.960
$25 on the App Store.

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.660
$25 a download.

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.330
And he sold a million.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:54.060
He is certainly one
of the richest

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:56.050
young kids in the country.

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:57.390
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: It's probably
quite cool to be an

00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:58.410
app developer now?

00:45:58.410 --> 00:45:59.580
JEHAN ARA: Yeah, it is.

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.180
Now everybody wants to
be an app developer.

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:03.680
And now you've got to figure
out what app works.

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:06.050
And not all games work.

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:09.730
So that is the challenge right
now, that you've got to find

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:12.970
ways of educating them.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.990
I think one of the biggest
problem is I wish there were

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:18.420
many more of our young
developers here at I/O.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:23.250
Because the excitement, the
energy of this conference, and

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:26.200
the passion that they have,
mixed together they would have

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.120
learned so much.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.625
They need a little bit of
polishing and that's it.

00:46:29.625 --> 00:46:30.070
BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
Yeah, I agree.

00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:32.240
JEHAN ARA: They're some of
the smartest kids there.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.795
And it's just the opportunity.

00:46:34.795 --> 00:46:36.200
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Eden, I'm
going to change the question

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:37.330
slightly on you.

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:40.280
In the mobile space, what
are you investing in?

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.920
I mean, what's hot for you?

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.600
EDEN SHOCHAT: So it's almost
a given that mobile is the

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:45.860
computing platform today.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:47.940
Anything else is marginalized.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:51.290
So that, OK, we're done.

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.710
The exciting thing about trying
to invest in what will

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:58.810
be big three years now
is you see a lot of--

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:00.580
you see the beginning,
but a good portion

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.970
of augmented humanity.

00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:04.880
I'm not sure whether it's
a commonly used term.

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.290
So Google Glasses is
a good example, a

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:09.330
very initial example.

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:12.070
I haven't seen actual
information being projected

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:17.300
into it, so I'm suspending
my disbelief.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.650
But that's augmented humanity,
to improve us through the use

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:23.090
of computing, and bring
that information in

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.200
an always-on basis.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.200
There's another company that
are actually very cool.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.490
Think of in-ears, like
for deaf people.

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:33.940
But right now for the general
population that you can

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.860
actually play with your
Android, or iPhone, or

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.260
whatever and say, I want to
hear what these guys are

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.120
talking about just five meters
away towards that direction.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:43.890
And you're hearing--

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:46.970
it's a DSB on top of that,
that actually has you--

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:51.890
you can cancel noise or hear
anything 5, 10 meters away.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:53.760
So that's, in my mind--

00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.380
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Not
creepy at all.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:56.300
EDEN SHOCHAT: A bit.

00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:01.170
But the point is of using
technology in order to augment

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:02.270
very basic capabilities.

00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:05.760
So right now that's one of the
most exciting areas for me.

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.710
BRIDGETTE SEXTON:
Jon, one minute.

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:08.706
JON BRADFORD: Very quickly.

00:48:08.706 --> 00:48:11.060
JEHAN ARA: That will
be a challenge.

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.850
JON BRADFORD: So this
is a shameless plug.

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:16.320
We believe so fundamentally that
mobile is important that

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.030
we've actually launched
an Accelerator

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:20.730
only program for mobile.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:24.860
So go and apply now, Springboard
Mobile in London.

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.810
We've got some awesome visas.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:28.770
Which basically means I can
actually [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:32.730
Forget about UK border
authorities, if you get past

00:48:32.730 --> 00:48:36.990
me, you and a founder can get a
three-year visa potentially.

00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:38.185
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: And
you're Irish.

00:48:38.185 --> 00:48:40.230
JON BRADFORD: Yeah, I'm Irish.

00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:43.650
So I mean, I have a really big--
this is a really big

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:44.100
thing to me.

00:48:44.100 --> 00:48:47.270
So there are now technically
more arm chips in the world

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:51.660
than there are physical
arms on the planet.

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.220
We are just about to hit
the fifth generation of

00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:54.840
computing--

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.960
blah, blah, blah.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:59.750
It's mobile computing,
it's not mobiles.

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:03.320
Every time you step down
in computing world from

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.050
mainframes, to minis, to
workstations, to personal

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:09.370
computers, the number of devices
increases and the

00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:12.880
geographically disparity
increases massively.

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.180
So this is, as I described,
not about West Coast,

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:20.260
latte-sipping surfer dudes with
iPhones, this is actually

00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.230
a massive, massive market.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:25.960
And it's going to exist
everywhere else apart from

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.250
California.

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:29.680
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Wow.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:30.860
California as an island.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.390
OK, let's start taking
a question over here.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.990
If you can introduce yourself
very briefly, and then try to

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:38.420
keep your questions
quite brief.

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.840
JASON: My name's Jason, East
Coast entrepreneur, a

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:41.450
technologist.

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:45.610
And my wife has been
to the developing

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:46.620
world several times.

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.880
It looks like our careers
will take us there.

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.420
JON BRADFORD: By the way,
everybody's developing.

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.296
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Well, some of
us actually aren't, which

00:49:53.296 --> 00:49:55.970
is the problem.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.720
JASON: So my exposure, as
someone who's grown up in the

00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:03.150
states of the developing world,
is someplace where

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:05.850
infrastructure is--

00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:08.250
my preconceived notions of it
are that they're not as firm

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:09.470
as they are here.

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:12.530
So it's hard enough in United
States to get a company off

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:15.190
the ground as
technology-oriented without

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:16.925
having to worry about, is the
power going to be on?

00:50:16.925 --> 00:50:19.600
Is the ISP going to be up?

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:24.220
If my vendor leaves me high and
dry, can I take them to

00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:27.830
court and get a civil action and
get my compensation back?

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:32.710
Can you talk about strategies
for US-based developers to

00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:36.730
sort of get involved in
developing companies in

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:40.250
developing nations where those
things that we take for

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.955
granted her aren't a given?

00:50:42.955 --> 00:50:44.336
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Erik, do you
want to talk about that with

00:50:44.336 --> 00:50:45.620
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:46.650
JEHAN ARA: May I address that?

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:49.770
OK, so we have lots
of power issues.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:54.850
We've got, in certain parts of
the country, security issues.

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:56.130
But generally not.

00:50:56.130 --> 00:50:59.320
I mean, it's perceived
to be that.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:02.490
And we've solved them.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:06.660
Aren't entrepreneur supposed to
find solutions to problems?

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:07.660
That's what we've done.

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:10.950
So most people now have
either UPSes on

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:11.900
which their power runs.

00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:14.425
It doesn't matter when the power
is off, the UPSes run

00:51:14.425 --> 00:51:15.970
them, the generators.

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:19.600
We forget about the fact that
the infrastructure will be

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.330
given to us.

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:22.720
We've created it ourselves
because we know we cannot

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:25.460
survive unless we have
these devices.

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:29.270
Now, the current new devices
which are coming with longer

00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:32.760
battery power are helping us.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:39.650
So I think as long as there is
an entrepreneur, any problem

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:43.660
that exists, actually they look
at as an opportunity, and

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:46.070
they look at as a challenge, and
they find a solution, and

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.100
they just move on.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:51.140
So a lot of companies now-- it's
hardly ever known, but

00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.890
one of the companies that
emerged out of Pakistan was

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:57.010
actually bought by the
Carlisle Group here.

00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:00.700
It was a financial services
company for $100 million.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.920
Several others have
just been sold.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.920
There was a gaming studio that
has had an investment of $35

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.970
million from Japan.

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:14.100
So they're small companies, 20,
30, 100 people, who have

00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:15.780
created businesses.

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:19.140
It's the front office that needs
to be outside because

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.770
they need to market
themselves.

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.130
And that's begun to happen.

00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:24.320
So if you're thinking of
investing in Pakistan, believe

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.260
me, there's a friend of mine
who graduated from

00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:28.220
Stanford, went back.

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:32.660
He said to start a company here
it cost him $2.5 million.

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.390
Took him 11 months, failed.

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:37.390
Went there for $60,000,
he started a company.

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:40.500
It succeeded because there's
so many opportunities for

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:44.230
creating new applications, new
solutions, and you've got a

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.880
big market.

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:47.330
And anything that works in
Pakistan, works in India,

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:50.040
works in Africa, works
in the Middle East.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:54.020
So you've got a huge market
available to you.

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:57.380
And you can try out ideas
for as little

00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:59.480
as $10,000 to $15,000.

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.160
If you fail you try
another one.

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:05.400
And so you've got the talent
there, all you need is to use

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:08.470
it and not be afraid to--

00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:12.630
as Jon was saying, if they fail,
that's the beginning of

00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:14.360
the next success.

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:15.310
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: I'm going to
move on to the next question.

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:17.210
JON BRADFORD: Can I quickly
jump in there?

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.610
Who's planning on taking
a holiday this year?

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:20.860
Nobody?

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:23.240
Right.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.550
When you take a week
off, go and travel.

00:53:25.550 --> 00:53:26.270
And go and see the world.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:29.186
And see what's actually
happening outside of the US.

00:53:29.186 --> 00:53:32.380
Actually, only 10% of Americans
have passports.

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:35.500
That's really sad.

00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:36.880
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Over here.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.560
AUDIENCE: So this is a question
about Southeast Asia.

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:43.000
I run a US-based startup
that was introduced to

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.420
Asia late last year.

00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.230
And we're doing very, very
well over in Asia.

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:51.450
We, in fact, now have a office
based in Singapore.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:54.750
And we focus on large enterprise
corporations.

00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.230
And I was just wondering if you
had any advice for a US

00:53:57.230 --> 00:54:00.010
company that's expanding into
Malaysia, Thailand,

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:01.660
Singapore, et cetera.

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:03.840
What are things we need to watch
out for and how do we be

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:04.890
successful?

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:07.000
JEFFREY PAINE: Sure.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.560
So the easiest port of call
is Singapore because for

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.130
Americans it's kind of like
California but hotter--

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:17.520
all the time.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.700
Lots of great foods, so you'll
probably put on weight.

00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.600
JEHAN ARA: He says that
without smiling.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.530
JEFFREY PAINE: So start with
Singapore, depending on how

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:29.200
you want to do it.

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.950
The good thing about Singapore
is there's a lot of enterprise

00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:33.410
salespeople you can hire.

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:37.880
Because we have grown up to be
educated to work for big

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:41.040
companies from the
US and Europe.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:43.640
So there's a lot of people with
very good corporate sales

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:44.460
experience.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:46.390
So that's a good
thing for you.

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:49.830
Especially if it is very
enterprisey, like many months

00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:52.630
of sales cycles, that
kind of thing.

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:55.040
And then regionally,
same thing.

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:58.260
All you need to do really is
to hire one guy that has

00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:59.680
regional experience.

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.210
Just one guy.

00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:01.480
That might take a while.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.240
But once you hire him, he will
bring the rest of the team in.

00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:04.932
JEHAN ARA: Or her.

00:55:04.932 --> 00:55:06.194
JEFFREY PAINE: Or her, yes.

00:55:06.194 --> 00:55:07.110
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Or her.

00:55:07.110 --> 00:55:07.410
JEFFREY PAINE: Usually.

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:08.350
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Question
over here?

00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:09.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah, quick
question.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.790
So have you seen companies that
have expanded into other

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:15.300
countries do better by just
essentially translating the

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.500
languages on their existing
apps and taking it there?

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.170
Or actually, redoing the
entire UI design

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:22.800
to match that culture?

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.910
And then have you also seen
people who attack smartphones

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:29.890
rather than smartphones and
dumb phones essentially do

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:31.840
better since they're
such on a rise?

00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:34.030
How have you seen smartphones
rising in

00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:36.780
your individual countries?

00:55:36.780 --> 00:55:40.990
JON BRADFORD: Who has Instagram
on their phone?

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:42.220
Have a look at the interface.

00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:44.690
There is no language
on it at all.

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:48.050
When you start shrinking things
to mobile devices, it's

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:50.100
icon-led as opposed
to language-led.

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:54.450
So your ability to move things
between geographical or

00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:57.730
cultural differences are
minimal on my end.

00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:59.290
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: We actually
don't have any more time for

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:01.150
questions, unfortunately.

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:03.490
But these guys are going to
be here in the outside.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:05.920
I actually have one last
question for each of you--

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.150
30 seconds.

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:11.290
I want to know what keeps you
passionate about the markets

00:56:11.290 --> 00:56:12.720
that you're working in,
the ecosystems that

00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:13.740
you're working in.

00:56:13.740 --> 00:56:14.950
What keeps your passionate?

00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:18.250
What's the next thing for you?

00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:19.500
JON BRADFORD: Entrepreneurs.

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:23.300
EDEN SHOCHAT: Beautiful.

00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:25.250
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: That's the
shortest answer I've ever seen

00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:27.080
Jon give in my life, except,
would you like a beer?

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.290
Yes.

00:56:28.290 --> 00:56:31.796
EDEN SHOCHAT: Beaches, beautiful
women, and the Tel

00:56:31.796 --> 00:56:32.480
Aviv spirit.

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:33.030
Anyway--

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:36.000
no, but seriously, you should
come to Israel.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.080
But what keeps me up--
so I'm still at

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.460
2:00 AM, just looking--

00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:42.440
I'm waking up, looking at
executive summaries.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:46.250
I think just the talent and
just the originality.

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:48.880
I learned that I'm old
when I thought ring

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.590
tones won't work out.

00:56:50.590 --> 00:56:53.370
And that is now a $5
billion industry.

00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:56.230
So it's great to see new
people with new ideas.

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:59.380
And that's really
a huge driver.

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.130
JEHAN ARA: OK, I grew up in
Hong Kong and I moved back

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:04.440
about 15, 16 years
ago to Pakistan.

00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.990
And I choose to be
there, although I

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:07.155
could be anywhere else.

00:57:07.155 --> 00:57:10.340
And what keeps me there is the
passion, the excitement in the

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:15.800
young people, the energy, the
need to want to prove

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:16.610
themselves.

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:20.130
And I think if I can contribute
even 1% towards

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:23.360
their growth, towards their
success, towards their

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:26.470
believing that they can do
anything that anyone else in

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:30.660
the world can do, then I think
I'm doing something right.

00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:32.790
ERIK HERSMAN: There's a lot more
friction in a place like

00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:34.780
Africa, but there's also
a lot more opportunity.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:38.260
And it's great to see kind of
a community get-together and

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.810
grow something, grow a whole
market, grow a whole industry,

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:43.580
to build a foundation for what's
going to actually be

00:57:43.580 --> 00:57:45.750
affecting the continent in
the next 5 to 10 years.

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:48.040
So just being a part of
that is why I do it.

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:54.750
JEFFREY PAINE: For me,
I echo this a lot.

00:57:54.750 --> 00:58:00.190
I am very sort of privileged
to have to do what I do.

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:03.600
It's really remarkable to help
crazy people change the world.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.220
I'm just amazed that I'm
paid to do this.

00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:13.100
So if you guys have that
passion, just go for it.

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:16.700
There will be people that will
be standing behind you.

00:58:16.700 --> 00:58:17.350
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: Thank
you guys so much.

00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:20.370
I think this is really one of
the most exciting times, if

00:58:20.370 --> 00:58:22.360
not the most exciting time
to be an entrepreneur.

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:24.430
If we look at technology, the
technology you've seen the

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:28.310
last three days, the barrier
to entry is very, very low.

00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:30.660
You no longer have to be sitting
in Silicon Valley.

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.020
And in fact, some of the best
entrepreneurs that I've seen

00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:35.830
in the last few years are not
sitting here and doing

00:58:35.830 --> 00:58:36.510
phenomenally well.

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:39.540
And building things that we
might think are US because we

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:42.790
download them off of our
Android, or iPhone, or iPad,

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:44.490
or your new Android tablet.

00:58:44.490 --> 00:58:45.970
But really, they may have
been created in

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:47.960
Pakistan, or Kenya, or--

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:48.380
JON BRADFORD: Finland.

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:48.920
Rovio.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:51.420
BRIDGETTE SEXTON: --potentially
those UK people.

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:54.500
And I think that these guys
have definitely taken the

00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:57.280
bootstrapped approach to their
economies and to their

00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.550
particular ecosystems.

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:00.570
And I know many of you guys--
actually, how many of you are

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:04.020
from international markets?

00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.190
That is awesome.

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:08.730
I think many of you guys have a
chance to definitely be much

00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:12.460
like them in taking advantage
of creating an ecosystem.

00:59:12.460 --> 00:59:15.280
All of their programs are
actually available and open to

00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:16.150
a global audience.

00:59:16.150 --> 00:59:20.060
And I have seen a huge value in
people taking their startup

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.580
and going to a new market, or
going to a place that's a bit

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:24.790
foreign, finding talent, and
being in one of these

00:59:24.790 --> 00:59:25.840
ecosystems.

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:28.500
So if you're interested in
joining an Accelerator program

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.620
or sitting in the iHub, there's
some huge textiles

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:34.730
companies have actually moved
themselves to Kenya, who I met

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:35.490
in the iHub.

00:59:35.490 --> 00:59:37.910
I think there's enormous
opportunity.

00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:39.540
And I can't thank you
guys enough for

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.545
coming to share that.

00:59:40.545 --> 00:59:43.720
So please help me welcome-- or
thank the crowd here, thank

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.710
the audience, thank the
panelists for coming.

00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:53.427
[APPLAUSE]
