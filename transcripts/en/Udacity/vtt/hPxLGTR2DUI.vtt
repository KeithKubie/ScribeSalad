00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In Unit 2 we're going to focus on Big Theta notation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now, Big Theta is a little bit like Big O, but if you don't what either of those things are,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
it's a concept that computer scientists use to talk about the running time of algorithms.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's especially useful for comparing the running time of different algorithms

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to see which one is more efficient.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're going to be looking at Big Theta in the context of understanding

00:00:21.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the relationship of individuals in a social network and the connections between them. Let's dive in.
