00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Let's try a few more of these P vs. NP questions.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.400
And again, I'd like you to check whichever boxes you think correspond to true statements.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.530
The first one is--If P≠NP, then all problems solvable in polynomial time

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.740
on a nondeterministic RAM will require exponential time

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.780
on a deterministic RAM.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.870
The second one is--

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.070
If a problem requires exponential time to solve on a deterministic RAM,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.710
then a nondeterministic RAM can solve it in polynomial time.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.380
The final statement is--

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.010
Showing P≠NP would mean that all NP-complete problems

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.690
effectively become solvable in practice.

00:00:37.690 --> 99:59:59.000
So, check whichever ones you feel are true statements.
