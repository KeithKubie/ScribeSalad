DAVE, YOU HAVE TO GET THIS.

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:05.138
I OWE LARRY DAVID MONEY,

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:06.807
AND I CAN'T LET HIM
SEE ME BUYING LUNCH.

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:07.307
- HOW MUCH DO YOU OWE HIM?

00:00:07.407 --> 00:00:08.075
- $13,000.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.444
- [laughs]

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:11.945
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST BLOW HIM?

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.881
- YOU SEXIST JACKASS.

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.183
I'D NEVER SUGGEST YOU PAY
SOMEONE BACK BY BLOWING 'EM.

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:18.318
- I'D BLOW MY LANDLORD FOR RENT.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.288
HELL, I'D GIVE HIM
A REACH-AROUND FOR CABLE.

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.457
- WHAT?
LAURA!

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:24.458
HEY.

00:00:24.558 --> 00:00:26.059
DO YOU--YOU'RE HERE.

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.094
YOU'RE IN--YOU'RE IN
A RESTAURANT?

00:00:27.194 --> 00:00:28.529
LOOK AT THIS.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.063
YOU'RE OUT HERE.
YOU'RE HAVING LUNCH.

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.165
BOY, THINGS MUST BE PRETTY GOOD.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:32.966
- OH, I WASH DISHES HERE.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:33.967
I'M ON MY BREAK.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:35.435
- OKAY.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:37.437
HEY, I'M HAVIN' LUNCH
WITH LARRY FLINT.

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:38.505
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:39.973
WHAT--WHAT'S THE PROTOCOL HERE?

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:41.475
DO I LET HIM ROLL
ALL THE WAY TO ME?

00:00:41.575 --> 00:00:42.910
OR DO I MEET HIM HALFWAY?

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.278
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:45.612
- WELL, YOU'RE BOTH
GONNA END UP HERE.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:46.847
- SHOULD I TELL HIM
YOU NEED A LITTLE WORK?

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:48.582
- NO, I'LL FIND SOMETHING.

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:51.985
- FIRST OF ALL, DON'T TAKE JOBS
YOU DON'T WANT FOR MY SAKE.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.387
- OKAY.

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.888
- IT'S LIKE IF SOMEBODY
OWES YOU SOMETHING,

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:56.156
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT THE ETIQUETTE IS.

00:00:56.256 --> 00:00:57.491
DO YOU MENTION IT?

00:00:57.591 --> 00:00:59.059
DO YOU--DO YOU NOT MENTION IT?
- MM-HMM.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.561
- IS THERE AN ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM?

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.429
YOU KNOW, ELEPHANT POINTING.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:04.264
SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD,
AND SOMETIMES IT'S NOT GOOD.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.432
- RIGHT, SO--

00:01:05.532 --> 00:01:06.900
- YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.101
THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU OWE ME MONEY?

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.069
OF COURSE I KNOW
YOU OWE ME MONEY.

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:10.404
OF COURSE I KNOW YOU KNOW.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.072
FOR THE SAKE OF THE FRIENDSHIP,

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:14.107
I'M ALMOST TEMPTED TO SAY,
"FORGET ABOUT IT.

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:15.075
YOU DON'T OWE ME A NICKEL."

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.076
-OH, OKAY, FINE THEN.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.111
- I'M ALMOST TEMPTED TO DO THAT.

00:01:18.212 --> 00:01:20.547
EH, THAT--THAT SEEMS
TOO MUCH OF A GESTURE.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:21.915
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE A JEW,

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:23.317
BUT HE TAKES IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.485
HE'S LIKE THE GIFT SHOP
AT THE HOLOCAUST MUSEUM.

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:25.652
- [scoffs]
