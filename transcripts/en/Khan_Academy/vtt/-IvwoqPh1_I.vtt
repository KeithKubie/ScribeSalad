00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.600
- [Instructor] An idea
that will keep coming up

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.330
as you study economics is
the idea of the four factors

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.120
of production, which are
usually listed as land,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.530
labor, capital, and entrepreneurship.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.280
And the idea here is if you
want to produce anything,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.950
so let's just say this circle
is the production process,

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.290
and this arrow is the
output, you need inputs.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.870
Now, you might have
many, many, many inputs.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.450
You might need supplies,
you might need a factory,

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.500
you might need people
to work in the factory,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.720
you need all of these different things.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.170
But the idea of the four
factors of production

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.820
is that these things can all be classified

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.470
in one of these four
groups, as either land,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.960
labor, capital, or entrepreneurship.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.910
Now, these words have
meaning in everyday language.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.850
And so, some of it might jump out at you.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.710
Of course, if you need to build factory

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.820
or if you need to farm,
you need land to do so.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.920
And you can see that in this example here,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.090
where we see a farm.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.390
Clearly, the need a lotta land
in order to have the farm.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.470
Even in a garment
factory, this is a picture

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.300
of a garment factory from
maybe a hundred years ago,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.170
even there, they needed land
on which to build the factory.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.250
So, this floor is sitting on land.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.730
And land doesn't just have to strictly

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.180
mean land in an economics context.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.950
It can mean natural resources in general.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.520
This could be things like
water or air or energy.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.700
So, in some contexts, instead of land,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.910
some people might say natural resources

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.650
for this first factor of production.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.770
Now, another important
factor of production,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.870
and arguably they're all
important, is the idea of labor.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.870
To produce many or most things,
someone has to work on it.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.160
So, someone had to plant these seeds,

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.430
and they will have to harvest these crops.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.940
The labor is very clear here.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.601
You see people putting in work

00:01:53.601 --> 00:01:58.600
in order to produce the
product right over there.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.890
Now, capital is an interesting one.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.080
It means one thing in everyday language,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.280
and it means something
slightly more specific

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.900
when we talk about it
in an economics context.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.830
In an economic context, capital is

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.940
something produced to
produce other things.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.290
So, examples of capital would be tools

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.740
that you use to produce other things.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.380
It could be a building that you need

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.720
in order to produce other things.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.640
It could be the machinery in a factory.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.660
So, in these two pictures,
there's many examples of capital.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.900
You could view this table and the tools

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.870
that these folks are
using, that is capital.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.610
You could use, you could view
the whole building itself

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.730
and all of the light fixtures
and all of that as capital.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.010
So, all of this stuff is capital.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.310
The hangers that they're
putting the coats on

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.520
after they produce it, that is capital.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.670
In this farm example, the
capital would be the buildings.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.690
These were constructed so that they could

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.980
produce the food from the farm.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.070
This little, it looks like
some type of machinery there,

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.570
that is capital for the farm.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.510
It's being used to produce
the output of the farm.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.200
Now, the place that that's
different than everyday language,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.870
in everyday language, when
people talk about capital,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.170
they'll often include financial capital,

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.250
financial assets that could be used

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.810
to get benefit in the
future, things like money.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.910
But in an economic context,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.930
we are not considering financial assets,

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.670
we're only thinking about
things that were produced

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.490
in order to produce other things.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:38.330
The fourth factor of
production is entrepreneurship.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.650
Entrepreneurship, in our everyday language

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.320
means putting things together

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.350
so you're trying to create other things.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.730
When someone's an entrepreneur,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.510
you might imagine someone who's
trying to start a business.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.010
In an economic context,
it has a related idea.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.330
Entrepreneurship is putting together

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.120
all of the other factors of production

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.430
so that you can actually produce things.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.260
You can't just randomly build buildings

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.470
and randomly plant seeds.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.410
Someone has to think about
how do you put these things

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.560
together so that you can produce
things in a reasonable way?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.380
And obviously, you wanna
produce as much as possible

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.310
given the other factors that you

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.920
are putting into the production.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.940
A related idea, and it sometimes
is used interchangeably

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.880
in an economics course, is technology.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.070
So, sometimes, you'll see the
four factors of production

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.130
as land, labor, capital,
and entrepreneurship;

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.530
and sometimes, you'll see it listed

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.730
as land, labor, capital, and technology.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.320
But when you see this, when you see

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.000
technology as a factor of production,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.140
don't think about it as
technology in everyday language,

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.780
where you think of
computer chips or software.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.680
When people are talking about technology

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.500
as a factor of production,

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.670
they are really talking
about entrepreneurship.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.610
They're talking about the
know-how of putting together

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.360
the other factors of production

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.330
in order to produce that output.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.240
Finally, I wanna leave on one idea,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.710
the idea of the two types
of things that could be

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.450
produced from all of these
factors of production.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.290
Broadly speaking, we
could produce something

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.840
that could be used to produce more things,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.970
and we already talk about it.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.970
We could be, in that situation,
be producing capital goods.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.520
So, that could be that we
are constructing a factory

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.120
that itself maybe produces
tools for other people

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.800
to use in some other production process.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.290
The other option we have is to produce

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.580
what are known as consumption goods.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.790
Consumption

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.010
goods.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.360
Consumption goods are
goods that are just used.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.360
It might make people happy,
they might find pleasure in it,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.290
but it's not being used
to produce other things.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.710
And because our production
resources are scarce,

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.420
there's a trade-off when
a society or a factory

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.270
or whoever decides how
much capital to produce

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.560
versus how much consumption goods.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.200
You need some consumption goods;

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.570
otherwise, frankly, we
wouldn't have clothing on.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.700
We wouldn't be eating nice meals.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.870
We wouldn't be able to enjoy our lives.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.860
But at the same time,
you also need capital.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.876
If we did only consumption
goods, at some point,

00:06:04.876 --> 00:06:07.050
we wouldn't have all the things we need

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.090
to produce the consumption goods.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.150
So, it's a very interesting trade-off

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.903
that we'll explore more in future videos.
