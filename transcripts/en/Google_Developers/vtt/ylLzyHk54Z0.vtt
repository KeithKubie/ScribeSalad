Stephanie Liu: Hi.

00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:03.567
In this video, I'm going
to give you a quick overview

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:07.267
of what you can do
with the YouTube APIs.

00:00:07.267 --> 00:00:08.934
First of all, we all know
what YouTube is, right?

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:11.300
Millions of videos uploaded
from all around the world

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.567
at your fingertips.

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:15.501
The YouTube APIs allow you

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:17.534
to integrate YouTube
into your application.

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:18.767
There are two main APIs:

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:21.767
the data API,
and the player APIs.

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:23.868
But before I get
into more detail,

00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:26.200
let's talk widgets.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.534
If you're looking
for a quick sprinkling

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:28.968
of YouTube on your website,

00:00:28.968 --> 00:00:32.167
there are some pre-made widgets
for you to check out.

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:33.901
The AJAX Video Bar makes it easy

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.501
to add a dynamic block of videos
onto your site.

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:38.868
All you have to do
is copy/paste some JavaScript.

00:00:38.868 --> 00:00:43.467
There's even a handy wizard
to help you do customizations.

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:44.734
Use the Video Search Control

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:48.167
to make this block of videos
more interactive.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:54.801
We also have
the custom player available.

00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:56.901
You can change the color
and borders to match your site,

00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.167
as well as size and format.

00:00:59.167 --> 00:01:00.701
To populate your custom player,

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:03.133
just select
one of your own playlists.

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.534
Now, if you decide
you want to do something

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:06.634
that's more complex
than what these widgets offer,

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:07.901
then you'll wanna use the APIs,

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:10.434
so let's get
into a bit more detail there.

00:01:10.434 --> 00:01:12.067
The data API is a RESTful API

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:14.667
that allows you to do
a wide breadth of operations.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.667
Searching, pulling back
user information,

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.100
uploading videos,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.000
creating playlists,
and much more.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.200
I'll go over the two
most popular use cases,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.200
search and upload,
and show you some examples.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.334
First up, search.

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:28.434
I'm sure you've all searched

00:01:28.434 --> 00:01:30.601
for your favorite video
on YouTube.com.

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:32.501
Using the API,
you can send a query

00:01:32.501 --> 00:01:34.334
for a search term
like you would on the site,

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:36.634
and retrieve a few results
in XML, which you could then

00:01:36.634 --> 00:01:38.701
display in your application
how you want.

00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:41.801
For example, TimeTube has an
innovative viewing experience.

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.200
They take video search results

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.267
and display them on a timeline
with weighted importance.

00:01:51.968 --> 00:01:53.901
In this web-based
presentation creator,

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:55.601
you can search
for videos within the app,

00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:58.100
and then embed them
right into your presentation.

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.167
Another big operation is upload.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:10.067
Your users can upload
their videos to YouTube

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.767
through your application.

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:16.300
For example, Animoto.com
is a slide show creation site.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.033
Once their users
create a slide show,

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.267
they have an option
to export to YouTube.

00:02:20.267 --> 00:02:22.801
They use the API to authorize
the user to the YouTube account,

00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:25.100
and then send the video over.

00:02:28.234 --> 00:02:29.834
"Spore" is a computer game

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:31.434
that lets you
create your own creatures.

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:33.100
And all proud parents
want to videotape

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.501
and share their creations,
so there's a "record" button

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:40.067
that lets you upload
straight to YouTube.

00:02:40.067 --> 00:02:41.167
I've only covered a small set

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:42.367
of what you can do
with the data API,

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:44.534
but hopefully you have
some good ideas.

00:02:44.534 --> 00:02:46.601
You can get started
with the data API

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:48.767
with one of our open source
client libraries.

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:52.400
We have them for PHP, Java,
.NET, and Python.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.567
They make parsing feeds

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.467
and handling authentication
much easier.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:56.868
I should also point out

00:02:56.868 --> 00:02:58.601
that while we don't have
a JavaScript client library,

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:01.334
we do offer JSON
as an alternative format to XML

00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:04.601
so you can easily
parse responses with JavaScript.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.300
Now, on to the player APIs.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.501
The player APIs give you

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:09.501
control over
the YouTube-embedded player.

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:13.100
You can issue commands, like
"stop," "pause," and "play";

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.267
listen for events,
like air events--

00:03:15.267 --> 00:03:17.067
or which state
the player is in--

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:20.234
and poll status, like how far
into the video the user is.

00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:21.801
Here's an example
of an application

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:22.934
that's using the player APIs

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:25.400
to sync up this lecture
with the slides.

00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:30.100
If you wanna do
even deeper customizations,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.434
use our chromeless player.

00:03:31.434 --> 00:03:33.067
It's just a video box
with no buttons

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:35.033
that you can control
with the player APIs.

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:36.300
You can skin the player

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.234
to match the look and feel
of your application,

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:40.701
much like in these examples.

00:03:44.634 --> 00:03:47.601
For even more examples,
check out our app gallery.

00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:50.634
And once you've built something,
show us by submitting yours.

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:52.701
This has only been
a quick overview,

00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:54.133
but find all the rest
of the details

00:03:54.133 --> 00:04:00.133
on code.google.com, and ask
your questions in our forum.
