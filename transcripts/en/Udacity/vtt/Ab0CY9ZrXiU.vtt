00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.920
Okay Michael, so, feels like we've relaxed almost

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.942
everything we could relax except for one thing. We're

00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:09.252
now going to look at two player non zero

00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:12.530
sum. None possibly none deterministic games of hidden information.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.220
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.524
&gt;&gt; And that's going to turn out to be messy, but

00:00:15.524 --> 00:00:18.404
get us to the place where I've secretly been trying to

00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:21.430
get us all along. So, let me describe a game

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.650
for you. Very carefully, and let's see where it leads us.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.490
Okay, here's the game, you've got two people. These two people are criminals.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.450
&gt;&gt; Oh no! Are they smooth criminals?

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.300
&gt;&gt; One of them is.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.454
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:43.026
[MUSIC]

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:45.540
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Oh, you're terrible. Okay, so

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.780
we have two people. They're criminals. Okay,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.260
and unfortunately they've both been captured by

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.558
the cops. I have actually no idea how

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:56.270
to draw that, but let's just try to draw that like this. The cops come along, and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.590
capture them both because they are suspected in a particular robbery. Okay?

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.932
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:01:02.932 --> 00:01:04.540
&gt;&gt; And they take them and put them both in jail.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.990
So those are jail bars.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.168
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.690
&gt;&gt; Okay? But they don't just put them

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.710
in jails. They put them in two separate jails.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.640
&gt;&gt; Oh no.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.406
&gt;&gt; Okay. And one cop goes to one criminal and says

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:24.730
listen, here's the deal. We know you did it. Okay? We know you did.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:32.480
And your friend over there, he's currently singing, singing like a bird. And he,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.380
is going to pin it all on you. So this is your last chance to give us a little

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.010
help and admit that you two did it. Or, that the other guy did it.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.140
You admit that the other guy does it, you say it was his fault, then we'll cut

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.610
you a deal. Now to make it worse, the

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.080
cop tells him that there's another cop over there.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.173
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:01:56.173 --> 00:01:58.520
&gt;&gt; Who's talking to the smooth criminal, and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.430
is offering him the same deal.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.530
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.562
&gt;&gt; And whoever, goes first, whoever pins it

00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:08.840
on the other guy first, gets to walk. Okay?

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.340
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.840
&gt;&gt; So, if I can get the curly-head guy to defect, okay?

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.786
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:23.220
&gt;&gt; Then, I am going to let him walk and he will spend zero months in jail.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.380
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.240
&gt;&gt; Okay. On

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.560
the other hand, if the other guy defects, then he's going to

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.110
get to spend zero time in jail. And since we've got all

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.410
that we need. We got a confession. To get this guy to

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.280
go to jail. He's going to go to jail for nine months. Okay?

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.380
&gt;&gt; Negative nine months?

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, that's a cost in months. I see. Uh-huh. [CROSSTALK]

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.284
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's a cost in months. Okay? So

00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:49.900
if, curly-head guy defects before the other guy does,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.370
then zero. He walks. He pays no cost, other than

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.255
the cost he's already paid for a life of crime.

00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:58.208
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:02:58.208 --> 00:03:01.440
&gt;&gt; Now if he refuses to drop a dime on the other

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.740
guy, but the smooth criminal decides to defect he's going to lose nine months.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.370
That make sense? And the other guy's going to walk. So he's

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.900
getting the same deal, they're both getting the same deal. You got it?

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.900
&gt;&gt; All right, now. It's a little more complicated

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.870
than that, all right? But I, I hope that you're

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.150
getting all, keeping all of this in your head. It's

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.040
a little more complicated than that. There's actually four choices

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.080
here, not just two. It's not just a case of. I

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.780
defect or the other guy defects. I defect, the other

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.950
guy doesn't. I don't defect, the other guy does. Okay? You

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.440
could both refuse to drop a dime on the other.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.180
You could cooperate, or you could both rat out the other.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.310
&gt;&gt; At the same exact moment?

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.601
&gt;&gt; At the same exact moment.

00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:45.014
&gt;&gt; So, there's a big thick wall here. Curly guy doesn't know what

00:03:45.014 --> 00:03:49.020
smooth guy is doing, and smooth guy doesn't know what curly guy is doing.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.590
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.020
&gt;&gt; So the question is, if you have a choice between either defecting or.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.830
&gt;&gt; Which means blaming the other guy? Which means

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.836
blaming the other guy you defecting from your friendship.

00:03:57.836 --> 00:04:01.617
&gt;&gt; Oh. Or you can cooperate, that is be true to your

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:05.890
friendship. I can, we both people can defect, both people can cooperate,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.320
one person can defect and the other person

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.090
cooperate, so there's actually four different options there.

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.200
&gt;&gt; I fee, I feel a matrix coming on.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there's a matrix

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.140
coming on. So let's draw the matrix, because

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.320
I think that makes it easier to see. But you have the background here, right?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.010
&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah.

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.709
&gt;&gt; The key piece here is that each person has

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.230
a choice of either defecting from their friendship or trying

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.220
to cooperate. Keeping their mouth shut, and, they don't know

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.910
what the other person is doing. So, what are all

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.430
the costs here? What are the worst case things?

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:33.541
Let's just draw it all out as a matrix.
