00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.060
So RAID stands for
Redundant Array of Independent Disks.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.980
And effectively with RAID
we have several disks

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.120
that play the role of only one disk,
in different ways.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.810
It can either pretend
to be a larger disk or

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.730
they can pretend to be
a more reliable disk.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.470
Or they can pretend to be
the disks that is both larger and

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.480
reliable then any one of the disks.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.600
Now it's important to note,
before we go into explaining RAID,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.800
that each of the disks is still
detecting errors using codes.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.260
So each of the disks,
will know whether it has an error, and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.000
in the overall RAID skim, we will know
which of the disks have an error.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.020
So, we don't have to have
RAID figure that out.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.330
We know that because each
of the disks still has

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.150
a code at each sector that is capable
of both fixing some errors and

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.950
also detecting even more
errors on that sector.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.400
So, what we want from RAID
is better performance and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.590
we want normal read
write accomplishment,

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.020
basically service accomplishment as far
as disk is concerned, even when there

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.230
are things such as bad sectors on
some disks or an entire disk fails,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.160
for example because it can no longer
spin, and things of that nature.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.290
So things that a basic error
detection correction code

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.460
that is attached to each sector,
cannot fix anymore.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.540
Possibly because we can no longer
get to that sector on the disc.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.630
Not all of the array techniques
will improve both of these.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.710
Some improve only performance,
some improve only reliability,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.310
some improve both.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.530
And these array techniques our number.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.290
So there is RAID 0, RAID1, etc.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.180
And we will look at some
of these techniques.
