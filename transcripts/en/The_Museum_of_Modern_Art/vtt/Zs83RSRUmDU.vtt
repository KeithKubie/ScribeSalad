00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.440
One of the exciting things for me about
Rauschenberg is that he was relentlessly

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.530
collaborative, so if you look at the
exhibition there are collaborations with

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:21.689
scientists, with artists, with writers,
with dancers, with musicians. He imagines

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.849
that there is a universe of
interconnected disciplines and

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.529
interconnected thought. He's in the
middle of this you know to himself he

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.570
imagines there's all this exciting stuff
happening in the world and if I put

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.629
myself there I can be right at the
center of it.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.090
Classical music is very small and it's
very local and  it lives in a little tiny

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.789
box and so for me one of the really
exciting things is that when I see

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.760
someone who was able to define the world
as on being all these incredible

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.770
connections that only connect because
they connect in him, it makes me feel

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.180
like I can do that. It makes me feel like
I can live a bigger life. And it makes me

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.880
feel like the music which I believe
fundamentally is universal—that the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.000
music can be part of a larger kind of
citizenship.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.970
The New York School is a historic term.
It means a moment in time in the 1950s

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.970
when composers started looking at ways
to challenge ideas that came from Europe

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.240
by incorporating freedom and
indeterminacy and democracy and music

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.120
And thank you all for coming and for
those of you who haven't seen the show

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:13.720
yet you should rush to see it. It's
incredible, and this piece, in particular, 4 Minutes and 33...

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.840
The central figure
in this New York School was always John Cage.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:25.160
One of Cage's most notorious pieces
is a piece called Four Minutes and 33 Seconds.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.500
Cage saw the white paintings of
Rauschenberg and realized how powerful

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:54.100
the provocation was to have something on
which you could project anything.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:02.860
So it was given to David Tudor who at the time
was the avant-garde music world's

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.280
greatest virtuoso of the most difficult
piano music.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.260
The idea that you are asking this incredible virtuoso

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.200
to sit down at the piano, we expect him to do something.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.720
So what he does is he takes out the
music and he closes the lid of the piano

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.790
for the time specified for this first
movement, and he opens the lid of the

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.840
piano and he closes the lid of the piano
for the second movement, and he does this

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.980
for all three movements for four minutes
and 33 seconds.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.900
He really is the closest

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.680
thing that music composition has to a
philosopher. It's Cage identifying what

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.740
the core action of composition is.
Composition is the designing of an

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.980
experience which makes an audience a
better listener. Something happens in

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.530
sound in front of you and you put it
together and you listen to it. If there's

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.760
an emotional reaction that's not that's
happening, it's not that the composer

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.700
makes you have the emotional reaction—
you are making that emotional reaction

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.860
yourself. How better to show that that's
the core of what classical music is than

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:25.160
to say there is nothing on stage other
than the opening of the proposition to listen.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.600
...and I actually don't I don't know enough about lighting technology because I'm a sound guy

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.660
I don't know enough about lighting technology, but I know it

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.120
just has to do with when you know when
you jiggle the two next to each other.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.620
Yeah.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.520
Okay, so this monitor's five...

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.160
And that's six.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.760
Okay, show me what to do.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.000
Twelve lights, twelve sounds.
All you have to do is turn them on.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.620
There was a moment where David Tudor moved
from being a performer, a recreator

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.599
into being a creator and that was
something that Rauschenberg did for

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:25.729
David Tudor. Rauschenberg invited David
Tudor to participate in a project with

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:32.900
him and David Tudor's idea was he walked
into this gigantic hall where there were

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.479
two hundred and seventy plus fluorescent
lights in the ceiling and he put a

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:43.669
microphone on every single one of the
lights and so then he had a little

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:49.540
control board where he would make music
by turning the lights on and off

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.520
So one of the things that we've done for our
show here is that we've made a kind of

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.460
homage to this piece. You don't want to
dim it? Because that's sometimes where

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:04.170
you get the fun flicker
there's a problem with the fact that

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.260
contemporary fluorescent lights don't
make sound for the most part. They're

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.770
lighting modern lighting fixtures are
very very quiet, and so I had to go and

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.930
find some recordings of vintage
fluorescent tubes and utilize those in a

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.100
sort of software environment that allows
us to turn on and off fluorescent lights

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:26.050
in a way that corresponds with sounds
that would be, you know, as near as we can

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.780
tell would be appropriate to what we
might have heard in that gallery space

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:57.150
Rauschenberg saw that there shouldn't be
a distance between composer and

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.920
performer, just as he saw that there
shouldn't be a distance between artist

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:09.930
and choreographer or artist and costumer
or composer and poet. He imagined that

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:18.120
somebody could do this job, and that kind
of enthusiasm and an invitation ended up

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:26.580
changing David Tudor's life. The notion
that you should be making your work and

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.860
also living in a world and giving
opportunities to other people and

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.720
helping people grow and finding people
who are interesting, who are interesting

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.690
and supporting them—that's rare. The
idea that he can be useful to someone

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.800
else,
that is very beautiful and that goes...

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.700
that's a theme that goes through this
entire show.
