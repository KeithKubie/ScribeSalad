The answer is, all of these are computer programs except

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.150
for the slice of toast. In general, if you can

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.990
eat something it's not a computer program. The programs that

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.220
you write in this class will be Python code. Those

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.250
will be input to another program, which is a Python

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.710
interpreter that follows instructions in your code, and it does

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.460
that by following the instructions in its code. And you'll

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.140
be able to run all that using your web browser.
