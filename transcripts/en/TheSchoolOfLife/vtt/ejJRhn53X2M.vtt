00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.160
Adam Smith is our guide to perhaps the most
pressing dilemma of our time: how to make

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.440
a capitalist economy more humane and more
meaningful.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.490
He was born in Scotland in Kirkcaldy – a
small manufacturing town – near Edinburgh

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.320
in 1723.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.300
He was a hard working student and very close
to his mother.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.519
He then became an academic philosopher, wrote
a major book about the importance of sympathy

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.999
and lectured on logic and aesthetics.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.330
He was also one of the greatest thinkers in
the history of economics – in part because

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.670
his concerns went far beyond the economic.
He wanted to understand the money system because

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.190
his underlying ambition was to make nations
and people happier. Smith remains an invaluable

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.120
guide to four ideas:

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.199
When one considers the modern world of work,

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.860
two facts stand out:
- modern economies produce unprecedented amounts

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.699
of wealth.
- many ordinary people find work rather boring

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.890
and (a key complaint): meaning-less.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.770
The two phenomena are in fact intimately related,
as Adam Smith was the first to understand

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.520
through his theory of specialisation.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.330
He observed that in modern businesses, tasks
formerly done by one person in a single day

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.050
could far more profitably be split into many
tasks carried out by multiple people over

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.160
whole careers. Smith hailed this as a momentous
development: he predicted that national economies

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.440
would become hugely richer the more specialised
their workforces became.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.140
One sign our world is now so rich, Smith could
tell us, is that every time we meet a stranger,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.519
we’re unlikely to understand what they do.
The mania for incomprehensible job titles

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:46.060
– Logistics Supply Manager, Packaging Coordinator,
Communications and Learning Officer – prove

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.700
the economic logic of Smith’s insight.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.130
But there is one huge problem with specialisation:
meaning. When businesses are small and their

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.140
processes contained, a sense of helping others
is readily available.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.900
But when everything is industrialised, one
ends up as a tiny cog in a gigantic machine

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.119
whose overall logic is liable to be absent
from the minds of people lower down in the

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.890
organisation. A company with 150,000 employees
distributed across four continents, making

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.280
things that take five years from conception
to delivery, will struggle to maintain any

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.500
sense of purpose and cohesion.
So Smith discerned that bosses of the specialised

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.030
corporations of modernity therefore have an extra responsibility to their workers:

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.100
to remind them of the purpose, role and ultimate
dignity of their labour.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.200
Smith’s age saw the development of what

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.980
we’d now call consumer capitalism.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.600
Manufacturers began turning out luxury goods for a broadening middle class.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.030
Some commentators were appalled. The philosopher
Jean-Jacques Rousseau wished to ban ‘luxury’

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.450
from his native Geneva. He was a particular
fan of ancient Sparta and argued that his

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.800
city should copy its austere, martial lifestyle.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.560
Disagreeing violently, Smith pointed out to
the Swiss philosopher that luxury consumerism

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.210
in fact had a very serious role to play in
a good society – it generated the surplus

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.690
wealth that allowed societies to look after
their weakest members. Consumer societies,

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.520
despite their frivolity, didn’t let young
children and the old starve, for they could

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.060
afford hospitals and poor relief.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.440
So Smith defended consumer capitalism on the
basis that it did more good for the poor than

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.069
societies devoted to high ideals. That said,
Smith held out some fascinating hopes for

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.170
the future of capitalism. He didn’t want
it to stay stuck at the frivolous level forever.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.740
He observed that humans have many ‘higher’
needs that currently lie outside of capitalist

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.140
enterprise: among these, our need for education,
for self-understanding, for beautiful cities

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.800
and for rewarding social lives.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.700
The hope for the future is that we’ll learn
to generate sizeable profits from helping

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.140
people in truly important, ambitious ways.
Properly developed, capitalism shoudln’t just

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.959
service our basic material needs while exciting
us to buy frivolous things. It should make

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.439
money from goods and services that deliver
true fulfiflment.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.880
Then as now, the great question was how to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.220
get the rich to behave well towards the rest
of society. The Christian answer to this was:

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.000
make them feel guilty.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.289
Meanwhile, the radical, left-wing answer was
then and is now: raise taxes. But Smith disagreed

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.440
with both approaches: the hearts of the rich
were likely to remain cold and high taxes

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.250
would simply lead the rich to flee the country.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.190
He proposed that, contrary to what one might
expect, it isn’t money the rich really care

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.690
about. It is honour and respect. The rich
accumulate money not because they are materially

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.820
greedy, but primarily in order to be liked
and approved of.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.760
So rather than taxing the rich, governments
should understand the vanity at the heart

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.630
of the rich and their motivations.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.800
They should therefore give the rich plenty
of honour and status – in return for doing

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.820
all the good things that these narcissists
wouldn’t normally bother with, like funding

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.380
schools and hospitals and paying their workers
well. As Smith put it,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.200
“The great secret of education is
to direct vanity to proper objects.”

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.380
Big corporations feel very evil to us now,
the natural targets of blame for low-paying

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.020
jobs, environmental abuse and sickening ingredients.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.340
But Adam Smith knew there was an unexpected,
and more important, element responsible for

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.210
these ills: our taste. It’s not companies
that primarily degrade the world. It is our

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.460
appetites, which they merely serve.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.340
As a result, the reform of capitalism hinges
on an odd-sounding, but critical task: the

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.949
education of the consumer. We need to be taught
to want better quality things and pay a proper

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.639
price for them, one that reflects the true
burden on workers and the environment.

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:50.560
A good capitalist society doesn’t just offer
customers choice, it also teaches people to

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:57.340
exercise this choice in judicious ways. Capitalism
can, Smith suggests, be saved by elevating

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.600
the quality of consumer demand.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.720
The economic state of the world can seem at

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.800
once so wrong and yet so complicated, we end
up collapsing into despair and passivity.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.139
Adam Smith is on hand to lend us confidence
and hope. His work is full of ideas about

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:20.860
how human values can be reconciled with the
needs of businesses. He deserves our ongoing

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.740
attention because he was interested in an
issue that has become a leading priority of

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.120
our own times: how to create an economy that
is at once profitable and civilised.
