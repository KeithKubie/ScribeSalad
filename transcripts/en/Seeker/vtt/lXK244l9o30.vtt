00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.940
I can use one of the four fundamental forces
of nature, to defy the other, right here,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:04.940
right now.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.640
Boom. [uses balloon and sticks it to self]
TAKE THAT GRAVITY.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.509
ELECTROMAGNETISM FOREVER.

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.069
Howdy boson buddies, this is DNews, I'm Trace!

00:00:19.069 --> 00:00:21.220
There are four fundamental forces in the universe.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.369
You know them, you love them, you're feeling
some right now: those are gravity, electromagnetism,

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.479
weak nuclear and strong nuclear.

00:00:28.479 --> 00:00:32.090
Each of these forces (mostly) fit into the
standard model of physics, the rulebook by

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.830
which physicists explain our universe.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.470
Gravity is a bit… weird.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.340
By the way, if you don't know what those Fundamental
Forces are about, you should probably watch

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.340
this video.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.760
Recently, a new discovery out of the Hungarian
Academy of Sciences got the media abuzz about

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.870
a possible fifth fundamental force.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.500
But, according to their paper in Physical
Review Letters they didn't really discover

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.500
a new force.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.360
Nope, what they found was *drum roll* an anomaly.4
The team was looking for "dark photons,"5

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.640
which sounds like an awesome Norwegian Death
Metal band, but in reality, it was a theorized

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.560
subatomic particle related to dark matter.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.500
Dark matter is scientists' name for matter
that doesn't interact with the normal stuff

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.789
the universe seems to be made of -- you, me,
the rock, the tree, the sun, and so on.

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:19.969
The researchers said, their data anomaly might
be a "protophobic X boson" that's 30 times

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.750
more massive than an electron.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.299
Later, in a review, scientists at the University
of California, Irvine said this might indicate

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.369
there is a fifth fundamental force of nature
that no one had ever detected before.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.259
But first, lemme explain.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.749
Bosons are a group of subatomic particles,
theorized by Einstein and Satyendra Nath Bose;

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:40.210
boson for Bose.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.829
The science is a bit complex, but essentially
bosons are particles which can exist in multiple

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.999
states, and spin with an integer or zero…

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:52.090
Don't worry about it, but a good example would
be the photon: the particles that make up

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.130
light, which can also be waves -- multiple
states.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.450
Look, it's not super important to understand,
just picture a tiny part of an atom.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.840
Each of these bosons interacts in some way,
which is how we can detect their presence.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.290
For example, the photon interacts with electrons
(which are negatively charged) and protons

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.080
(which are positively charged), right?

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.860
That's all part of the electromagnetic power
of the photon.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.410
Physicists believe each fundamental force
of nature has a corresponding subatomic particle.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.560
As I mentioned, the "photon" carries electromagnetic
force, strong nuclear force is carried by

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.911
the "gluon," weak nuclear force is carried
by "W and Z" bosons, and (theoretically) gravity

00:02:29.911 --> 00:02:31.890
would be carried by the "graviton."

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.890
Although, admittedly, scientists haven't found
that one yet.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.840
So, if this new boson discovery is confirmed,
(and it hasn't been yet), it would show a

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.540
force that interacts with electrons (which,
again, are negatively charged) and neutrons

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.260
(no charge at all)!

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.660
This is super strange!

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.870
The lead researcher from the UC Irvine team
speculates that this could be the indication

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.740
of a "grander, more fundamental force" but
it could also be the key to finally detecting

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.740
"dark matter."

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.810
Which, again, is matter in the universe that
haven't been able to detect, because it doesn't

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.680
seem to interact with anything!

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.810
This "protophobic X boson" interacts very
lightly, and in unexpected ways22, and that

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.960
could physicists to start looking for interactions
that they would have easily missed otherwise!

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.590
A new force could add more chapters to the
Standard Model of Physics.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.930
Of course, we don't know yet.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.990
Other scientists at European Organization
for Nuclear Research are looking to confirm

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.420
these findings, and some scientists are skeptical
of the findings ALTOGETHER!!

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.780
So more research is DEFINITELY needed.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.300
Practically speaking, we have no idea what
confirmation of this could prove.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.360
In 600 BC, the Greeks discovered if you rub
animal fur on a bit of amber you'd get a strange

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.360
attraction.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.470
Now we know it's static electricity, but it
would be centuries before we'd learned to

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.570
master electromagnetism.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.330
These new chapters of science have to start
somewhere, and maybe, just maybe, this was

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.330
it.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.440
Want to know how they smash atoms together
to find new particles?

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.100
I went to the Large Hadron Collider and got
a tour!!

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.460
IT WAS SO COOL.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:17.120
Here's how it works.
