00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 align:start position:0%
it
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.399 align:start position:0%

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 align:start position:0%
invisible to you and it's partly because
 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
invisible to you and it's partly because
you<00:01:17.009><c> implicitly</c><00:01:17.640><c> trust</c><00:01:17.909><c> the</c><00:01:18.240><c> structure</c><00:01:18.780><c> and</c>

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 align:start position:0%
you implicitly trust the structure and
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.690 align:start position:0%
you implicitly trust the structure and

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
so maybe you go into the unconscious
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.149 align:start position:0%
so maybe you go into the unconscious
