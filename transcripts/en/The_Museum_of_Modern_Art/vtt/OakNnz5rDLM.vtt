00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:08.000
Aaron: So the transparent screen is showing
performance footage of the same slideshow

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.190
we’re showing in the gallery.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.420
When the performance was shot, the white balance
was created in such a way that it adds a blue

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.050
tinge to the slides, so basically our choice
now is—if we want them to match—do we

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.520
try to add a blue tinge to the wall?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.220
Or do we try to remove the blue from the footage?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.150
Leah: Oh, I don’t think we should make the
slides blue.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.150
That would be…

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.200
Charlie: No, they’re beautiful in black
and white.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.640
Aaron: So I think we should look at maybe
trying to desaturate the performance footage

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.250
and try to get them to work better together
that way.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.679
Leah: Well, I think we should test it in the
space though just to see…

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.559
Charlie: I brought my computer because I have
everything laid out on my computer…

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.619
Leah: You know, my instinct is to keep the
color because it tells you it’s something

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:57.589
different, you know, and that it’s live.

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.780
Charlie: Well, if you look at it in the wide
shot you’ll see…

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.949
That’s when it’s really blue.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.290
But everything is blue, that’s the thing.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.939
The floor is blue.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.170
Leah: I see what you’re talking about.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.299
The one thing that I do like about having
it in color is that it keeps some sense that

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.890
it’s different in character from the slide
projection, that it’s a continually re-performed

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.090
work, and this is one…

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.619
But I wonder if we can get it less blue and
keep the sense of it being in color or whether

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.060
you think that really the only way we can
make it work is to…

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.729
Charlie: Well, you can desaturate it and everything
gets desaturated and it’s still color.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.329
Leah: Well, Charlie, I’m going to leave
that decision to you.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.950
Charlie: I’m not that bothered by the fact
that it’s blue versus this—because it

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.390
is two different things.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.929
But I was just trying to make it match…

00:01:53.929 --> 00:02:00.780
Aaron: Well, we certainly don’t want people
to think that this is one piece that is being

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.780
staged in a gallery.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.420
Leah: Yeah, and the more discrepant things
are, the more it seems like maybe we should

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.650
just try to tell people that this is how it
looks in the context of a performance.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.690
Mack: And what about that?

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.810
Leah: What about what?

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.340
Aaron: There will be some spill.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.190
Mack: It will be like this more than like
this, but…

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.510
Leah: You mean spill on the floor?

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.379
Aaron: Yeah, but you see that bottom right
corner which is representative of the actual…

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.860
Leah: I don’t know…

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.090
Charlie: I like it.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.439
Mack: It looks really good there.

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:36.549
Charlie: Yeah.

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.871
I’m just wondering if you want to put something
on the floor to make it even, but maybe not…

00:02:41.871 --> 00:02:43.800
Leah: Actually the colors on the floor are
pretty good!

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.050
Mack: The issue is that you see the keystoning
on the floor.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.060
Charlie: I like that.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.720
I mean, that’s what happens when you project
from above…

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.670
Aaron: I mean, this is two layers of the film,
so actually if you look at one layer it will

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.970
then be much more on the floor.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.500
And it’s a little sharper because the two
layers soften it just a touch—soften the

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.500
edges.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.750
Leah: Can we try it that way, and if we change
our minds we add another layer?

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.750
Aaron: Sure.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.750
Leah: Okay.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.989
Yeah, I love it actually.

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.030
I really love it.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.749
I think people are just going to stay here
mesmerized.
