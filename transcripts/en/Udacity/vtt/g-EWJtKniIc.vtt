00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is our first serious equation of the course—Δx = V₀t + ½at².

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now, I've introduced this Δ because this equation really describes how much

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and object position changes from here to there

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
over a period of time, given an initial velocity and an acceleration.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I wrote a here instead of g, because a is more general.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In physics we like general equations.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is the acceleration of your object, which on earth in free fall does happen

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to be this number g, which is 10 m/s².

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
On the moon, though, this number actually significantly smaller.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So, this is one of the important kinematic equations.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It's one of the equations that really describes how objects move.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now, there's a couple other kinematic equations that I want to talk about,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and I'm actually going to do something that I'm a little reluctant to do.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I'm going to give them to you.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The next one I want to talk about is this one—

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
velocity equals initial velocity + acceleration times the amount of time the object's been moving.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Okay, fine. Why am I reluctant to give this to you?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm reluctant because I already did.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When we defined acceleration, we defined it as a change in velocity over some elapsed time,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
some change in time.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In fact, that's exactly what this equation says, though it's hidden a bit.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This velocity is actually what we can call some final velocity, after some time has elapsed.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If we just rearrange this a little bit—like this—and then we can even divide by t if we'd like,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we have this definition of acceleration.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's the change in velocity—final minus initial—over the elapsed time t.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The last equation I want to talk about is this one. What does this one say?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I says that there's some relationship between final velocity and initial velocity,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
acceleration and distance traveled.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Deriving this one is a big trickier, but it's still something that I think you can do.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm not going to do the derivation here, but I'd love to see some discussion about this in the forums.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now, let me say this is often the place where students get a bit scared.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I've had many students tell me that equations are frightening,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
but the fact is they aren't. They're inanimate objects.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They're not even objects. They're an inanimate idea.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In fact, they're a tool. They're a tool for us.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When you see a tool that you don't know how to use, you have two choices for how to respond.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You can walk away, discouraged because you don't know what to do with it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Or you can imagine all the amazing things this tool will let you do,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
sit down, and learn to use it. I hope that's the option you choose.

00:02:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's sit down and learn how to use these tools.
