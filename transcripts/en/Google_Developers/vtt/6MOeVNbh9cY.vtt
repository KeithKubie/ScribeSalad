MIKI KONNO: Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.610
Thank you for having us.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.810
I am Miki Konno.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.140
This is Bethany Fong.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.940
As you all know, Google takes
the user very seriously.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.530
An essential part of
that is gather and

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.560
utilize user feedback.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.250
And what we're going to talk
about today is how we do it.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.020
I've been a UX researcher for
the last 12 years and have a

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.190
background in human factors and
organizational psychology.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.860
Prior to Google, I worked at
Sony, HP, and Microsoft.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.540
And I'm currently as a part of
Android UX team, focusing on

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.480
Android At Home project.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.040
Although the majority of my work
is around end consumer

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.340
user, I've been proactively
involved in

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.790
Agile developer community.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.590
And I am very happy
to be here.

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.090
BETHANY FONG: I'm Bethany Fong,
and I've been a designer

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.350
for Android for about
two years now.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.540
And my background is in
engineering and product design

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.870
through Stanford's
design program.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.520
And I'm very excited to be here
today to help you learn

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.640
how to do research, because
it's one of my

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.580
favorite parts of my job.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.670
I love talking to real users
and seeing the unexpected

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.890
things they do.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.470
And I love putting those
observations into design

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.400
improvements and ultimately
into code.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.160
So today, in 40 minutes, we're
going to give you an overview

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.380
of UX research from an Agile
developer's perspective.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.640
And we'll walk through four
case studies of different

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.010
testing methods that we use
in Android every day.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.520
By the end of the talk, you'll
be ready to start running

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.780
tests on your own products.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.790
So let's start with that
overview of UX research from a

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.040
developer's perspective.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.260
So why should developers
care about UX testing?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.930
Well, Dr. Claire-Marie Karat
from IBM has performed quite a

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.330
bit of research on return
on usability investment.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.449
And she found that as
a rule of thumb--

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.900
for every dollar spent solving
a problem in design, you save

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.500
$10 in development, and you
save $100 in post-release

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.800
maintenance.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.090
As developers, that should catch
your interest because

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.680
that's your time and
effort being

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.910
saved due to UX research.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.200
And this is why we're
doing this talk.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.740
We value efficiency and
robust products.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.160
And we know that you
guys do, too.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.320
So what kind of usability
improvements are you going to

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.220
invest that $1 into?

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.710
When you start looking into
it, you might encounter a

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.520
process like this--

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.580
the long, slow Japanese
tea ceremony.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.110
It's complicated and requires
patience for everybody, and it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.360
takes almost two hours to make
just one cup of tea.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.140
But it's worth it in the end.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.170
It's just not compatible with
the need for speed.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.120
And here's the equivalent
process in the research world.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.970
This is a traditional UX study
schedule laid out end to end.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.980
And I do want to point out that
this is not how Android

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.280
runs design research today.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.240
This process takes between five
to six weeks to run its

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.910
full course, starting from the
initial participant screener

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.820
creating the study, setting it
up, running it, and then

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.200
analyzing the results.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.980
And when you overlay a typical
two-week software development

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.080
cycle over it, starting from the
task selection and ending

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.530
with a nice shippable increment,
you see that these

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.640
aren't compatible.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.380
For the same user task, you can
start the research in the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.860
software development at the
same week, where you'll be

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.820
done with the development
way before you even

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.600
start talking to users.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.780
And you'll actually have a few
increments done by the end of

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.630
the testing phase.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.180
So here are some of the needs
that we hear from developers

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.510
when they encounter a
timeline like that.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.620
We hear, can we get
user feedback

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.430
before we start coding?

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.700
We need feedback on these
brainstorm ideas now.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.210
Can't you get to the data
analysis any quicker?

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.440
And there's no time to
test every user story

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.690
that we want to build.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.430
So maybe what we're looking for
is something more like the

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.100
espresso shop for the UX
research world and less like

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.650
Japanese tea.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.380
Espresso is still a lovely
caffeinated beverage.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.440
But it's a lot quicker to make
and it packs a punch.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.930
OK, so let's look at the
landscape of how researchers

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.110
measure users.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.890
and see which area is
"espresso-able." Here is UX

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.640
research laid out on a
two-by-two matrix.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.990
This axis from top to bottom
is qualitative to

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.090
quantitative.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.570
This axis from left to right
runs from people's goals and

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.680
attitudes to people's
behavior.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.670
And you probably recognize a lot
of the different methods

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.440
laid out on this grid or have
participated in one of these

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.230
studies yourself.

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.000
This upper right quadrant, the
area pertaining to insights

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.090
into what people do, is the one
that works well for fast

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.370
turnaround and quick feedback.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.840
And it's the most tactical.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.580
All the other quadrants
are more strategic,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.130
though equally important.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.840
They do take more prep
time and more time

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.500
to analyze the results.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.730
This upper left quadrant is--

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.990
you address this before you
start building anything.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.290
It's more formative, and it
helps with concept creation.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.290
This lower left, it's more
about market research.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.100
It's more about existing habits
and behaviors, and you

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.520
have to gather a lot of
people to get results.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.200
This lower right, we're getting
closer to Agile, but

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.810
it takes a lot of preparation
and analysis.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.180
And although AB testing can be
fast, you don't get insights

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.400
into why people do
what they do.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:40.480
So we're going to focus on the
most tactical methods from

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.980
this graph and insights
into what people do.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.330
So we're going to give you
four examples of those

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.120
tactical methods that
we run in Android.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.550
Let's start with the heuristic
evaluation.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.720
Heuristic evaluation is, in
one word, measurement.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.410
It helps you gain insight into
your products' performance

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.170
against typical behavior.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.810
You're measuring against that
upper right quadrant.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:12.250
It's a review of your product
against a set of usability

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.690
principles, such as the user
should know what's happening

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:17.200
in the system at all times.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.720
Or there should be
no extraneous

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.850
information on the screen.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.580
Think about your own
area of expertise.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.130
How would you look at your
product from that

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.010
single point of view?

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.830
Maybe you're a security expert,
or you're the person

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.510
in charge of Help tools, or
you developed the design

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.560
principles for your team.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.550
How could you measure an
existing product against your

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.450
own key principles?

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.030
If you need some ideas, there
are many lists of usability

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.020
heuristics online.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.910
Just start with Wikipedia.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.220
And if you were here for Helen
and Rachel's talk right before

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.810
this, that's another great
list that you could use.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.250
So here's the process for
heuristic evaluation.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.330
And I'm going to be using an
example from Android to

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.820
illustrate this.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.960
A few months ago, another
company released a tablet, and

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.680
our leadership wanted to know
how long those set of

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.960
processes took.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.210
This is a great question to
evaluate using a heuristic

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.530
method because it was a
quantitative question.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:13.700
Great questions can be how
long does this take?

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.900
Or how many times might a user
need to navigate away?

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.850
Or something a little less
quantitative, but still

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.720
measurable, like how well does
this flow and adhere to

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.800
principle x.?

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.610
So we set up some speed-based
usability heuristics--

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.200
number of screens, number of
clicks, number of times to

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.155
enter text, minutes of loading
time, confusing language that

00:07:33.155 --> 00:07:34.940
would slow somebody down.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.300
Then we set up a room and time
to meet up with our key

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.600
stakeholders--

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.880
our researcher, our project
manager, and

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.150
our set up flow designer.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.810
We then ran through the set-up
process together at a measured

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:50.650
pace, keeping track of time, but
also taking detailed notes

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:53.780
on each step of the process and
how well all the elements

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.250
on the screen helped us, the
user, get through setup as

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.080
quickly as possible.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.130
I can't tell you in too much
detail what we found.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.700
But we were pleased to
see that it was a

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.140
standard set-up process.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.680
And it also used some industry
standard design niceties, like

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.480
using loading time to
educate the user on

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.050
how to use the tablet.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.180
So we wrote a quick summary
report with what was good and

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.180
bad and how long
the setup took.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.750
It actually took much longer
than we expected, about 10

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.070
minutes longer.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.320
So what next?

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.770
So normally action items, when
you're running against your

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.460
own products, are usability
action items, like we have to

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.230
move this button, or we have
to change this wording.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.020
But action items from running
a heuristic evaluation as a

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.890
competitive analysis usually
have to do with keeping up

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:37.679
with industry baselines.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.250
And this helps with scheduling
our own work and saving our

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.310
respective teams and our
developers from churn.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.670
So to recap what makes a
heuristic evaluation unique is

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.890
that it gives you evidence of
adherence to principles.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.570
It requires one researcher, no
users, and no lab, so it's

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.080
pretty cheap and easy
to conduct.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.030
Some things to keep in mind as
you're considering it is that

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.260
it doesn't put a real user
in front of you.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.970
So even though it provides great
baseline knowledge, it

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.700
won't through you those
real-world curve balls.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.670
And it'll always be subjective
based on which expert is

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.920
running it.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.320
But it's a great place to get
basic understanding of your

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.635
own product and of your
competitors' products.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:27.430
MIKI KONNO: Next I'm going to
talk about the RITE study--

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.060
Rapid Iterative Testing
and Evaluation

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.890
method, aka RITE method.

00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:36.490
Some of you might be familiar
with this terminology.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.462
This method was originally
created by a UX researcher in

00:09:39.462 --> 00:09:42.180
game studio at Microsoft.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.620
This is an iterative type of
usability method and commonly

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:51.760
used for the continuous design
iteration on prototypes.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.480
Here's a common process
for the RITE study.

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.407
Starting with the research
question from the team, such

00:09:59.407 --> 00:10:03.470
as well, I really need to get
quick feedback on this, an UX

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.630
researcher maybe put together
a brief script

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.320
and conduct a study.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.190
I mean, this portion is very
similar to traditional

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.942
usability studies.

00:10:12.942 --> 00:10:17.410
It's different because the
interface changes of the

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:22.090
prototype will be immediately
available after each user.

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:26.670
Therefore, this cycle
repeats itself.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.220
Let's say you have five users
coming to the study for a

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.670
one-hour session each.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:37.910
So you will start with the one
hour between each session, for

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.070
example, 9:00 AM and 11:00
AM, between one hour as

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:43.210
illustrated.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:48.170
In this case, changes to the
interface are made immediately

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.560
after the first user.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.330
Then interface is tested
with the second user.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.990
This cycle continues until the
very last 5:00 PM user.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.080
This method is frequently used
for small design changes, in

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:09.400
UI tweaks, or perhaps a
design explanation.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.400
And it's great to use for the
prototype and great way to

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.460
make design improvements
in small increments.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:21.740
It's preferred to have a
dedicated UX researcher to

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:27.470
require to facilitate, and a
dedicated designer or even a

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.860
developer is needed to
iterate the design.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.390
It could be run in one day, as
illustrated, or you can spread

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:37.910
out to two days.

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:42.880
So here is the two-day
RITE method example.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.640
For two-day RITE method, the
first design iteration can be

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:52.180
made after all three users
perform on the first day and

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:56.810
test of the new design with
three users on the second day.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.830
And then you make additional
design changes after all users

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.560
are finished.

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.430
Let me give you some example
from a Nexus

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.470
7 Quick Start guide.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.720
I don't know if you're familiar
with this, but to use

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.910
Nexus 7 with mobile network
data, you must first insert

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.830
and activate micro-SIM card.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.070
So when one of the tech writers
approached me asking,

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:29.510
well, Miki, I don't know if this
graphic is going to work.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.960
Because I really have a concern
around if the user

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:38.490
will understand how to remove
the SIM and orientation of the

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.770
SIM card itself.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:47.300
So we basically decided to
run a two-day RITE study.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.240
On the first day, we found
several issues with the very

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.410
first user.

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.850
So the user understood the
orientation of the SIM card,

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.760
but they still could not locate
the exact location of

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:05.920
the SIM card cart to using
a pin to take it out.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.400
So the user had some
difficulty with it.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.990
And when the second user did the
same thing, we felt like

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.520
we needed to change the
design quickly.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.870
While I'm conducting the third
user, the designer put

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.000
together a new design
by next day.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.330
So the second day, we used the
new design to test it with

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.630
three users.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:31.010
This time, it worked really,
really well, much better than

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:32.570
we expected.

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:34.810
But again, any usability
study, there's

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.430
new stuff comes up.

00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:41.065
At last, we made more design
changes after the whole study

00:13:41.065 --> 00:13:44.090
is completed and shared the
result with the key

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.630
stakeholders.

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:48.640
Initially, they told me we have
only two weeks to finish

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.070
the design.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:54.170
By that time, we thought, no,
it's not going to be possible.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:58.250
But by the time we're done, we
feel like, wow, we really

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:01.660
still made it work.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:06.600
So in summary, the RITE study
focuses on changes in the

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.270
design in an iterative manner.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.460
It requires one researcher, or
one designer, or perhaps

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.750
developer, and five
to six users.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.570
This type of study requires
a usability lab

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:21.660
or conference room.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.890
And it takes a day or
two to conduct.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.810
There are many pros of using
this type of method.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:33.330
It's agile and using
real users.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.650
And it's collaborative because
the team has to agree on each

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.910
design solution within
allocated time.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.620
Remember, you have
only one hour to

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.600
come up with the solutions.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.760
Visual and very focused, because
design changes are

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:51.400
instantly visible, and the team
is able to focus on a

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.640
very focused design issue,
one at a time.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.150
BETHANY FONG: So our next method
is the Cafe study,

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:03.970
which is a very popular study
method at Google.

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:06.410
And as you can tell from the
picture, you get to talk to

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.710
real people in a Cafe study.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:11.700
It's a quick way to get real
user feedback without needing

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.200
a lab or pre-recruited
participants.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.640
You use your device, running a
prototype, in a cafe, and you

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.510
politely ask people if they
could give you their feedback

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.000
on your product.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.800
And because you're asking real
people with busy lives, you

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.100
really have just a few minutes
for one or two

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.370
scenarios to test.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.000
Like how would you share this
picture with your friend?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.660
Or do you know where to go
after setup is done?

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.730
So a Cafe study is useful to get
fresh user eyes on small

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.280
and isolated usability issues.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.650
And here's how we've used the
Cafe study method at Android.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.230
As you might know, we created
the ability to put widgets on

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:52.140
the lock screen with
Jelly Bean 4.2.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:54.660
And when we were prototyping
this, we experimented with

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.400
different visual and animated
ways of hinting that you could

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.090
put a widget on the
lock screen.

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:00.960
And one of them was putting bite
hints on the side of the

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.350
screen, showing that you can
swipe up or to the side to

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.890
access your widgets.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:06.800
And this animation protruded
a little bit

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.350
into the Unlock area.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.920
So we wanted to make sure that
people could still unlock

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.490
their phones without activating
the widgets.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:16.210
And so this was a really good
Cafe study question because it

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.190
was a very bounded use case.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:20.250
Can a user unlock their
device successfully?

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.540
So we then got set up with a
very quick script of a few

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.350
questions and several phones
running the widget prototype

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:30.870
with a few different lock
screen patterns.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:36.550
A researcher and a note taker
then went to our Google cafes

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.680
to find some willing
participants.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.390
And Google cafes, are great for
us, because Googlers are

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.680
usually very excited to help.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.210
They have a lot of opinions,
and they are familiar with

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:48.970
usability studies.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.640
And if you're part of a large
company, you will probably

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.930
find equally excited

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.380
participants among your employees.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.400
And if you don't have large
herds of hungry coworkers to

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.940
access, there's always
the public.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.400
You can go to a real cafe, or
a farmers' market, or a

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.450
shopping mall and ask
people there.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.480
So over a couple of hours, we
ended up talking to 21 people

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.390
with a total of about 90 lock
screen attempts among them.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.069
And it was conclusive.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.960
No one accidentally triggered
the widgets when they unlocked

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.359
the phone, which is awesome.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.560
It's very rare you
get that kind of

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.740
really conclusive evidence.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.369
So we had found a hinting
mechanism that didn't activate

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.940
the wrong thing.

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:34.120
However, a different problem
arose, which is very few

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.040
people actually noticed and
asked what the white hinting

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.710
was for the widgets.

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:41.000
So then we went back to
the prototyping team.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.670
We were able to tell them that
taking up home screen space

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.660
was fine functionally.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.990
But we needed to keep working
on discoverability

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.960
for the next test.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.450
And that's actually what
we did for our

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.010
next usability test.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:58.080
So what makes Cafe study a
unique method is that it's a

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:01.140
quick way to assess those
wishy-washy design changes

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.210
that no one on your
team really knows

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:04.790
how to decide about.

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:06.960
But just put it in front of a
real user, and they will tell

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.900
you very quickly which one
you should go with.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.375
And it's easy to put together
since you don't need a lab.

00:18:12.375 --> 00:18:15.530
And the report is quick to write
because it's basically

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:19.660
yes or no and common reasons
why or why not.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.790
Remember that you should just
test limited feature areas.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.730
And because you're getting
a random sample of the

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.100
population, you don't know about
the user's background

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.320
with your product or with
similar products.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.120
So you're really just testing
their behavior.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.630
MIKI KONNO: So next we're
going to talk

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.700
about the Pulse study.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.660
The reason why we call it Pulse
study is because the

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:50.220
method is to assess the current
health of the product.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.440
And it's also structured
in the way that you can

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.560
constantly monitor the health
of the product.

00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:00.290
The Pulse study uses continuous
user feedback along

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.470
with a sprint cadence.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.940
Therefore, it takes only one
week from start to finish.

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:11.310
It meets sprint team's urgent
needs, works well with user

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.290
stories, or small features.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.160
It's flexible to test any type
of research questions,

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.615
requires minimal advance
planning, and has immediate

00:19:22.615 --> 00:19:23.865
product impact.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:29.790
Here's what the process
looks like.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:33.200
During the Monday scrum, we
decide what to test on the

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.970
particular week as a team.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.080
Once we know what we're
testing, we

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.260
decide who to recruit.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.270
We are lucky to have a dedicated
recruiter at Google

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:48.930
because she understands the
exact target users.

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:53.440
On Tuesday and Wednesday, I
decide what research method we

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.820
use based on what we're testing
and start creating a

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:01.290
lightweight protocol
or script.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.300
And then I walk through with the
team usually because they

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:08.842
need to prep the design
or prototypes.

00:20:08.842 --> 00:20:11.710
By the time Thursday and Friday
comes, we expect the

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.700
six users are already recruited,
and they come to

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.260
the usability study.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.590
Sometimes we divide it into
three users on Thursday and

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:23.960
three users Friday, so that we
can decide to use the two-day

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.800
RITE method, we can do that.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.650
Usually we spend one hour
for each participant.

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:34.510
It's a good length because you
can really focus within the

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.300
one-hour time frame.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.470
Key finding will be sent
out after each daily

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.090
briefing with the team.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:44.960
And then we then brainstorm
solution for the issues,

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:50.350
filing the bug, adding new
user stories and so on.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.160
In summary, the Pulse study

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.290
structure is fast and flexible.

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:58.190
It can be used with many
different types of research.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.390
It requires one researcher, a
couple of observers, and five

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.340
to six users.

00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:08.010
In this type of study, it's a
good to use a usability lab or

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:13.350
conference room and takes a
week from start to finish.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:17.990
It works well with the sprint
planning, mockups and demos,

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:23.220
smaller and simpler features,
and perhaps quick UI fixes.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.870
It complements full-scale
research that requires more

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:32.340
users and which are typically
long term, complex, and

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:33.590
strategic in nature.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.570
Now I would like to go in little
more detail about how

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:44.232
to run the Pulse study.

00:21:44.232 --> 00:21:47.775
The first step is to decide what
you are really testing.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:53.000
Do you want to test some
sprint build, what's a

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.050
so-called [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.320
at Google.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.850
Perhaps a UX designer may be
having some mockups or

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.590
prototypes to show
to the user.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.620
Or perhaps a industrial
designer wants to get

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.870
out-of-the-box solutions.

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:13.960
Next you need to decide who
is your target user?

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.850
In Android, especially with a
brand new product, we often

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:19.420
use internal people.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:23.950
But we also use external users
to get more general insights

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:27.690
into usage and knowledge around
the released product.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:32.030
Having a target profile will be
really helpful because it's

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:35.290
coming up with more focused
research questions as well as

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.460
it helps you determine
the relevancy of the

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.980
results from the study.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.430
So now who's doing what?

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.160
You need to assign the team
to different roles and

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.980
responsibilities.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.160
Usually I'll be the moderator
because I'm a UX researcher.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.740
But other team members
are either

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.920
observers or note takers.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:01.520
At Google, research project
is a team project.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.490
When I joined Google, Bethany
immediately helped me out with

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:09.195
setting up the lab, taking
notes, observing, and sharing

00:23:09.195 --> 00:23:10.600
key insights.

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.700
I thought she was helping me
because she's just nice.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.720
Or I'm new.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.950
But it turns out it was
the norm at Google.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:23.930
It's invaluable to get team's
feedback before, during, and

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:25.830
after the study.

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:29.490
By the time you finish the
study, everybody knows what

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:34.190
happened and what kind of
solution they may need for the

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:35.440
particular product.

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.190
Now you need to determine where
you should perform to

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:48.400
study at, a lab like this or
maybe a conference room.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.340
This is the Android
At Home lab.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.900
As you can see, this
looks like real

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:55.380
second story buildings.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.300
Homes exist inside
of our building.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.510
I must admit I'm very lucky
to have a lab like this.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:07.320
Bethany and another researcher
created this lab just for the

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.720
Android At Home project.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:15.480
Some people are surprised when
they come to the lab.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.040
This home lab is nice because
it has an environment where

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.160
user feels completely
comfortable

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.880
and truly feel home.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.490
There's a kitchen table.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.490
There's a couch, TV.

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:33.830
And then there's also an office
and a bedroom you don't

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:35.680
see in the picture.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.280
We can use this space for
multiple purposes, such as

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.820
one-on-one usability sessions,
group sessions, even for the

00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.670
team brainstorming in
the home context.

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.250
This is a wonderful space to
get feedback on the mobile

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.020
devices because it's more
realistic than using office

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.470
setup, as typically usability
labs look like.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.750
There are three cameras, and
we can control from the

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.150
observation room.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.830
This is the observation
room upstairs.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:08.420
It's hooked up with AV equipment
so that team can

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.580
observe the sessions upstairs.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:16.200
And we can also communicate
through walkie talkies.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.340
There are many couches, so a
number of people can sit down

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.850
and relax and watch or
observe the study.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.490
And there are white boards so
that the observer can write

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:31.256
down some issues or perhaps
doing some design solutions.

00:25:31.256 --> 00:25:34.090
A conference room is also
right next to it.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:37.630
Therefore, the team can attend
a video conference without

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.800
leaving the lab.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.970
Actually, you really don't need
an elaborate lab to gain

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:45.720
user insights.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.940
All you need is a couple
conference rooms, and the

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:50.660
Google Hangout.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:55.940
For example, there was one
time our lab lost power.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.570
It was completely shut down.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.940
So we had to scramble because
three more users were coming.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.380
So we immediately booked two
conference rooms, one for

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:07.270
conducting study, another
one for observer.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.880
And then we used a Google
Hangout to continue the

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.150
session, and it worked
really well.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.510
So once you have everything set
up in place, you are ready

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:21.940
to execute the study.

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.240
I'm sure some of you
have never done a

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.150
usability study before.

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:27.700
But you don't have to
worry about that.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:31.770
Your job is to let users
speak up and talk about

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.570
your product honestly.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:37.360
You can follow simple guidelines
to get maximum

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.220
insight from users.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.830
Make them feel comfortable
when they come in.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:43.940
How's your day?

00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:46.000
How was traffic?

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.670
Hey, thanks for helping us.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:52.010
Let them know problems
are not their fault.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.190
Make sure to say something
like, well,

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:55.320
we're not testing you.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:56.070
Don't worry.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.370
We're testing the product.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.260
We need your honest feedback.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.540
And listen and observe
carefully, and repeat and

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:07.320
clarify what the user said.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.530
What did you mean by that?

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.950
Could you please clarify?

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.390
OK, you know the basics.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:16.430
But you still need to be very
careful what not to do.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:20.970
For example, don't brag about
your product even though you

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.840
really feel like it.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.170
I know this is your
precious baby.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:29.340
You want to advertise how
awesome is your product.

00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:32.920
But that's opposite of the
product usability studies.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.390
Don't say something like,
isn't it awesome?

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.900
This is a great product.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:42.760
And do not insult a user, even
if you kind of feel like it.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:43.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.490
MIKI KONNO: It's never good
to say, seriously, dude.

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:49.355
I can't believe you
didn't know that.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:57.830
It's always not a good idea
to make a user undergo

00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:02.850
unnecessary suffering, even
though it's kind of fun to

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:03.900
watch it, right?

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.010
MIKI KONNO: Such as that's
still wrong.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:11.020
You have to keep trying.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.527
You need to find that button.

00:28:16.888 --> 00:28:19.910
For observers, it's nice
to use the check boxes.

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.650
You don't need to take long
notes because it's really

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:23.930
cumbersome.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.970
And it's really difficult to
take notes and observing user

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:29.310
at the same time.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.340
It's very fast to log.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.340
All you have to do is, I have
the list out so that you have

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.720
just to do the check box.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.950
It's easier for observers to
attend a session without

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.920
worried about, do I need to help
Miki to take long notes?

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:48.800
So check box always helps
with your observers.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.990
So the next step is a debriefing
with the team.

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:56.270
At Google, this is a very
important part of the study

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:01.060
because you get a lot out of it,
such as scrubbing action

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.710
items, and finding the
bugs, and so on.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:06.100
And this is genuine
cross-functional

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.400
collaboration.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.550
Maybe Bethany can comment on
that from a designer's

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.460
perspective.

00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.700
BETHANY FONG: Sure.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.960
So I just want to emphasize that
getting your whole team

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.870
together to have a
cross-functional debrief is

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:19.070
really important.

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.780
Because when the researcher
is telling you about key

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.350
problems, you can start
brainstorming ideas right

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.030
there and addressing things
like technical feasibility

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.960
issues, product scope, new
interactions you want to

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.080
introduce, all in
the same place.

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.150
And so everybody leaves with
an action item, and the

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:34.730
problem gets solved right
away instead of

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.630
languishing in your email.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.240
And it's not just about
problem solving, too.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.010
As the researcher points out,
successful features from the

00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.650
study is rewarding as a team
to see all the things that

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:45.900
worked well.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.260
MIKI KONNO: So the last
step is communication.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.810
By the time the study is
finished, teams should know

00:29:52.810 --> 00:29:54.800
what happened exactly.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.720
But the important part of
wrapping up the study is

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.180
creating a report for us.

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:04.060
Stakeholders need to know what
happened and what changes

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.250
should be made.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:09.120
And often having a report is
very useful because you may

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:13.140
not remember what happened
six months from now.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.980
Once debriefing is done, I often
send out a very brief

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.790
summary of the result by
email to the team.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:24.520
But sometimes, I need to do the
presentation for a wider

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:29.580
audience, because to address
critical issues and highlight

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.550
some of the problems by showing
pictures and playing a

00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.000
video clips from the lab.

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.850
Just communicating the result
does not really guarantee the

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.290
actual changes.

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:45.870
And my job is not completely
done yet at that point.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:51.000
So I often create a UX hot list
as a reminder that I need

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.740
to follow up these issues
to make sure

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.810
they will get resolved.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:31:00.650
Having an impact on the issues
is much more important than

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:01.900
just conducting studies.

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.380
BETHANY FONG: So I'm going
to wrap this up.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:11.140
And we hear a few frequently
asked questions.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:14.050
The first is, what if we don't
have a user researcher?

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:16.825
This is especially true for
small development groups.

00:31:16.825 --> 00:31:18.800
Well, of course, it's
great to have a user

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.260
researcher on your team.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.830
And you can always hire a
consultant for a short-term or

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:24.680
a long-term project.

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:26.540
And remember that there's
still those three other

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.370
quadrants that can be
researched, if you remember

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.090
that matrix from
the beginning.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.550
And a trained professional
will be probably best to

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.710
handle those.

00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:37.460
But in a pinch, your product
manager, UX designer, or a

00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.970
savvy developer could
run studies.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:42.210
I think now that you've heard
our presentation, you have the

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.560
basic pieces that you
need to start.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.620
Another question that we hear
is, what if we don't have the

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:49.920
budget to recruit users?

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.350
It sounds very expensive.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:55.090
Well, you can use your own
employees, like we talked

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:56.480
about in the Cafe study.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.920
Just make sure that they
aren't the ones who are

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.180
working on your product.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.040
Or you can ask your customers
through social media to

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.160
participate.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.140
And small monetary rewards or
gift cards always help and

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:09.390
aren't that expensive.

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.600
MIKI KONNO: Lastly, how do
user studies complement

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:17.260
acceptance testing?

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.220
Acceptance testing is testing
against the featured

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.960
requirements in the
sprint backlogs.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.210
But a usability study is
for user requirements.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.330
For example, a feature
requirement might be A, B, and

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:37.500
C. So OK, after usability
study sessions, we find

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:42.910
everybody can do A, B, and C.
But it could be with lots of

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:45.600
difficulty, or dissatisfaction.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.240
Then what are you going to do?

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:53.210
And maybe a user desired D
instead of A, B, and C. Then

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.450
that could be a new
feature, right?

00:32:55.450 --> 00:33:00.380
That is why usability studies
complement and do not replace

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:01.630
acceptance testing.

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.000
BETHANY FONG: So we've laid out
research methods that take

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.950
from one to two hours
to conduct, all

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:11.240
the way to a week.

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.000
And these are a great start.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.770
You don't need lab space or
recruitment time for the

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.220
heuristic study or
the cafe study.

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:22.030
And you don't need weeks of a
dedicated researcher for the

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:25.510
quick change of the RITE study
or the in-depth results of a

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.930
Pulse study.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.870
It's really easy to get started
investing that dollar

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:32.280
of design improvement.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.890
Your users' feedback
is invaluable.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.760
And we hope that after today,
you feel empowered to start

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.230
testing right away and funneling
those crucial

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:41.750
insights right back into
your products.

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:45.410
Thank you so much for coming.

00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:45.710
MIKI KONNO: Thank you so much.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:47.510
[APPLAUSE]
