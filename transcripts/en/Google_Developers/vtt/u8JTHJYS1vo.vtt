[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.382
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh!

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:08.464
BRAD ABRAMS: Hey, Timothy.

00:00:08.464 --> 00:00:09.230
How's it going?

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.670
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
It's going great.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:10.810
This is Brad Abrams.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.837
Brad is a product
manager on Assistant.

00:00:12.837 --> 00:00:13.920
BRAD ABRAMS: That's right.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.611
Yes.

00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:15.610
How's it going, Timothy?

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.530
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
It's going great.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.989
Now that you're
here and I'm here,

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.780
I think we should talk
about the Assistant.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.520
What do you think?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.440
BRAD ABRAMS: I think that
sounds like a great idea,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.340
because it's the only thing I
know to talk about, so perfect.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.423
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:27.640
Let's start with square one.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.030
BRAD ABRAMS: OK.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
What is Assistant?

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.580
And why is it cool
for developers?

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.329
BRAD ABRAMS: Well, the
Assistant is really

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.450
a conversational
interface to Google.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.170
It's the smart brain
in your Google Home

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.440
or on your Android phone.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.990
And actually, at this event we
just launched on iOS as well.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.140
And you can have really a
conversation with Google

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.780
to help you get things done.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.770
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.290
What are the different
services for developers

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.230
to integrate with?

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.720
BRAD ABRAMS: Oh,
great, so there's

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.100
a couple different ways.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.010
One, you can extend
the Assistant

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.330
by adding your own custom
apps to the Assistant.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.544
And then, you can also host the
Assistant in different devices.

00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:08.210
So if you're building
your own hardware,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.380
whatever, you can host
your Assistant there.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.020
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
that's the difference

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.435
between actions on Google
and the Assistant SDK, right?

00:01:13.435 --> 00:01:14.310
BRAD ABRAMS: Exactly.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.700
So the Assistant SDK is where
you host it with your hardware,

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.909
and actions on Google is
extending the Assistant.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:21.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.829
Well, we're at I/O. And
I know some new stuff

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:24.620
has been announced.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.550
Whey don't you tell us about
some of your favorites.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.640
BRAD ABRAMS: Oh man,
it's hard to pick.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.890
There are so many.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.530
I'm really excited about actions
on Google coming to phones--

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.160
to Android and iOS.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.430
So up until this
event, you could only

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.440
build actions on Google for
home-- for eyes only experience

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.570
or eyes free experience.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.710
And now we have actions on
Google for the phone as well.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.770
So we have suggestion chips,
lists, image carousels.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.639
And it could really give you
a deep multimodal experience.

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:54.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Would you
mean like seeing and hearing?

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.410
BRAD ABRAMS: That's right.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.520
You can see and hear.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.580
Yeah.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.060
We also launched Transactions.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.660
So you can buy things
via the Assistant.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.220
I think that'll
help users a lot.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.000
I know I want to buy a pizza,
you know, from my phone.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.150
I can just say, OK, Google.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.250
I want a pizza.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.640
And it can connect me to
somebody to go do that.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.387
And for developers
it also gives,

00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:17.970
you know, a financial
incentive, which

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.570
I hear some developers
like to get paid.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.170
So--

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Indeed they do.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.650
BRAD ABRAMS: And then
of course deep for

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.592
me is developer experience.

00:02:27.592 --> 00:02:28.800
And we've done a lot of work.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.632
We launched the platform
first in December.

00:02:30.632 --> 00:02:32.840
And we've done a lot of work
on developer experience.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.960
So we launched a new version
of the Developer Console.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.950
We call it the actions console.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.350
Developers can use that
to work better in teams

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.260
together, to get deep analytics
about their application.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.710
As well as-- it integrates
really well with the Firebase

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.611
and Google Cloud consoles.

00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:49.610
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.897
BRAD ABRAMS: And
can I do one more?

00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:51.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Absolutely.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.971
BRAD ABRAMS: See I
can just add them.

00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.380
So one more would
be discoverability.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.870
I think that's been--

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.850
in the whole kind
of chatbox space,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.810
generally having
people be able discover

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.970
them has been a problem.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.400
And so we've done a lot
of work in that regard.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.300
The first is that we have a
new directory for our apps.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.450
And it's right there on
the Assistant surface,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.590
just one tap away.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.970
And you can see a category
view of all the Assistant

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.960
apps that are there.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.660
We also gave you a way to
get a web URL into that.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.740
So if you wanted to promote your
app via your enormous Twitter

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.590
followers, you could totally
go do that, which is awesome.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.030
And of course, people who
love your Assistant app

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.250
can share it with their
friends via the deep link.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.050
And finally, we did
some work to help

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.910
discover when to invoke your
Assistant app from information

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.390
in the directory,
other information

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.870
provided by the developer.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.090
We can just respond to
queries like, play a game.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.030
And we can actually find
the right system apps

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.070
to go trigger in that case.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.715
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
totally awesome.

00:03:55.715 --> 00:03:57.173
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah,
it's really fun.

00:03:57.173 --> 00:03:59.295
It's kind of a big release
for us here at I/O.

00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:00.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
I mean that's a lot

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.550
of different stuff.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.744
BRAD ABRAMS: Yes, it
certainly is-- certainly is.

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:06.160
But I think it comes together
in a really cohesive package

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.829
though, because
you know, if you're

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.120
going to do Transactions--
you're going to buy things--

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.901
a lot of times having
a visual surface to see

00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:16.359
the different
options, see the cart

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.702
and what not really
helps with that.

00:04:18.702 --> 00:04:20.160
And then of course,
if you're going

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.959
to have a financial
interest there,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.100
being able to have people
discover your Assistant apps

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.970
really helps.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.680
OK, so let's take a step back.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.330
And I would love to
hear your thoughts

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.320
just on conversational
interfaces in general.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.620
BRAD ABRAMS: Yeah, I mean--

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.260
if you think about
this evolution that's

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.446
been happening, you know, like
when I started using computers,

00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:42.820
it was like a
mouse and keyboard.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.500
It was very indirect, right?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.450
You moved--

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.385
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Wait,
you had a mouse?

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:47.750
BRAD ABRAMS: I did have a mouse.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.100
You don't think I had a mouse?

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.970
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well,
I mean, you know,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.280
you start with like
the Commodore 128.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.150
BRAD ABRAMS: Right,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.360
OK.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.484
Before, you had a keyboard.

00:04:53.484 --> 00:04:54.770
And then, we added a mouse.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:55.830
But these are indirect.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.996
Like, you do something with
your hands and something

00:04:57.996 --> 00:04:58.990
happens on the screen.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.850
And then, you know, we got
capacitive touch, right?

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.880
So you could actually
touch the screen.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.820
And like, my kid
when he was two knew

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.470
how to touch the screen, right?

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.620
Like, that was very intuitive.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.800
And I think we're at the
verge of making the next step.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.900
And that is, rather
than just being

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.390
able to like touch the
button, what if I could just

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.760
express what I want.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.560
Why do I have to dig
through a bunch menus,

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.120
find the right button to press?

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.230
Not really sure
what's going to happen

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:25.470
when I press that button.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.570
But what if I could
just express my idea?

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.820
This is what I want to happen.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.966
I want to play this game.

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:32.090
I want to order this pizza.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.300
I want to do whatever.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.380
And that's what I think this
conversational interface is

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.260
enabling.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.710
And I do want to say that I
think one of the things that's

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.130
been holding us as
developers back from that

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.712
is the right tooling to do so.

00:05:47.712 --> 00:05:48.670
BRAD ABRAMS: You know--

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.110
you know, as I described
that, I think that developers

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.550
are going like, wow.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.300
Sure, but how do I do
that when the user--

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.800
how?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.070
If you think about the
huge number of ways people

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.070
could say they want a pizza,
order toppings on a pizza,

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.560
how can they turn the huge
vagaries of human language

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.400
into something a
developer can understand?

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.340
And that's where
tools like API.AI

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.080
can really come into play.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.230
API.AI is our own
conversation building tool.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.760
And what it does is let's you
as developers define intents,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.710
just by giving us
some example phrases

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.560
of what a user would say.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.330
And then, we can do--

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.260
pull out the entities from that,
and do the natural language

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.125
understanding, so that
we can do slot filling

00:06:34.125 --> 00:06:36.430
and actually figure out
what users are saying.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.970
So you might give an example
like, I want a large pepperoni

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.800
pizza with tomato
sauce as your example.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.920
We know large is the entity.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.510
Pepperoni is an entity.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.070
And tomato sauce is an entity.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.140
We can actually pull those
out and then recognize

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.750
other queries like, I want
a small pizza with tomatoes

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.160
and green olives with no sauce.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.560
And that-- because
we can do that,

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.620
it makes it much more
tractable for developers

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.204
to actually understand
human language.

00:07:07.204 --> 00:07:09.453
TIMOTHY JORDAN: But seriously,
how many times have you

00:07:09.453 --> 00:07:11.351
ordered a pizza with no sauce?

00:07:11.351 --> 00:07:13.350
BRAD ABRAMS: Well, you
know, that's pretty rare.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.220
But you know, I actually
I'm for extra sauce,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.380
you know, just because it
dribbles down your face.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.800
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh,
OK, that's good.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.276
BRAD ABRAMS: And
that's beautiful.

00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:21.230
I'm sorry, we got
to cut that out.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
right, is there anything

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.201
else you would say about
Assistant or any the developer

00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:25.660
tools before we go?

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:27.100
BRAD ABRAMS: No, I think
we pretty much covered it.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.310
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
Brad, thanks so much.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.300
BRAD ABRAMS: All
right, thank you.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.950
