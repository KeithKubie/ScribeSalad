00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.703
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.833
&gt;&gt; In 2001, I witnessed
a distinguished panel

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.820
of judges discuss the
mastery of an excerpt

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.086
from Jonathan Franzen's
novel, The Corrections,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.866
and recommend its author for an NEA
Fellowship not knowing or taking

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.706
into consideration
who the author was.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.510
Five years later, I had the
pleasure of working with Jonathan

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.706
when he served as a judge
for the NEA Fellowships.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.246
So I can tell you a
little bit about him.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.243
His descriptions of Washington,
D.C. notwithstanding, he is smart,

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.763
observant, and obviously
dedicated to his craft.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.026
I might also say he is nice but
having finished his latest novel,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.326
Freedom, I am too afraid to
ever use that word again.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.190
So I'm thinking at this point that
you folks already know all that.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.593
I'm thinking here is a
man who doesn't need much

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.940
of an introduction these days.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.356
You probably saw him on the cover
of Time Magazine, the first author

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.936
to appear there in a decade.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.250
I'm guessing you also read at
least one of the rhapsodic reviews

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.136
of Freedom which, by now,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.870
could probably fill more
pages than the book itself.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.600
Maybe you read that President
Obama read Freedom on his vacation

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.333
or that Oprah let bygones
be bygones and chose Freedom

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.956
as her first book group
pick in over a year.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.590
Maybe you are a fan of
Jonathan from years ago

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.923
when The Corrections won
the National Book Award

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.333
and was shortlisted
for the Pulitzer Prize

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:37.290
and the National Book Critics Circle
award and the PEN/Faulkner Award.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.470
Maybe you continued to read his
work, his collections of essays.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.576
His collection of essays,
How to be Alone

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.310
or his memoirs, The Discomfort Zone.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.470
Maybe you've read his pieces
in The New Yorker or Harper's

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.756
and have opinions on his take on
the contemporary literary landscape

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.063
or other's take on his take of the
literary landscape or other's take

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.326
on how the landscape favors men
or postmodernism or I don't know,

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.360
roaming house cats, not
a shy group we novelists.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.623
Maybe you saw Jonathan on The
Simpsons and you're hoping like I am

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.983
that his career trajectory with
all its excesses of fame leads him

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.146
to a special Christmas album
or doing the cha-cha-cha

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.193
and dances with the stars.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.460
[ Laughter ]

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.526
&gt;&gt; We can dream.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.310
Or maybe you don't know Jonathan
and you're just now learning

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.276
about Freedom, this new tour
de force that he's written.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.940
Well then, let me warn you.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.473
In the words of one character,
Freedom is a pain in the ass.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.623
The book unleashes a bizarre
pathological sequence of events

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.456
that befalls Americans like you
and me and will make you unhappy.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.350
But as the narrator tells us,
there is a kind of happiness

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.033
in unhappiness if it's
the right unhappiness.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.930


00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.120
We owe a great deal of
thanks to Jonathan Franzen

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.513
for giving literature
back its shining moment

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.213
for writing a big ambitious literary
novel that has grabbed headlines

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.190
and makes us think
and feel and opine

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.643
and reflect all while we're
pondering what it means

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.703
to have the freedom to do so.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.166
We owe him thanks for giving us
the right kind of unhappiness.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.363
Please join me in welcoming
Jonathan Franzen.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.510
[ Applause ]

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.010
[ Pause ]

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.966
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I almost took the bottle
with Jane Smiley's name on it.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120
[ Laughter ]

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:02.766
&gt;&gt; They actually have
the water bottles labeled

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.360
with the writer's names.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.370
So it's nice to be here.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.303
I'm told I'm not allowed to
read to you from the book.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.963
I'm speaking at a normal
tone of voice.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.250
I can't really do it much louder,

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.850
perhaps if that throbbing
generator sort of noise would stop.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.173
Anyway, I was asked to say
something about my process.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.420
And just by good fortune, I have a
manuscript in my briefcase suitable

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.480
for perhaps 15 minutes of discussion
of that, at which point I'll turn it

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.680
over to questions and answers.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.006
Thank you all for coming out here.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.826
It's not as hot as it could be.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.510
[ Laughter ]

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.380
[ Pause ]

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.000
&gt;&gt; I gave the whole text
of the speech at Seattle

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.766
but it lasted about 40 minutes.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.456
So if I suddenly start speaking
of you all here in Seattle,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.483
it's because I haven't had
time to revise the manuscript.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:13.690


00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.183
Okay, it seems to me something of
a miracle that people still come

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.986
out to hear a writer speak
instead of staying home

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.790
with their televisions
and computers.

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.126
I'd spent a lot of time in the
last few years sitting alone

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.270
in a darkened room, and so
it's great to come here and see

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.610
so many people who care about books.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.196
I'm gonna begin this talk by
addressing four unwelcomed questions

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.296
that novelists are often asked
in a course of an evening

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.563
like this, morning, sorry.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:44.830
[ Laughter ]

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.296
&gt;&gt; I thought I have reached the
last evening but there was one more.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.460


00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.400
These questions are apparently
the price we have to pay

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.570
for the pleasure of
appearing in public.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.993
They are vexing and maddening
not just because we're asked them

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.863
so often but also because with
one exception they are difficult

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.616
to answer and therefore
very much worth asking.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.926
The first of these
perennial questions is

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.170
who are your influences?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.200
Sometimes the person asking this
question merely wants some book

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.416
recommendations but all too
often, the question seems

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:21.836
to be intended seriously.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.790
And part of what's annoying
about the question is

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.056
that it's always asked

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:27.186
in the present tense,
who are my influences.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.526
At this point in my life, I'm mostly
influenced by my own past writing.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.580
If I were still walking in the
shadow of say E.M. Forster,

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.976
I would certainly be at
pains to pretend I wasn't.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.723
According to Mr. Harold Bloom
whose very clever theory

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.030
of literary influence
helped him make a career

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.350
of being a cannon maker, I wouldn't
even be conscious to the degree

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.216
to which I was still laboring
an E.M. Forster shadow.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.743
Only Harold Bloom would be
fully conscious of that.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.220


00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.863
Direct influence makes sense
only with very young writers

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.730
who in the course of
figuring out how

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.843
to write first try copying the
styles and attitudes and methods

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.683
of their favorite authors.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.190
I personally was very influenced
at the age of 21 by C.S. Lewis,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.110
Isaac Asimov, Louise Fitzhugh,
Harriet the Spy, Herbert Marcuse,

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.830
P.G. Wodehouse, the Dialectic of
Enlightenment by Max Horkheimer

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.983
and Theodor Adorno, and my
then fiancee to name a few.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.376
For a while in my early
20s, I put a lot of effort

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:33.986
into copying the sentence rhythms
and comic dialogue of Don DeLillo.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.523
I was also very taken
with the strenuously vivid

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.380
and all-knowing prose of Robert
Coover and Thomas Pynchon.

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.340
And the plots of my first two
novels were substantially borrowed

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:47.766
from two movies, The American Friend
by Wim Wenders and Cutter's Way

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.193
by Ivan Passer, basically stole two
plots whole cloth from those movies.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:07:59.706
But to me, these various influences
seem not much more meaningful

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.760
than the fact that when I was 15
my favorite music group was the

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.440
Moody Blues.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.220
A writer has to start
somewhere but where exactly he

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.126
or she starts is almost random.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.310
It would be somewhat
more meaningful to say

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.910
that I was influenced
by Franz Kafka.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:17.836
By this I mean, it
was Kafka as taught

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.436
by the best literature professor
I ever had who opened my eyes

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.966
to the greatness of what literature
can do and who maybe want to try

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.700
to create some literature myself.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:30.136
Kafka is wonderfully ambiguous
rendering of the protagonist

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.256
of The Trial Josef K.
who is once a sympathetic

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.940
and unjustly persecuted every
man and a self-pitying criminal

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.740
who is willfully blind
to his own guilt,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:43.650
was my portal to the possibilities
of fiction as a vehicle

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.683
of self-investigation as a method
of engagement with the difficulties

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.643
and paradoxes of my own life.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:53.900
Kafka teaches us how
to love ourselves even

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.383
as we're being mercilessly hard
on ourselves, how to remain humane

00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.896
in the face of the most
awful truths about ourselves.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.016
It's not enough to love your
characters and it's not enough

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:09.420
to be hard on your characters.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:09.763
You always have to be trying
to do both at the same time.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:13.656
A literature in which the
good are good and are rewarded

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.630
for their goodness is a
literature of fantasy.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:19.240
It's the province of
the genre novel.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:21.770
A literature that treats
characters as objects within systems

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.406
of language and other formalisms
is a literature of diversion.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.053
It's the province of the art novel.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:32.566
The books that dwell between these
two extremes and recognize people

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.220
as they really are, the books whose
characters are once sympathetic

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:42.073
subject and dubious objects are
the ones capable of reaching

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:42.356
across cultures and generations

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:44.296
of forming collectively what
I would call literature.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:51.883
The bigger problem with the
question about influences, however,

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:54.483
is that it seems to presuppose that
young writers are lumps of soft clay

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.350
on which certain great writers

00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:58.606
that are living have
indelibly left their mark.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:01.450
&gt;&gt; And what maddens
the writer trying

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:03.536
to answer the question honestly is

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.016
that almost everything a writer has
ever read leaves some kind of mark.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.986
To list every writer I've learned
something from would take me hours

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.710
and it would still not answer the
question of why some books matter

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:14.690
to me so much more than other books.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.650
Why even now, when I'm working I
often think about war and peace

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.250
and The Great Gatsby and never think
about Ulysses and To the Lighthouse.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:24.760
How did it happen that I did
not learn anything from Joyce

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:26.910
or Woolf even though they
are both very strong writers?

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:34.450
I think the common understanding of
influences whether Harald Bloomian

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:38.696
or more conventional is far
too linear and one dimensional.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.203
Art history with its progressive
narrative of influences handed

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:43.293
down from generation to generation
is a useful pedagogical tool

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:46.776
for organizing information,
but it has very little to do

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:49.956
with the actual experience
of being a fiction writer.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.013
When I write, I don't feel
like a craftsman influenced

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:55.993
by earlier craftsmen who
were themselves influenced

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.020
by earlier craftsmen.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:03.326
I feel like a member of a
single large virtual community

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.436
in which I have dynamic
relationships with other members

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:09.350
of the community, most of
whom are no longer living.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.410
As in any other community, I have
my friends and I have my enemies.

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.276
I find my way to those corners of
the community where I feel most

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.703
at home, most securely but also
provocatively among my friends.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.396
Once I've read enough books to have
identified who they are and this is

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.356
where the young writer's process
of active selection comes in,

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.250
the process of choosing
whom to be influenced by.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.346
I worked to advance
our common interests.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.890
By means of what I write and how
I write, I fight for my friends

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.656
and I fight against my enemies.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:39.530
I want more readers to
appreciate the literally values,

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:44.223
the glory of 19th century
Russian fiction.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:45.256
I couldn't care less whether
readers love James Joyce

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:48.226
and my work represents
an active campaign

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.113
against the values I dislike:
sentimentally, weak narrative,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.066
overwrite prose, solipsism,
self-indulgence, misogyny

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.256
and other parochialisms, sterile
game playing, overt didacticism,

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.966
moral simplicity, unnecessary
difficulty,

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:09.996
informational fetishes, and so on.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.620


00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.126
Indeed much of what might be called
actual influence is negative.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.600
I don't wanna be like this
writer or that writer.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.130
The situation is never
static of course.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:25.933
Reading and writing fiction is a
form of active social engagement,

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.100
of conversation, and competition.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:30.390
It's a way of being and becoming.

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:33.296
Somehow at the right moment when
I'm feeling particularly lost

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.153
and forlorn there's always
a new friend to be made,

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:38.880
an old friend to distance myself
from, an old enemy to be forgiven,

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.853
a new enemy to be identified.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.313
Indeed and I'll say more about
this later or perhaps not.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.806
It's impossible for me-- it's im--

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.700
I don't know what I'm
about to refer to.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.206
It's coming later in the sentence.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.916
Indeed it's impossible for
me to write a new novel

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.990
without first finding
new friends and enemies.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.266
With strong motion, my new
friends were Dostoevsky

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.106
and Flannery O'Connor.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.573
My new enemies were the
academic postmoderns.

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.156
To start writing The Corrections, I
befriended Kenzaburo Oe, Paula Fox,

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.790
Halldor Laxness, and Jane Smiley
who I just shook hands with.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.440
With my new novel,
I found new allies

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.140
in Stendhal, Tolstoy
and Alice Munro.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.453
For a while, Philip Roth was
my new bitter enemy but lately,

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.253
unexpectedly he's become
a friend as well.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.003
I still campaign against
American pastoral

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:37.456
but the fearless dionysiac
ferocity of Sabbath's Theater

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:40.953
when I finally read it this
last year became an inspiration.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.500
It's been a long time since I felt
as grateful to a writer as I did

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:48.690
when reading the scene
in Sabbath's Theater

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:51.153
when Mickey Sabbath's
best friend catches him

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.766
in the bathtub holding a picture
of the friend's adolescent daughter

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:55.886
in a pair of her underpants,
where the scene

00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.140
in which Sabbath finds a
paper coffee cup in the pocket

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:00.936
of his army jacket and
decides to abase himself

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.303
by begging for money in the subway.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:06.113
Roth may not wanna have me or any
other living writer as a friend,

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:10.370
but I was happy at these moments
to claim him as one of mine.

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:14.570
I'm happy to hold up the savage
hilarity of Sabbath's Theater

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.026
as a correction and reproach
of the sentimentality

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:20.886
of certain young American writers
and critics who seem to believe

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:26.913
in defiance of Kafka that
literature is about being nice.

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.880


00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.370
The second perennial question
is what time of day do you work

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.216
and what do you write on.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:39.090
This must seem to the people
who ask it like the safest

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.043
and politest of questions.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.193
I suspect it's the question people
ask a writer when they can't think

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:45.283
of anything else to
ask and yet, to me,

00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:51.436
it's the most disturbingly
personal and invasive of questions.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.326
It forces me to picture
myself sitting

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:54.480
down at my computer every
morning at 8 o'clock

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.543
to see objectively the person who
as he sits down in this computer

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:03.336
in the morning wants only to be
a pure invisible subjectivity.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.430
When I'm working, I
don't want anybody else

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.563
in the room including myself.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.630


00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:10.423
Question number three is, I read an
interview with an author who says

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:15.906
that at a certain point in writing
a novel, the characters take over

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.926
and tell them what to do.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.126
Does this happen to you too?

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.260
This question always
raises my blood pressure.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.036
Nobody ever answered it
better than Nabokov did

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:29.303
in his Paris Review interview
where he fingered E.M. Forster

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:32.380
as the source of the myth about a
novelist's characters taking over

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.480
and claimed that unlike Forster
who let his characters sail away

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.013
on their passage to India.

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.813
He himself worked his
characters "like galley slaves."

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.980


00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:48.930
When a writer makes a
claim like Forster's,

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.643
the best case scenario
is that he's mistaken.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.853
More often unfortunately, I get
the sense of a writer who seems

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:00.120
to be trying to aggrandize himself,
trying to distance his own work

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.540
from the mechanistic
plotting of genre novels.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.776
The writer wants us to believe that
unlike those hacks who can tell you

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.376
in advance how their
books are gonna end.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.923
His imagination is so powerful and
his character is so real and vivid

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.230
that he has no control over them.

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.700
The best case here again
is that it isn't true

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.240
because the notion presupposes
a loss of authorial will

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.956
and abdication of intent.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.170
The novelist's primary
responsibility is to create meaning

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.776
and if you could somehow leave
this job to your characters,

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:34.736
you would necessarily be
avoiding it yourself and,

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.463
of course, it can never be avoided.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.986
But let's assume for charity's
sake that the writer who claims

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.640
to be the servant of his
characters isn't simply trying

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.066
to flatter himself.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.666
What might he actually mean?

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.576
He probably means that once
a character has been fleshed

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.923
out enough to begin to
form a coherent whole,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.296
a kind of inevitability
is set in motion.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:56.400
He means specifically that the
story he originally imagine

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:58.820
for a character often turns out
not to follow from the liniments

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.713
of the character he's
been able to create.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:06.503
I may abstractly imagine a character
who might intend to make a murderer

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.976
of his girlfriend and his
children, but then discover

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.170
in the actual writing that the
character I'm actually able

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:13.623
to make work on the page
has reserves of compassion

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:21.370
or self-awareness that renders such
an outcome unlikely or impossible.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:24.340
The key phrase here
is work on the page.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:25.436
Everything under the sun is
imaginable and proposable

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:28.043
in the abstract, but the writer
is always limited by what he

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:31.296
or she is actually able to
make work, to make plausible,

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.686
to make sympathetic, to make
entertaining, to make compelling,

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:38.453
and above all, to make
distinctive and original.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.493
As Flannery O'Connor famously said,

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:44.506
"A fiction writer does
whatever she can get away with

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.100
and nobody ever got away with much."

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.523
Once you actually start writing
the book as opposed to planning

00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:54.213
that the universe of conceivable
human types and behaviors quickly

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.400
and dramatically shrinks to the
microcosm of human possibilities

00:17:59.640 --> 00:17:59.840
that you contain within yourself.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.840
A character dies on the page if
you can't hear his or her voice.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.953
In a very limited sense, I
suppose, this amounts to taking over

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:09.936
and telling you what the
character will and won't do,

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:13.223
but the reason the character can't
do something is that you can't.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.076
The task then becomes to figure out
what the character can do to try

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:20.120
to stretch the narrative as
far as possible to be sure not

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.133
to overlook exciting potentialities

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.390
that you wouldn't necessarily have
guessed you had inside you while

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:29.763
continuing to bend the narrative in
the direction of the potentiality

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.283
that best accords with
the meaning you're after.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.486
I'll be rewriting that
sentence which brings me

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.546
to perennial question number four.

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:49.230
Is your fiction autobiographical?

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.836
I'm suspicious of any novelist
who would honestly answer no

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.110
to this question and yet, my
strong temptation when I'm asked

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.276
that myself is to answer no.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.773
Of the four perennial
questions, this is the one

00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:07.373
that always feels the most hostile.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:08.266
Maybe I'm just projecting
that hostility,

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.886
but I feel as if my powers of
imagination are being challenged

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.450
as in this is a true work of fiction

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:17.590
or just a thinly disguised
account of your own life.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:20.816
And since there are only so many
things that can happen to you

00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:22.986
in your life, you're
surely gonna use up all

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:24.586
of your autobiographical
materials soon if indeed,

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:27.106
you haven't used it up already.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.373
And so you probably won't be writing
anymore good books, will you?

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.423
In fact, if your books are just
thinly disguised autobiography,

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:37.700
maybe they weren't as interesting
as we thought they were.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.053
Because after all,
what makes your life

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:42.453
so much more interesting
than anybody else's.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.033
It's not as interesting as
Barack Obama's life, is it?

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.543
And also, for that matter, if
your work is autobiographical,

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.886
why didn't you do the honest thing
and write a nonfiction encounter.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.120
Why dress it up in lies?

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.353
What kind of bad person are
you telling us lies to try

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:02.246
to make your life seem more
interesting and dramatic?

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.310


00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.213
&gt;&gt; I hear all of these other
questions in the question

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:10.976
and it has the effect of making the
very word autobiographical feels

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:14.650
shameful to me.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:17.343
My own strict understanding of
an autobiographical novel is one

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.216
in which the main character
closely resembles the author

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.513
and experiences many
of the same scenes

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.666
that the author experienced
in real life.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.576
My impression is that
Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms,

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:31.010
Charlotte Bronte's Villette,
Saul Bellow's Augie March,

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.163
Christina Stead's The
Man Who Loved Children,

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:36.320
and Remarque's All Quiet
on the Western Front.

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:39.320
All of the masterpieces are
substantially autobiographical

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.040
in this regard but most
novels, interestingly, are not.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.906
My own novels are not.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.823
In 30 years, I don't think I've
published more than 20 or 30 pages

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.990
of scenes drawn directly from real
life scenes that I participated in.

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.630
I'd actually tried to write a
lot of more pages than that,

00:20:59.290 --> 00:20:59.463
but these scenes rarely
seem to work in a novel.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:02.546
They embarrass me or they
don't seem interesting enough,

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.886
or most frequently, they
don't seem quite relevant

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.063
to the story I'm trying to tell.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.966
Late in The Corrections, there's
a scene in which Denise Lambert,

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.590
who resembles me to the extent of
being the youngest child in a family

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.876
of five, tries to teach
her demented father how

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.246
to do some simple stretching
exercises and then has to deal

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.406
with his having wet the bed.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.543
That actually happened
to me and I took a number

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:31.910
of the details straight
from my life,

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.106
some of what Chip Lambert
experiences when he's

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:34.950
with his father in the
hospital also happened to me.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:37.106
And I did write an entire short
memoir, The Discomfort Zone

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:40.980
which consists almost
entirely of scenes

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:42.520
that I experienced first
hand, but that was nonfiction.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.033
And so I ought to be able to answer
the perennial autobiography question

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.913
with the resounding unashamed
no or at least to answer

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:53.590
as my friend Elizabeth
Robinson does.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:57.850
"Yes, 17 percent, next question."

00:21:58.790 --> 00:21:59.790


00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.850
The problem is that
in another sense,

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.786
my fiction is extremely
autobiographical and moreover

00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:11.676
that I consider my job as a
writer to make it ever more so.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.816
My conception of a novel is that
it ought to be a personal struggle,

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.343
a direct and total engagement

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:20.476
with the author's story
of his or her own life.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:21.223
This conception again
I take from Kafka

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:22.790
who although he was never
transformed into an insect

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.723
and although he never
had a piece of food,

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.390
an apple from his family's
table lodged in his flesh

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:31.646
and rotting there, devoted
his whole life as a writer

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640
to describing his personal struggle
with his family, with women,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.170
with moral law, with his
unconscious, with his sense

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.310
of guilt, and with the modern world.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:44.483
Kafka's work which grows out
of the nighttime dream world

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.296
in Kafka's brain is
more autobiographical

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:50.473
than any realistic retelling at his
daytime experiences at the office

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:53.813
or with his family, or with
a prostitute could have been.

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.853
What is fiction after all if not
a kind of purposeful dreaming?

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.930
The writer works to create a dream
that is vivid and has meaning

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.436
so that the reader can then vividly
dream it and experience meaning.

00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.773
And work like Kafka's
which proceeds directly

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:11.896
from dream is therefore
an exceptionally pure form

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.343
of autobiography.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.266
There's a very important paradox
here that I'd like to stress.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.436
The greater the autobiographical
content of a fiction writer's work,

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.373
the smaller its superficial
resemblance

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.166
to the writer's actual life.

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.923
The deeper the writer
digs for meaning,

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:30.836
the more the random particulars

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.903
of the writer's life become
impediments to deliberate dreaming.

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:37.570
And this is why writing good
fiction is almost never easy.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.993
The point at which fiction seems
to become easy for a writer

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.166
and I'll let everyone
supply their own examples

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.006
of this is usually the point

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.673
at which it's no longer
necessary to read that writer.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.830
There's a truism at least
in the United States

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:53.430
that every person has
one novel in them.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.630
In other words, one
autobiographical novel.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.350
For people who write more than one,
the truism can probably be amended

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.916
to say every person has one
easy to write novel in them,

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.780
one ready made meaningful narrative.

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:10.233
I'm obviously not talking here
about writers of entertainments,

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.000
not P.G. Wodehouse or John
le Carre, or Elmore Leonard,

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:14.203
the pleasure whose
books is not diminished

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:16.223
by their similarity to one another.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:23.196
We read them indeed for the reliable
comforts of their familiar worlds.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.806
I'm talking about more literary
work and it's a prejudice of mine

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:26.513
that literature cannot
be a mere performance.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:29.646
That unless the writer is personally
at risk, unless the book has been,

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.106
in some way, for the writer,
an adventure into the unknown,

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.280
unless the writer has set himself

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:38.213
or herself a personal
problem not easily solved,

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:41.633
unless the finished book
represents the surmounting

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:45.526
of some great resistance.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.706
It's not worth reading
or for the writer,

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:50.853
in my opinion, worth writing.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:53.336
This seems to me all the more
true in an age when there are

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:58.010
so many other fun and inexpensive
things a reader can do besides

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.646
picking up a novel.

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.513
As a writer nowadays, you
owe it to your readers

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.246
to set yourself the
most difficult challenge

00:25:04.380 --> 00:25:04.743
that you have some
hope of being equal to.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:07.710
With every book, you have
to dig as deep as possible

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.123
and reach as far as possible.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:12.486
And if you do this and you succeed
in producing a reasonably good book,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.770
it means that the next time you try
to write a book, you're gonna have

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.750
to dig even deeper and reach
even farther, or else, again,

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.913
it won't be worth writing.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.313
And what this means in
practice is that you have

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:25.710
to become a different person
to write the next book.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.430
The person you already are already
wrote the best book he could.

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:32.353
There's no way to move forward
without changing yourself.

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:35.653
Without, in other words, working
on the story of your own life,

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.053
which is to say your autobiography.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.920
Thanks, I'll stop there.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.320
[ Applause ]

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:46.640
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000


00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:49.820
[ Applause ]

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.440
&gt;&gt; So, I don't know
how the Q&amp;A works

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.773
but I'm happy to take questions.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.810
Are there microphones
or are they just shouted

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.626
out over the droning
of the generator?

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.260
[ Inaudible Discussion ]

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.986
&gt;&gt;Oh, there are microphones.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.120
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:24.920
&gt;&gt; And the gentleman
has stepped up to one.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:30.786
&gt;&gt; I read a review of Freedom in the
Atlantic by B.R. Myers, I believe.

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.586
And there was-- it was not a
friendly review but there was a line

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:43.026
in it that said basically, if you're
reading Freedom, you're missing

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.383
out on some sort of great
literature that you're missing.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:53.710
And so I wanted to see your opinion
on like what is the requirement

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.646
of reading established great
literature before you can read

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.026
something that is of literary
value today, that make sense?

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:07.970
I hope that makes sense.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:08.940
&gt;&gt; Well, my publishers
would sincerely hope

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.326
that you did not read-- need

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:13.676
to read all the classics
before buying a new book.

00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:17.510
[ Laughter ]

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.290
[ Applause ]

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.203
&gt;&gt; So there is-- that's
an interesting question.

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:32.890
I think that one of the
things I learned in college,

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.806
I didn't learn much about literature
until I took a German class.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.646
One of the things that I did
valuably learn was that sometimes

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.786
when Emily Dickinson says A, she
means the opposite of A. So that is

00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:58.180
to say those poems
are not actually--

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.346
you can't just read
through it and say, "A."

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.883
You actually have to read
very carefully and figure

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:05.796
out where she is actually
saying what she means

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.040
and where she is saying the
opposite of what she means,

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:12.820
which is to say you learn
things like irony and ambiguity.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:18.110
And those are very frightening
things for a reader, a young reader,

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.280
because especially when you're young
you want to know what the text means

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.453
and you want it and
you resent the text

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:27.273
if it doesn't tell you
exactly what it means.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.966
And you also, at a young age,
want moral life to be simple.

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:37.793
You want it to-- you want the good
to be good and you want the bad

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.933
to be bad, and you want to be able
to sit in a good position and say,

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:43.726
"that's bad" and feel if
you're reading a book,

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.433
that the author is on your side.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.963
And interestingly, interestingly,
it's almost the definition

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:58.453
of classic literature that it
refuses to allow the reader

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.493
to occupy that comfortable
moral position.

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:05.586
And it takes you into these
realms where the responsibility

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.846
for figuring out what's being--

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:16.203
what for taking meaning from text
is significantly the readers.

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:19.613
And these are very valuable skills.

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:20.220
They're skills that
the lead reviewer

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:26.153
for the New York Times has not yet
acquired in 30 years of being--

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:27.590
[ Laughter ]

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:31.123
&gt;&gt; But, and so I think
it's a disaster.

00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:38.896
It would be a disaster if
people stopped learning how

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:43.156
to read really good books
from the past when they get

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.810
to high school and college.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:51.650
Because it's almost an introduction
to a way of being a grownup rather

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:54.390
than having a kind of adolescent
black and white view of the world.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.316
&gt;&gt; And you can't just get so much.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.660
You get connected to the mind of
somebody who is writing 200 or 300

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.576
or 400 years ago and
it's actually very hard

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:11.226
to do that in any other way.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:15.443
So three cheers for reading
old books but you know,

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:16.936
I don't think you have to read
the entire Harvard Classics series

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:22.650
in order to read a
contemporary book.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:23.356
Yes, they're all-- everyone is
lining up with this microphone.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:29.330
This is the preferred hot mic.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:30.830
[ Laughter ]

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.950
&gt;&gt; The most common criticism
that I've read in the reviews

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.310
of Freedom is the comment--

00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:38.343
&gt;&gt; I thought the reviews were good.

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.010
[ Laughter ]

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:43.010
[ Applause ]

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:44.860
&gt;&gt; But no, I'm not reading
them so this is interesting.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.426
&gt;&gt; They were overwhelmingly
good and being in the middle

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.693
of the book rightfully so.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.643
But this point I found repeated and
I think it has some merit and I'd

00:30:57.810 --> 00:30:59.543
like you to comment on it.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:00.026
And that is that Patty's [phonetic]
voice is not a unique one,

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.993
that it seems quite coincidentally
to be very similar to the voice

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:11.126
of the author and that
she is not obviously,

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:14.430
you know, Jonathan Franzen.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:14.830
She is entirely different person.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:21.163
And this comment was repeated most
recently in Ruth Franklin's review

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.936
in The New Republic, and
if you wanna say anything

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:26.963
if you have read that review.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:28.496
&gt;&gt; I don't read these.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:30.210
&gt;&gt; Okay. But then about that
comment there, I'd appreciate

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.116
if you'd make some
comment about that.

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:36.570
Thank you.

00:31:38.090 --> 00:31:39.090
[ Laughter ]

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:43.356
&gt;&gt; I was not unaware that
Patty wrote awfully well

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:48.380
for an ex-basketball playing B
student at a large state university.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:51.630
[ Laughter ]

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.096
&gt;&gt; With no formal training
in writing.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:56.940
[ Laughter ]

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:58.586
&gt;&gt; There is-- there is a certain--

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:02.920
there is a convention
with first person.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:05.093
That's essentially a first
person narrative in third person.

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.236
That is it's being presented
as the document of an actual--

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:13.030
produced by an actual--
by the character herself.

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.193
And you know, there is--
what are the chances

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:18.543
that a pedophile named Humbert
Humbert would happen to write

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.056
as well as Vladimir Nabokov.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.190
[ Laughter ]

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:30.523
&gt;&gt; It's really kind of like, wow,
there are two Russian immigrates

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:34.776
who happened to have like the
best relationship to the page

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.876
of practically anyone
who's ever written.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.623
And you know, you could say the
same thing about Nick Carraway.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.163
He writes awfully well.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:52.013
So to that extent, I mean I think
the measure is whether you enjoy

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:56.730
reading the thing and if
that's what is being seized

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.286
on as a common complaint,

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:04.760
I'm actually very gratified
'cause I'm not too upset

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.680
about it wherever you went.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:11.423
I would be happy-- I mean,
you know, it's nice to give

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.770
for critics something to
complain about in a way.

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:16.570
[ Laughter ]

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:19.236
&gt;&gt; Yes. Do we have to go?

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:21.103
I thought it was 11:25.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:22.270
11:05? The whole thing
was half an hour?

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:24.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:26.100
&gt;&gt; That's not what my schedule says.

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.120
[ Laughter ]

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:30.930
&gt;&gt; My schedule is completely
misleading.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.263
I thought we had until 11:25.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.630
Really, truly, somebody
else wants the stage now?

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:37.430
[ Laughter ]

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:40.296
&gt;&gt; So sorry, I've gotta run.
