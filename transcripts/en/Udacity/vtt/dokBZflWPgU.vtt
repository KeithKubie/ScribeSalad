I also want to mention one pet peeve, the

00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:09.110
door slam. It's great if you've sunk development money

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.610
into developing a native mobile app, and it's fine

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.560
if you want to make sure your users know it's

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.780
available, but you shouldn't block access to your web

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.070
application with a full page ad for your native

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.670
mobile app. Make this offer unobtrusive, and make my

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.640
decision to ignore it sticky. Now, you can use smart

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.270
app banners, in iOS, to make this offer a little less intrusive, but if

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.580
I open a URL in a browser, I probably want to stay in the browser.
