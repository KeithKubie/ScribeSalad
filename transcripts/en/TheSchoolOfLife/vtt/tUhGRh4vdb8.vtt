00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.160
We know very little for certain about the life of the Chinese philosopher,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.980
Confucius

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.900
He is said to have been born in 551 BC in China. He may have been a student of the Daoist master, Lao Tzu

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.420
According to tradition,

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.980
he began Government service, and served many roles, including: Minister of Crime,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.960
under Duke Ding in the state of Lu.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.100
However,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.540
Confucius and the duke fell out, after the duke received a present from a neighboring ruler:

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.780
80 beautiful women, and 124 horses.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.920
The duke spent all of his time riding the horses, and being entertained by the woman.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.040
Which Confucius found deeply improper for a ruler.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.840
So he left the court, and wandered for years.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.900
Around between the 3rd, and 5th century B.C,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.900
Confucius' works were collected into

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.420
the "Analects 论语 (Lunyu)", a collection of sayings, written down by his followers.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.620
Some of the morals Confucius taught, are easily recognizable.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.800
Most notably, his version of the Golden Rule:

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.620
"Do not do unto others what you don't want done to yourself"

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.720
But, some of them also sound very strange, or old-fashioned to modern ears.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.600
especially to western ones

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.360
But we need his advice all the more for this.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.340
It serves as an antidote to the troubles we currently face.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.180
Here are a few examples, of what Confucius helps us to remember:

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.980
One: Ceremony is important.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.060
The Analects are filled with strange conversations between Confucius and his disciples,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.640
like this one:

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.200
Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.160
Confucius  said, "Ts'ze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony."

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.180
At first, this is baffling,

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.320
If not also humorous.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.920
Why not save the sheep?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.740
But, Confucius is reminding Tsze, and us, about the importance of ceremony.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.320
In the modern world, we tend to shun ceremony,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.240
and see this as a good thing, a sign of intimacy, or lack of pretension.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.600
But, Confucius believed in the value of ceremonies over sheep,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.680
because he valued what he called "Ritual Propriety 禮 (Li)"

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.300
This might seem a very outdated and conservative idea

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.820
but, in fact, many of us long for particular rituals.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.160
That meal mum cooked for us whenever we were sick,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.000
or the yearly birthday outing.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.600
Or our wedding vows.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.760
We understand that certain premeditated, deliberate, and precise gestures

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760
stir our emotions deeply.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.380
Rituals make our intentions clear

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.380
and they help us to understand how to behave.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.240
2 : We should treat our parents with reverence.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.080
In particular, Confucius had a very strict idea about how we should behave towards our parents

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.200
He believed that we should obey them when we are young,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.660
care for them when they are old,

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.100
mourn at length when they die

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.500
and make huge sacrifices in their memory thereafter.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.940
He even said that we shouldn't travel far away while our parents are alive,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.380
and should cover for them if they steal a sheep

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.160
This attitude is known as "Filial Piety"

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.500
This sounds strange now when many of us leave our parents' home as teenagers

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.880
and rarely return to visit.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.420
We may even see them as strangers arbitrarily thrust upon us by fate.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.420
After all our parents are so out of touch,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.420
so pitifully human in their shortcomings,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.420
so difficult, so judgmental, and they have such bad taste in music.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.620
Yet Confucius recognised that in many ways moral life begins in the family.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.860
We cannot truly be caring, wise, grateful and conscientious

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.620
unless we remember mum's birthday and meet dad for lunch.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.500
3 : we should be obedient to honorable people

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.060
Modern societies are very egalitarian - we believe that we are all born equal

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.700
and should ultimately be able to say and do whatever we like.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.340
We reject many rigid hierarchical roles

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.520
Yet Confucius told his followers: "Let the ruler be a ruler,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.000
the subject a subject, a father a father and a son a son".

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.300
This might sound jarring but it is in fact important to realise

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.720
that there are people worthy of our deep veneration

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.940
even our simple and humble obedience.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.360
We need to be modest enough to recognise the people

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.100
whose experience or accomplishments outweigh our own

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.020
We should also practise peaceably doing

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.960
what these people need, ask or command

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.400
Confucius explained: "the relation between superiors and inferiors

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.200
is like that between the wind and the grass:

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.440
the grass must bend when the wind blows across it."

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.940
Bending gracefully is, in fact, not a sign of weakness

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.080
but a gesture of humility, and respect

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.240
4. Cultivated knowledge can be more important than creativity.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.300
Modern culture places a lot of emphasis on creativity

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.420
unique insights that come to us suddenly

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.900
but Confucius was adamant about the importance of the universal wisdom

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.400
 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.340
that comes from years of hard work and reflection

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.940
He listed: benevolence, ritual propriety, righteousness, wisdom, integrity

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.500
as the five constant virtues

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.280
While Confucius believed that people were inherently good,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.780
 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.380
he also saw the virtues like these must be constantly cultivated

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.440
just like plants in a garden

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.940
He spoke about moral character and wisdom

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.900
as the work of a lifetime

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.900
We can see now why he had such reverence

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.900
for his elders

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.900
Of course, a burst of inspiration may well be

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.900
what we need to start out business or redo our

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.900
rough draft or reinvent our life.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.900
But if we're being very honest with ourselves,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.900
we'll have to admit that we also need to devote more

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.900
energy to slowly changing our habits.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.900
This, more than anything else,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.900
is what prevents us from becomming

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.900
truly intelligent, accomplished and wise.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.900
Confucius died without reforming

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.900
the decadent officials

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.900
But after his death his follwers created

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.900
schools and tempels in his honor across East Asia,

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.900
passing his teachings along for over

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.900
two thousand years.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.900
Today millions of people still follow Confucius' teachings

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.900
as a spiritual or religious discipline

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.900
And his thought has been a huge influence on

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.900
Eastern political ideas about morality

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.900
obedience and good leadership.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.900
We might find Confucian virtues a bit strange

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.900
or oldfashioned, but this is what

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.900
ultimately makes them all the more important.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.900
We need them as a corrective to our own excesses.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.900
The modern world is almost surprisingly

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.900
totally un-confucian,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.900
informal, egallitarian and full of innovation.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.900
So we're conversely at risk of becomming

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.900
impulsive, irreverent and thoughtless

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.900
without a little advice from Confucius

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.900
about good behavior and sheep.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.900
 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.900
 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.900
 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.900
 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.900
 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.900
