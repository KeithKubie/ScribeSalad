00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:18.560
really get that message that's great
 

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.640
really get that message that's great
thanks I hope all all your students for

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:21.650
thanks I hope all all your students for
 

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:28.000

paying attention Eric that the word

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.010
paying attention Eric that the word
 

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.460
paying attention Eric that the word
sustainability is used very frequently

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:30.470
sustainability is used very frequently
 

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.900

to make sustainable buildings but it's
about buildings where all systems have

an inter where you can see the effect of
