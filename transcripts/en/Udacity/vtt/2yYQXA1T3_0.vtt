00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.570
So how do we do Radiometric Calibration?

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.490
Again, we're interested in this
pipeline of going from L towards I,

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.400
but we also want to be able to
model the inverse phenomenon of it.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.875
So let's start off with a Color Chart,
that we know the reflectances of.

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:20.720
What basically means is a color chart
like this comes in predefined and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.200
here basically, just I'm showing
you the gray values here.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.818
It shows what are the intensities,
90, 59.1%.

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:30.870
So somebody had sat down and
calibrated this color chart as a perfect

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.940
color model or gray scale values
that we're interested in.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.830
What we want to do is we want to
take multiple exposures from this

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.000
co, color chart.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.600
Which basically means is I'm
going to take images of this.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.440
What I can do of course is I can take
them at different exposure values.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.240
That basically means I can, you know,
do things like ep, epsilon photography.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.060
I can take images at different
exposures, shutter speeds, and

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.230
all that kind of stuff.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.390
That would of course change how,
what kind of intensities for

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.070
the same image that is out there.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.830
Of course, we're basically playing
around on this parameter here to oh,

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.590
different types of parameters
to get to this value.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.120
I'm just showing you an example of this.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.330
So, again,
my pixel values go from zero to 55.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.942
This is my scene irradiance.

00:01:11.942 --> 00:01:15.950
I'm going to look at irradiance, because
we know scene radiance to ir, irradiance

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.510
is a linear things and actually we're
more interested in trying to get there.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.300
This mapping is something
which is linear.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.640
Of course, when done,
we know what's going on.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.190
Of course, this basically means is now
everything's projected on a 2D surface,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.300
which the information is coming from.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.220
So, of course, if I know the scene
irradiance I can plot a point,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.460
as I go at different scene irradiance.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.900
And of course I can figure out from
this one what is the intensity at each

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.950
and every pixel.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.870
So next part that we can do now, of
course, is after I've drawn this curve,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.260
for a specific device or a sensor,
and imaging device like the camera

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.730
I've done this on by taking in this
case, one image, two image, three, four,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.040
five, six, seven images and
I can basically fill in the curve.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.110
Now I can do the opposite, right.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.550
If I know a pixel value, or I want to,
curious about a pixel value,

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.635
can I actually now compute
the scene irradiance?

00:02:05.635 --> 00:02:08.520
And that's what this
exercise basically shows.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.110
Once I can model this, I can always
come back and I say, okay, what's here?

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.330
I can figure out the scene
irradiance at this point.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.670
Again, scene irradiance here
is going from zero to one.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.170
Now, this will allow me to
pick up any values I want.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.677
So, of course,
there are few assumptions here, in,

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:27.160
when we play around
with images like this.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.310
It assumes constant lighting,
and all patches,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.540
basically, are equally well lit.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.706
So it can't be a focused light source.

00:02:34.706 --> 00:02:38.260
The assumes of light source
is really far away, and

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.140
is equally lighting the whole scene.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.900
So, you know, for example,
something like natural sunlight.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.590
When you light with this kind of
stuff we're allowed to do this.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.990
A unique inverse exists for

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.760
g because in this case g is monotonic
and smooth for all types of cameras.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.140
And again we will model this for
different cameras and

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.460
this allows us to compute this.
