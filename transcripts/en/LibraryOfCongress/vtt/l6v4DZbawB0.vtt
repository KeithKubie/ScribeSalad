&gt;&gt; Susan Meinheit: Welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.250
Thank you to the
Embassy of Mongolia

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.170
and the Mongolian
Cultural Center

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.540
for bringing this
exciting conference

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.040
to the Library again this year.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.990
It's my pleasure to introduce
the chief of the Asian Division,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.560
Dr. Dongfang Shao, who will
officially start the program.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.360
Thank you.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.440
[ Applause ]

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.740
&gt;&gt; Dr. Dongfang Shao:
Good afternoon.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.360
You know, we are lucky.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.970
You know, we only
have eight hours,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.020
government shut down, you know.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.240
Originally I was so concerned,
you know, we were unable

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.440
to have a meeting here.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.510
And welcome to the
Library of Congress, yeah,

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.570
particularly the keynote speaker

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.320
to what we call the 12th
International Mongolia

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.930
Study Conference.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.600
Yeah. I attended nine three
years ago in the Embassy, yeah.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.690
We would like to thank Mr.
Bold Bat-Ochir, Deputy Chief

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.190
of Mission of Mongolia
to the United States,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.170
and also the Embassy staff
and Mongolian Cultural Center

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.100
and its president,
Saruul Erdene Myagmar,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.910
for bringing the
conference participants

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.820
to the Library of Congress.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.700
Yeah. Asian Division has a very
large Mongolian collection,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.880
you know, and also a very
important collection.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.210
The resources is for
academic research.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.880
You know, we supposed to be one

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.750
of the largest Mongolian
collection outside

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.690
of Mongolia, yeah.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.160
And also, we have covered
179 different Asian languages

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.600
of 23 countries and areas.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.990
Yeah, so we have the
largest collection

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.810
of Japanese collection
outside of Japan

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.270
and we have the largest
Indonesia collection,

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.080
yeah, outside Indonesia.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.950
Yeah. So we welcome all the
visiting scholar to come

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.740
to use our collection, you
know, to conduct your research

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.040
in the Library of Congress.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:43.080
Yeah. And also, I would like
to thanks the Mongolian Embassy

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.800
to send us 74 books in the
different format on behalf

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.210
of former President Elbegdorj
and his administration.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.550
You know, these books are here

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.830
and we will have a small
ceremony to have a presentation.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.630
Yeah.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:13.510
[ Background sounds ]

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.500
[ Applause ]

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.930
Now I ask Susan Meinheit,
she is our Tibetan

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.970
and Mongolian specialist, to
reintroduce today's speaker.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.250
[ Applause ]

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.550
&gt;&gt; Susan Meinheit: Okay.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.850
Thank you.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.380
And it's my honor to introduce
our two keynote speakers

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.230
for today's conference.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.450
Robert McIntosh, M.S.,

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.060
is a retired U.S. National Park
Service Senior Administrator

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.660
who received the service's
Distinguished Service Award.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.960
He now serves on the board

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.980
of the Mongol Ecology
Center in Ulaanbaatar.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.380
Clyde Goulden, Ph.D., is
Curator Emeritus of the Academy

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.980
of Natural Sciences
at Drexel University,

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.690
and since 1996 has
been the director

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.320
of the academy's Institute
for Mongolian Biodiversity

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.590
and Ecological Studies.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.120
He conducted his Mongolia
research under grants

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.630
from the National Science
Foundation for over 20 years.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.480
It is my honor to present them
for an interesting presentation

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.120
on the critical importance of
science and the rule of law

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.590
in protecting the integrity

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.070
of Mongolia's Lake
Hovsgol National Park.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.870
Gentlemen.

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:58.070
[ Applause ]

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.370
&gt;&gt; Robert McIntosh: Thank you.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.670
Can you hear in the back?

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:01.970
Sound good?

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.270
Thank you.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.840
It's Dr. Goulden and my
pleasure to have the honor

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.510
to be the keynote
at this conference.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.130
We submitted our abstract
and then got shocked

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.740
by asking to do the keynote.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.740
So we're a little above our pay
grade, but thank you anyways.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.800
We obviously want to talk about
the integration of science

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.520
and public administration,
science-based decision making

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.390
in national parks in Mongolia,
and for that matter the need

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.730
that exists for that
throughout the world.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.850
So our talk today is
focused on Lake Hovsgol,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.320
but in your own experiences
with different parks

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.160
in different parts of
Mongolia and different parts

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.730
of the world, the
same lessons are true.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.460
I want to start first by
just giving us a geographical

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.950
reference as to where
we are in the world.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.640
Lake Hovsgol National Park is
the headwaters of the Selenge,

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.380
one of the many headwaters
of the Selenge

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:10.750
in north central Mongolia down
to Lake Baikal, and it flows

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.860
into the Yenisei
River, which is one

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.660
of the great Arctic
rivers in Siberia.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.090
Equally important, just to
the west is the Darkhad Valley

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.330
and the Shishged River,
which also flows north

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.400
into the Yenisei and
on to the Arctic.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.870
Lake Hovsgol National Park

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.500
and the Lake Baikal region
is the southern extent

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.870
of the permanent permafrost,
which is very important

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.460
in the issues of climate
change as we move forward.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.240
And you can see from the
different colorations

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.710
in this slide, the red arrow
pointing to Lake Hovsgol,

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.720
that to the north is
the Siberian taiga,

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.310
and to the south is the steppe,
the Central Asian steppe.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.300
So it's the blending
or the transition

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.770
from one major ecosystem
to another.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.130
In local cultural
traditions, particularly

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.620
in the Lake Hovsgol area,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.380
it is that Lake Hovsgol
itself is the Mother Sea.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.810
Munkh Saridag Mountain to the
north along the Russian border,

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.340
looking over the frozen lake
and the Village of Hankh,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:26.410
is the Father and all life
emanated from the Father

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.940
and the Great Mother Sea.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.570
So now the rangers of Lake
Hovsgol wanted to kind

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.060
of take you on a quick
tour of the park.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.340
This is the entrance sign,
the new entrance sign,

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:45.990
which was donated in 2015
by Yosemite National Park

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.600
in the United States at the
time we signed a sister park

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:54.150
agreement between Lake
Hovsgol and Yosemite.

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.740
You can see here in the
geographic reference

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.880
of the country, Lake Hovsgol
is that north central,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.510
and the colors just to the left
or the west, are the three parks

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:08.000
that surround the
Darkhad Valley.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.410
The park itself is
1.2 million hectares.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:16.280
That's about Yellowstone
and a half again.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.880
Various transitions
of ecosystems.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.660
Seventy percent of
the fresh water

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.900
in Mongolia sits in that lake.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:26.100
It's 267 meters deep.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.300
Sixty-eight mammal species
are known in the park

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.520
and ten fish, one endemic.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.770
The Hovsgol Grayling only
lives in Lake Hovsgol.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:41.350
Local families and visitation,
which you will see shortly,

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:46.810
is skyrocketing, and we'll
discuss the impacts of that.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:51.110
In 2013 the Mongol Ecology
Center worked with the park

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.640
and developed a vision statement
for the management of the park,

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.560
speaking to the diverse
cultural and natural resources

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.340
that express the
values of the Mother Sea

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:06.300
and the Father Mountain,
nomadic traditions and folklore,

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.920
together for the
preservation, fully integrated

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.270
with sustainable
economic development.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.410
This is the game changer.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:18.960
In the Soviet period
industrial export/import

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.170
from the Soviet Union
for 1990 to 2010 or so,

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.050
things were very quiet,
depressed economically

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:33.490
in Hatgal, and then in 2014
the paved road from Ulaanbaatar

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.030
to Hatgal was completed and
this is what has happened

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.810
to the visitation.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:43.320
You can see early in the
2000s very little visitation.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.750
Once the road was completed,

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:51.240
2017 almost 100,000
people visited the park,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.490
and a spike in international
tourism as well.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.230
The border between Russia and
Mongolia is now open to Russians

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.980
and Mongolians, and
there's been a huge spike

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.800
in the Russian traffic
from Irkutsk to other parts

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:09.870
of the Lake Baikal region coming
down to visit Lake Hovsgol.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.680
The basis of any national
park in any country is law.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.100
Lake Hovsgol National Park
was established in 1992.

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.050
Think about the timing there
in terms of the independence,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:27.020
the constitution, the
creation of the parliament

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.080
and a very quick decision

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.130
to preserve the area
around Lake Hovsgol.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:37.800
It wasn't until 1994, still
very quickly in the growth

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.000
of a new nation, that the law

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.110
on the protected
areas was established.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.940
For national parks it
set up special zones,

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.700
sort of like our wilderness
areas, it set up travel

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:53.830
and tourism zones, where
temporary structures

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.380
and travel was restricted
but permissible,

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.110
and the limited use
zones, where travel,

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:04.970
permanent tourism facilities and
local families are authorized

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.340
to live or allowed to live.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.920
So moving in to park
management issues, park zoning.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.790
This map was done in 2014.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.130
The pink area, it
is the special zone,

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.820
the sort of wilderness zone.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.500
The tourism is the
blue, very limited areas

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.960
that are called tourism,

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.640
and then very large areas
for limited use zone.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:33.760
Limited use provides
no protection

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:40.970
for fish spawning areas, small
natural areas, prime grasslands

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:46.130
and the 574 local families
that live some or all

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.740
of the year inside the park,
and you can see that number

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:55.330
of livestock that they husband
within the park resources.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.250
In 1996 the parliament

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.310
of Mongolia established
the international long-term

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.790
ecological research site
to join a group of sites

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:10.020
across the world important
in understanding the bio

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.980
and general science
information about global issues,

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.050
and this was established
in 1996.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.100
Research started then
and has been ongoing

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.930
in this area ever since.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.840
Unfortunately, however,
in the Anjigas Valley,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:34.250
which you can see on the map,
in 2013 unlawful construction

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:36.550
of a tourist facility.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:42.890
In 2014 limited use zone
extended 36 miles south

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.550
from that line that
goes across the map.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.270
And then the permit for that
construction, 18 months later,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:54.150
was approved in December
of 2014.

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.410
No laws were being followed,

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:01.210
no standards were being
followed in that example.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.870
And that, unfortunately,
is not the only example.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.510
Mongolian standards
for tourism developed

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:10.940
in protected areas
were developed in 2013,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:16.410
or a new set was established in
2013; 200 meters from the water,

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.030
setback from the water, one
kilometer between facilities,

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.330
no open toilets and livestock

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.740
and tourism facilities
must be separated

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.390
by a minimum of 500 meters.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:30.700
This is the classic example
of a local family trying

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.270
to diversify economically,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:36.960
and it's a challenge
obviously relative

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:41.130
to their standards
and what they can do.

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.570
Here's a livestock
pen, an open toilet

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.140
and a tourist facility
all within a stone's throw

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:52.050
of each other, which
creates public health issues,

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.350
as you can well imagine.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.010
In 2014 we did a
survey of the ger camps

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.300
to identify the location
of all the camps

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.880
on the southwest shore.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.670
2016 we came back
and did it again.

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.760
The red are the new camps in
a two-year period of time.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.920
When you zoom down on this,

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.910
you can see that the
average separation

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:17.580
between camps is .27 meters.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.060
The standard is one kilometer.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.660
So again, the standard is not
being followed and the intensity

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.020
of development is
critically impacting

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.280
or has the long-term potential

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.000
to critically impact the
quality of water in the lake.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.300
Visitor experience.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.900
I pulled this off the
Facebook page for Hatgal.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:47.150
A local Mongolian wrote
that the place was overrun,

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.290
it was dusty, it was smoky.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.650
People can vacation, but do
they have to drink so much.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.770
They should drive slower, they
should take their trash out,

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.830
stop driving on the grass.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.560
Local people.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.530
This is what they face
on a day-to-day basis.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:08.000
Litter, wild camping with
no toilets, wild camping,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.890
wild trash, no toilets,
right on the lake shore.

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.810
Waste management also creates
plastic pollution, bottles,

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:23.040
bags just dumped into various
depressions in the landscape

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.620
and over time, from sun and
wind, they degenerate and end

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.960
up in the lake, creating hazards
for the fish, creating hazards

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.670
in any water that's consumed
through the bioaccumulation

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:38.200
of plastic in the systems.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:42.260
The Mongol Ecology Center Junior
Ranger Program did water quality

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.250
sampling this last
summer, five test sites.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.860
Five sites found the water to
be clear, found the water to be

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:55.970
at the appropriate pH, found the
water to be low in nutrients,

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.960
but found the water to
contain fecal coliform.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.280
The issue is just at the
edge of being serious,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.720
but it's certainly an alarm
bell that needs to be watched.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.000
Oil and gas pollution from
water craft, old boats,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.230
two-cycle engines and public
safety is a serious concern

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:23.400
as far as dealing with folks
using boats on the water.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.460
There are more than
70 private operators,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.860
unregulated private operators

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.430
with tour boat type
activities on Lake Hovsgol.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:36.060
Park roads, the road
on the left is the road

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.020
from Hatgal to Hankh.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.160
The road on the right
is an improved road

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.480
on the southwest
shore of the lake.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:50.130
Unintended consequences of
this type of construction,

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.010
they put the road between
the ger camps and the lake.

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:55.940
Now everybody complains
of the noise, the dust,

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.080
the speed of the vehicles,
and the folks from UB

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:04.370
and the Toyota Motor
Club have found the lake

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.940
and this was scary
to watch these six

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.120
or seven vehicles come
speeding down that road

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.670
without regard to anybody.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:17.670
New roads are in the profile
of what's going to happen

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:19.190
in northern Hovsgol aimag.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:24.380
This map on the left shows an
analysis of the various routes

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.410
to get from Muron over
to the Darkhad Valley.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:32.280
The one that is seemingly
locally most favorite is

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:34.230
through the Jiggly Pass,

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:36.340
but that is the one
of highest concern.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.760
The one down below,
with the Y, the yes,

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.480
is the one that's
being, at least as far

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.780
as this study was concerned,

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.950
being recommended
for consideration.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.440
The west side road, 180
kilometers on the --

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.120
excuse me -- the east side
road on the right side

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.090
of the map presents similar
problems in terms of how

00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:00.100
to develop what will
become an interstate,

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:04.030
international highway,
not for park use --

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:08.960
or one purpose will be park use,
but the road will be consumed

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.080
by commercial traffic
bringing materials north

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.880
and south from Russia.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.670
This is what can happen if the
road's not designed properly

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:22.010
and if speeds are not
controlled and the type

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.860
of uses are not regulated
as well.

00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.400
Managing for new uses, explosion
in tour boats on the lake,

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.950
and within the last two or
three years the appearance

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:38.280
of commercially rented off-road
vehicles for group tours

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.180
or for individuals,
as well as dirt bikes

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.060
to take off into
the countryside.

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.360
The way forward.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:48.100
Adhere to the laws
and standards.

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:51.140
Adhere to the IUCN,
International Union

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:52.910
for the Conservation of Nature,

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.710
under UNESCO protected area
guidelines for best practices,

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.760
science-based decision
making, planning with teams

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.020
of interdisciplinary experts,
involving the community

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:05.700
and other stakeholders,
and most importantly,

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:09.190
transparent administrative
practices.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.740
We'll now ask Dr. Goulden to
review some critical points

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:16.350
in the water chemistry,
the science of water,

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:17.750
as far as Lake Hovsgol
is concerned.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:19.550
Thank you.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:26.530
[ Applause ]

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.900
&gt;&gt; Clyde Goulden:
Thank you, Bob.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.290
Actually, every time I
hear Bob talk about this,

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:34.140
there's something new
that's gone wrong.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.640
That's very tragic.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.600
But everything's going
beautifully here.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.310
Thank you very much
for having us.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:46.160
I want to start off just
showing you a picture

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:54.760
from our training program that
we had between 2002 and 2006.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:59.560
We brought in, with
support from the World Bank

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.490
and the Global Environment
Facility,

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:05.760
18 young Mongolian researchers,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.210
many of whom had
Master's degrees,

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.990
all of whom were supposed to
speak English so we didn't have

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:14.780
to worry about English
at the beginning.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.650
They lied a little bit, but
they knew enough English

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:21.260
to convince me that
we'd get along okay.

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:24.230
On the other hand,
some of the individuals

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:28.360
in this photograph are
Peace Corps volunteers.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.530
We were able to have Peace
Corps volunteers to come

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:38.390
up during the summer months,
on their holidays, by the way,

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:43.540
and teach English to
all of our researchers.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.770
Now, let me just say

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.960
at the beginning we
started with about 18.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.410
Two or three dropped out.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.410
We added two or three more.

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:58.320
Most importantly in all of this
is that all those individuals

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.180
who completed the program, the
five-year program, and we had,

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.160
by the way, a number of
international scientists come

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.130
in for training in a
number of different areas,

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:15.470
all of those individuals who
finished the program ended

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:21.970
up going abroad for
graduate study, and of that,

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.500
12 of the individuals
returned to Mongolia

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.970
with a doctor's degree.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.730
The rest all returned,
all of the scientists,

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.640
young scientists returned.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.530
And as many of you know
who've worked in Mongolia,

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.850
usually when someone
leaves, they don't come back

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.440
if they can avoid it, and
that's not to criticize them,

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:47.060
one understands that, but
all of these individuals --

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:51.340
in fact, you may even
recognize some of those

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.020
from your own visitations.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.100
There are more than obviously
18 individuals in there.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.060
There are a number of faculty
from the National University,

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.930
from the Mongolian
Academy of Sciences,

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:08.460
and international scientists
that, again, we were able

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:12.190
to bring in for training
and specialty purposes.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:18.320
So just a little
background very quickly.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.790
And the role that I'm trying to
play here is to give you a bit

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:28.830
of the science, our scientific
understanding of Lake Hovsgol

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:32.980
and why it is so sensitive
to the kinds of problems

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:35.450
that Bob has just discussed.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:39.930
It is a tectonic basin,
similar to Baikal.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:43.910
Baikal, of course, is
about 22 million years old.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:47.090
Hovsgol itself is only
about 5 million years old

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.490
and was formed during one
of the last tectonic phases

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:56.290
that extended the size of Lake
Baikal, but added Lake Hovsgol,

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:59.080
but it's separate, of course,
though they are connected

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.390
by the Selenge River,
as Bob said.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.060
The lake is reasonably large.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.420
Its surface area is about
the size of Lake Erie.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:13.210
Though Lake Erie is around
55 meters deep, Lake Hovsgol

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.170
and these tectonic
basins are much deeper.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:23.150
This is 262 meters deep, and
because of that large volume

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:28.780
of water, it's the 16th
largest lake in the world.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:33.080
Baikal, of course,
is the largest lake.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.890
The watershed has
been a summer home

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.600
for nomadic herders
for centuries.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.220
I mean, you probably can go
back at least 2,000 years,

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:52.270
if not longer in time, where
herders have been coming

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.810
into the valley there,
or to valleys, actually.

00:23:55.810 --> 00:23:59.360
And, of course, one of
the most important things,

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:02.000
and most of you familiar
with Mongolia know

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.680
that often they have
very serious droughts.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.880
So where do you go to get
water during a drought;

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.500
you try to go to a river.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.230
You look at the rivers and
they're totally overgrazed,

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.620
in terms of the watershed of
the river during a drought.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.090
Hovsgol itself can
become overgrazed, too,

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:26.320
but it becomes a really
important place for the herders

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:30.250
to be able to take their
animals to get water

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:34.730
and generally get good pasture.

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:39.170
The herders are coming,
in this case,

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:43.660
from their winter grazing area,
which is up in the mountains,

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.510
and they come down into the
valleys during the summer,

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.700
and then again in the autumn
will start heading back

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.470
up to the top of the
mountains, and that is simply

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:58.100
because the valleys during the
winter are very, very cold.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:03.160
So actually, you can feel
it as you walk up yourself.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:06.070
You're four to five
degrees warmer as you go

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.910
up towards the top
of the mountain.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:12.060
And you can see also in
that picture, by the way,

00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:18.060
they're carrying their ger,
all of their possessions,

00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:21.460
on the back of yaks here,
and then you can see

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:27.050
in the background up above the
sheep, goats, cashmere goats

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.210
and other animals
coming down the valley.

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.160
Most herders will
have at least four,

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.390
possibly five different
species of animals

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:38.420
that they have in their herds.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:44.120
And in general, what you'll
see is that the goats,

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.070
the cashmere goats and the
sheep, are grazing up on slopes.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.490
Horses and yaks are down
below, down near the river.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.900
So they're actually
separated ecologically.

00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:00.180
So even though you have a
number of fairly large herds,

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.400
they really are sort
of exploiting as much

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.970
of the slope environment
as they can.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:15.700
The problems that Bob
has alluded to in terms

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.220
of construction are
really mirrored, of course,

00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:24.340
in the ecology, the ecological
changes that are occurring now.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:28.640
And what we're seeing
now is that more and more

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:32.370
of the watersheds, as
they're being developed

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:37.180
for these ger camps and
the shoreline of the lake,

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:42.140
that those areas of the
lake that are closest

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.860
to the shore are starting to
very serious blooms of algae.

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.950
This is the kind of problem
that most people don't think

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:55.970
of as a serious problem at
first, but as it expands

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.060
and those areas become
more and more polluted,

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.300
which is really what this is
all about, people become less

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.630
and less interested
in going there.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.760
You don't want to have to
go to a lake and get out

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:12.070
and take a shower afterwards
so you can clean all the scum,

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:15.620
the algae scum off of you,
and yet that's starting

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:18.590
to occur more and more.

00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:21.920
Another aspect of that, in
terms of that's a problem

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.830
of nutrient loading,
a lot of it from trash

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:29.260
and any erosion coming
off of the landscape,

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.930
and I'll explain what that
problem is in a minute,

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:35.800
but the other part is that
with rapid warming due

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.230
to climate change, the whole
area has already warmed,

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.950
is warming two to three times
faster than we are warming

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:46.130
with climate change,
and we talk mostly here

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:50.910
about a one degree warming
over the last 40 or 50 years.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:55.470
In Mongolia and in parts -- much
of Siberia you're really talking

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:58.650
about at least a
three degree warming,

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.290
and a lot of that is simply

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:06.090
because the snow is melting
very rapidly, so that rather

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:11.590
than sunlight being
reflected back by the snow,

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.680
so the heatiness [phonetic]
is sort of reflected back.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.790
In fact, now, that
heat that's coming

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:20.000
from the sun is being
absorbed by the landscape

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.320
and that's why the warming is
occurring much more rapidly.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.750
And then finally,
as I mentioned,

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:29.810
the increased trash
accumulation.

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:34.880
So I'm going to focus on those
three points here very quickly.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.670
Mongolia is generally
known, to begin with,

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:39.570
as the Blue Pearl of Mongolia.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.010
Have any of you heard
of that before?

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:42.310
[ Inaudible responses ]

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:46.000
I just wondered, because
I started there in 1994

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
and that was the
first thing I learned.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.620
Mongolians love pearls,
to begin with.

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.840
I'm pretty sure I'm
saying that correctly.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.720
And so when they say the
Blue Pearl, you can see why.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.060
It's really a gorgeous color.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.200
The water is so clear, and
what happens is that with --

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.810
as you know, a rainbow has all
of the speck tore of colors,

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:14.020
colored light in it, but
as light goes down through,

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.390
that sunlight goes
down through the water,

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.450
different wavelengths, different
colors are being absorbed

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.960
and removed.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.860
And the one wavelength of light

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.030
that goes the deepest
is blue light and then

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:34.730
that is reflected back
to the sky and the lakes,

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:39.590
in other words, as the ocean,
is so clear that the light

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.860
that comes back to
you when you look

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.970
down on the lake
is that blue light.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:47.880
Everything else has
been filtered out.

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:51.510
The reason I mention
this, of course,

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.290
is this is what we want it to
look like, this is what you want

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:56.980
to see when you get there,

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:59.070
but the question is
are you always going

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:04.990
to be able to see it.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:09.880
The concept of pollution that
we refer to in water and lakes

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.580
in particular, such as the Great
Lakes, we don't really talk

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.800
about pollution, but we could,

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:20.090
but there is a term
eutrophication that I think many

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:25.700
of you perhaps have
heard of before.

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:32.360
Eutrophication is a phenomenon
where a water body is shifting

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.910
from a low productive,
low nutrient system,

00:30:37.910 --> 00:30:46.150
with very clear, clean water,
to a more polluted water,

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.770
where nutrients are coming
in stimulating algae growth.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:54.850
That algae growth, in turn,
builds up a large plant biomass

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:57.860
in the water so it
clouds the water,

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:02.380
and then when that bloom dies
out, it falls to the bottom

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:06.010
into the sediments
of the lake and then

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.080
that begins to decompose.

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.790
Especially in a lake like
Hovsgol, where you have a lot

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:14.000
of oxygen already present
in that bottom water,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.040
that plant material, dead
plant material is decomposing,

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.690
decomposing and decomposing
and taking up oxygen,

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:25.180
drinking oxygen continuously.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.710
And so it's grabbing the
oxygen out of the water

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.640
and slowly these kinds of lakes

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.450
that are undergoing
eutrophication,

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:36.470
becoming more productive,
what happens is

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:41.710
that the mud itself
loses its oxygen.

00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:44.380
The water above it loses oxygen.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.390
And when that happens,
the nutrients

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.010
that have been suspended
in the water column,

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:55.740
and particularly a nutrient
like phosphorus, that has gone

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:59.560
down to the bottom,
remained in the sediment

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.680
under these high oxygen
conditions, when it loses

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.790
that oxygen, that phosphorus
especially, some nitrogen,

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:12.360
but particularly
phosphorous, now can emerge

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:16.200
from the sediments and it
comes back up into the water

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.950
and fertilizes the
growth of algae.

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:23.070
So that what basically
is happening is

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:27.480
that as you're undergoing
this gradual increase

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:31.720
in productivity, increase
of growth of plant material

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:37.570
in the water column, it is
then regenerating itself,

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:40.020
recovering those
nutrients, bringing it back

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:44.480
up into the water and so
you not only have the influx

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:48.590
of nutrients from the watershed,
but you now have an influx,

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.040
as it were, from the sediment.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.150
So it's a reinforcement effect
that builds up very quickly,

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:57.700
and this really increases.

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:05.050
The lakes that you've seen
maybe here in Virginia or in --

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.820
no, we're not in
Virginia, sorry --

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.700
in Pennsylvania where
I come from, in Kansas,

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:15.540
in Indiana where I've
studied lakes before,

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.000
you start to get ponds,
especially Michigan,

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.120
or Lake Erie, many
of you know --

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.280
remember the description
of Lake Erie?

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.910
Lake Erie is dead.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:28.350
What did they mean by that?

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:31.850
What they actually meant,
obviously the water was there,

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:34.430
the basin was there,
it's all there,

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:39.630
but you don't find very much
life in many areas of the lake,

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:44.110
and it's that living material,
of course, that has died,

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.120
has released its nutrients.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:51.300
They've gone back up in that
reinforcing kind of change

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:58.250
that is going on, but it chokes
out the oxygen so that many

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:03.590
of the organisms present,
fishes, et cetera, are dying.

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:08.290
It's a very serious problem, and
that's why Lake Erie was said

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.400
to be dead, though it's not,
and hopefully it's starting

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.890
to return, in fact, but
it's reversing itself again.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:22.500
So what are the kinds of
problems that are causing this.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.420
Water quality studies of the
tributary streams that we did

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.860
in 1999 to 2000 found that
livestock grazing itself,

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.950
this is before tourism
really built up,

00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:38.490
livestock grazing itself
is fertilizing algae

00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:42.340
and plant growth, as just
described, mostly in the bays

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.010
or in the near shore areas.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:46.760
Those are the areas that
are being hit first.

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.500
And, of course, those are
the areas that tourists want

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.090
to spend their time in.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:54.880
The increased photosynthesis
then increases --

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:58.290
and this is an interesting
point, but it can end

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:05.140
up increasing the alkalinity
of the water and when

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.780
that alkalinity -- in one
bay that we measured --

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:14.060
if you know the pH scale,
neutral is around seven

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.420
and you go up to
ten, you're really

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:20.490
in a very alkaline situation,
or you go down to four or five,

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.390
you're in a very acid system.

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:29.130
We found one area, one bay with
fish kills with a pH of 9.8.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:33.710
I won't go into the reason
for that, but if anyone wants

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.310
to know, we can discuss it.

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:41.370
One of the really key points to
understand about Lake Hovsgol is

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:47.140
that most of the geology in
that area consists of dolomite,

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.580
sort of a limestone, a
slight variation on the theme

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:58.590
of limestone, but this dolomite
is very rich in phosphorus.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:02.770
And again, phosphorus
is a major nutrient,

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:08.380
if not the major nutrient
limiting this plant growth

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.700
in lakes.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:16.710
So the whole effect of
the watershed coming in,

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.560
the nutrients from the
watershed coming in,

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:22.930
going into the sediment,
being regenerated back

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:29.000
up into the water, is being
reinforced overall by half

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.040
of the watershed of Lake
Hovsgol, consisting of dolomite

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.710
that is loaded with phosphorus.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.390
Anything that is done
in the lake almost

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:45.800
without care is going to end up
being a problem in Lake Hovsgol.

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.990
The issue on this, of
course, I said unregulated

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:56.910
as a point there, the
lake is very sensitive.

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:04.150
If it is regulated with
the kinds of things

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:08.210
that Bob was talking
about, you don't have to end

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:10.400
up with this kind of a problem.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.330
If those ger camps keep
being built the way

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:16.820
that they were described,

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.060
you can imagine what's
going to happen.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.730
It's going to be very
serious in the future.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:26.240
Right now I happen to be
involved with a project

00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:28.730
from the Asian Development Bank,

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:33.850
where the bank is very
appropriately investing a great

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:37.180
deal of money trying
to help the people

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:40.520
of Lake Hovsgol develop
a tourism industry

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:44.800
and the issue is, of course,

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.480
which direction is
it going to take.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:51.380
Is it going to take a
regulated direction,

00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:56.580
where everyone follows the best
guidelines to protect the lake,

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.060
or is it going to
go in a direction

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.440
where people ignore
those problems,

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:07.670
as they are doing right now,
and causing the lake to go

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:10.970
in a direction of
very serious problems.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:17.900
As some of you know, Baikal is
becoming more and more polluted

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.630
in many areas and what you
see in the watershed now,

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:25.020
more and more, are these
kinds of algae growths,

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.020
and that's the kind of
thing, most certainly,

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.170
not only on the bottom --
these are benthic algae growing

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:33.220
on the bottom, but
also up in the water,

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.520
so the water turns green.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:42.520
Then you have the whole
aspect of climate change.

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:45.740
So we have this problem
with nutrients in the lake.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:49.200
We also have a problem with
climate change, and I think many

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.900
of you have been
introduced to that enough

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:55.410
so that you'll appreciate
what I'm referring to here.

00:38:55.410 --> 00:38:59.940
We've been doing interviews
with nomadic herders and trying

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:04.470
to get their perceptions,
understand their perceptions

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:07.970
of how climate change is
affecting their lives.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.320
And these are some of the
questions and the responses,

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.110
just to give you an idea
of how the herders --

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:19.190
and let me say one thing.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:23.840
Some people, when you're a
[inaudible], seem to suggest,

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.170
oh, those herders, they don't
know what they're doing,

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.230
you know, they're just going
around out there somewhere,

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:32.340
not really protecting
their environment.

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:36.070
In fact, in my mind
it's quite the opposite.

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.460
They're very concerned

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:40.090
and they're extremely
good observers.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:42.660
So what is the biggest
environmental impact

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:47.540
on the lives of the herders,
as they responded to us.

00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.980
The first issue is
changing weather.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.520
It's not saying weather,

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.180
which we all complain
about the weather.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.540
They're complaining about
the weather changing.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:04.290
Actually, over the last few days
maybe we've had a lot change,

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:05.590
but.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.950
Overgrazing is much less a
serious problem for herders

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:12.760
as is the changing weather.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.110
And then you ask them
are the seasons changing,

00:40:15.110 --> 00:40:18.420
trying to break down that
whole idea and other aspects

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:21.800
of what they mean
by changing weather.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.120
The timing of the
seasons has changed,

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:25.420
and this is really important.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:29.070
As you know, nomadic
herders that are moving

00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:32.670
to the mountaintops during
the winter, they start moving

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:36.090
in autumn, they have to
know when to start moving,

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.820
and traditionally they have
usually started sometime

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:41.170
in late August, early September.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:44.110
Remember, that's
pretty far north.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:49.320
So they have a timing for when
they move up into the mountains

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.030
to get away from the cold
valleys, and they have a timing

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:58.170
for when they move back down
to the valleys in the spring

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:02.660
because they have to always
worry about their water sources.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:06.580
So the timing of the
seasons has changed

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:10.970
and it is creating substantial
problems for the herders.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:13.900
The winters are milder,
as you would expect.

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.440
Summers are cooler, but are
mixed with very warm days and,

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.280
in fact, they now say that
they are having heatwaves,

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.160
in the same way that
we have heatwaves,

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.390
and that the heatwaves
are burning the grass.

00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:35.550
And finally, and the thing
that I want to emphasize here

00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:38.390
for the next couple of slides,

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:43.030
is they say the rains have
changed, and they will describe

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:49.350
to you that rains used to be a
light silky rain that might last

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:52.290
for two or three days.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:55.340
Now, it's coming in gushes.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.270
And you've seen that, I'm
sure, yourself around here,

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:00.140
so I'm not telling you anything

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:03.100
that you haven't
witnessed as a change.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:07.840
And I think if you
consider all the things

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.680
that have been occurring with
some of these really heavy rains

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.970
where it washes cars off
of Long Island Expressway,

00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:16.890
and there was one big storm
that came out of Chicago

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:20.280
and came right down to
Washington area here,

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:26.480
flooded tremendously, these are
not historically common events.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.940
They may have occasionally
occurred in the past,

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.250
but they are increasing
in frequency.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:36.730
For Mongolia, what
you're beginning

00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:40.740
to see now are these
really heavy,

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:44.020
hard rains that are coming
in and they look like this,

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:48.330
if you can sort of -- I hope
you can see, right in the center

00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:53.120
above those houses, there's a
very heavy rainstorm occurring.

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:55.650
That happens to be south
of us and we just happened

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.650
to be heading that way.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.760
This kind of a rain
is called a --

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.550
by the Mongols is
called an aadar rain.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:08.620
Many of you fluent in
Mongolia will know that term.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:14.560
This is the kind of rain you
don't want to stand outside

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.180
and feel this warm rain
coming down on you.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.480
That would have been the kind

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.590
of rain they would
expect in the past.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:28.030
Now what they're finding
are cold rains coming down,

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:34.490
large drops that are coming down
very rapidly on top of them,

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:38.500
and they become very, very
concerned about their children

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.340
when there are children
are outside.

00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:43.910
Some of these rains are so hard
that they can kill animals,

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:46.650
and I'm not exaggerating that.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:49.260
I hope you appreciate.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:52.010
Just to show you now,
this happens to be --

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:55.430
one of the things that the
herders say was, again,

00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:59.210
we used to have these two- or
three-day rains, half day maybe,

00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:02.840
a couple of days, light rains.

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.100
Now we're having
really intense rains.

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:08.730
Overall there's not a big
increase in the amount

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:13.720
of rainfall annually, it's
just coming delivered now,

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.900
instead of a slow, gradual rain,
it's coming down in torrents.

00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.440
It's coming down
very hard, as I said.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.400
And what you see on this
graph is that everything

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.480
above that horizontal line,

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.430
where on the top there
it says aadar rain,

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:33.810
every rain above that
line is an aadar rain,

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:38.240
and this is a very,
very heavy rain.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:44.980
This is from 2008,
2009, 2010, 2011, 2012.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:46.280
Every year.

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.790
The number on top of the
line represents the length

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:51.540
of that rain.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.000
So, for example, look at 2010.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.410
You have rains that are
aadar rains, very hard rains

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:07.180
that are lasting 15, 30,
15 minutes, ten minutes,

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:11.270
five minutes, with three
millimeters every five

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.710
minutes occurring.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:15.870
Now, that may not
sound like very much,

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.970
but that's a lot of
rain coming down.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.880
And this is what the herders say
as a result of our interviews

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.540
and discussing it with them.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:31.360
The herders claim the aadar
rains were very damaging

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:34.240
to their pastures, animals

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.750
and to their families
while watching the herds.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.190
They're very concerned
about their children,

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:43.110
especially when they're out
because often the child will go

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:47.290
out without a shirt on and then
you have one of these cold,

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:50.260
drenching rains come
down and, of course,

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.490
hypothermia then becomes
a very serious problem.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.720
It's very common now.

00:45:55.720 --> 00:46:01.640
The rain eroded the road,
very intense, dangerous.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:04.370
The ger was flooded,
mattresses were floating,

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:06.980
pasture covered with
running water.

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:11.220
That's not typical,
certainly not historically.

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:13.280
In previous year -- these
are different herders

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.960
that are telling us this.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.670
In previous year, 2011,
had extremely intense,

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.580
hard rain, killed many animals.

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:25.320
Now, how many animals do
we kill when we have one

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:26.700
of our rains right now?

00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.920
One of those really
heavy rains killed a lot

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.330
of cars, I know that.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:34.270
Some people were
harmed, in fact, but.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:35.650
We had extremely hard,

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:38.600
windy rain that knocked
down many trees.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.570
Our fodder, their food that
they collect for the winter

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:46.100
for their animals, our fodder
was blown up into the air.

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.260
We lost half of the fodder.

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:51.630
Our ger was damaged and
knocked down in 2010.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:55.160
And these gers are
pretty well fixed,

00:46:55.160 --> 00:47:00.630
and yet the aadar rain can knock
them down and blow them around.

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:04.210
Last year at the end of July
I experienced aadar boroo.

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.480
That's rain, aadar rain.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:08.970
It was dangerously intense.

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:17.110
And in most cases these
rains are ending up in floods

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:20.730
when they get at Hovsgol,
near the lake itself.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:22.580
If you could, on the
upper left there,

00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.890
if you could just
walk straight out,

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:27.120
you would actually
see the lake there.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.650
It's just beyond it.

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:33.390
But what happens is when the
stream following an aadar rain

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:37.750
is coming down towards the
lake, it sort of backs up.

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:39.590
The lake is acting
as a dam for it,

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:44.720
so it backs up in the
whole pasture area.

00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:49.650
This is a stream that originally
is about 25 feet across,

00:47:49.650 --> 00:47:50.950
nothing more than that.

00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:54.350
And you can see two
of our researchers,

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:58.750
they're actually looking for
insects, not for fish there.

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:04.770
So you get a perspective
on what that river is like.

00:48:04.770 --> 00:48:08.610
Now, look at above that
and over to the right,

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:11.480
if you look just beyond --
I don't know if you can --

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:14.670
I don't know if I can point out.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:17.820
If you look up in the
upper right corner there,

00:48:17.820 --> 00:48:20.440
you see dots there.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:24.160
There are four yaks and
a couple of horses there

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:32.770
that got isolated out on a
little knob, not recognizing --

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.320
I mean, they're sitting there
grazing and not recognizing

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.760
that the whole valley
was flooding.

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.640
But I leave that in for scale

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:43.520
as you can compare the two
researchers versus the yaks

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.740
and the horses for scale.

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:52.390
So aadar rains now, all of the
herders say, and I haven't put

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:55.050
in the analysis for that,

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:58.720
but all of the herders are
saying the aadar rains are much

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.220
more common now.

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.750
We used to have these
light rains,

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:04.320
now we're having these
very intense rains.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.840
It's not always the
only rain that occurs,

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:10.330
but nevertheless, it is there.

00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:14.800
This is a rainfall right
here that is about two inches

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.320
over a two-day period.

00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:22.140
We've had some rains more
than that, I'm afraid.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:27.460
So my concern, Bob's
concern for Lake Hovsgol,

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.930
and I think the concern
of many people,

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:33.450
is rather substantial
and with good reason.

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:37.250
Our research on Lake
Hovsgol suggests

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:40.980
that strict protection
guidelines need to be followed

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.030
as the bay and shoreline
areas, the lakes,

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:46.640
watershed are developed
for tourism

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:49.870
and as the climate
continues to change.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:53.200
This is critical in order
to avoid serious problems

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:56.970
in the future that would
very likely include blooms

00:49:56.970 --> 00:50:01.330
of nuisance aquatic plant
growths, fish kills,

00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:05.810
more flooding, and would
quickly discourage tourists

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:09.130
from visiting the park and
all of the efforts then

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:11.150
to build tourism would
have come to nothing.

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:12.950
Thank you.

plenty of time for questions.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:30.060
I just wanted to say
that because the Library

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:34.290
of Congress is preparing
a webcast of this program,

please ask questions.

&gt;&gt; Clyde Goulden: How many of
you have been to Lake Hovsgol?

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:57.260
Wow. That's a good --
that's pretty good.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:07.540
Have you seen changes in fishing
and in some cases plants growing

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:11.100
where they hadn't been
growing before in the water?

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.760
It's a slow process,
a really slow process.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.060
It's only really
building up now.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:16.860
Yeah.

[ Inaudible comments ]

00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:50.470
&gt;&gt; Robert McIntosh: The story
you tell was a story you could

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:54.890
tell of the United
States 50, 75 years ago.

00:52:54.890 --> 00:52:56.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:57.490
&gt;&gt; Robert McIntosh:
And the people

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:01.560
of the United States
finally became, themselves,

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:06.810
so upset that there
were national campaigns,

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:12.750
just signs on TV and all those
different types of media,

00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:18.340
to tell people to care for the
landscape and don't litter.

00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:22.490
So that changed the mentality,

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:28.310
coupled with more intense
litter patrolling, particularly

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:32.820
in the parks, because I think if
people see litter, they litter.

00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:34.120
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.420
&gt;&gt; Robert McIntosh: If
they don't see litter,

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:37.730
they think twice about
throwing the plastic bag

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:41.530
or the cigarettes, or
whatever, out the car window

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:42.830
or leaving them behind.

00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:45.940
So I think it's both a role
of the government to respond

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.620
to that, but most importantly
you have to change the mindset

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.790
of the population,
and the best way to do

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:55.530
that is national campaigns
to just make people aware

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:57.510
of what they're doing
to themselves.

00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:14.440
[ Inaudible comments ]

00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.740
&gt;&gt; Robert McIntosh: Yeah,

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:17.880
that's a problem not
unique to Mongolia.

00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:23.850
But again, I think even with
plastic in retail and so on,

00:54:23.850 --> 00:54:28.070
if people are educated, they
will strive to take care of it

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:29.720
as opposed to just littering.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.940
And there are campaigns in
Europe and campaigns starting

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.360
in the United States to just
try to eliminate as much plastic

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:41.870
from the retail stream as
possible, and that's a long road

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:45.070
to follow, but hopefully it will
be successful in those places

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:48.920
that are trying it, and it can
be tried in Mongolia as well.

00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.460
&gt;&gt; Clyde Goulden: Now,
it may sound, by the way,

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:52.730
that we're only worried
about Lake Hovsgol,

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:54.030
but I think Bob has said enough,

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:57.380
and I would certainly
reinforce the whole issue,

00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:00.900
that what is happening there is
happening in many of the parks.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:03.990
One of the things that really
attracted me to Mongolia

00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:09.270
to begin with is that they
have established a plan

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:14.170
for protecting 15 percent,
if not more, in fact,

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:20.640
almost 25 percent at one time,
of their area in national parks.

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:26.560
That goal at least has reached
the 15 percent part now,

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.880
and in each one of these parks,
some of them much more protected

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:36.390
than others because they haven't
attracted people as much there,

00:55:36.390 --> 00:55:43.560
but as they do, there is an
ethic that has to be recognized

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:48.030
and established for what
happens when you go into a park.

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:52.890
Our National Park Service has
done a great deal and continues

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:56.810
to do a great deal, and in
Mongolia they will, I know,

00:55:56.810 --> 00:56:00.360
catch on and begin
to do that, too.

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:02.170
&gt;&gt; Robert McIntosh: I'll give
you a quick little case study.

00:56:02.170 --> 00:56:06.260
Three years ago we started a
Junior Ranger Program in Hatgal

00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:08.970
and this year we'll have it --
it's already started in Hankh

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:10.640
at the northern end of the lake.

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:14.590
After the first summer camp
a couple of the kids went

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:18.700
to the local store in the
main strip of Hatgal and stood

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:22.880
at the door and when people
left, they challenged them

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:25.360
as to what they were going
to do with that plastic bag

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:28.180
or what they were going to do
with that empty Coke bottle,

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.060
and made them promise,
basically,

00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:33.650
that they would not just
throw it into the countryside.

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:35.780
So here we've got a sixth-,

00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:40.260
seventh-grader who's already
understanding what the issues

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:44.590
are and starting to try to
make a change, and the more

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:47.250
that we can do that type of
thing and touch one person

00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:49.970
at a time, the problem
goes away.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:54.020
Yes.

00:56:54.020 --> 00:57:03.540
&gt;&gt; I agree with you about
the role of our children

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:04.840
in all this [inaudible].

00:57:04.840 --> 00:57:13.020
It obviously worked
in the United States

00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:41.230
and we're seeing it
work in Mongolia.

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:44.700
I want to ask about the
possible role of the people

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:47.900
who have the guest gers
around the side of the lake

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:53.010
and whether you see --
because we saw the same thing

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:55.940
in a national park in
western Mongolia, the Altai,

00:57:55.940 --> 00:58:00.400
and I keep wondering whether
the role of the guides

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:07.160
and the guests and their owners,
is it their place to report it.

00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.460
&gt;&gt; Robert McIntosh:
Yeah, obviously.

00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:09.760
Obviously.

00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.080
And they all have
different motivations

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.000
and they all have
different sensitivities.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.350
Some, I think, are very strong
in terms of eliminating plastic

00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:23.880
in the waste stream and making
sure that their guests pick

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.180
up trash, and if they don't,
they pick up the trash.

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:27.480
&gt;&gt; Well, the toilets also, yeah.

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.780
&gt;&gt; Robert McIntosh: And
the toilets also, yeah.

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.590
I mean, we didn't get into
that topic, but that is one

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:32.310
of the biggest topics
at the lake

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:33.610
and in other high
tourist areas in Mongolia.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:34.910
The standard says
no open toilets,

00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:36.210
no outhouses, so to speak.

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:37.510
Making that transition
is expensive and because

00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:38.810
of the climate, the
technology is very challenging.

00:58:38.810 --> 00:58:40.110
So the ADB project that Clyde
mentioned is addressing that.

00:58:40.110 --> 00:58:41.410
How successful that first phase
of that is going to be is still,

00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:42.710
I think, the jury is out.

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:44.010
But the people around Lake
Hovsgol who live there,

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:45.310
the ADB recognizes that.

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:46.610
We certainly recognized
that in our study in 2013,

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:47.910
that some of the biggest
challenges the park was going

00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:49.210
to face were transportation
issues

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:51.510
and waste management issues.

00:58:52.750 --> 00:58:58.030
In the back.

00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:04.360
&gt;&gt; My question is besides
regulation, how [inaudible].

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.140
&gt;&gt; Robert McIntosh: I
think we're starting

00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:12.690
to see that evolve.

00:59:12.690 --> 00:59:18.790
There are nuggets of groups
that tourist providers

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:27.950
in Hatgal have created an
association to address some

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:36.850
of these issues, so I think
slowly but surely you'll see --

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:43.790
and in Hankh also,
slowly but surely see some

00:59:43.790 --> 00:59:50.550
of these issues being addressed
by local citizens and businesses

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:53.960
to sustain the economic
advantage that they have,

00:59:53.960 --> 01:00:02.490
because as Clyde pointed out
in a couple of his slides,

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:13.340
if it's a dump, people aren't
going to want to go there.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.510
Yes.

We can get into this.

01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:43.550
But in summary, I think
one of the problems

01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:47.270
in the tourist facility
development is

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:51.380
that there are multiple layers
of approval, and depending

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:54.220
on what way you read
this law versus that law,

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:57.620
it's somewhat confusing as
to who has the authority.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:02.620
But generally speaking,
the park,

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:04.930
the soon [phonetic]
governor, the aimag governor

01:02:04.930 --> 01:02:08.520
and the minister
approve a permit.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.840
But there's also sort
of a sideway exception

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.480
that the soon governor has
permission to grant permits

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:21.680
to local families for grazing,
and then those families set

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:28.200
up a couple of gers for a side
principal or secondary economy.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.500
I'm not sure.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:33.020
But because of that, and there's
no one point of authority,

01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:37.850
people are finding ways to drive
over it, around it and under it

01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:44.290
to get -- it's going to
take a strong recognition

01:02:44.290 --> 01:02:47.640
of the problem and a new
commitment, basically,

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:50.990
to start to try to
sort this out.

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:53.320
There's a new director
at Lake Hovsgol.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.400
He's been there almost
two years now.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.130
He's serious about addressing
this issue, but there are a lot

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:06.080
of factors that are forcing
him to compromise and try

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.790
to make things happen
in the right way,

01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:10.920
but at least it's starting.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.200
And I can tell you in the
history of the United States,

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:14.790
of the national parks
in the United States,

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:17.760
a hundred years ago we had
very similar type problems.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.560
So it's not like this
can't be corrected.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.040
[ Inaudible comment ]

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.340
On the which?

01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.040
[ Inaudible comment ]

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.520
I'm sure it exists.

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:28.820
We don't have it.

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:34.370
But I do know that there are
more incidences in recent times

01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:36.210
than there were historically,
and you can see

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:40.640
from the seven year or so
commercial boat operators

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.800
that are taking people
out on the lakes.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.260
And I've heard stories that, you
know, life jackets are required,

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.070
but they're homemade life
jackets that don't really work.

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:52.380
And, you know, if you fall
in a lake in Virginia,

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:54.760
the water's relatively
warm and you can survive.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.150
You fall into Lake Hovsgol,
the water temperature,

01:03:57.150 --> 01:04:00.970
even on the warmest day of
the year, is not warm enough

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.270
to allow you to survive.

01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:03.900
And if you're way out in
the middle of the lake

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.200
and help can't get
to you quickly,

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.500
that's not going
to be a good story.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.340
Thank you all very much.

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:16.140
&gt;&gt; Clyde Goulden:
Yeah, thank you.

01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:21.800
[ Applause ]

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.510
&gt;&gt; Susan Meinheit: My
name is Susan Meinheit

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:25.720
and I'm the Tibetan and
Mongolian specialist

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.520
in the Asian Division of
the Library of Congress.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:38.050
[ Background conversations ]

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:39.880
I'm going to do a
brief presentation

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.170
on the Mongolian collection
and then I will lead you

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:44.130
over to the display
I've prepared.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:46.080
So, please, take your seats.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:48.510
Bring your coffee.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:53.140
[ Background conversations ]

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:57.100
The Asian Division was
founded in 1928 and it's one

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:59.040
of the four area
studies divisions

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:00.960
of the Library of Congress.

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.430
We are a custodial division
for Asian language materials,

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:07.940
with over four million
volumes of monographs

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:11.510
in over 130 Asian languages.

01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:15.040
The Mongolian collection
currently consists

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:20.910
of about 11,000 monographs,
170 serial titles,

01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:26.310
almost 4,000 microfiche,
175 reels of microfilm,

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:30.880
and about 600 volumes
of rare books.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.250
The first Mongolian books came
to the Library of Congress

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:37.820
between 1893 and 1901 as gifts

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.720
from the American diplomat
William Woodville Rockhill,

01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:45.640
and the rare collection
now has about 600 volumes,

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.940
including complete
reprint editions

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.950
of the Mongolian
Kanjur and Tanjur.

01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:53.830
This is the first Mongolian
book to come to the Library

01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:58.540
of Congress, a gift from
William Rockhill in 1893.

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:02.200
It's a very beautiful
Mongolian edition of the Sutra

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.890
of the Great Liberation,
Tharpa Chenpo in Tibetan.

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:12.990
So in 1992 the Library began
a current acquisitions program

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:16.810
for Mongolian through the
New Delhi field office,

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:18.210
which continues today.

01:06:18.210 --> 01:06:21.090
We have a vendor in Ulaanbaatar

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:25.100
who ships books via the
U.S. Embassy every month

01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:26.680
to the Library.

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:30.560
We also acquire Mongolian
language material published

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:34.070
worldwide, including
China, Taiwan, Russia.

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:37.080
And we have a very small
collection of publications

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.970
in Kalmyk, Buryat, and
other related languages.

01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:51.890
So I've named today's display
Sutras and Silver Lakes,

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:56.820
Books and Scenes of Mongolia, in
honor of this conference topic.

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.260
The display focuses primarily
on Hovsgol Lake and Aimag.

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:12.770
The two glass cases include
several small sutras, sudars,

01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:16.380
about respecting nature,
surrounded by images of lakes

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:20.190
and mountains, the landscapes
to which they belong.

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:22.980
This part of the display will be
on view until the end of March

01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.280
in case you don't have
time to look at it today.

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:32.150
Included in the display
is a remote sensing map

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:36.730
of Hovsgol National Park
which was scanned to us

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:38.130
from originals found

01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:41.150
in the Library's
Geography and Map Division.

01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:43.850
Two other maps and the
[inaudible] of this one are also

01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:46.610
on the open display cases.

01:07:46.610 --> 01:07:49.500
And I thank our colleagues from
Geography and Map Division,

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:54.670
if they're here, for kindly
loaning these items for today.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:57.000
Geography and Map Division
has a very large collection

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:03.930
of Mongolian maps, which can
be searched online using search

01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:09.350
terms, Hovsgol maps or just
Mongolia maps, and you'll get

01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:11.900
about 150 different items.

01:08:15.310 --> 01:08:21.030
Next to the map there is a
1989 Russian atlas of the lake,

01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:25.480
atlas of Hovsgol Lake, also
from Geography and Map Division.

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:29.120
It features very colorful graphs
and charts documenting studies

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.970
of the lake made
between 1971 and 1986.

01:08:38.610 --> 01:08:40.780
The cases also feature
several small texts

01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:43.170
from our Mongolian
rare book collection.

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:46.480
These reflect Mongolians'
traditional deep respect

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:48.430
for the environment.

01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:50.750
Included is an interesting
19th century sudar

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:57.060
of Tsorj Lama Avgaandorj,
emphasizing the importance

01:08:57.060 --> 01:09:00.280
of respecting the spirit of
nature by praying to the sky,

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:03.970
earth, land and country.

01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:08.930
Other small sutras offer praise
to mountains, earth and sky.

01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:18.560
The countertop dismay features
a wide selection of books

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.740
on Hovsgol, its history,
culture, folk songs, legends,

01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:27.120
tourism, wildlife, wild flowers
and environmental issues.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:32.320
You can see the Library of
Congress catalogue search terms

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.750
which could be used for
information on these books,

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:37.660
and you can see we
spell in a variety

01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:41.140
of different [inaudible]
systems in the catalogue.

01:09:41.140 --> 01:09:46.270
And these are some of the
subject headings you can search

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:47.980
for further information.

01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:49.810
These are all established
Library

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:53.110
of Congress subject headings,
legends, Mongolia, Hovsgol,

01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:56.700
Aimag, Tales, Mongolia,
Darkhad, Mongolian people,

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.660
folklore, et cetera, et cetera.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:01.530
And if you're interested
in more information

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:04.630
on our Mongolian collection,
you can start by searching here.

01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:09.470
And these are also subject
headings that I used

01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:12.620
in preparing the display;
wildlife conservation,

01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:15.060
biodiversity conservation
Mongolia,

01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:17.130
ecosystem management Mongolia.

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:19.990
You can see we have a
very extensive collection.

01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:22.910
Reindeer herding, et cetera.

01:10:29.050 --> 01:10:32.410
The display also
features several books

01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:38.780
from the Library's Law
Library on Mongolian laws

01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:43.290
for environmental protection.

01:10:43.290 --> 01:10:47.000
They also can be searched
by the various Library

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.300
of Congress subject
headings here.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:59.200
And finally, the display
includes a few miscellaneous

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.380
books related to other
topics in the conference.

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:07.870
For example, the travel
book by Beatrix Bulstrode,

01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:11.420
and books on the history
of Mongolian television,

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:16.830
a book on Buryat poetry, for
our visitor from Buryatia.

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:19.880
And all of these
books are available

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.480
in the Asian Reading Room, which
is located across the Great Hall

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:26.820
from here, Jefferson LJ150.

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:30.100
We're open Monday
through Friday, 8:30 to 5.

This is our website.

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:38.120

I'll be happy to answer them,

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:41.590
and then if you could
finish your refreshments

01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:44.710
and we could go over and
take a look at the display.
