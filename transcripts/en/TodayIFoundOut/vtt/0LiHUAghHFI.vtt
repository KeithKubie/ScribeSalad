00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:11.710
The 
first high heel wearers are believed to have

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.469
been Persian horseback warriors sometime around
the ninth century.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.180
The extended heel was reportedly developed
specifically for riding, to keep the rider’s

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.290
foot from slipping out of the stirrups.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.660
It also helped to hold the rider steady when
standing up in the stirrups and shooting arrows.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.189
A group of Persian diplomats visited Europe
in 1599 to recruit allies to help Persia defeat

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.320
the Ottoman Empire.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.550
A craze for Persian culture developed as a
result and Persian-style high heeled shoes

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.300
were adopted enthusiastically by Western European
aristocrats.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.460
The shoes became a status symbol and the heels
were extended to make the men look even taller.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.080
(This is thought by many etymologists to be
where the term “well heeled”, meaning

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.730
“wealthy” originally came from.)

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.360
Just as the 1980s had notorious shoe collector
Imelda Marcos, the 1600s had a rabid shoe

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.230
collector and trend setter in Louis XIV of
France.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.509
While he was a powerful leader, his height
left something to be desired at five feet,

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.230
four inches tall (1.62 m), which was slightly
below average in his day.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.280
(The average height for men in France at the
time, in modern international units, was 5

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.660
ft. 5 inches or 1.65 m.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.660
Note: Contrary to popular belief, Napoleon
was not short; he was two inches taller than

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:17.660
the average in his day.)

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.210
A king being slightly shorter than average
wasn’t ideal for his ego, so Louis took

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.460
measures to make himself look taller, sporting
four inch heels, often decorated with elaborate

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.659
battle scenes.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.650
Eventually, he switched to having red heels
on all his shoes and decreed that only the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.760
upper echelons of society could have matching
red heels.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.630
It became a simple matter of looking at the
color of a man’s heels to see if he was

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.760
in the king’s inner circle.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.900
Not to be outdone, women of the 1600s started
wearing heels as a way of showing their equality.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.490
Elizabeth Semmelhack, curator of the Bata
Shoe Museum in Toronto and author of Heights

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.130
of Fashion, a History of the Elevated Shoe,
says the rage of that period in parts of Europe

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.310
was for women to dress and act like a man.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.310
(It should be noted, though, that at the time
men’s outfits by today’s standards were

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.310
extremely effeminate, a-la King Louis XIV’s
photo above.)

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.330
You had women cutting their hair, adding epaulettes
to their outfits.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.960
They would smoke pipes, they would wear hats
that were very masculine.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:23.689
And this is why women adopted the heel — it
was in an effort to masculinise their outfits.

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.969
As usually happens, high fashion is adapted
into more affordable versions and filters

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.889
down to the less fortunate.

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.409
The lower classes started to wear high heels.

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.219
The elite responded by making their heels
increasingly higher to maintain the distinction

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:42.989
of being upper class- the higher the heel,
the more expensive the shoe typically was.

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.159
They also began to differentiate heels into
two kinds- fat heels for men and skinny for

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:49.159
women.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.549
Eventually, men got away from the heel almost
completely to show their distinction from

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.549
women.

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.680
Since the late 18th century, men’s shoes
have had primarily low heels, except for cowboy

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.010
boots and some shoes worn by rock stars, who
occasionally have a propensity to wear effeminate

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.639
garb similar to before the “Great Male Renunciation”,
when men switched from wearing jewelry and

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.569
elaborate outfits with highly decorated cloth
to drab, darker colored simple clothing.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.260
Basically, when Western men on the whole stopped
trying to beautify themselves, starting at

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.859
the tail end of the 18th century.

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.090
For a time, women also drifted away from the
heel as it truly wasn’t practical, particularly

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.689
on old muddy or cobblestone style streets
where heels were nearly impossible to walk

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:28.689
in.

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:29.900
They weren’t gone long, though.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.379
The heel came back into fashion in the mid-19th
century with the advent of photography.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.950
Why?

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.120
As seems to happen often when new technologies
are introduced, pornographers are always among

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.090
the first to take advantage and they were
among the first to embrace photography.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.319
This pertains to high heels in that they often
dressed models for risqué post cards and

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.359
other photographs in nothing but a “modern”
(for that time) version of the high heel.

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.510
Since then, high heels have come in and out
of fashion repeatedly, except for in the porn

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.139
trade, where they’re seemingly a constant.

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.700
Lower heels were preferred during the late
1960s and early 70s.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.979
In the 1980s and 90s, high heels made a popular
comeback.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:11.439
Various styles of heels have taken their turn
on the runways as well, such as the block

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:33.420
heel of the 70s, the mule and the famous stiletto
that’s been popular in 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:05:23.350
the 50s, 80s, and today.
