etc for 2.5 hours per week we'll add on

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140
etc for 2.5 hours per week we'll add on

the low end of what we'd expect that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960
the low end of what we'd expect that
 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.740
the low end of what we'd expect that
means that you've gained 30,000 hours

means that you've gained 30,000 hours
 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.479
means that you've gained 30,000 hours
but not all of that is productive time

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
but not all of that is productive time
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.220
but not all of that is productive time
because you have to sleep accounting for
