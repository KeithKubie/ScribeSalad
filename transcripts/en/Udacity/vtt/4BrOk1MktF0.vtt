00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have another question about this protocol.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The way that I've described it here,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
does it actually provide authentication?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The possible answers are no, neither party is authenticated to the other one;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
yes, that it authenticates the client to the server but not the server to the client;

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
yes, it authenticates the server to the client but not the client to the server;

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or yes, it authenticates both parties to each other.
