00:00:00.295 --> 00:00:02.730
Yes, it's that time of year
again, and for Numberphiles

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.450
that means one thing--

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.720
Advent calendars.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.750
For each day of December, I'm
going to be adding a new video

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.660
link to each number
in the calendar.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.090
On December 1, number
1; December 2,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.610
number 2, and so on.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.610
It could be a Numberphile
video, old or new.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.290
It could be one of my other
videos from another channel or

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.745
from another YouTuber
altogether.

00:00:21.745 --> 00:00:24.000
But the one thing they'll have
in common, either in an

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.100
obvious or nonobvious
way, is an

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.000
association with the number.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.580
One of the videos is also going
to be an unlisted one

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.070
that you'll only be able to
watch through the Advent

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.590
calendar, because I'm a
bit sneaky like that.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.040
I know that annotations don't
work for some people, so there

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.910
are also links under
the video.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.470
So please, come back each day
of December, or whenever you

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.702
choose, and find out what
videos have been added.

00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:49.110
And also, it's not too late to
suggest one, if there's one

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.470
you think I should
be linking to.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.360
Well, if you're still here,
I'm going to tell you, you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.540
should also be following
Numberphile on Twitter or

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.480
Facebook, links below.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.370
All right, you've had
long enough now.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.350
If you haven't clicked on
something by now, you're never

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.050
going to click, so I'm
stopping the video.
