00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.550
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.420
OLIVER ROEDER: Hey.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.160
All right.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.230
Hi, Google.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.400
Thank you for having me.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.720
I'm Oliver Roeder.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.290
I'm a senior writer
at FiveThirtyEight,

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.590
and I am also FiveThirtyEight's
puzzle editor.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.630
And I have a book out, which is
our first ever FiveThirtyEight

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.240
book, which is a collection
of my puzzle called

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.300
"The Riddler", subtitle
"Fantastic Puzzles"

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.450
from FiveThirtyEight.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.550
So today I just kind
of want to talk to you

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.460
about what "The Riddler" is
and what FiveThirtyEight is,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.250
and what I do.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.490
But I also want to
involve the audience.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.170
So there will be some
participatory puzzles

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.890
toward the end, and prizes,
and people will come on stage,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.540
and it'll be very exciting.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.189
So if this were a
normal book talk,

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.230
it would be very easy for
me because I could just

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.300
read from my book and I
wouldn't have to do anything.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.580
This is not a normal book.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.840
It's a puzzle book.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.940
But I do want to read
you about two paragraphs

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.856
from the introduction
just to kind of give you

00:01:07.856 --> 00:01:09.610
a sense of what
this is all about.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.200
And I think if you like
what I say, you can buy one

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.550
and I'll be happy to
sign it afterwards.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.460
So let me drink
some water first.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.690
How about that Amazon, huh?

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.670
I expected a lot more
scooters and stuff.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.970
"In 1865, the British Museum
received a brittle and breaking

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.920
scroll of papyrus.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.900
The document was
discovered in Egypt

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.430
in the ruins of the Mortuary
Temple of Pharaoh Ramses II.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.740
It was well over 3,000
years old and worse

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.610
for the wear,
pictured on the left.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.800
At the museum, curators
carefully unrolled

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.650
its two sides and placed
them in two glass frames.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.710
One side had a jagged gash and
the other had a blank section

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.540
about 10 feet long.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.940
Yet despite its rough
condition, much of the document

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.330
could still be painstakingly
deciphered and translated,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.850
and it became known
as the Rhind Papyrus

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.550
after the antiquarian
who had purchased it.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.150
Its text begins, quote, 'The
entrance into the knowledge

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.829
of all existing things
and all obscure secrets.'

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.870
What followed turned out
to be the world's oldest

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.420
collection of math puzzles.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.430
The problems posed
in the Rhind Papyrus

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.050
won't present much of a
challenge to the modern reader,

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.110
especially for those of
you holding this book,

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.140
or holding this book
after you purchase it.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.430
One of its problems, for
example, reads, quote,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.720
'Find the volume of a
cylindrical granary of diameter

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.740
nine and height 10.'

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.240
Another, 'Sum the geometrical
progression of five terms

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.780
of which the first term is
seven and the multiplier seven.'

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.360
But now these puzzles
serve a grander purpose.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.570
The 84 problems and solutions
recorded on the Papyrus

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.640
provide some of the
clearest insights

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.270
into the numerical methods of
the ancient Egyptians, some

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.120
of the world's earliest
mathematicians."

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.180
So this is a very long
tradition into which

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.540
FiveThirtyEight and The Riddler
puzzle column is entering,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.670
and that's what I want
to talk about today.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.400
So one sort of
hurdle that we want

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.070
to get people to jump
over with The Riddler

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.457
is this idea that I'm
not good at math, right?

00:03:31.457 --> 00:03:33.290
The truth is, I'm not
all that good at math.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.250
And many people say this,
including my boss, Nate Silver,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.740
the founder and editor in
chief of FiveThirtyEight,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.790
who says that in the
foreword to this very book.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.780
So one way to do this, I think,
is with engaging math puzzles,

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.210
puzzles that tell
stories, puzzles

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.630
that have many different
angles of attack,

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.800
and puzzles that don't echo
the things that you didn't like

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.760
about math class in school.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.190
But this is a very
self-selected kind

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.360
of audience, extreme
selection bias.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.800
I gave this talk once before.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.412
And I remember it
going really well,

00:04:11.412 --> 00:04:13.370
but there is a key
difference between that time

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.703
and this time, and it's that
time, people were drinking.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:23.540
So it already feels different.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.870
So lots and lots of people
have tried to do this.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.174
I keep thinking there's
going to be a screen here.

00:04:30.174 --> 00:04:32.090
Lots and lots of people
have tried to do this.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.800
We're very far from the first.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.740
And like I said, this has
been a long, long tradition,

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.020
of which we are just
the most recent entrant.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.740
And chief among these
people, in my mind,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.470
is Martin Gardner, who I imagine
many of you have heard of.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.960
So for, what is
it, 30 or so years,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.010
he wrote a monthly column
in "Scientific American"

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.760
called Mathematical
Games every month.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.929
And it became so popular
and was such a driver

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:09.470
of sales and subscriptions of
"Scientific American" that they

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.780
moved it right to the
front of the magazine

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.280
so that people
didn't waste any time

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.920
and they could get right to it.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.055
In fairness to myself,
my column is weekly.

00:05:19.055 --> 00:05:20.555
Martin Gardner's
column was monthly.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.990
And Gardner's columns
were collected--

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.072
it took me, like, 90
minutes to figure out

00:05:29.072 --> 00:05:30.030
how to make it do this.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.140
So please appreciate that--

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.100
were collected into many,
many, many, many books, many

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.100
not pictured on
this slide, which

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.750
may be in the back of
the mind of my publisher.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.290
But so far, my output is
significantly smaller,

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.080
and this is my first book.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.090
So what Gardner said,
"One of the pleasures

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.160
of writing the column
was that it introduced me

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.820
to so many top mathematicians,
which of course I was not.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.120
Their contributions to my column
were far superior to anything

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.180
I could write and were a major
reason for the column's growing

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.530
popularity."

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.240
I feel exactly the same
way, except rather than

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.480
top mathematicians, it's
FiveThirtyEight readers.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.710
So The Riddler column
is a very participatory,

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.730
collaborative endeavor.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.670
I'm called the puzzle
editor for a reason.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.410
I don't write most
of the puzzles.

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.800
I get ideas from
our very numerate

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.230
and generous and
bright readership

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:37.920
that I mold into something
that we can publish.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.960
And I go back and
forth with readers

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.090
about puzzles and
solutions, and I'm

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.260
merely the sort of
conduit of this funnel,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.960
to mix my metaphors.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.020
And it's really a
reader-driven enterprise.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.310
So I'm harping on
Martin Gardner,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:00.480
but I think it's
really illustrative.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.930
Martin Gardner introduced,
via his math column,

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.730
many things to the broader
world which are now, I think,

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.810
extremely familiar.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.902
Probably most of you have heard
or seen most of these things,

00:07:13.902 --> 00:07:15.360
and they're not
even really thought

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.550
of as something that would
come from a math column

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.320
right there in sort of a
broader cultural category now.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.800
And that's what we hope
that The Riddler will do,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.360
is introduce people
to ideas that

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.260
become very familiar to them
and are not sort of locked away

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.320
in a math book or math
class or something.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.830
So I'll go very briefly
through what is--

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.160
how many people are familiar
with FiveThirtyEight?

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.440
Wow, literally everyone?

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.930
Well, I'll do this very quickly.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.910
We used to be known for filling
in maps with different colors.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:59.040
And now we're known
for all kinds of stuff.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.930
As I was talking to
a gentleman before,

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:06.010
I'm currently on world chess
championship coverage duty

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.390
and scheduled this
talk for today

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:10.450
because it's an off day in
the world chess championship.

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:15.010
So we're really kind of
taking this empirical world

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:20.170
view to everything-- culture,
sports, economics, science,

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:26.410
and of course, politics,
which I think we're

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.910
happy the election is over.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.990
But our chart is a
little sad this week.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.520
So you guys like technology
and all that kind of stuff.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.179
So let me just talk
a little very quickly

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.330
about the logistics.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:46.860
How does this column
come together every week?

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.980
So you guys have email here?

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.140
Yeah, I have email.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:57.030
Well, that's not my fault.
That's my employer's fault.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.640
So I have email, and my
very own email account.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.812
And every-- see, when
people are drunk,

00:09:02.812 --> 00:09:04.020
that got a much bigger laugh.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.510
So readers will send
me all kinds of stuff,

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.140
germs of puzzle ideas, fully
fledged puzzles, something

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.870
that they noticed
in their daily life.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:21.090
The puzzle-- I think it was last
week someone, their landline

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.550
and their cell phone had
the exact same digits, just

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.290
an anagram of the digits.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.970
And the guy emailed
me just saying,

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:28.630
I noticed this in real life.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.820
So we made it a math puzzle.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.970
What are the odds that
one of my phone numbers

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.470
is an anagram of digits
of another one of my phone

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:35.970
numbers?

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.670
So these come in.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.510
I pick one, I mold
it, I write it up,

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.760
I send that to my editors.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.100
We publish it on
FiveThirtyEight.

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:52.140
And then readers will go email
me answers, tweet me answers.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:55.309
See, that's a Google
product, Google form.

00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:56.100
All kinds of stuff.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.410
I funnel this into another
document, it gets edited,

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.970
and we put up the solution.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.670
So this is kind of
the lifespan of a math

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.259
puzzle at FiveThirtyEight.

00:10:10.259 --> 00:10:12.050
Oh, and then they take
all that and turn it

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.341
into a book, which you can buy.

00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:17.330
I think it's actually
cheaper up there.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:20.660
So all of this
collaboration has given rise

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:26.480
to Riddler Nation,
which is the name

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:30.105
of our collective sort of
universe of readers and fans.

00:10:30.105 --> 00:10:31.730
And so not only on
FiveThirtyEight.com,

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:39.170
but on people's blogs and
GitHubs and other websites,

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.980
people post their ideas,
their solutions, extensions

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:44.390
to the problems.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:49.040
And it sort of created
sort of an ecosystem kind

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.060
of that exists online
around the puzzle itself,

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:57.180
which is very exciting for me.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:59.760
So I showed you a slide
earlier of what Gardner

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.300
has introduced to the world.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.660
And these are some
of the things much,

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.450
much less popular than
Gardner's, but that The Riddler

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.150
has kind of started to
introduce into the world.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.370
And I should note
very prominently

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.940
that almost all of these are
reader-created images that

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:23.390
resulted from a puzzle
that we published.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:28.650
So for example, Planetary
Guardians was a puzzle.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.940
Two aliens land on the
surface of a planet, each

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.760
with a piece of a bomb that
will destroy that planet,

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.860
as aliens do.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.450
And there is a
guardian who needs

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.570
to stop them from getting
together and assembling that.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.510
And the question
was, at what speed

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.250
relative to the
speed of the aliens

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.260
does the guardian
need to go to ensure

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.130
he saves the planet x percent
of the time, whatever?

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.877
And it turns out to be
very, very difficult.

00:11:54.877 --> 00:11:56.460
But that's kind of
what it looks like,

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.160
and that's how that reader
chose to approach the problem.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.350
Let's see.

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:08.610
Oh, Picky Eating is imagine
that you were an eater so picky,

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.560
and you hated the
crust of your bread

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.750
so much, that you would
only eat those portions

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.050
of the sandwich closer to
the center than to the crust.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:18.750
And how much of the
sandwich would you eat?

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.770
And it sounds pretty easy.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.610
It's actually a little
bit tricky geometrically.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.010
And that just shows
as your sandwich--

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:30.960
I mean, triangular sandwich,
hexagonal sandwich, et cetera,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:35.400
and sort of the asymptotic
behavior of your eating.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:40.750
And the Pringle of Probability
we'll come back to later.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.640
Laser Larry was about a guy
named Laser Larry attacking

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.540
Riddler headquarters.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.260
And there's tons and
tons of examples.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.380
These just look cool.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.110
We have puzzles
about baking cakes,

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.290
about making tables
efficiently from various sizes

00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:02.760
of rectangular wood,
and a dodge-ball duel,

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.380
except with three people.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.600
So I'm going to walk you through
just one more example quickly

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.390
of kind of what all
this looks like.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.160
And I honestly
don't remember what

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.790
comes after that in
this presentation.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.200
So we'll find out together.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.280
So we posed this puzzle
about a martini glass.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.050
And you've drunk
enough of your martini

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:28.040
such that the drink reached a
certain fraction up the side.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.690
You tilted it so
it was just barely

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.610
to the point of spilling.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:34.700
How far up the other
side does it reach?

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:37.480
And I won't walk through
all the math right now.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.870
You should try it when
you get back to your desk

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.891
because I'm sure you don't
anything better to do.

00:13:42.891 --> 00:13:45.140
But this is kind of what my
Twitter looks like the day

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.400
after we publish something.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.420
So we have the very math-y
folks, the theoretical folks,

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.640
we have the empirical folks.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:58.200
And we have the people
who just say, screw math.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.660
And this is really,
really fun to see

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.520
different kind of approaches,
both serious and not.

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:07.070
And then I cull
all that together,

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.020
and this is literally
what we publish.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.140
This is what the column
looked like the next week.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:14.750
So we pick out some
diagrams, typeset some math,

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.460
write some words, and so on.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:17.960
OK.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:24.170
This one is something that came
to us from one of our readers

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:28.800
who was a NASA scientist.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.520
And you can talk to
your partner or your row

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.950
or your neighbor,
whatever you call it.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.440
But talk amongst yourselves
for a couple minutes.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.160
So what's going on here is
you have this menu of items,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.370
and you are a space agency.

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:51.710
And your goal is to arrive
an alien artifact first.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.900
And you have a budget,
which is $1 billion,

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:58.580
and there are various things
that you can buy, and fuel,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:00.170
as listed here.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.410
But there's only a certain
amount of them in the world.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.760
So why don't we take, like,
two minutes or three minutes,

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.820
however long it takes, and
then we can kind of discuss.

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:12.830
And whoever gets
there first, I will

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.600
buy them a book at the end.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.770
How about that?

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:16.730
That's exactly right.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:17.750
So there's one way.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.640
This is the fastest
you can get there.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.325
But if you hoard the
world's xenon, as one does--

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.820
so very, very good.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.670
Team effort.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.990
I love it.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:35.490
I'm going to give a good report
to your managers when I leave.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.530
Very good.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.466
So this took me even longer
than the other thing.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.010
OK.

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.630
I'm going too fast.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.685
There's going to be two
participatory Riddlers

00:15:50.685 --> 00:15:52.810
that I think will be less
painful than the one that

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:54.790
preceded them.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.490
There will be one puzzle
that will have two winners.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:00.942
Those two winners
will join me on stage.

00:16:00.942 --> 00:16:02.650
From those two, there
will be one winner,

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:06.970
and that winner will get a
prize, which will be my book,

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:09.650
and I will sign it for you.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.730
I'll buy it for you, and
then sign it for you.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:14.270
OK.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:19.730
So this was a
Riddler last summer.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:26.690
And what you are going to do
is pick a positive integer.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.520
The person who
submits the lowest

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:34.340
integer which no one else has
chosen will be one winner.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.050
And then, since we
need two, the person

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:41.300
who picks the second lowest
integer that no one has chosen.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.830
Does that make
sense to everyone?

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:44.600
I'm sure it does.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.880
So you can take out your
cellular telephone and navigate

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.920
to tiny.cc/smallnumber.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.750
There should be a
Google form with which

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.370
I'm sure you're very familiar.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:17:01.580
And please put your
name or something

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.740
to identify you, your
nickname, and your number.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:12.670
And if you don't have a phone,
I don't know what to tell you.

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.170
All right.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.270
Moment of truth.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.960
I guess we need to sort it.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.004
How do we do that?

00:17:20.004 --> 00:17:22.371
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:22.371 --> 00:17:23.079
OLIVER ROEDER: 2.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:27.450
Dave.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:28.459
Where are you, Dave?

00:17:28.459 --> 00:17:29.250
AUDIENCE: I'm here.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.291
OLIVER ROEDER: All right.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.050
Congratulations.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.960
Congratulations.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.390
And I think there
were no 5's, but there

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.180
is a unique 7, which is Adam.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.480
Adam, come on up.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.020
OK.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.610
Well-chosen.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:55.930
Yes, I will scroll down.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.375
Brad B, class clown.

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:11.410
I'm happy to share this later.

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.370
OK.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:20.790
So the original post
was July 28, 2017.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.150
So if you look at the week
after that, you can find it.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.800
OK.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.430
OK, OK, OK.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.070
So this is where you
two now find yourselves.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:38.390
You are contestants on a hot new
game show called Highest Number

00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.980
Wins.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:42.310
So you're really going to change
your mindset from low number

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.122
to high number.

00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:45.580
So what's going to
happen is you'll

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.380
each go into a secret
booth, not pictured.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:55.130
And you're going to receive a
random number, not an integer

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.840
this time, but a random
number between 0 and 1.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.850
And your decision will
be to keep that number

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.800
or to ditch it,
in which case you

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.140
will get a second random
number, independently

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.450
random number between
0 and 1, in which case

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.470
you have to keep it.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.110
So you have one opportunity to
kick it out and get a new one,

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:16.420
or you can keep the first one.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.860
And whoever of you
has the higher number

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.810
at the end will win
the grand prize.

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:25.880
Does that make sense?

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.360
So we're going to have to do
some sort of jerry rigging

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.610
of the secret booth
since there are so

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.180
many screens around here.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:36.664
So do you have a
preference who goes first?

00:19:36.664 --> 00:19:38.080
I guess you had
the lowest number.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:39.621
Would you like to
go first or second?

00:19:39.621 --> 00:19:42.430
AUDIENCE: I'll go first.

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:45.220
OLIVER ROEDER: So I
guess you will have

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:50.590
to maybe look at the curtain.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.690
This is an honor
system thing here.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.320
OK.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.010
And audience, please keep your
jubilant--your reactions have

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:01.779
been so jubilant thus far,
I'm a little bit worried about

00:20:01.779 --> 00:20:03.320
what's going to
happen So please no--

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:11.470
my two least favorite things
are speaking in public

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:15.310
and operating my computer
while people are watching me.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.110
So this is--

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.210
I think this will work.

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.350
Can people see this?

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:23.050
Yeah?

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.270
OK.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.970
All right.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.770
So you understand
what's about to happen.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.040
AUDIENCE: I think I do.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.248
OLIVER ROEDER: So you're
going to get a random number

00:20:30.248 --> 00:20:31.291
between 0 and 1.

00:20:31.291 --> 00:20:33.790
You're going to decide whether
you want to keep that number,

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.692
and that will be
your number forever,

00:20:35.692 --> 00:20:37.900
or if you want to throw it
away and get a second one.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.630
If you get a second
one, you must keep it.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:44.230
So since we don't actually
have soundproof booths,

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:49.880
how about if you like your first
number, give me the thumbs up.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.670
That means you keep it.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.764
If you don't like it,
give me the thumbs down

00:20:54.764 --> 00:20:55.930
and I'll give you a new one.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.849
So if you like your number,
if you don't like your number.

00:20:58.849 --> 00:20:59.390
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:59.390 --> 00:20:59.780
OLIVER ROEDER: OK?

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:00.321
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:21:00.321 --> 00:21:01.180
I can do that.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:02.191
OLIVER ROEDER: OK.

00:21:02.191 --> 00:21:02.690
Here we go.

00:21:06.663 --> 00:21:07.163
OK.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:14.550
You're going to remember--

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.050
I remembered what it is.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:16.980
OK, sorry.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:17.850
Ignore that, please.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.480
Ignore that.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.060
I just wanted to go back.

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:21.880
All right.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.020
You have your number?

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:24.520
Everybody knows
what the number is.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.810
OK.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:29.760
Second player, you
can-- and I guess

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.400
you can look now that
you're locked in.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.290
Are you ready?

00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:40.123
AUDIENCE: I'm ready.

00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:49.060
I'd like another one.

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:49.830
OLIVER ROEDER: OK.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:51.590
The moment of truth.

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.380
You can reveal your number
now since all decisions

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.380
have been made.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.640
AUDIENCE: .69 Pretty good.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.470
OLIVER ROEDER: .69.

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.365
Very, very well put, yeah.

00:22:03.365 --> 00:22:05.240
AUDIENCE: What was the
one that you rejected?

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.620
Or was that your first?

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.969
AUDIENCE: It was
.2 something, or--

00:22:08.969 --> 00:22:10.010
OLIVER ROEDER: All right.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.610
Ready?

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.050
AUDIENCE: .2 is terrible.

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:13.901
Is it-- no.

00:22:13.901 --> 00:22:18.140
AUDIENCE: .02

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.560
OLIVER ROEDER: Oh.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.204
Bravo.

00:22:21.204 --> 00:22:21.870
Congratulations.

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.340
AUDIENCE: I never
win games of skill.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:26.770
OLIVER ROEDER: OK.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.720
You're welcome to stay there
or go back to your seats.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.700
It's almost over.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.450
Oh, yes.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:35.850
Thank you.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:43.510
OLIVER ROEDER: So this was
a problem on The Riddler,

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:46.180
and a ton of people played.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:50.060
And the winning--
did I say what the--

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:54.190
and we had random
matchups of people.

00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:58.180
But there's some math, some
real math behind this, some game

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.340
theoretic math.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.070
Obviously, assumptions about the
players' payoffs and so forth.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:09.610
But this is kind of
what the solution

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:13.270
to a problem like this we would
publish on FiveThirtyEight.

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.930
So even if you don't think
through the game theory,

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:20.177
you can still submit, and
it can be interesting,

00:23:20.177 --> 00:23:21.760
and then there's
kind of another layer

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.330
of what is a sort of theoretical
solution to this problem.

00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:28.510
And one way to think
about it is that you

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.850
have a cutoff value,
which I'm sure both of you

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.120
kind of had in the back
of your mind as something

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.190
higher than which
I'm going to keep

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.550
and lower than which
I'm going to reject.

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:41.770
And a key to
solving this problem

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:44.420
is to recognize, well, if I get
exactly that cutoff number, I'm

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.650
indifferent between
accepting and rejecting,

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.090
and the math kind
of flows from there.

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:52.810
So the probability that
you win if you keep C

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:56.470
must be equal to the probability
that you win if you ditch C.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.970
And you can just
do some algebra.

00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:02.670
You get a pretty simple
quadratic, which you can solve.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.820
And does anybody recognize
what game theoretically optimal

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.426
cutoff, what that number is?

00:24:09.426 --> 00:24:10.529
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:10.529 --> 00:24:12.820
OLIVER ROEDER: Yeah, the
Golden Ratio, the Golden Ratio

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.580
conjugate, what
Golden Ratio minus 1.

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.290
So that's pretty cool.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:26.080
And this problem can be solved
visually from both players

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.790
in three dimensions using
the Pringle of Probability.

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:31.920
And that's that.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.480
So I'm really happy to
take questions or talk

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.310
about anything else.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.770
And I'm happy to stick around
and talk after and sign

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.480
books and all that stuff, too.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.270
So thank you.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:48.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:49.360
Yes.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.919
AUDIENCE: Who's going to win
the world chess championship?

00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:53.710
OLIVER ROEDER: That's
a very good question.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:59.350
I would say-- well, Carlsen
is the heavy favorite.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.060
The question is how heavy.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:07.094
And I would say Caruana, like
plus 500, something like that

00:25:07.094 --> 00:25:08.010
if you could get that.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.250
I don't know, because
if it remains drawn,

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.130
Carlsen's much stronger
rapid and blitz player.

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:17.110
So I would still take Carlsen.

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:20.980
I don't know what the money
line is on him, though.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:21.980
There's been four games.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:22.938
They've all been drawn.

00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:23.740
So it's very tense.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:24.479
Yes, sir.

00:25:24.479 --> 00:25:26.770
AUDIENCE: How do you recommend
improving your intuition

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:29.380
around some math
problem like this?

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.777
How ca we learn?

00:25:30.777 --> 00:25:32.360
OLIVER ROEDER: That's
a good question.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:37.270
I mean, my stock answer is
just like do The Riddler a lot.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:45.400
So in the book, for example--

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.200
I don't have a great
answer for you.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.840
But in the book, I've tried
to organize the problems

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.580
from easy to hard.

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.150
And in the column we
have two versions.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:56.980
One is called Riddler
Express and one

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.870
is called Riddler Classic.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.870
And oftentimes
the Express puzzle

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:04.960
will be a simplified version
of the Classic puzzle.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.010
So ideally, if we
do our job right,

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:10.030
there'll be pieces
of the intuition

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:12.820
from the more complicated
puzzle kind of embedded

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.810
within the simple puzzle.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.350
But yeah, I think just exposure.

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.976
Like for example,
crossword puzzles.

00:26:22.976 --> 00:26:24.850
The only way to get good
at crossword puzzles

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.230
is to do crossword puzzles.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.700
There's no other way.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.810
Or like language
immersion or whatever.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:32.950
I don't know.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.380
That's a very unsatisfactory
answer, I know.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.030
But do math puzzles.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.740
I don't know.

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.440
Martin Gardner books.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:42.940
Yeah.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.356
AUDIENCE: How do you feel like
the style with which you've

00:26:45.356 --> 00:26:48.120
presented and explained these
puzzles has changed over time?

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:51.010
Do feel like you've
used like more

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.100
or less technical language, or
just generally style changes?

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.100
OLIVER ROEDER: That's a
really interesting question,

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.110
which I haven't thought
about until right now.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:02.200
I would guess that
the language has

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.440
gotten less technical
for a couple of reasons.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:11.950
One is since we have a big
readership that often publishes

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.450
on their own
websites about this,

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:17.910
I've been able to outsource
a little bit of that.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.520
So I could say, well, for
this derivation of this part,

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.950
you can see this guy's
excellent, or girl's excellent,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:27.130
woman's excellent solution.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.370
And so I am able
to outsource a bit.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:33.880
Second is just I think we've
kind of found our cadence,

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:40.630
and just we use a lot less
LaTeX math typesetting nowadays.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:43.435
Have you noticed a trend
one way or the other?

00:27:43.435 --> 00:27:44.560
AUDIENCE: I haven't really.

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.440
I've noticed generally, I guess,
some technical publications

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.317
obviously getting more or
less technical over time.

00:27:50.317 --> 00:27:52.150
OLIVER ROEDER: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:54.780
Thank you.

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.410
Yes, sir.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.620
AUDIENCE: What is the
most unintuitive solution

00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.810
to a problem you've seen?

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:02.340
OLIVER ROEDER: The
most unintuitive.

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:12.300
So I think I have an answer
to that, which has to do--

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.060
so it has to do with
this Lonesome King puzzle

00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:24.020
on the bottom right there.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.490
So what this puzzle
is, is it goes

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.100
by another name, which
is rather dark, which

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:33.050
is Group Russian Roulette.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:37.350
So these are a bunch of people.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:40.270
A dot is a person,
and they randomly

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:44.530
shoot at another person
in a huge circle.

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:46.870
And if you get shot, you die.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:50.290
And the question is
what are the chances

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:53.290
that there is a single
person left at the end,

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.690
as opposed to 0 people?

00:28:55.690 --> 00:29:00.280
And this is incredibly,
incredibly hard.

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:06.320
And the answer is about
50%, but not exactly 50%.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.680
And it doesn't
approach 50%, either.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.620
It oscillates depending on
the initial size of the crowd.

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.320
So if there's,
like, 10,000 people

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.480
or 20,000 people
or 30,000 people,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.760
it's very, very strange.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.080
And there's actually
an academic math paper

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.080
about this that basically says
this is really, really weird.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.110
So that's one example.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.000
AUDIENCE: What's the
most surprising field

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.130
of math someone has
used in a solution

00:29:36.130 --> 00:29:37.660
that you really enjoyed?

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:39.535
OLIVER ROEDER: Most
surprising field of math.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.185
That is a good question.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.430
So I would say
just as background,

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:57.090
tons of like combinatorics
are happening.

00:29:57.090 --> 00:30:01.920
Lots of simulation Monte
Carlo stuff gets used.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.060
Probability.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:08.580
We haven't had much or
like topology type stuff.

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:11.550
People submit in very
interesting programming

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:12.900
languages sometimes.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.890
It's a really good question.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.470
I don't have a great answer.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:28.100
But the media that people use
from cocktail napkins to Python

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.080
and everything in between is
always really heartening for me

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:31.761
to see.

00:30:31.761 --> 00:30:32.760
Let me think about that.

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:35.280
If you're still around,
I'll let you know.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.130
What percentage of people
misunderstand the question

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:40.506
or get the question
wrong or both?

00:30:40.506 --> 00:30:42.000
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah, both.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.660
OLIVER ROEDER: It is
extremely high variance.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.960
So there's extremely high
variance, in first of all,

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.960
the number of people
who submit answers.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:57.930
So I would say the average is
on the order of a few thousand.

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:01.440
But I would say the variance
is on the order of, like, 1,000

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.230
or something.

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:05.970
And there's a
selection issue, which

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:08.190
is you're more likely to
submit an answer if you

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.710
think your answer is right,
I think, generally speaking.

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:18.100
If I had to guess, I would say
60% to 70% correct on average.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.020
But there's a huge
band around that.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:26.140
The Riddler Classic,
which is the harder one,

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.140
last week we got three
answers submitted,

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.020
which was the fewest
we've ever gotten.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.810
It was just-- see,
and now I keep

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.060
remembering that this is
going to be tweeted to, like,

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:39.310
15 million people or whatever.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.520
So it was very
hard and involved.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.700
And so I think that's why,
not that it was difficult,

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:48.590
necessarily.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:49.447
Hi.

00:31:49.447 --> 00:31:50.280
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.250
OLIVER ROEDER: No, please.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:53.375
AUDIENCE: Does Nate Silver
give performance reviews

00:31:53.375 --> 00:31:55.044
with a Band of Uncertainty?

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:02.815
OLIVER ROEDER: Again, see- no.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:11.440
No.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.250
We are subject to certain
corporate policies of the Walt

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:21.280
Disney Corporation,
and they govern that.

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:27.690
Well, it's like 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, plus or minus 0.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.700
But I will suggest that to him.

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:37.510
Or give bonuses with
a Band of Uncertainty.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.650
Roll the dice.

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:40.480
Yeah.

00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:44.850
Or we could just do Wolfram
Alpha and click the button.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:46.680
AUDIENCE: Does your
interest in politics

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.390
extend to other
kinds of puzzles?

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.210
You mentioned
crosswords earlier.

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:52.560
OLIVER ROEDER: Yes.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:56.280
Crosswords are a
big hobby of mine.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.295
So I competed a couple of
times in the American Crossword

00:33:00.295 --> 00:33:01.920
Puzzle Tournament,
which is like the de

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.650
facto national championship.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:08.280
And one of my claims
to journalistic fame

00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:12.780
was I broke a crossword
plagiarism scandal

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.870
and got the crossword
editor of the "USA

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:20.730
Today" removed from his duties.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.720
This was, I guess, a victory
for FiveThirtyEight data

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:29.290
journalism, and it's a
relatively interesting story.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:34.980
So a computer programmer
web scraped 50,000 something

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.950
crossword puzzles from
all different outlets

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:41.400
and put them into this
format that he had created.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.950
And one thing you could
do with this database

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.600
is match two pairs
of puzzles, basically

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:48.590
like a similarity score.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:53.950
And these two puzzles
have 3% match or 5% match

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:55.900
or 0% match, whatever.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:34:00.960
And what we found was that all
of the puzzles that matched

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.090
came from two outlets.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:06.420
One was "USA Today" and
one was a syndicated puzzle

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.800
called Universal--

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:11.010
and it used to be
called Universal Press

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.550
Syndicate or something.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.030
And they were both
edited by the same guy.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:19.730
So this really crazy fact
dropped out of this data set.

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.960
So that happened, and
then we paired that

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.520
with traditional reporting.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.239
So I went to the library
and pulled the microfilm

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:30.150
to make sure this was actually
the puzzle in the paper

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:32.489
that day for a bunch of them.

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:36.389
Sorry, this is probably not what
you wanted me to talk about.

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:39.100
But this is the question
answerer's prerogative.

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.650
You can ask whatever you want.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.650
I can answer whatever I want.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:46.610
And he took the
microphones away.

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:50.219
Yeah, so and then we obviously
called this guy for comment

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:53.612
and talked to people
in the crossword world

00:34:53.612 --> 00:34:54.570
and that kind of stuff.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:55.830
So I love crossword puzzles.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:35:00.150
I'm good, not great
at solving them.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.280
Other puzzles.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.920
I can't do, what's
it called, Sudoku.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.785
I can't.

00:35:06.785 --> 00:35:08.160
I don't know what
it is about me.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:11.400
I just-- not can't
like I hate them.

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.200
Like I don't know
how to solve them.

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:14.920
KenKen, too.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.920
I don't know what it is.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.790
Maybe I just haven't
devoted enough time.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.950
But what about you?

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.330
AUDIENCE: I'm a big fan
of crossword puzzles.

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:23.746
OLIVER ROEDER:
Have you ever tried

00:35:23.746 --> 00:35:27.600
to create a crossword puzzle,
construct a crossword puzzle?

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.670
I haven't made one yet.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:30.431
But you saw that
article, "New York Times"

00:35:30.431 --> 00:35:32.680
did a series on how to make
your own crossword puzzle?

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.804
OLIVER ROEDER: I did, yeah.

00:35:33.804 --> 00:35:35.657
AUDIENCE: So that's
got me thinking.

00:35:35.657 --> 00:35:37.240
OLIVER ROEDER: I've
tried to make one,

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:39.710
and I found it
extremely difficult.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:43.280
I heard there's an internal
Google crossword puzzle.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:44.670
Is that true?

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.334
AUDIENCE: I haven't
heard of one.

00:35:46.334 --> 00:35:47.278
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:48.700
OLIVER ROEDER: OK.

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.310
That's cool.

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:55.480
I'm not as familiar with
cryptics, but I like them.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.380
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.421
OLIVER ROEDER: Thank you.

00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:59.430
Sorry, was there something else?

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:00.970
AUDIENCE: I was just curious.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:03.430
You know, I do various types
of puzzles, and some of them

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:05.772
are just find the
lateral thinking that

00:36:05.772 --> 00:36:06.730
gets you to the answer.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:07.980
And these are very different.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.567
And I was wondering,
first of all,

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.650
whether the same kind of
person is attracted both,

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:14.170
and also whether you
find that it tickles

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.420
the same part of your brain,
or if it's something very

00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:18.211
different for you, or
if one type of puzzle

00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:19.780
draws you to another
type of puzzle.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.488
OLIVER ROEDER: Crosswords
and The Riddler

00:36:21.488 --> 00:36:24.810
is my puzzle diet, yeah.

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:26.520
OK.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.430
Thank you, everyone, so
much for spending your lunch

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:30.820
hour with me.

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.860
I really appreciate it.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.660
And yeah, I'll be back there.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.650
So thank you.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.500
[APPLAUSE]
