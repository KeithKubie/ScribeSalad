00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:04.379
[music playing]

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.840
Bladesmiths, welcome
back to the forge.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.842
You've had five days
at your home forges

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:11.511
to work on your jumonji yaris.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.346
Fuad, how did it go?

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:15.765
Oh, it went really well.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.184
Everything went
according to plan.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:21.855
I used a lot of two-part
components in my construction,

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.733
and I'm very happy with
the overall result.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.693
Jacob, how did it go for you?

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:28.403
It went pretty good.

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.822
I ran into several
complications,

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:33.616
but overall I think
it went pretty well.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.326
All right, gentlemen.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:36.911
Now it's time to see how they
hold up in our weapons test.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.122
Up first, the kill test.

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:40.707
Doug.

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:44.085
The yari, with its long
handle and multi-pronged spear,

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:48.798
makes it a trifecta of points
and edges, and a deadly weapon.

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:51.342
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

00:00:51.342 --> 00:00:52.886
I will take your
yari and deliver

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.930
multiple slashes and
thrusts on this pig carcass.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.390
Fuad, you're up first.
You ready?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.142
Oh, I'm ready.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:03.229
I see Fuad's yari
and I'm like, wow.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.857
I feel really good going
into weapons testing.

00:01:05.857 --> 00:01:07.942
I think if the yari
is used in the ways

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:09.694
that I've read about
how it was used,

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:13.823
I know that I'm just going to
mince that thing with my yari.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:16.659
[music playing]

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.001
Oh.

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:30.048
Oh.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:30.590
Jesus.

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:42.519
All right, Fuad, let's
talk about your yari here.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.939
We felt that it had
very good balance to it.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.902
That on the initial slash right
here, it dug in into flesh,

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:52.612
then it hit the spine.

00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:56.199
The transference of energy hit
a weak spot into your handle

00:01:56.199 --> 00:02:00.078
over here, but it still
had a secondary cut

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:01.704
all the way through.

00:02:01.704 --> 00:02:05.416
I would consider
your blade a kill.

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:06.835
Thank you.

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:10.839
It was-- mine-- mine was
beautiful, well made.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:12.757
And some wood grain
just, you know.

00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:19.347
Fuad, your weapon suffered
a catastrophic failure.

00:02:19.347 --> 00:02:22.308
Now, that's bad, however, you're
not out of this competition

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:23.935
yet.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:27.814
Jacob, your yari still must
perform in this kill test.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.274
Let's see what happens.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:32.527
Right now I'm
feeling nauseous.

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:36.656
My heart's pounding in my chest,
my hands are sweaty, and I'm--

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:42.745
just can't wait to see
how it actually goes down.

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:45.623
[music playing]

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.768
All right, Jacob, let's
talk about your yari.

00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:09.188
In the initial swing, instead
of being able to cut cleanly

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:12.692
with this part, to cut
through, this got in the way

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.360
with the angle that it had.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.071
But let's talk about
these particular blades.

00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:20.658
They are sharp enough to
penetrate into the pig carcass.

00:03:20.658 --> 00:03:25.371
The thrust is really devastating
and very deep into that.

00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:29.334
Your handle construction--
it stayed true.

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:30.752
No issues at all.

00:03:30.752 --> 00:03:33.546
Overall, your weapon will kill.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.131
Thank you, sir.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:37.926
My yari held up, and I'm just--

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.470
thank you, God.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.639
Well, Fuad, the
blades of your yari

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.849
were beautifully constructed.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.018
The overall weapon
was very elegant.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:51.356
However, your shaft broke in our
first test and we cannot move

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.733
forward in this
competition because that is

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.861
a catastrophic weapon failure.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.323
And I have to ask you to
please leave the forge.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:02.867
I was really confident
going into the competition,

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:06.663
and I felt like my yari
was going to really perform

00:04:06.663 --> 00:04:08.331
a lot better than Jacob's.

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.459
And it's just pure
irony all the way down.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.671
Maybe that small
flaw in that wood

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.382
was put there to teach
me some kind of lesson

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.926
that I have to derive
from the cosmos somehow,

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:23.429
but right now it
feels pretty bad.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.182
Jacob, you are the
Forged in Fire champion

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.393
and will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.143
Good job.

00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:30.144
[applause]
