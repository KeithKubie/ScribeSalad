00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.480
- I could say the
performance is the moment

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.744
when the performer with his own idea

00:00:13.744 --> 00:00:16.726
step in his own mental
physical construction

00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:19.559
in the front of the
audience in particular time.

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:21.930
This is not a theater.
A theater will repeat.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.063
Theater replace somebody else.

00:00:24.063 --> 00:00:25.863
Theater isn't like box.

00:00:25.863 --> 00:00:27.555
Performance is real.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:29.424
In a theater you can cut with a knife

00:00:29.424 --> 00:00:31.293
and there is blood.

00:00:31.293 --> 00:00:33.162
The knife is not real
and blood is not real.

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:36.378
In performance the blood
and the knife and the body

00:00:36.378 --> 00:00:39.060
of the performer is real.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.171
It's very hard to make a strong,

00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:45.282
illuminating, you know, work of art.

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:48.393
I'm more interested idea
I really fear about.

00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:51.487
I'm really interested in
idea who change something or,

00:00:51.487 --> 00:00:53.554
you know, make me learn something.

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:56.707
If you do things you like
or you have the pleasure,

00:00:56.707 --> 00:00:58.688
you know, doing it, you'll never change.

00:00:58.688 --> 00:01:00.619
You're always in the same
pattern and everything

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:03.940
is happening the same way
again and again in your life.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.898
Performance is the kind
of unique form of art

00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:09.786
and is very temporary and comes and goes.

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:13.272
And in every society it's
different relation to performance.

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:16.153
In the 70's it was body art
and then disappear completely.

00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:19.077
In the 80's because the
market was all focused

00:01:19.077 --> 00:01:20.763
on goods and something to sell,

00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:22.400
there was nothing to sell
with the performance.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.756
It was just memory.

00:01:23.756 --> 00:01:26.171
Every time the economical
crisis in the world

00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:28.980
the performers become kind of evident.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.155
I don't expect anything for myself

00:01:32.155 --> 00:01:34.576
is this expectation to be there 100%.

00:01:34.576 --> 00:01:36.979
I expect to be absolutely,
whatever I do, 100%.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.277
And it is up to audience
how they take it or not.

00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:42.911
And I will be-- I like them to be present,

00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:44.757
because the work is done for the audience.

00:01:44.757 --> 00:01:46.556
Without the audience
the world doesn't exist.

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:48.151
It doesn't make any meaning.
