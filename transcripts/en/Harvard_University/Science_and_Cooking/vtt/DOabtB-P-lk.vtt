00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.070
MICHAEL BRENNER: Welcome to the
second lecture in our series

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.050
on Science and Cooking, and we're
delighted today to have Joanne Chang.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.800
This week the topic
is phase transitions.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.350
Now phase transitions is
what happens, like when

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.670
you boil water-- you know
that when you heat water,

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.580
it goes from being a normal
temperature, to being at some point

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.379
the liquid transforms
to a gas-- and there are

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:39.920
lots of phase transitions in cooking.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.400
I mean, in fact, arguably
cooking is really

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.110
the control of phase transitions.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.950
And it turns out that one of the
most useful phase transitions,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.260
and really one of the most interesting
for cooking, happens with sugar water.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.410
Which is going to play, I think, a
prominent role in tonight's lecture.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.980
And I mean the thing about sugar water--
actually is anyone drinking Coca Cola?

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.616
Does anyone have a Coca Cola?

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:02.490
You have a Coca Cola?

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.770
No one will admit it?

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.830
So I mean, OK, so let
me ask you a question.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.340
In fact, maybe in fact I'm
not going to use my slides,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.710
maybe I'm going to talk about
phase transitions instead.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.780
So I should have brought this demo.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.167
So does anybody know if we
took-- is that a beaker of water?

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:16.250
JOANNE CHANG: This is ice.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.720
MICHAEL BRENNER: That's ice.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.240
So if we took water, that's
about how much water is that?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.040
That's about-- that's 5
and 1/2 cups of water.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.687
Does anybody know how much sugar we can
dissolve in 5 and 1/2 cups of water?

00:01:26.687 --> 00:01:29.020
That is for example, suppose
we had another beaker which

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.460
is filled with sugar up
to this level, do you

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.180
think if we mixed it in the
water it would dissolve?

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.590
Who votes yes?

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.230
Who votes no?

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.085
OK, so most of you didn't vote.

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:41.072
Did you notice that?

00:01:41.072 --> 00:01:41.780
They didn't vote.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.250
So let's try it again, you're not
allowed to get away with that.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.124
So this is a straightforward question,
you can go home and verify it.

00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:50.620
If we had 5 and 1/2 cups
of sugar, and we poured it

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.550
in 5 and 1/2 cups of water, who
votes that it would dissolve?

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.860
Who votes that it wouldn't dissolve?

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.760
OK, so what if we have
5 and 1/2 cups of salt?

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.610
Instead of sugar, salt.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.000
It's a cooking material right?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.520
You can use salt?

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.550
Who thinks that the salt would dissolve?

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.170
Who thinks that the
salt would not dissolve?

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.994
OK, so what if we had 10 cups of sugar?

00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:15.410
So that's 5 and 1/2 cups of water.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.350
Suppose I had 10 cups of sugar?

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.120
Who thinks it would dissolve?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.766
Who thinks it wouldn't dissolve?

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.140
OK, you're getting better voting.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.470
So the answer is that 10
cups of sugar would dissolve.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.190
So the solubility-- So you can
dissolve twice the weight of sugar

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.800
in the equivalent weight of
water at room temperature.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.350
Now Joanne's going to be doing a lot of
boiling, are you going to be boiling?

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.950
JOANNE CHANG: I am, yeah.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.700
MICHAEL BRENNER: So
when you boil, suppose

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.970
you have water at 100 degrees
Celsius, boiling point.

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.010
How much sugar can you dissolve then?

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.810
Does anybody know?

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.934
Maybe I'll ask it this way.

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:50.130
So let's say we had 11-- so
I'm leading you to the answer--

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.890
but we said 11 cups.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.000
So what about 15 cups?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.630
Can you, at boiling water, 15 cups?

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.560
20 cups?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.510
Who votes 15?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.720
Who says yes?

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.330
20?

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.360
Who says yes?

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.920
So it turns out four times, it's a
factor of 4 at 100 degrees Celsius.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.250
It's also the case-- and maybe this is
a better intro than what I've prepared,

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.560
come to think of it,
cause this might even

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.750
be relevant for what
you're going to talk about,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.610
that's unusual right-- so it's
also the case that-- I don't

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.200
know if you knew this, but-- the
boiling point of sugar water mixtures

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.140
increases with temperature.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.860
So if you actually were to put four
cups of sugar into a cup of water

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.137
at 100 degrees Celsius, the
water wouldn't be boiling,

00:03:28.137 --> 00:03:30.970
the mixture wouldn't be boiling,
the boiling point actually goes up.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.730
And I think what you're going to
see when Joanne gives this lecture,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.000
and this is dangerous
for me to see, cause

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.124
I have absolutely no idea
what you're going to say,

00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:39.432
but anyway this will
be-- except that she's

00:03:39.432 --> 00:03:42.700
going to talk about sugar-- is that
you have to control temperature

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.370
very carefully.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.865
Because what happens, of course,
is that if you just dump heat in it

00:03:47.865 --> 00:03:51.010
then the thing starts to boil, the
gas comes off, and that of course

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.580
means that the sugar fraction increases.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.120
Which makes the boiling
point increase more,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.940
which makes the sugar
fraction increase even more,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.660
and there's a runaway
phenomenon in this.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.800
Which is the reason, how
many of you make candy?

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.679
How many of you don't make candy?

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:06.720
Okay good, just checking.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.492
Which is the reason that you
have to buy candy thermometers.

00:04:10.492 --> 00:04:12.450
Joanne I don't think
needs a candy thermometer.

00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:18.500
So she'll explain to you how she
gets away with this presumably.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.970
Or she doesn't, ask her.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.226
So with no further ado,
let me introduce Joanne.

00:04:22.226 --> 00:04:24.100
So I actually-- it always
makes me very happy

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.349
to introduce Joanne for a
number of different reasons,

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.270
but one of them-- which for those of you
have come here before, you've heard me

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.280
say this but I'll just say it
again-- is that Joanne was a Harvard

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.490
undergraduate, and she
was an applied math major.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.960
And I, as it happens, run the
applied math major at Harvard.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.110
And I've never understood why I was
involved in the science of cooking.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.060
And Joanne though, well
she was in applied math,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.740
and she actually knows what she's doing.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.450
And so it's sort of
somehow made me feel good.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.064
So anyway with that, Joanne, thank you.

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:00.320
JOANNE CHANG: Thank you.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.020
Thank you, for that introduction.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.290
I always learn something from the
introduction that you give, Michael.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.880
You always explain stuff.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.630
So one of the reasons why I
love coming to these classes,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.410
I'm a nervous wreck the entire
week before, I still am right now,

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.930
but in that quick 5 or 10
minutes that Michael speaks,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.850
I always learn a little bit
more about what it is that I do.

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.830
Because I know how it works, and
I can explain what will happen,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.840
but I didn't even think about what
was happening with the boiling point.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.230
We are going to boil sugar,
I'm going to show you

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.080
different things you can do with
the different stages of sugar.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.180
But I didn't even think about
the actual boiling point rising.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.930
A little bit into the
lecture, I will talk

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.750
about the freezing point of a liquid,
and how when you add sugar to it

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.410
actually depresses the freezing point.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.660
But I hadn't thought about
how it works the other way.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.850
So that was really fun to learn.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.540
So thank you again for
having me back this year,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.320
and think you to Harvard
for hosting this class.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.120
And then I also have to thank
my assistant Jess, who's

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.475
back there piping lots of
little containers of butter

00:06:02.475 --> 00:06:05.100
cream and caramel sauce, and
little crispy cookies for you guys

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.760
to try at the end.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.040
So there is a tasting.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.500
[LAUGHING] Yay Jess.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.020
So, the last two years
that I've taught here,

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.980
I focused very broadly
on just the chemistry

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.600
of science, the chemistry of
baking, science and baking,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.130
and I focused on making a cake.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.380
What we did was, we took all
the different ingredients

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.480
that go into a very
simple yellow cake, and I

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.230
talked about emulsification of eggs.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.092
I talked about gluten formation.

00:06:39.092 --> 00:06:41.050
I talked a little bit
about buttermilk, and how

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.030
it reacts differently than milk.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.880
I talked about all of the different
ways you can leaven a cake, so

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.700
with air and with steam,
baking soda, baking powder.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:55.820
You put all these things together, mix
them all up, and then you get cake.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.370
And what we did, the
last two years, is we

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.314
taught about the science of
baking through yellow cake.

00:07:02.314 --> 00:07:04.480
These are some examples of
some of the cakes we did,

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.610
one with no baking powder,
one with no baking soda,

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.140
we did melted butter instead
of room temperature butter,

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.870
we did a host of different things.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.750
And it was a super fun lecture to teach.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.160
Turns out that last year,
two of the students--

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.074
so I teach the class
tonight for the public,

00:07:19.074 --> 00:07:21.990
and then tomorrow I'll come back and
teach to the Harvard students who

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:25.510
are actually taking this class as
a course-- and two of the students

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.980
last year, upon taking the
science and cooking class,

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.430
and then watching the lecture
that I taught about cake,

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.532
for their final project-- I think
it was their final project-- they

00:07:35.532 --> 00:07:37.240
decided they wanted
to do more with cake,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.060
and so they came up with spray cake.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.250
I don't know if any of you guys saw
this, it was actually in The Globe

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.030
about two or three months
ago, it was front page news.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.410
These two Harvard students
had come up with a cake

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.080
that you can put-- they
put it in an aerosol can.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.580
It sits on a shelf in the grocery
store, and whenever you're hungry

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.640
and you want cake, you just spray
this into a pan and then bake it.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.300
And then you get cake.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.520
So this is for people who think
they cake mixes are too difficult.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.150
And thus you just want to take
an aerosol can and spray it.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:15.180
But they came by the restaurant,
and they baked me some cake,

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.010
they wanted me to approve it,
and see if I thought it was good,

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.780
and I thought it was really good.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.560
And I have to say it was really
exciting to know that something

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.270
that I had taught had
actually led these students

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:30.720
and inspired them to create
a product, where they're

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.780
going to go off and make millions.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.601
So two questions lead
from that, and when

00:08:35.601 --> 00:08:38.559
I told my parents about this-- I sent
it to them because my picture was

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.780
somewhere, and they always
love that kind of stuff--

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.360
the first thing my mom said is,
are you getting royalties on this?

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.030
So that I still don't know,
I haven't heard from them,

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.360
but they might be here in this room,
or maybe they'll watch the video

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.040
and so they know where to fine me.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.252
You can always tag me along.

00:08:57.252 --> 00:08:58.960
And then the other
question it raises, is

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.270
that it really does up
the ante for this lecture,

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:06.250
and can I create a lecture that
will inspire people and make people

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.920
innovate something even more exciting?

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.440
So a lot of pressure this time around.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.580
OK, so this time Professor
Brenner and I talked

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:21.340
about focusing on a singular subject
rather than the broad topic of cooking

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.790
and baking, and science and chemistry,
but instead on just one subject,

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.150
and that is sugar.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.410
So this actually came at a great
time when Professor Brenner called me

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:34.370
last year, because I was just finishing
the manuscript for a new book that

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.450
is coming out next spring-- which
is called Baking With Less Sugar--

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:42.060
and I just spent the prior year baking
all year long with recipes that I

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:45.730
was used to using at the bakery, but
with less sugar or with no sugar.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.790
So I had a lot of experience
baking with less sugar or no sugar,

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:54.050
and seeing the way the recipes came
out when you didn't have sugar.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.540
So I was excited to take
everything that I've learned

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.240
and then share that with you guys.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.450
So you can see all the things you
can make with either no sugar or very

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.420
little sugar.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.100
It turns out that
sugar is something that

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.240
is genetically engineered inside of us.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.340
We are all born with
an affinity for sugar,

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.970
and if you have something
sweet in your mouth,

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.140
your body reads it as a
possible source of energy,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.530
and it reads it as probably not
something that's going to be harmful.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:28.150
It doesn't read that when it gets
something sour, or something bitter.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.460
And so it's having
something that is sweet

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:36.870
is something that we're all accustomed
to, and that we are all attracted to.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.980
So when you think about sugar,
and what it does to desserts,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.570
what is it that defines a dessert?

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.390
Well it's got sugar in it.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.460
There are very few deserts out
there that don't have sugar.

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.280
You could have a desert that's fresh
fruit, that's what my parents did,

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:54.510
they thought that was dessert.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.260
I disagreed.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.230
Or you can have, some people actually
serve cheese as a last course,

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.620
I don't know some of you guys do
that, I've always found that baffling.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.870
But this is also another
way people end their meal,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.110
but really, when we think
about sugar, what we

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.680
think about is all the desserts
that you can create with sugar.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.130
So, what does sugar do to a desert?

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:24.380
The most obvious one, if
I were to ask all of you,

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.160
is you would say it adds sweetness.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.740
It turns out, and Jess and I spent
all afternoon thinking about this,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.890
finishing up this
presentation, it turns out

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:38.330
that chocolate is the
only dessert that we

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:43.040
could think of, in which sugar--
the only role that sugar plays is

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.700
to add sweetness.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.010
Every other dessert
we came up with there

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:53.050
was another role that sugar played
in making that dessert palatable.

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:55.920
So I don't know, I'm going to pose
that as a question to you guys.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.711
Think about all the
desserts that you know,

00:11:57.711 --> 00:12:01.470
and if you can think of
a desert in which sugar,

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.890
the only role it's playing, is to
make it palatable to your palate,

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.020
to make it sweet.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.650
Then I would love to hear it,
because we had this blank at first.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.730
Because we couldn't think
of anything that only

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.620
had sugar to just add sweetness.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:19.496
Because sugar plays so many different
roles in every sort of desert.

00:12:19.496 --> 00:12:21.730
Does anybody have any ideas?

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:23.910
Can anybody think of
any dessert in which

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.980
the only reason you would have
the sugar is to add sweetness?

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.475
The slide that we had, anybody?

00:12:31.475 --> 00:12:31.975
Yes?

00:12:31.975 --> 00:12:33.320
AUDIENCE: Milkshakes.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.350
Milkshakes?

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.434
OK, I'm going to come
to that in a little bit.

00:12:36.434 --> 00:12:38.350
So I'm going to jot down
all these in my head,

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.610
and then we're going to address them.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:39.930
Yes?

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.212
AUDIENCE: What about
a piece of chocolate?

00:12:41.212 --> 00:12:43.213
Bitter chocolate, as
opposed to sweet chocolate.

00:12:43.213 --> 00:12:45.212
JOANNE CHANG: Exactly,
so this was the only one.

00:12:45.212 --> 00:12:48.150
Bitter chocolate and chocolate,
were the only thing I can think of.

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.080
We had one more, which then
we realized there was actually

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.371
another role that sugar played.

00:12:51.371 --> 00:12:53.500
So I'm looking to see
if anybody would-- yes?

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.220
AUDIENCE: Sorbet?

00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.670
JOANNE CHANG: Sorbet.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.700
Goes along with milkshakes.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.660
Sorbet and milkshakes, the
sugar does add sweetness,

00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.170
but it also does something else.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:02.750
Yes.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:03.610
AUDIENCE: Popsicles?

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.307
JOANNE CHANG: Popsicles, sorbet,
and milkshakes, all the same.

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:08.440
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.507
JOANNE CHANG: Yes?

00:13:09.507 --> 00:13:10.790
AUDIENCE: Zabaione?

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.680
JOANNE CHANG: Zabaione.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.080
There's going to be
another part where you're

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:19.104
going to see where the sugar actually
helps with the Zabaione as well.

00:13:19.104 --> 00:13:19.910
AUDIENCE: Custard.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.165
JOANNE CHANG: Pasta?

00:13:21.165 --> 00:13:21.665
Custard!

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.305
Custard, yep, you need the sugar for
another reason, other than sweetness.

00:13:29.305 --> 00:13:29.930
One more thing.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:30.550
Whipped cream!

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.758
Actually whipped cream,
you're right, the only reason

00:13:32.758 --> 00:13:35.812
to have sugar for whipped
cream is to sweeten it.

00:13:35.812 --> 00:13:38.020
So that is, I don't know if
that counts as a dessert,

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.895
but it is just like
chocolate, it's something

00:13:39.895 --> 00:13:42.905
that's sweet where the sugar
is only-- OK, one more, yes.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:44.180
AUDIENCE: Yogurt.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.380
JOANNE CHANG: Sugared
yogurt, yeah, you're right.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.650
So sugar in that case is
just added as flavoring.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.310
So, you're dying to give one more.

00:13:56.789 --> 00:13:58.830
For the beautiful French
macaroon, you definitely

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.140
need sugar for reasons
other than just-- and I'll

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.592
be demoing that as well,
we're going to make meringue.

00:14:04.592 --> 00:14:06.380
That stabilizes the egg foams.

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.670
So it turns out that sugar does so
many other things, other than just

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.160
add sweetness.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.940
So I'm going to spend a little time
talking about the different roles

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.770
that sugar plays in various
desserts, and then I'm

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:22.149
going to go into the stages of sugar.

00:14:22.149 --> 00:14:24.690
We're going to take some sugar
syrups, which are all up here,

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:26.900
and we're going to take
them to different stages,

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.552
and you'll get to see how they
react to make different pastries.

00:14:31.552 --> 00:14:33.760
So now I'm just going to go
through kind of a laundry

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.740
list of what other things sugar does
to a desert that makes it a desert.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.750
So the first thing is creaming
the sugar into butter.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.510
So any cake recipe,
any cookie recipe, they

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.000
almost all start out with creaming
butter and sugar together.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.960
You take granulated sugar,
you mix it into butter,

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.369
and you cream it, what's
called creaming, in a mixer,

00:14:56.369 --> 00:14:58.910
and you mix it, and mix it, and
mix it until it becomes light

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.170
and fluffy in color.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.210
And basically what's
happening is, I mean

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.150
you guys all know the texture
of sugar, it's very granulated,

00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:08.800
if you look at those granules
of sugar under a microscope,

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.730
they're little itty bitty crystals.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:14.170
And the little sugar crystals
have very hard jagged edges,

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:19.390
and when they are mixed with the butter,
or margarine, or any sort of solid fat,

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:24.700
what the sugar crystals are doing,
is they're digging little air

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.910
pockets into the fat.

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:30.030
So it's sort of like
when you're a gardener,

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:33.900
and you take a hoe, and your hoeing
the firm earth and you're aerating it.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:35.710
And that's exactly what
happens when you're

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.800
creaming sugar and butter together.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.550
All of those air
pockets then go on, when

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.440
you're making your cake or your cookie,
to make your final product light

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.640
and fluffy and tender,
and not hard and dense.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.297
So when you think about cookies
and you think about cakes,

00:15:50.297 --> 00:15:52.130
you need the sugar to
make them taste sweet,

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.320
but then you also need them in order
for them to be light and fluffy,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.260
because of the creaming properties.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:01.810
So this is from last
year's lecture, we have

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:06.510
a picture of a cake in which it's
creamed with a full amount of sugar,

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:08.450
and then we use half amount of sugar.

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.990
And from the pictures it
doesn't look hugely different,

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.820
but if you were to
imagine a six inch cake,

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:17.060
there's actually about an inch to a half
an inch all the way through the cake,

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.350
we noticed, when we use
half the amount of sugar.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.480
And it's because there was half
the amount of sugar crystals

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.540
to create those air pockets,
and so then the final product

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.410
was able to rise quite as much, so
the cake was a little bit denser

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.120
and it didn't rise quite as much.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.320
Another thing that sugar does
is that it's hygroscopic.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.940
And what this means, is that it attracts
water molecules that are in the air,

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.090
and it brings it to itself.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:47.700
So this is one of the reasons why you
can take cookies, and cakes, and such,

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.040
and you can package them,
and they can sit on the shelf

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.340
and they won't get stale.

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:53.900
Because with the sugar does,
is it keeps the moisture

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.550
that's already in the
cookie, inside the cookie.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.860
And it helps it last longer, so
you can put on the supermarket

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.040
and sell it for weeks at a time.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.690
Originally when we
were talking about what

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:08.490
is a desert in which the only thing
that sugar does is add sweetness,

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.970
this was the first slide
that I had because I thought,

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.980
well if you take some fruit, and you
mix a little bit of sugar into it,

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.819
and you sweeten it,
then that's a desert,

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.970
and the only thing the sugar is
doing is adding sweetness, right?

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.170
Well it turns out not.

00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:24.240
If you look at the picture closely,
you can see in the pot of strawberries,

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.960
you can see a little bit of that sauce.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.910
That sauce is because
sugar's hygroscopic,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:30.880
when it mixes with
the strawberries, it's

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.810
drawing out all the moisture in the
strawberries and it's creating a sauce.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.760
And so that's the other
way in which sugar

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.950
helps make this desert so delicious.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.770
It makes it sweet and then it
also combines with the liquid

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:43.540
in the strawberries to make a sauce.

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.730
OK, so the people who said
popsicle, sorbet, and milkshakes.

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:51.350
This is a really
interesting part about sugar

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:57.160
that I didn't know from a science level,
I just knew from an operational level.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:00.180
That when I used to make
sorbets and ice creams,

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.700
if I had something that didn't
have a lot of sugar, it was really,

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:04.201
really icy.

00:18:04.201 --> 00:18:07.408
And if I had something in which I had
mis-measured, and I put too much sugar,

00:18:07.408 --> 00:18:08.340
it was really soupy.

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.480
And I could never really
figure out why, I just

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.670
made sure that I followed the
recipe so that wouldn't happen.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.890
But in studying more about the role
of sugar and what it does to desserts,

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:22.460
sugar actually depresses the
freezing point of a liquid.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.810
So if we take ice, and we put it in
the freezer, you get an ice cube right?

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.790
It's going to freeze at 0 degrees
Celsius, 32 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:18:30.790 --> 00:18:33.150
If you add some sugar
to that, what it does

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:38.110
is that it means that that sugar
water won't freeze right at 0 degrees

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.150
Celsius, but it might
be a little bit lower.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.190
And so if you have a freezer that's at
0 degrees Celsius, then that sugar water

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:46.040
that you have won't freeze solid.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.240
So we use this to our advantage
when we're making frozen desserts.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.137
So when you make a popsicle,
or a sorbet, or milkshake,

00:18:52.137 --> 00:18:54.720
you need the sugar to make it
taste good and to make it sweet,

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.820
but you also need the sugar
to make it actually scoopable,

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.570
so that you can eat it, so it's
not like sucking on an ice cube.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:07.090
So this is a video, Jess made five
versions of grapefruit sorbet.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:11.650
This is just grapefruit and water.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.600
There's no sugar.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:17.480
This version has a half a cup of
sugar, and she wanted me to explain it

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.650
she's holding iPhone
with one hand and she's

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.500
trying-- which is why it looks
like it's really awkward.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.750
Because we were watching it, and I was
like, why are you looking so weird?

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.880
And she said that it's
because I'm trying

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.380
to hold the iPhone at the same time.

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.210
This is version three, one cup of sugar.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:35.440
This is the actual recipe, you can
see you can actually scoop into it.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:38.779
This is version 4, 1
and 1/2 cups of sugar.

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:40.570
And that you can scoop
into it, and you can

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:45.219
see that it's actually kind of
melted, because it's not quite frozen.

00:19:45.219 --> 00:19:47.010
And then finally this
is two cups of sugar,

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.980
this is twice the amount of sugar
that you should have in this recipe.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.800
And it's practically soup.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.890
You can see it's like really
syrupy, and she doesn't even

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:58.268
have to be so stiff anymore.

00:19:58.268 --> 00:20:00.040
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.630
So that's what sugar does to
popsicle, sorbet, and milkshakes.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.100
Not only does it add the sweetness,
but it also allows for a nice texture,

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:10.220
so that you can eat it
and it's easy to eat.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:14.520
Sugar also stabilizes beaten egg foams.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.090
So for the person who said
French macaroon, you need sugar,

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.970
it adds sweetness, but it
also provides the structure.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:25.614
So that you can make
the French macaroon.

00:20:25.614 --> 00:20:29.310
[BLENDER]

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.809
OK, so the first thing we're going to
do is just a beat up the egg whites

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:33.850
without any sugar at all.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:39.520
So like I was saying, you have the
protein strands of the egg whites

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.380
are starting to get filled with air.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.277
And you're going to see-- like this
egg whites before they're beaten,

00:20:44.277 --> 00:20:45.610
they're yellow, they're viscous.

00:20:48.889 --> 00:20:50.680
I think you can start
to see into the bowl,

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.710
you can see how it's starting
to get white and airy,

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.550
that's because all of
the air is starting

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.520
to get captured within the foams.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.690
Now the protein of the
egg whites, which is now

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:04.477
capturing all the air, those
protein strands aren't that stable.

00:21:04.477 --> 00:21:06.810
So I'm going to whip this,
and whip this, and whip this,

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:08.893
and I'm gonna put this out
in the bowl, but you're

00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:11.010
going to see it's going
to be very unstable.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.290
It's going to look a
little bit like Styrofoam,

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.165
and it's not going to
be anything that you're

00:21:15.165 --> 00:21:18.700
going to be able to really bake with,
because it's going to start to deflate.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:23.470
We're going to do another batch
with egg whites and sugar.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.010
So sugar, when I start to
add that to the egg whites,

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.500
the sugar actually combines with
the water that's in egg whites.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.800
So egg whites are
protein strands in water.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:38.220
We're going to whip up the sugar into
the egg whites, and in that batch,

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:41.140
the sugar will combine with
the water and it's going

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.050
to create a syrup within this foam.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.380
And what the syrup is going
to do, is it's actually

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.740
going to protect all of
the little protein bubbles

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:52.470
that the egg whites are
forming when it goes into foam.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.430
And so it's sort of
like packing peanuts,

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:56.210
you know when you have
something fragile,

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.192
you buy all those little
Styrofoam peanuts.

00:21:58.192 --> 00:22:00.650
And you pack your fragile items
and you put lots of peanuts

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.390
around it to make sure it doesn't break.

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:05.950
That's exactly what will
happen with the sugar.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:11.372
So you can see that now the egg
white foam is all nice and white,

00:22:11.372 --> 00:22:12.330
and it's getting foamy.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.020
And I don't know if you can see, but
now it's starting to get over whipped.

00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:19.547
Because all of those proteins are being
stressed, and stretched, and stretched,

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:21.380
and stretched, and
they've taken all the air

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.494
they can, and then they're
just like, OK, that's enough,

00:22:24.494 --> 00:22:25.910
and then they start to break down.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:35.290
So this one--

00:22:42.071 --> 00:22:44.820
So this one, can you tell how, I
don't know if you can really see,

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:48.032
but it's-- you see
how deflated it looks?

00:22:48.032 --> 00:22:49.740
And it's like, it's
just a matter of time

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.290
before all of this kind of deflates.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.260
And it doesn't look very, I don't know.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.710
I mean to me, this
doesn't look very stable,

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:58.585
but I don't know if
you're not a baker if you

00:22:58.585 --> 00:23:00.340
can tell that this isn't very stable.

00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.230
So is there are non-baker out
there that can look at this?

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.895
Does this look stable to you?

00:23:04.895 --> 00:23:05.853
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:23:05.853 --> 00:23:07.260
JOANNE CHANG: You don't know, OK.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.926
You're going to have to take my
word for it, this is not stable.

00:23:09.926 --> 00:23:12.251
Look at it, it's like-- see?

00:23:12.251 --> 00:23:13.817
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:23:13.817 --> 00:23:16.150
JOANNE CHANG: It just looks
like it's not going to last.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:17.899
And then, we're going
to put it over here,

00:23:17.899 --> 00:23:20.650
and you're going to watch it
all night long, and you'll see.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:28.380
OK, so then, we're going to do the exact
same thing, with the same amount of egg

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.160
whites to begin with.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:38.556
But this time we're
going to add-- So the key

00:23:38.556 --> 00:23:40.055
is you have to start it really slow.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.010
So the same process is going to happen.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:48.490
It's going to start to get foamy.

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.142
So while this is, while
I'm waiting to add this,

00:23:56.142 --> 00:23:58.600
these are the things that you
can make-- some of the things

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:00.630
that you can make with
stabilized egg foams.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.120
You can make lemon meringue pie,
you can make angel food cake,

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.042
you can make butter cream.

00:24:06.042 --> 00:24:08.010
I'm going to slowly add the sugar.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:11.300
So lemon meringue pie, you take
this meringue that I'm making,

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:16.690
and you plop it on a pie, and that's
meringue for lemon meringue pie.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:18.860
Angel food cake, you
take this exact meringue

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.760
that I'm making-- you're going
to see how easy baking is--

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:24.000
you're going to fold in
some cake flour and bake it,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.682
and that's angel food cake.

00:24:25.682 --> 00:24:28.890
And then buttercream, again you're going
to take this exact meringue that I'm

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.931
making, and you're going
to throw butter into it,

00:24:30.931 --> 00:24:32.860
and that's going to be buttercream.

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:39.430
So those are some things that you
can make with sugar and egg foams.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.580
So I'm going to let this
go for a little bit,

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.454
and then I'm going to
show you the difference

00:24:43.454 --> 00:24:46.060
between this one and that one.

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.520
So while that's going, I'm going to
give you another thing that sugar does.

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.982
Sugar tenderizes, and
inhibits, gluten development.

00:24:52.982 --> 00:24:55.440
And I'm not going to go into
a big long thing about gluten,

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.675
but basically gluten is a big buzz
word, everybody knows about gluten,

00:24:58.675 --> 00:25:00.450
it means you want to avoid wheat.

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:04.960
Gluten are two protein molecules
that exist in wheat flour.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.910
And they exist separately until
you add liquid to wheat flour.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:12.170
As soon as you add liquid to it, the
two protein molecules bond together,

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:15.020
and then they do exactly
what the egg whites do.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:19.420
They bond together and they form
these stretchy things that hold air.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.420
So this is great for
when you have bread.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.430
If you take bread, which is flour,
water, and a couple other things,

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.900
and you mix it up, you
develop all this gluten,

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.440
and you create a bread that's really
chewy, and it has a lot of great heft,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.420
and it tastes really great.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.650
And that's great for bread.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.640
But when you're making a cake, that's
the last thing in the world you want,

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.530
is a cake that's chewy and not tender.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:44.540
You want something
that's light and fluffy.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:50.590
What sugar does, similar to what
it does with these egg foams,

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:55.720
is that the sugar ends up
protecting those two protein gluten

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.840
molecules from bonding.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.070
And so when you're making a cake batter,
if you have a lot of sugar in it,

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.080
then the sugar's protecting
those from bonding,

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.996
and then you have a cake
that's tender, and it

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:09.310
doesn't have the ability to hold
all of these big pockets of air,

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.320
which will give you a chewy cake.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.050
Let me show you this meringue.

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.165
So this is very different.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:23.460
So this was the same one cup of--
I'm going to ask my friend here,

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.034
does this look different?

00:26:25.034 --> 00:26:28.444
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:26:28.444 --> 00:26:30.360
JOANNE CHANG: So do you
see how silky that is?

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.416
Where's the camera?

00:26:31.416 --> 00:26:33.320
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.010
JOANNE CHANG: It's like really
silky and much more stable,

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.290
and this is what you would
use to make a dessert with.

00:26:45.182 --> 00:26:46.765
And that's just the addition of sugar.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.760
Okay, I'm going to start
getting these things going.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:00.740
There's that one.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.710
And then there's that one.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:11.570
OK, so a couple more
things, and then we're

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:13.630
going to start talking
about the stages of sugar.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:15.860
So sugar aids in browning.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:22.090
So what this means is, at 310 degrees
there are protein molecules and sugars

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:25.080
that rearrange themselves in
a cake batter, or a cookie,

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.310
or whatever, into these
little ring-- this

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:31.780
is one of the things I learned, getting
ready for the class-- they rearrange

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.550
themselves into these little ring-like
structures, that then reflect light

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:38.590
differently to make
something look browner.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:42.470
So this is a picture of the sour
cream coffee cake at the bakery.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.670
So as it turns out, for the
new low sugar baking book,

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:47.570
I made a sour cream coffee cake.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.190
This is the exact recipe
that we make at the bakery,

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:54.359
except it has instead of a full cup of
sugar, it has six tablespoons of sugar.

00:27:54.359 --> 00:27:56.025
And you can see the difference in color.

00:27:56.025 --> 00:27:58.020
I mean there's obviously going
to be a difference in taste,

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.019
but there was such a
drastic difference in color

00:28:00.019 --> 00:28:03.710
that when we took this picture
for the photo shoot, for the book,

00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:07.900
the photographer kept trying
to get me to put it in the oven

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.850
and brown it longer, or he tried
to Photoshop it to make it browner.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:13.890
And we knew that this wasn't
a super attractive picture,

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.210
because the one on the left
is what you're typically

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:19.110
used to seeing when you
think about a beautiful cake.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.940
But this thing is, that when
you don't have a lot of sugar,

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:25.290
you're never going to get that browning,
and so we wanted it to be realistic.

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:27.470
And so this is the picture,
something like this

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:28.761
is what you'll see in the book.

00:28:28.761 --> 00:28:30.420
Sugar makes pastries crispy.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.449
And so in something like a
cookie, the sugar will liquefy.

00:28:33.449 --> 00:28:35.490
It's in the cookie batter,
it goes into the oven,

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.130
it liquefies, and then
as the water evaporates,

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.330
the sugar recrystallizes,
and then you end up

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.399
with a cookie that's really crispy.

00:28:43.399 --> 00:28:45.940
So you're going to get a little
bit of a crispy sugar cookie.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.240
And it's crispy because of the sugar.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:52.750
Again, I tried to make a low sugar sugar
cookie for the book, and it was soft.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.750
It wasn't that sweet, but
it was also just soft,

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.100
and there was no way we
can get it to crisp up.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.150
We ended up doing a ginger
snap, and what we did

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:01.360
was rather than-- because
it wouldn't crisp up,

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.650
because it didn't have any sugar in
it, we put it in an oven overnight

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:05.900
and we dried it out.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.094
And then it ended up just
being a hard dehydrated cookie.

00:29:09.094 --> 00:29:10.135
So it was sort of crispy.

00:29:10.135 --> 00:29:10.470
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:13.094
JOANNE CHANG: I know that sounds
really appetizing, doesn't it?

00:29:13.094 --> 00:29:14.560
No, it's really good.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:21.370
And then finally, sugar caramelizes
between 356 degrees and 390 degrees,

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.600
sugar will caramelize.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.170
And that adds to the flavor of a
cookie, or cake, or tart shell,

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:31.630
you get that really nice
toasty, nutty aroma.

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:37.340
OK, so the next thing we're going to
talk about is the stages of sugar.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.320
I'm going to come back
and babysit these guys.

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:47.690
So when you take sugar and
water and make it into a syrup,

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:51.110
and you boil it at the
various temperatures

00:29:51.110 --> 00:30:01.540
that you boil the sugar water
to, it corresponds to the way

00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:06.210
the sugar reacts in cold water.

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:09.950
And so the first stage is thread stage.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:12.200
This is the easy one, you just boil it.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.550
At 230 degrees to 235 degrees,
it's called thread stage.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:19.290
If you pour a little bit of this into
some water, you'll get little threads

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:20.710
and then it goes to the bottom.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.850
This is used for sweetening iced
tea, or just glazing fruits.

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.905
The second stage is soft ball.

00:30:27.905 --> 00:30:32.650
At soft ball, which is what I'm
taking this to, you can make fudge.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:37.340
I'm going to take my between soft ball
and the next one, which is firm ball.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.280
So at firm ball, you can make caramels.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:43.097
So these are the
difference in temperatures.

00:30:43.097 --> 00:30:44.180
I'm going to go backwards.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.790
So if you look at soft ball, 235 to
240, when you take the sugar water

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:51.350
and you put it in cold water,
you'll get a soft ball.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:53.940
That's how it got its name, and
then with firm ball, when you

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.440
do the same thing you get a firm ball.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:57.690
And that's how, so you don't
need a candy thermometer,

00:30:57.690 --> 00:30:59.350
because you can just use your hands.

00:30:59.350 --> 00:31:01.290
But the thing is, is
that it's really hot.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.890
So you have to first
freeze your fingers.

00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:06.700
And the other thing
that you can do-- and I

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.825
don't know if you can hear
it because I'm talking--

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:13.530
but when you hear sugar water boil,
it just sounds like water at first.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:18.850
And then, as it starts to get more and
more concentrated, you can hear it,

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:20.929
and it starts to thicken.

00:31:20.929 --> 00:31:22.720
And when it gets to
the right temperature--

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.690
and this is only because I've
been doing it for years--

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.500
you can actually tell when it's
hitting about soft ball stage.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.208
So that way you don't have to
plunge your finger in all the time,

00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:31.859
you can wait.

00:31:31.859 --> 00:31:32.650
So can you hear it?

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:34.720
It's a little bit slower now.

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:43.400
So now I'm going to take a little bit,
and now I've gone a little bit too far.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:47.370
No here we go, firm ball.

00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:50.800
You can't really see that, but
there's a firm little ball.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:53.995
OK, now we're going to make meringue.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:05.780
So this is very similar
to the meringue that we

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:08.070
made that's sitting
over there in that bowl,

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:10.230
except that I've cooked the sugar.

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:14.170
This will help make it--
that meringue, is not

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:16.120
quite as stable as this meringue.

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:36.945
So I've just taken that sugar syrup,
and I've poured it into the egg whites.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.110
I'm going to take this Italian meringue,
and I'm going to throw butter into it,

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:47.412
and then that's buttercream.

00:32:47.412 --> 00:32:50.620
And that's what you use to frost a cake,
and that's what you're going to eat,

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.570
is a little bit of butter cream.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.570
OK, but you have to wait until this
cools before you can add the butter.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.130
So while that's cooling,

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:02.620
I'm going to go back to
this slide really quick.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:08.310
Hard ball is what you
use to make marshmallows.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:12.480
And then soft crack, is taffy.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:15.040
Hard crack is lollipops.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.800
And then the final
stage, is caramelization.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:22.440
And that's when you take the sugar
so far that it starts to turn tan,

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.150
and then it starts to
turn brown, and you

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:28.819
can make praline, and caramel sauce,
and a whole bunch of other things.

00:33:28.819 --> 00:33:29.860
So does that makes sense?

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:34.158
All of the stages of sugar, and
why they have the different names?

00:33:34.158 --> 00:33:34.657
OK.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.780
Because you can definitely
use a candy thermometer,

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:43.220
but if you know what you're
looking for, you don't have to,

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:44.800
and you can just use ice water.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.340
And then you'll know
exactly how far to take it.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:50.505
OK, so let's revisit these meringues.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:58.250
You can see this one.

00:33:58.250 --> 00:34:03.380
So can you see, this is the one that
was just egg white, and no sugar.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.195
And it's basically just deflating
in front of our very eyes.

00:34:06.195 --> 00:34:09.500
It's very sad.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.550
Useless.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:14.260
This has been stabilized with sugar.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:18.470
So you can see it's still beautiful,
you can make cookies out of this.

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:21.949
You could fold almond flour,
and make French macaroon,

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:25.050
that's what you'd use this for.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.310
The Italian one, which is over there,
we're going to wait until it cools,

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:34.420
and then this one we are
going to make praline.

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:39.150
Praline is when you take sugar,
and you wait until it caramelizes.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:44.570
So right now it's reaching
about firm ball, hard ball,

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:49.305
because it's really,
really slow in its bubbles.

00:34:49.305 --> 00:34:57.340
And the bubbles are getting
really big, they're very slow.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.450
And now it'll slowly
start to turn color.

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:03.930
And as soon as it starts to
caramelize, to make praline

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:07.845
you just pour nuts into it, then
pour it out onto a sheet tray,

00:35:07.845 --> 00:35:08.720
and then let it cool.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:22.740
OK, so while that one is
waiting to caramelize,

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:24.490
we're going to add the
butter to this one.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.700
Sorry, I don't mean
to keep moving around.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.127
Can you see how much this has grown?

00:35:30.127 --> 00:35:31.710
I don't know if you guys can see that.

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:36.700
So to make butter cream, you just take
the butter and you just throw it in.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:39.620
It's got to be soft butter,
it can't be too cold

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.455
or it'll shock the whole thing.

00:35:41.455 --> 00:35:48.280
But it can't be melted butter, because
then it won't be stable enough.

00:35:48.280 --> 00:36:00.710
And it's about a cup of egg whites, a
cup of sugar, and a pound of butter.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.084
Does that sound like a lot?

00:36:09.084 --> 00:36:10.750
I feel like this is such a small amount.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:11.830
Like, I'm almost done.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.750
And what will happen is, as the butter
will slowly mix into the meringue,

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.220
and it's going to look broken at first,
it's going to look like we messed up,

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:27.330
and then slowly it'll all come
together and we'll have buttercream.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:31.320
OK, so that one is working.

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.890
And now, we're going to come back here.

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:35.590
And now you can see, you see that?

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:38.370
How nice that looks?

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:49.690
So I'm just going to swirl this
around a little bit, and add my nuts,

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.170
swirl to coat.

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:14.900
And probably about 10 or 15 minutes
will cool, and it'll be really hard,

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.650
and then you can break it off
and some people can eat it.

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:21.190
Because we only have this much.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.740
So we'll put it right there.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.840
We're going to make caramel
sauce, and then we're

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:29.270
going to finish with croquembouche.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:33.870
Which is the picture that the
beginning of the slide show began with.

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.895
So right now I'm just adding
water to the sugar to dissolve it.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:54.230
And then we're going to take
it just as far as we took that.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.650
And this one we're waiting
to get a little bit

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:05.990
brown so that we can make caramel sauce.

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:08.697
OK, so here we go, we're going
to look at the butter cream.

00:38:35.038 --> 00:38:37.577
And so this is buttercream.

00:38:37.577 --> 00:38:39.535
And this is what you
would use to frost a cake.

00:38:43.949 --> 00:38:45.990
So if you want, you can
make this ahead of time--

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:48.790
I know this isn't a baking class--
but just so you know, if you want,

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.123
you can make this ahead of
time, store it in the fridge,

00:38:51.123 --> 00:38:53.950
and then when you want to reuse
it, you don't want to use this.

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.640
You actually want to
use this, to repaddle it

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.130
and to make it smooth again.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:01.720
It's going to be hard like butter,
because it's mostly butter,

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.760
so you're going to want to bring it
to room temperature and paddle it.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.760
And it might break, it
might look curdled, but just

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.740
wait until it warms up and then when
you paddle it'll get smooth again,

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:11.739
and then you can use it.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:18.670
Any questions?

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:19.170
No?

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:19.980
OK.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:21.980
Cause we just have to
wait for these two things.

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:25.300
The timing with caramel
is a little bit tricky.

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:30.120
So we're waiting for this to
caramelize, and then we're

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.480
going to do the croquembouche with this.

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.696
That's all I have. [LAUGHING]

00:39:37.696 --> 00:39:40.450
MICHAEL BRENNER: Can I actually
take the time to say something?

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:42.450
About the boiling point, again?

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:46.990
So if you noticed on Joanne's slides, as
she was going from softball to hardball

00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:49.100
to whatever they're
called, what was increasing

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:52.650
was the percentage of
sugar in that thing.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.640
And it's really dramatic, that
it's only a couple of degrees

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:59.180
and the sugar percentage
goes up from like 85% to 95%.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.822
So what's the rest of it?

00:40:00.822 --> 00:40:01.530
Other than sugar.

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:02.446
What else is in there?

00:40:02.446 --> 00:40:05.440
Where it says 85% sugar,
what else is in the mixture?

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.120
Water.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.340
And so the reason that the
textures are so different

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.700
is because you know if it's all
sugar, it'll be really hard.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:17.581
But see at 95% sugar then the
texture is softer, 92% it's softer.

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.330
so what you're really
doing is controlling

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:22.460
the water content, of the mixture.

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:26.100
JOANNE CHANG: So, we're going
to now make caramel sauce.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.882
So you can see, that it's
now nice and caramelized.

00:40:28.882 --> 00:40:31.090
And one trick-- again I know
it's not a baking class,

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:34.214
but just in case you guys decide to
make something-- when you make caramel,

00:40:34.214 --> 00:40:38.160
right now it looks really brown, but
the real key is, what you want to do

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:43.670
is, actually tilt the pan,
and then look at what results.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:44.920
Because that's the true color.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:48.770
So I think a lot of bakers, they
think, oh, this is caramel, I'm done.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.350
But no, this isn't dark enough.

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:53.090
What you want to do is take
it, tilt it, and then look

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:57.910
and then that fine
sheen is the true color.

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:00.137
OK, now it's good.

00:41:00.137 --> 00:41:02.970
And then we're going to add cream,
but you have to be really careful

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:08.900
because it's-- and that's caramel sauce.

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.959
And then this one, this
is the last one, which

00:41:14.959 --> 00:41:17.000
is, I'm going to do what's
called spinning sugar.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.200
And that's taking caramel,
and then creating--

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.380
because remember how we
talked about soft ball,

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:26.310
firm ball, hard ball, soft crack, hard
crack-- it turns out at hard crack

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.820
and beyond, what that means
is that when the sugar cools,

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.620
it becomes like a crack.

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:32.860
It cracks.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:39.070
And caramel, which is way past hard
crack, when you flick it really fast,

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:44.140
it creates these long sugar strands
that end up looking very beautiful,

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.430
and that's spun sugar.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.329
And last year when I did
it, I had a pot of sugar

00:41:49.329 --> 00:41:52.620
and it crystallized in the middle of the
lecture, and I was like, what do I do?

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:56.220
So crystallization of sugar is when
you're doing what we've been doing,

00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.640
you put sugar and water in
a pot and you turn it on,

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.160
you think you're making either
softball for a butter cream

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.762
or you're making caramel for
caramel sauce, and you come

00:42:04.762 --> 00:42:06.470
and you look at it,
and all of a sudden--

00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:08.760
and I was actually worried
that that might happen tonight,

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:11.760
but I probably should have let it
happen so that I could show you guys.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.468
So when you come back
and you look at it,

00:42:13.468 --> 00:42:16.570
it turns out it starts to have-- I
don't even know how to describe it,

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:21.510
it kind of looks like pieces of
ice floating in the sugar syrup.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:24.140
So everything that you've
seen, has been perfect.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.280
Everything's boiled,
this look so perfect.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.300
It's just boiling and boiling.

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:32.160
But it turns out, there's a couple
things that cause crystallisation.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.230
That I know of, from a
pastry point of view.

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.800
I don't really know what it means
from a scientific point of view.

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:43.410
But if you have any sugar crystals
that are on the side of the pan.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.800
So when you take sugar and
water and you mix them together,

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.220
you don't want to splash
sugar crystals on the side.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.380
You may have noticed that
when I put the water in,

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:52.713
I didn't just pour the water in.

00:42:52.713 --> 00:42:56.820
I very gently put the water in, I really
gently moved the sugar to dissolve it.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.160
Because if there's any sugar
crystals on the side, then

00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:02.890
there's a chance that those sugar
crystals, they're very influential.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:05.200
And when this is happening,
it's at this point when

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.840
it starts to go into soft
ball, firm ball stage,

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:12.200
but if there's a sugar crystal, the
sugar crystal will fall into the syrup

00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.450
and it'll just cause this chain
reaction that will then cause

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:19.970
what looks like ice on the top of it.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.490
And it can happen at any stage.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:25.535
The other times it
happens is if you move it.

00:43:25.535 --> 00:43:27.910
So I don't know if you've
noticed, but I won't touch this

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:29.410
until it starts to caramelize.

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:34.160
So if you move the sugar syrup while
it's boiling, it for some reason

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:36.974
jostles it and makes
it want to crystallize.

00:43:36.974 --> 00:43:38.140
And so those are two tricks.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.410
You want to make sure that there's
no sugar on the edge of the pan,

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:44.010
and then you don't want to
touch it until it caramelizes.

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:46.300
As soon as it caramelizes,
you can touch it.

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.050
And you can swirl it around,
and even out the caramelization.

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:53.430
But before then if you touch it,
there's a chance it will crystallize.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:56.930
Some things that you can do, you
can try to just boil it gently,

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:58.880
and sometimes it boils away.

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.070
But a lot of times you
just have to start over.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.550
And so like during the
holidays when we're

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.466
making millions and
millions of croquembouche,

00:44:04.466 --> 00:44:07.070
we have pots of sugar
just going on every stove

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.299
because one out of every
ten ends up crystallizing,

00:44:10.299 --> 00:44:11.340
and then we can't use it.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.440
So we always have these backup pots.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:13.870
MICHAEL BRENNER: Is that?

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:14.370
How's that?

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:16.760
JOANNE CHANG: Yeah, I think
let's do this for a sec.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.930
So the sugar actually started to
crystallize, which is too bad.

00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:23.240
OK, so now you can see,
so this is caramel right?

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.510
We've made it, and we let it sit,
and now it's starting to cool down.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.410
And as it cools, it thickens up.

00:44:29.410 --> 00:44:32.050
And then-- so what I'm
doing is, I keep lifting

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:36.880
it to see if it'll just fall in one
continuous strand without breaking.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.380
And then once I feel like
it's a nice thick layer--

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:42.890
I'm going to try not to make
too much of a mass here.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.840
So then what you can do is just
do what's called spun sugar.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.494
Which is you basically--

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.610
So I let a lot of it drip off,
because I don't want clumps of it,

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.300
and then I just flick.

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.300
And you can see that
it just starts to fall,

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:06.050
because it's past that soft crack stage.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.720
I mean there's a lot of
different ways you can do this,

00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:11.490
and typically you should do
this on a piece of parchment,

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:14.470
it makes cleanup a little bit easier.

00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:17.640
I'll do that tomorrow, I forgot, sorry.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.590
OK, and then so this is
just the start of it.

00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:26.140
So then you can take all of this
spun sugar and just wrap it around.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:31.450
Here, I'll go this way so
that-- but it's super easy.

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:34.200
You just hold this, and then you flick.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.740
So you have to flick.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.720
It's a really quick, quick flicking.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:47.240
So a lot of times people do this,
I'm going to show you what not to do.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:51.990
So a lot of times
people will do this, OK.

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:57.140
But what you want to do is,
again let a lot of it runoff,

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:04.450
and then just flick really fast.

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:10.010
And then as the sugar
falls from the utensil,

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:15.110
it'll form these strands
that then become spun sugar.

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:19.240
And so then as this gets
colder, it becomes harder

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:24.410
to spin because the sugar gets
more and more firm and hard.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.074
And then you can do what's
called pulled sugar.

00:46:27.074 --> 00:46:29.740
Actually, you would never take
it to caramel to do pulled sugar,

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:34.930
but if you take sugar to hard
crack stage and then let it cool,

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:39.949
it becomes stiffer as it cools.

00:46:39.949 --> 00:46:42.240
And as it becomes stiffer,
you can start to lift it up,

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.890
and it starts to feel like
caramel, and you start to pull it.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:48.110
And that's how they make all those
beautiful flowers, and birds,

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:52.160
and butterflies, and stuff like that.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.700
So this is, you just keep going
until you cover it, and as

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:57.490
much caramel as you want.

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:00.054
The tricky thing about
croquembouche, and about spun sugar,

00:47:00.054 --> 00:47:01.720
is that it's very temperature dependent.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:03.410
And it's very humidity dependent.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.340
And so you actually
can make it, and it'll

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:09.200
last for about an hour or two hours,
and then it just starts to melt.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.910
And if it's raining outside,
you don't even have that long.

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.762
You probably have like 15 minutes,
and then it just starts to melt.

00:47:14.762 --> 00:47:16.720
MICHAEL BRENNER: Can I
ask you guys a question?

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.259
So why do you have to flick it?

00:47:19.259 --> 00:47:19.800
Anybody know?

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.360
It has to, it has to hit air.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.610
So somebody said cool
rapidly, so when you flick it,

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:34.610
I think you evaporate the liquid out
faster, and it solidifies faster.

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:36.840
If you go like this,
it doesn't evaporate,

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:41.720
so probably it's liquid when it
comes down if you don't flick it.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.470
JOANNE CHANG: I think because as
it cools-- so if I just take it,

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.679
and just move it--

00:47:48.679 --> 00:47:50.220
MICHAEL BRENNER: You're just pouring.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:51.610
JOANNE CHANG: Yeah,
then it's just pouring.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:53.300
So it's not really, it's like--

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.110
MICHAEL BRENNER: When
you move something,

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:55.700
so there's this wonderful
experiment that we've

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.699
all don, that if you blow
on a spoon that's hot,

00:47:57.699 --> 00:48:01.889
it cools faster, then if you let
it-- And that's because evaporated,

00:48:01.889 --> 00:48:03.180
you carry the heat away faster.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.380
Sort of evaporates faster.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.030
So should we-- I think we
should take more questions.

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:09.570
Let me propose several things.

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:10.986
First, I think we should all clap.

00:48:10.986 --> 00:48:13.740
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]
