DANNY BERNSTEIN:
Hey, everybody.

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.750
Welcome to the panel that-- it's
really obvious from the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.260
title what this is about.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.450
Just kidding.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.910
So my name is Danny Bernstein,
and I lead the partnerships

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:14.500
team for Google+.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.670
So we're really happy to
have everybody here.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.960
This panel is going to introduce
some of the earliest

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.710
partners of the Google+
Sign-In product.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.050
And I'm taking an opportunity
here with our esteemed

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.600
panelists, who we'll introduce a
second, to chat a little bit

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.890
about why they decided
to be early

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.800
adopters of this product.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.570
Google has many, many launches
over the course of the year

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.060
and talks to lots of different
companies at different times.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.370
And so it'll be interesting and
kind of a nice opportunity

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.130
for these guys to talk about
why they decided to adopt

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.200
early, and also, just generally
speaking, then going

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.490
into a little bit of depth on
what they're doing, actually,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.570
with their integration.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.880
And these are three apps
that are household

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.170
names at this point.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.340
They have significant
adoption.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.640
So that's really cool.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.910
So in case you haven't kind have
gotten the quick Google+

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.110
Sign-In overview, let me just
do that in about 30 seconds

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.170
Google+ Sign-In is an
authentication option for

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.210
websites, for applications.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.160
And what it's allowing you
to do is use your Google

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.880
credentials to log
into websites.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.040
And it makes it much easier than
to have an application

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.910
personalized.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.190
And this is sort of a trend
that's happening all

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.050
throughout application now,
which is that you expect to

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.090
have personalized or familiar
experiences within

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.110
applications.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.120
And now Google is making
that very easy.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.350
And we also think that users
prefer Google in that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.710
environment.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.800
They trust Google.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.360
And it's a great choice
to put in front of

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.530
users to enable that.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.680
And what we're doing with
Google+ Sign-In is that we are

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.140
giving developers this choice
for authentication, but then

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.150
we're also putting lots of
functionality underneath it

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.840
that's additional value.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.535
So for example, and you might
have seen this example a

00:01:53.535 --> 00:01:54.520
couple of times.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.950
When you log in with Google
and if you own an Android

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.850
device, we will then open up a
window that says, would you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.470
like to also download
the application?

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.100
And so it turns out that 40% of
Android users that log in

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.890
with Google then download
the app.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.039
So that's a big number.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.430
And so that's just an
example of the kind

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.870
of thing we're doing.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.190
We announced yesterday that once
a user downloads the app,

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.750
they're then automatically
logged in.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.940
So what Google will continue to
do over the course of the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.060
next several quarters is release
more and more cool

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.800
things for developers, for
businesses, that can help them

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.460
build a Google+ integration that
adds significant value.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.170
All right.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.270
So we have three panelists
here today.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.940
We have Jessica Yi from
Fandango, who is the chief

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.160
product officer there.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.350
We have Manolo Espinosa, who
is the head of audio at

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.380
SoundCloud.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.960
And we also have Robyn
Peterson, who

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.060
is the CTO of Mashable.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.680
So these guys have volunteered
to kind of participate today

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.050
and share what they're doing.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.900
And what they represent are
just three of the many

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.670
companies who said, well, this
product launched at the end of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.510
February, but we want
to be early.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.760
We want to be one of
the case studies.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.070
And so they're going to now
walk you through their

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.180
integrations.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.929
So we will begin
with Fandango.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.120
JESSICA YI: Hi everyone.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.400
I'm Jessica.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.900
As many of you probably
know, Fandango is a

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.090
movie ticketing company.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.530
We also have a lot of movie
information, a broader

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.000
community around it, and you
probably all have used

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.840
Fandango for showtimes.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.560
We like to believe that
moviegoing is

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.220
largely a social event.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.220
Maybe every now and then
you go by yourself.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.390
But for the most part, you're
doing it with other people.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.560
And there's a broader life cycle
around moviegoing where

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.680
you're in three distinct
phases.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.150
Discovery and consideration,
where you're watching

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.580
trailers, maybe checking out
reviews, looking at photos,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.250
just learning about movies.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.640
And then once you've decided
you're actually going, you're

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.430
in a planning and buying mode.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.570
And then afterwards, you're
in a discussion mode.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.550
And all these phases have
social touchpoints where

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.040
you're communicating with either
your immediate friends

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.620
or a larger moviegoing
community at large.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.580
So one of the things that
we've focused on in our

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.490
implementation that we're
showing here is the middle

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.640
phase, where--

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.649
that's kind of our sweet spot
of planning and going.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.800
You can see we've revamped our
sign-in page here to make it

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.210
really easy, have multiple
options for sign-in.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.250
If you want to carry your
identity with you from Google

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.610
or if you already have a
Fandango login, we can tie the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.160
two together.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.910
If you go to the next slide.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.210
You can see, this is a typical
showtimes page.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.430
And at that moment where you've
selected the movie and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.990
the theater and you're
actually looking at a

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.310
showtime, we make it really easy
with this integration to

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.650
be able to push that out to
your circles or immediate

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.330
friends through clicking on
the Google+ icon there.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.730
And then that comes
up as a "join me"

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.120
message on a Google platform.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.120
So you don't need to
be on Fandango.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.620
You don't need to
send an email.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.260
You're alerting them across
multiple platforms.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.845
So we think that's going to
have great reach for our

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:16.330
community and be able to join
people in a way they haven't

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.720
really done before.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.240
That's one instance of it.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.690
We plan to roll out across
all the multiple

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.330
touchpoints pre and post.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.560
So this was a great
start to it.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.180
It's an interactive post.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.360
And I think that another flavor
that we're talking

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.540
about-- there's no visual here--
is the app activities.

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.880
Trailer watching is actually a
huge activity that is a great

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.360
marker for movie interest.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.850
When it first releases, up
through opening weekend, and

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:47.990
even after.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.750
And that kind of aggregated
activity, stuff that doesn't

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.870
necessarily show up in a feed,
is really important data.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.350
DANNY BERNSTEIN: Awesome.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.700
Well Jessica, one thing I
think that I was really

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.100
interested in, participating
in the process with you and

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.980
your team, was how the decision
was made internally

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.610
to move forward with
this integration.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.440
What are the consideration
points?

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.760
What are the kinds of things
that a company like Fandango

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.880
with a structured development
and process--

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.110
how do you approach a
development and technology

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.340
decision like this?

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.160
JESSICA YI: Well there
are two parts.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.240
Obviously, business value and
implementation effort.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.410
On the business value side, we
have over 40 million uniques a

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.280
month across our platforms.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.820
And all the interactions that
we have with our customers

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.140
sometimes can happen on kind
of a one-off basis.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.970
And what this allows us to do
is really amplify the value

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.810
that we're providing to our
customer base and get that

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.820
message across multiple
platforms.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.400
So as we're watching trailers,
ratings and reviews, ticket

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.470
purchases, any of those
activities can really be

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.960
broadcast more widely.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.200
From an implementation
perspective, it didn't take

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.810
our team that long
to build it.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.740
So the immediate return was
there for us in that

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.530
calculation.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:00.976
Awesome.

00:07:00.976 --> 00:07:02.580
Thank you very much.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.230
All right, we'll now hear from
Manolo talking about

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.100
SoundCloud.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.200
MANOLO ESPINOSA: Great.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.740
Thanks, Danny.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.490
First off, I wanted to thank
the Google+ team.

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:16.240
Seth, Danny, Giro, Ardon--

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.060
they're an amazingly dedicated
team that's just passionate

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.410
about creating a wonderful
service and they've been great

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.310
partners to work with.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.660
SoundCloud is the world's
largest audio platform.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.570
We reach about 200 million
users a month.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.300
That's about 8% of
the internet.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.340
Creators upload about 10 hours
of content every minute.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.340
And those creators range from
professional musicians like

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.170
Beyonce to folks who
create music out of

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.500
their bedroom or basement.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.010
Programs like "This American
Life," the White House,

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.890
expectant parents who want to
record the heartbeat of their

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.080
child and share that.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.420
We have offices here.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.580
I'm based here in
San Francisco.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.930
But we have offices in Berlin,
London, Sofia, and New York.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.880
And that allows us to leverage
our API, that's really, really

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.480
flexible, to provide
an extremely

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.010
socially connected service.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.130
One of the things that we're
always looking at-- and I lead

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.750
a platform here in
San Francisco--

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.370
is how to leverage external
relationships.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:26.630
So I work with Facebook,
Twitter,

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.810
Tumblr, and now Google.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.909
We are extremely passionate
about all

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.640
things music and audio.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:41.669
And so Google+ allowed us to
extend the social experience

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:43.370
and to leverage a
simple sign-on.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.760
We launched Google+ Sign
In on our web app.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.180
Our mobile web.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.300
And just on Monday, our
iOS and Android.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.870
It was a simple process.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.450
Well-documented, great
communication, and we're

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:02.120
excited to continue
iterating on that.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.440
So you see on that first slide,
and on that one right

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.660
there as well, that
accessibility early on from an

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.650
onboarding perspective,
we think that's great.

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.000
What we also did, if you want
to go to the next slide--

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.490
this is a basic navigation when
people enter our name,

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.640
SoundCloud, in Google search.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.990
One of the things that we think
is really interesting is

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.920
that when people are looking for
SoundCloud starting from

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.100
Google, they're looking
for content.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.110
And what we want to do is we
want to have a hook to that

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:43.000
content that they're aware of
and can click and get a deep

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.970
link to that.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.540
And suddenly be surprised by
content that may be really

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.470
popular on SoundCloud and
immediately get to that.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.200
And Google+, with this
integration, if you see on the

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.970
next slide, provides us
with a very good hook.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:02.460
Every day folks start their
navigation from Google.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:04.480
I'd love it to start on
SoundCloud, but they start

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.720
everywhere else as well.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.620
And if they're looking for
something to be able to

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.820
provide them a link
right there--

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.830
and if you see on the right
side, underneath our logo,

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.890
there's a link to an "Economist"
article.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:22.310
"Economist" has been working
with us for about two years.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.570
They have Economist Radio,
great content.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:28.000
And clicking on that drives
you right into SoundCloud.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.690
So you can immediately
interact with it.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.150
Listen to it, share it.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:36.120
And how we get to that content
on Google is because Google+

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.340
users are playing and sharing.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.720
And that activity gets moved
over to Google and helps

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.970
populate that.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.910
So we think being at the port of
entry, having a presence at

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.970
the port of entry there that
provides that deep link is

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:50.645
phenomenal.

00:10:50.645 --> 00:10:52.950
DANNY BERNSTEIN: It's a big deal
for Google, because we're

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:56.650
now able to work with a
SoundCloud or Fandango and

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.020
actually get activity
information that we can bring

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.260
in to places like Search.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.040
So this is an exciting new
data opportunity for us.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.530
And in the process, we're able
to add more links in Search.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.010
And so this is just
the beginning.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:12.880
But it's neat to have a showcase
like SoundCloud.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.130
All right, Robyn.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.850
ROBYN PETERSON: Great.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.230
Hey everybody.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:19.460
Robyn Peterson, CTO
of Mashable.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.150
And if you don't know what
Mashable is, basically, in a

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.250
nutshell, we're an extremely
social news site.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.800
So what that means is, we cover
the news that's trending

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.870
on social sites, like Twitter,
Facebook, Google+.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:37.370
But we also cover the news--
and this is almost more

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.586
important--

00:11:38.586 --> 00:11:43.480
the news and cultural nuggets
that are going to trend.

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:44.550
So going about a--

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.850
I'm going to give a little
bit of history here.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.620
But going back about a year, we

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.040
completely rebuilt Mashable.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.230
It's a custom Ruby
on Rails app.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.960
But down at its core, most
importantly, is something we

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.720
call the Velocity algorithm.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.880
And what the Velocity algorithm
really is is a set

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:00.740
of crawlers that go out to
places like Google+ and

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.080
Twitter and Facebook and bring
back all this great engagement

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.740
data around published
articles.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.010
We then dump that into a
predictive engine that we

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.220
created in-house.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.170
And it tells us, quite simply,
what's going to go viral in

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.460
about four hours.

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.600
So we use that information to
do all sorts of cool things.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.830
We have great dashboards for our
editorial team so they can

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:25.700
stay ahead of what's going
viral on social.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:28.220
But they also use that
to do cool things

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.040
like lay out our homepage.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.630
Our entire homepage and all of
our channel pages are all laid

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.510
out by our Velocity algorithm,
deciding which things are

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.270
going to go viral and promoting

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.680
those in bigger slots.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.050
So the reason I bring that up
this is for two reasons.

00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.280
If you want to go on to
the next slide, Danny.

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.910
So one, since we're so social,
and since we're really almost

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:53.040
becoming one with these social
networks that we cover, any

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.900
kind of barriers between where
the story starts--

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.100
which is on our site, where the
content is created and the

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.370
conversation begins--

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:04.390
to the place where the
conversation then propagates

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.730
and, in fact, multiplies.

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:09.560
And a place like Google+
is that exact place.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.660
So what we did here is we not
only integrated login and sign

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.220
in and registration--

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.960
it's very dramatic with
the music, isn't it?

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.550
DANNY BERNSTEIN: There's
something going on in the

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:19.030
other room that's incredible.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.078
ROBYN PETERSON: Yeah.

00:13:19.078 --> 00:13:20.364
You dim the lights and.

00:13:20.364 --> 00:13:22.355
I'll take you guys on a tour.

00:13:22.355 --> 00:13:23.600
DANNY BERNSTEIN: You move
like a live orchestra.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.570
[INAUDIBLE] playoff there,
it's amazing.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:24.801
ROBYN PETERSON: Yeah.

00:13:24.801 --> 00:13:26.051
Exactly.

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:28.370
I kinda liked that.

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.260
We could get it back, maybe.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:29.850
DANNY BERNSTEIN: Yeah,
it's nice.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.780
ROBYN PETERSON: So when you're
on Mashable and you're looking

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.200
at an article, you can
share that article,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.040
obviously, to Google+.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.280
When you do that, we're
going to do something

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.090
a little bit special.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:41.720
We're actually going to push
along some information to

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.320
Google+ such that, when someone
who's following you on

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.610
Google+ sees the article that
you just shared from Mashable,

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:52.620
when they come back, your
profile photo will be on the

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.510
Mashable article.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.590
And you will get credit, so to
speak, visual credit for being

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.920
the curator of that piece.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.040
And we're doing this for
a couple of reasons.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.240
But really, the main one--

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.030
well, there's actually two.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:10.470
So the top one there is that, in
news, there is a huge theme

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.760
in the user-generated space
called "curation."

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.350
The curator of a story is almost
as important as the

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.800
writer, the creator
of that story.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.920
Because the curator is the one
that picks that story up and

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.200
pushes it across the web,
creating this whole viral

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.440
snowball effect.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.340
So what we want to do is really
incentivize our readers

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.270
to become curators.

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.940
And we're doing that here
by putting their

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.190
profile photo up there.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.010
And as that link it shared
around on Google+ or on other

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.890
places, that curator
gets credit for it.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:39.660
Which is pretty neat.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:43.260
And you can see it here, next
to the primary image of this

00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:48.420
particular article, at Mashable
we identify these

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.670
things called microcontent
within every article.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:53.140
And those are the elements of
the article that are really

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.750
the most shareable.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.940
So in this case,
it's an image.

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.720
If someone shares that image,
the person who clicks and

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.180
comes back will actually see
the sharer's profile photo

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.930
right there and say this person
has shared it with you.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.610
And then here's an example of
what we call in the industry a

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:11.270
pull quote.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.560
But a quote on the article.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.770
This happens to be identified
by the writer of the article

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:16.930
as being a very shareable
element.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.750
And when this particular user
shared it off, and now we're

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.130
coming back and looking at it,
we can see that this person is

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:25.330
identified as actually
sharing the article

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:26.600
but from this quote.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.000
So this was the most shareable
element to that person in the

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.660
whole article.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.420
Which is kind of neat.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.970
It really kind of incentivizes
that person to keep sharing.

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.390
And then the other thing that
we did, going beyond these

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.540
slides, is now knowing what you
know about us that we know

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.570
everything was built on this
Velocity algorithm and that we

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:47.360
have this really cool display,
we actually just launched a

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.190
couple of days ago a
Google Glass app.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.480
If anybody has Google Glass in
the room, it'd be great if you

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.660
could connect to it.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:58.950
What we do there is when our
Velocity algorithm detects

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.910
something about to go viral, we
will send an alert to the

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.920
people who are wearing Glass who
have connected to our app

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.780
and tell them, hey this story
is about to go viral.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.960
And you can either read
that article aloud--

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.560
so have Google Glass
read it aloud.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.590
The whole article in your ear,
so you could stay up to date.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.370
And then you can also share
directly from Google Glass and

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:21.470
it will show up just
like this.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.720
So we're integrating it not only
on the site, but also in

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.580
Google Glass.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.500
And represented like this.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.960
Really giving credit
to the curator.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.400
DANNY BERNSTEIN: I think one
thing that I noticed and the

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.170
team noticed as we were
reviewing the Mashable

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:38.420
integration is that there is a
simple elegance to the way

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.670
that the sharing attribution
is displayed.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.940
Which is a striking change
from some of the original

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:47.876
social platform integrations,
where you would

00:16:47.876 --> 00:16:48.870
get a capture screen.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:50.480
You would have an aggressive
sign-up.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.240
So I want to hear a little
bit for you on that.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:56.010
Because it's as if you are
perhaps leaving some kind of

00:16:56.010 --> 00:17:00.550
user registration on the table,
but emphasizing, then,

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:02.520
the user experience and
things like that.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.810
ROBYN PETERSON: Well, at
Mashable, we have 25 million

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:08.329
monthly visitors.

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:13.020
And the ones that follow us on
social networks tend to have

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.180
anywhere from three to five
times the average number of

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.970
followers on those social
networks compared to the

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.250
average person.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:22.540
So what we're talking about
here is these really

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.160
high-clout with a "C"
social networkers.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.730
People who've who really have
big followings on the web.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.430
So in a sense, they're
power users.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.070
They're really power users
of the social web.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:36.320
So we feel that we really need
to be subtle when we integrate

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:37.420
these kind of elements.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.920
But also do it in a way that
actually rewards that curator.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.740
And that's what we really
aim for here.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:41.780
DANNY BERNSTEIN: Cool.

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:42.926
Awesome.

00:17:42.926 --> 00:17:43.310
Good stuff.

00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:46.060
Well, we're now going to move
into a little bit of a

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:46.740
discussion.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.700
And then we will have some time
for questions at the end.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.530
So just to let you guys know.

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.110
So one thing that I think is
really important for us is the

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:56.340
Google+ platform represents an
entirely new way that third

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:57.620
parties are working
with Google.

00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:59.540
And that's a big deal.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.120
We've had APIs like Maps that
are several years old.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.430
Of course we've had
a Search product.

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:05.040
Of course we've had
an Ads product.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.640
But the Google+ platform
is very new.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.500
And I think one thing I'd like
to hear from you guys, and

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.210
perhaps to get some thoughts
from the audience as well is,

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.700
how can Google become easier
for you to work with?

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:20.630
How can we be easier as
a potential partner?

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.100
As a potential platform?

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.120
As a potential developer
experience

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:24.970
and things like that.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:29.470
I'd love to have you
guys opine on that.

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.700
Jessica?

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.540
JESSICA YI: I'll go first.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.040
DANNY BERNSTEIN: All right.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.080
JESSICA YI: Well, you said,
"easier." But I think being

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.070
effective is something that
we're thinking about.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.080
We've talked about the life
cycle of the customer and the

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.090
different touchpoints that a
user could have with Fandango

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:46.810
in the various phases.

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.960
And how Fandango experiences
represented across the Google

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.310
platforms could manifest
differently.

00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:55.810
So one of the things I think
is really important is to

00:18:55.810 --> 00:19:00.660
think holistically about how
Fandango and Google appear to

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.050
the customer in the different
life cycles.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.970
So perhaps on an opening
weekend, which is kind of the

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.780
height of our value, when
you're doing a search on

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.930
Google, you're seeing
what's hot, what's

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.450
selling this weekend.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.110
Earlier on in a different
context for a different

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.840
keyword or something,
we could be

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.630
servicing content for discovery.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.140
And again, back to the other
touch points, like how does it

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:25.880
appear on Gmail?

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.790
Or how does it appear in Search
and other platforms?

00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:32.260
So it would be great to paint
a holistic picture for the

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.820
user and say, what's the best
way we could work together to

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.100
create that kind of collective
experience as opposed to

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:41.100
looking at it from a
product standpoint.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.460
And then seeing how you can
apply it back to the business.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.630
DANNY BERNSTEIN: That's
interesting.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:49.340
When we often talk to companies,
they tell us that

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.180
things like user registration,
like sharing, like identity,

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.430
are really, really hard.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:55.660
And they're looking to
Google to help solve

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:56.410
some of those things.

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:57.700
But in reality, those
things have been

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.630
really hard for Google.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.270
And part of what Google+ is, as
we think about how we work

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.670
with partners, is that it is
a common sense of identity

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.870
across all of Google.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.940
It's a common way to share
across all of Google.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.540
It's a common notification
system across all of Google.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:13.350
And it's a common system
of friends.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.710
And two years ago, those
things did not exist.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.540
So we have products like
the little red

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:19.610
notification square.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.100
And so the fact we're now able
to unify these products, and

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.760
that there's a common set of
rules and systems and APIs,

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.540
that makes things a heck
of a lot easier.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.910
So that's sort of how we've
thought about it.

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:34.990
ROBYN PETERSON: And I would say
on our side, just building

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.240
on what you're talking about
there, Danny, this notion of

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.180
multifaceted identity, I think,
really needs to be

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.020
understood by Google.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.910
And that's quite simply--

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:46.850
just taking me as the example.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.610
So I have my personal account.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.090
And that's what I've
set up Google+ on.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.680
And that's where I'm posting
all my kid photos and all

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:55.130
those things like that.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.330
And then at Mashable, we're
Google Apps customers, so I

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.540
have my @mashable.com
version of me.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.350
And that's my business me and
my personal me, and I keep

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.470
having to flip accounts
constantly.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:08.410
DANNY BERNSTEIN: And I know
you also have your

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.220
breakdancing account as well.

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.000
ROBYN PETERSON: Yeah.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.560
Well, that's all
animated .gifs.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.430
So that's a little easier.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:21.230
But if there was this understood
notion that I'm

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.920
more than just one email
account, so to speak--

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.820
there's a personal side to me,
there's a business side of me.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:33.280
And how does Google understand
that both of those exist?

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.710
DANNY BERNSTEIN: I think we've
heard quite a bit of that this

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.010
week in a lot of different
sessions.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.520
Is how to reconcile those, and
also what is the data that

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.990
you're missed that's missing
and things like that.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:45.080
So we've heard that one
loud and clear this

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.370
week, quite a few times.

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:47.400
It's good.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.820
MANOLO ESPINOSA: So my thoughts
are less on the

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.580
technology side but more
on partnerships.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.930
We work with, for example, a lot
of content creators that

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:57.970
are journalists.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.870
And they want to work with us
because we can help get their

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:05.180
content across other social
networks in a

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.230
really, really easy way.

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.920
And they, like a lot of people,
see Google as an

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:14.020
amazingly large company with so
many different touchpoints.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.770
And they look to us to help
connect them to that.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:22.820
I think a good example is how
we can work with this

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.620
integration and how that ties
into Google News, for example.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.450
And this is a relationship.

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:30.540
You start working
on something.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:31.150
You iterate.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.070
You get better over time.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.720
You see other opportunities.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.530
And any of those opportunities
that we can then pass along to

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.170
our creators is a huge
opportunity, therefore, for us

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:44.380
to make something very big and
change the way people discover

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:45.950
and share that content.

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:50.620
It is an interesting thing when
you are looking at taking

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.510
something that's so socially
connected and connect it

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.160
across a company as
large as Google.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.390
And I think anything that the
organization can do to help

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:02.640
clear that up is very useful.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.070
DANNY BERNSTEIN: Great.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.500
Awesome.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:08.480
So one last question, and then
I think we'll open it up to

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:11.740
the audience, is when you're
approaching decisions like

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.100
this, how are you--

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.560
and we heard from Jessica
on this point earlier.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.690
But how are you arousing
consensus and approaching

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.230
something like this?

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:23.150
And you guys, at this point,
are anywhere from 50 to

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:24.980
several hundred people inside
of your companies.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.070
And then are taking adding
a new sign-in option.

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.890
That's significant.

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.060
How did you think about that?

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.850
How are you are you thinking
about the process before?

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.190
And then also how are you
thinking about it in terms of

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.470
assessing value?

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:37.490
ROBYN PETERSON: I think
this one was kind of a

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:38.640
no-brainer for us.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:42.240
We already had Google+ Sign-In,
the previous version.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.380
And we have a very strong
Google audience.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.070
Over 2 million likes,
I believe, on

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.280
Google+ on our main page.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:54.360
But then if you add up all
of our writers' personal

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.500
followings, and those sorts
of things, it's

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.850
some n times that.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:59.150
Some x times that.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:01.450
So we have a really
big following.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.610
And we know that the people who
are really going to enjoy

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:07.760
this feature are going to be
the power users of Google+.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.390
So for us, we derive so much
value from curators on the

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:15.980
web, people sharing our content,
that this is just one

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.760
more step we can take to
really accelerate that

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.060
MANOLO ESPINOSA: For us, it was
a combination of listening

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:25.050
to our users, who want things to
be super, super simple, but

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:26.670
also listening to our
content partners.

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:29.210
And we had heard loud and clear
that they wanted to be

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.430
able to have integration and
embedding and experience there

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.950
with Google+.

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.000
Listening to those two parties,
and then, clearly,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.270
working within an organization,
our priorities,

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.760
our road map, it's packed
all the time.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.710
We are always struggling
with that.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:49.740
This one was, I think, the
combination of just prudent

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.890
risk-taking, honestly.

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:54.000
Looking at, does this make sense
for us, and having a

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.140
leap of faith, and saying,
look, I think--

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.430
DANNY BERNSTEIN: And in this
case, working across a couple

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.410
different time zones as well.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.320
MANOLO ESPINOSA: Time zones.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.300
Multiple offices.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.420
We decided to do it across
all our web app,

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.460
mobile apps, et cetera.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:10.990
Just a lot of the things that
had to synchronize.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.130
And ultimately, we thought that
by listening to what our

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:15.130
users wanted and our content
partners wanted,

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.380
that was good thing.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:18.790
DANNY BERNSTEIN: All right.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:20.640
Well, we definitely have some
time for questions.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.230
So anybody in the audience want
to ask questions for our

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:25.480
panelists here?

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.040
Nobody?

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:30.180
Oh.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.590
We've got somebody here.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.809
I think you're first.

00:25:34.809 --> 00:25:36.059
AUDIENCE: First!

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:41.110
All the screen shots that you
shared, there was a big red

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.170
button alongside a
big blue button.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.260
How does, specifically, Google+
compare to other

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:53.320
networks or social
media platforms?

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.930
Does it bring more value to you,
or how does it compare?

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.750
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.580
ROBYN PETERSON: Yeah, sure.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.120
You know, we do see

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.660
differences between the networks.

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:09.730
But to be honest, there's
a few different

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.260
users that we see.

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.580
There's users who are just
hardcore Google+ users,

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.100
hardcore Twitter users hardcore
Facebook users.

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:23.090
But I think those users
are actually

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.880
somewhat rare in our world.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.520
I think we see more poly-network
users, so to

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.710
speak, where they're using a
bunch of different networks.

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.170
And they use them for
different things.

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:33.730
So for instance, to throw one
out that we didn't talk about

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:34.730
here, how about LinkedIn.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:38.430
So LinkedIn performs very well
for Mashable when we're

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:42.070
talking about trends in the job
market, or something about

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.620
how to use some certain aspect
of social in your career.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.250
It's not it's not uncommon for
those particular stories to be

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.790
at the top of the charts
for LinkedIn.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:53.260
Google tends to do well.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.410
The Google users tend to
really enjoy Google I/O

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:58.330
content, for one.

00:26:58.330 --> 00:27:00.540
That's doing-- yeah, who
would have known?

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:01.580
That's doing quite
well for us.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.090
But there's just different
personas with each network.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:08.150
And we see them ebb and flow
based upon that content.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.690
DANNY BERNSTEIN: We have
heard from a couple of

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:10.470
partners this week.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:13.670
So many of these integrations
are just brand new.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.330
And this product actually
only launched

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.810
at the end of February.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:19.420
But three notable stats I heard
this week from partners

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.500
that are now OK to share.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:25.670
One is that "The Guardian," the
UK newspaper, shared that

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.560
on their Android app, that
Google+ is now the preferred

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.300
option of users.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:33.000
It's 41 percent of their social
login, and that's the

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.610
biggest number.

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.400
And I heard from both Flixster
and SkillPages that,

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.070
basically, their social logins
are evenly divided now between

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.320
Google+ and Facebook.

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.420
It's really interesting,
especially because Facebook's

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.560
option launched four years ago
and we've been in the market

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.120
for now less than
three months.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:56.800
So we think we think having
user choice is a really,

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.250
really good idea.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:00.310
And there actually are
very different use

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.240
cases for both of those.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.820
So generally speaking, we
think choice is good.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.431
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:06.431 --> 00:28:08.235
Thanks.

00:28:08.235 --> 00:28:08.690
AUDIENCE: Check.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:09.770
Hey, guys.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.290
I was wondering if you could
talk a little bit about the

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.230
content personalization for us
publishers in the audience.

00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:18.620
Like for Fandango, and
SoundCloud, and Mashable, we

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.590
saw some of the things-- like
with Mashable, how you said

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.100
the user really liked this
piece of the article.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.130
Are we going to see more
homepage landings personalized

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:29.060
based on a social sign-in?

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:29.480
ROBYN PETERSON: Yeah.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.770
It's a great question.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:34.540
I think that's going to be a big
part of what you see for

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.880
Mashable coming over
the next year.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:39.560
If you think about what we've
done so far, we're just

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.220
watching, in a sense,
macro-trends of what's

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.220
happening with content.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.050
So this kind of article
is about to go viral.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:47.850
And that one is too.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.030
But really, the more interesting
nugget is, within

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:53.180
your group of friends, maybe
this one's going viral but

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:54.460
your friends haven't
seen it yet.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.830
That would be fantastic
for us.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.700
And these are the kinds of
things that we're going to try

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.650
to tackle at Mashable.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.000
And I think that goes
right to the sweet

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.980
spot of your question.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:03.200
DANNY BERNSTEIN: All right.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.780
One question for you, Robyn,
related to that is Mashable

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.710
adopting these things early.

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:09.880
Are you engaging with other
media companies now who are

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.890
kind of saying to you, well,
you're using this with social

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:14.540
login, hey, how do we do this?

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.490
Can you productize it?

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:16.300
That kind of stuff?

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:16.660
ROBYN PETERSON: Yeah.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.140
Yeah.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:19.410
We actually have heard
that a lot.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.090
We've heard that a lot about
Velocity in particular, can we

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.800
productize that.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.550
It's something that we're
thinking about.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.360
It's something you could
see from us over the

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.550
next year or two.

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:31.660
We're not sure.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.390
But we actually spend a lot of
time working with other media

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:40.410
companies just trying to get
out of our competitive mind

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:44.960
spaces and work together to
advance media in general.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.290
Because it's a tough landscape
right now, right?

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:55.000
68% of ad dollars for display
ads goes to 5 companies that

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.890
are historically thought of
as the top tech companies.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.120
Which means that this pie
that's left for media

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:02.440
companies to go after is getting
smaller and smaller.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.430
So all us media companies need
to work together and start

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.910
thinking more like
tech companies.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:07.820
And that's really how
we're going to

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.500
get ahead and survive.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.800
JESSICA YI: I have one thing
to add to that on

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.220
the Fandango side.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:18.360
For content recommendations and
movie recommendations, you

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.740
could have a Netflix-like
algorithm for that based on

00:30:21.740 --> 00:30:22.770
past purchase history.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:25.790
But a lot of it's based on my
circle of friends might have

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:29.330
similar tastes to me, and that
we could make recommendations

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:33.500
based on your friends who've
watched certain trailers or

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.260
purchased tickets, or certain
genre interests.

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:40.290
And then we can additionally
curate content for upcoming

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.610
movies and movie news and
casting information.

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:46.040
Things like that, based on
your interest levels.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:48.150
MANOLO ESPINOSA: And for
us, it's really new.

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.710
We're just pushing on this.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.030
We have been working on
recommendation stuff.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:55.140
But that's the power of
innovating, right?

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.110
You lean forward.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:57.260
You try something.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.060
You iterate.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.790
If it's something you really
care passionately about, come

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:02.020
work with us.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:02.680
We're hiring.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:04.505
That's something that we're
always interested in, getting

00:31:04.505 --> 00:31:06.170
other people's perspectives.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.390
DANNY BERNSTEIN: Content
recommendations, I think, is

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.530
one of the hardest things
for publishers to build.

00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:14.040
And so we've spoken now to
dozens of publishers.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.980
And they all have a very stated
desire to innovate

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.760
around content recommendations
and

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.920
personalization of content.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.450
That being said, those tech
resources always seem to get

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:26.650
diverted to building video
ads and things like that.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.330
So that's really, really
challenging.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.610
That being said, we launched
a content-recommendations

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:35.290
product for mobile websites
just a couple of days ago.

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:36.530
It's live on "Forbes."

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.450
So that's an area we're also
really excited about.

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.580
And you'll see a steady wave of
innovation around that from

00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:45.340
Google, because we really
want to democratize that

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.130
capability.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.850
Because it is so hard.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:48.590
It's so hard to do.

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.530
It's so difficult
to integrate.

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.050
It really is.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:55.070
It's reserved for the heavily,
heavily-resourced few.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:57.310
And we want to try
to change that.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:59.950
MANOLO ESPINOSA: And I think it
also goes to point that you

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.780
don't, therefore, want to spend
those resources doing

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:05.570
things like complicated
sign-ins.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:06.730
You want to do an
easy sign-in.

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.290
You don't want to have to
worry about how to force

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.430
people to do installs.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.240
You doing an over-the-air
install with Android.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.900
You go for the simple things
that are all tied together in

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:15.910
one package.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.680
Then you can deploy those
resources on things that are

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.404
really, really tough.

00:32:20.404 --> 00:32:22.270
DANNY BERNSTEIN: All right.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:24.544
Any other questions?

00:32:24.544 --> 00:32:25.480
All right.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:27.880
Well, thank you guys so much
for doing this and for

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.000
participating here, for being
in our Sandbox, and for

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.870
integrating so early.

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:31.680
We really appreciate it.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.730
So thank you.

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:33.180
JESSICA YI: Thank you.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.430
ROBYN PETERSON: Thank you.
