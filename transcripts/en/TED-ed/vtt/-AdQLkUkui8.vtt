00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.480
Charles Osborne began to hiccup
in 1922 after a hog fell on top of him.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.860
He wasn't cured until 68 years later

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.930
and is now listed by Guinness as
the world record holder

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.001
for hiccup longevity.

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.641
Meanwhile, Florida teen Jennifer Mee

00:00:25.641 --> 00:00:28.951
may hold the record 
for the most frequent hiccups,

00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:34.381
50 times per minute 
for more than four weeks in 2007.

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:37.601
So what causes hiccups?

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:41.871
Doctors point out that a round
of hiccups often follows from stimuli

00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:43.781
that stretch the stomach,

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:45.052
like swallowing air

00:00:45.052 --> 00:00:48.176
or too rapid eating or drinking.

00:00:48.176 --> 00:00:51.616
Others associate hiccups 
with intense emotions

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:53.442
or a response to them:

00:00:53.442 --> 00:00:54.172
laughing,

00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:54.900
sobbing,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.846
anxiety,

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:57.641
and excitement.

00:00:57.641 --> 00:01:00.324
Let's look at what happens when we hiccup.

00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:05.623
It begins with an involuntary spasm
or sudden contraction of the diaphragm,

00:01:05.623 --> 00:01:08.142
the large dome-shaped muscle
below our lungs

00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:10.611
that we use to inhale air.

00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:15.361
This is followed almost immediately
by the sudden closure of the vocal chords

00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.032
and the opening between them,

00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:19.082
which is called the glottis.

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:23.263
The movement of the diaphragm
initiates a sudden intake of air,

00:01:23.263 --> 00:01:27.250
but the closure of the vocal chords
stops it from entering the wind pipe

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.922
and reaching the lungs.

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:32.692
It also creates the characteristic sound:
"hic."

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:36.603
To date, there is no known function
for hiccups.

00:01:36.603 --> 00:01:40.652
They don't seem to provide any medical
or physiological advantage.

00:01:40.652 --> 00:01:46.972
Why begin to inhale air only to suddenly
stop it from actually entering the lungs?

00:01:46.972 --> 00:01:48.279
Anatomical structures,

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:51.712
or physiological mechanisms, 
with no apparent purpose

00:01:51.712 --> 00:01:54.874
present challenges 
to evolutionary biologists.

00:01:54.874 --> 00:01:59.493
Do such structures serve some hidden
function that hasn't yet been discovered?

00:01:59.493 --> 00:02:02.454
Or are they relics 
of our evolutionary past,

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:04.523
having once served some important purpose

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:09.517
only to persist into the present 
as vestigial remnants?

00:02:09.517 --> 00:02:11.285
One idea is that hiccups began

00:02:11.285 --> 00:02:14.803
many millions of years
before the appearance of humans.

00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:19.155
The lung is thought to have evolved
as a structure to allow early fish,

00:02:19.155 --> 00:02:23.394
many of which lived in warm, stagnant
water with little oxygen,

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:28.144
to take advantage of the abundant oxygen
in the air overhead.

00:02:28.144 --> 00:02:31.414
When descendants of these animals
later moved onto land,

00:02:31.414 --> 00:02:36.574
they moved from gill-based ventilation
to air-breathing with lungs.

00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:41.814
That's similar to the much more rapid
changes faced by frogs today

00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:44.198
as they transition 
from tadpoles with gills

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:46.425
to adults with lungs.

00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:51.414
This hypothesis suggests that the hiccup
is a relic of the ancient transition

00:02:51.414 --> 00:02:53.996
from water to land.

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:56.975
An inhalation that could 
move water over gills

00:02:56.975 --> 00:03:02.507
followed by a rapid closure of the glottis
preventing water from entering the lungs.

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:03.857
That's supported by evidence

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:08.284
which suggests that the neural patterning
involved in generating a hiccup

00:03:08.284 --> 00:03:13.996
is almost identical to that responsible
for respiration in amphibians.

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:18.187
Another group of scientists believe
that the reflex is retained in us today

00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:21.705
because it actually provides
an important advantage.

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:25.325
They point out that true hiccups
are found only in mammals

00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:28.826
and that they're not retained in birds,
lizards, turtles,

00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:32.835
or any other exclusively 
air-breathing animals.

00:03:32.835 --> 00:03:38.033
Further, hiccups appear in human babies
long before birth

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:41.457
and are far more common in infants
that adults.

00:03:41.457 --> 00:03:43.187
Their explanation for this

00:03:43.187 --> 00:03:47.447
involves the uniquely mammalian 
activity of nursing.

00:03:47.447 --> 00:03:50.737
The ancient hiccup reflex may have been
adapted by mammals

00:03:50.737 --> 00:03:55.761
to help remove air from the stomach
as a sort of glorified burp.

00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:59.607
The sudden expansion of the diaphragm
would raise air from the stomach,

00:03:59.607 --> 00:04:04.858
while a closure of the glottis would
prevent milk from entering the lungs.

00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:08.287
Sometimes, a bout of hiccups will go
on and on,

00:04:08.287 --> 00:04:10.677
and we try home remedies:

00:04:10.677 --> 00:04:13.538
sipping continuously 
from a glass of cold water,

00:04:13.538 --> 00:04:15.009
holding one's breath,

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.238
a mouthful of honey or peanut butter,

00:04:17.238 --> 00:04:19.228
breathing into a paper bag,

00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:21.709
or being suddenly frightened.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.229
Unfortunately, scientists have yet
to verify that any one cure

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.097
works better or more consistently
than others.

00:04:29.097 --> 00:04:33.409
However, we do know one thing
that definitely doesn't work.
