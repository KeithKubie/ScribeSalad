00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.750
If you had to buy a new car every time you
had to go somewhere, you'd be broke by Tuesday.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.570
So, why not apply the same logic to space
travel.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.730
90s kids will remember the space shuttle launches
that ferried astronauts and cargo to the ISS.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.370
But even the reusable shuttle was expensive,
and so the program ended in 2011.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.730
According to the founder of SpaceX, Elon Musk,
the shuttle was too complex, and money could

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.250
be saved if the rocket was simplified.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.250
Simplifying a rocket.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.110
How hard could that be?

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.099
Well, after few crash landings and explosions,
SpaceX seems to have the self-landing reusable

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.449
rocket thing figured out.

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:36.820
So, does this make space travel cheaper?

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.230
Space shuttle missions cost about 450 million
dollars per launch, and while that sounds

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.570
like a lot more than SpaceX’s price of $133
million, you have to remember the Space Shuttle

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.800
was a beast of a craft, capable of carrying
50,000 pounds of cargo AND 7 crew members.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.539
Broken down by the pound Shuttle flights cost
about 10,000 dollars whereas a SpaceX Dragon

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.030
stuffed to the gills costs 9,100 dollars for
every pound of cargo.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.900
That’s well shy of Musk’s ultimate goal
of bringing down the cost of space travel

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.539
by a at least a factor of 10.

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.180
But, he hopes to hit those numbers by launching
more cargo at once on their next rocket, the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.350
Falcon Heavy.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.259
For now SpaceX has started launching reused
Falcon-9 rockets and says the cost of refurbishing

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.170
one is less than half of building one from
scratch.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.350
They still have to recoup their investment,
but eventually Musk says prices will drop.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.810
The thing is, SpaceX is competing for government
contracts with another company called United

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.890
Launch Alliance or ULA, a joint venture of
Lockheed-Martin and Boeing.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.060
Based on the US Air Force’s 2018 budget
estimate, it looks like ULA will charge 422

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.460
million dollars per launch in 2020.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.259
SpaceX, on the other hand, has done similar
jobs for only 83 million dollars.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.950
So things are allegedly cheaper.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.299
Though, how much of that 300 million dollars
difference is down to the rocket, is up for

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.299
debate.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.200
In fact, the Government Accountability Office
has criticized ULA for a lack of transparency

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.360
on pricing.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.069
While some would argue ULA charges that much
because they’re up against the margin and

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:05.920
can’t cut costs, Musk thinks they charge
that much because they can.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.180
They used to have no competition, their launch
record is outstanding, and the satellites

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.920
they’re launching cost billions, so what’s
a few hundred million dollars between friends?

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.330
While the Department of Defense can accept
the higher launch costs because their budget

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.480
is bigger than God’s, NASA is, by comparison,
a poor pauper that has to make a lump of coal

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.690
last the winter.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.430
In 2015 NASA received 34 times less money
than the DOD.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.160
So, if SpaceX can save NASA money, it would
be an ideal partnership.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.520
The next thing NASA needs is a way to transport
people.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.760
SpaceX’s unfinished Dragon 2 spacecraft
is designed to carry people at a price of

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.060
58 million dollars per seat.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.900
Pretty good considering the only other ride
to the ISS is aboard a Russian Soyuz, and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.680
since the shuttle’s retirement they’ve
been hiking the price.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.350
They’re planning to charge 81 million dollars
a seat next year.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.900
I for one hope he does manage to get that
price down, because I don’t think I can

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.050
save up 58 million dollars before I die.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.720
Maybe I should invent some sort of service.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.550
Like an easy way to pay my pals or something.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.470
I don’t know, get back to me on this one,
Elon.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.180
Thanks for watching, if you like what you

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.180
button.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.290
If you bought a ticket to space, how high
would you have to go before you technically

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.290
got there?

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.500
Trace tells you where space starts here.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.020
So would you hitch a ride on a rocket if you
could?

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.409
Let us know in the comments, and thanks for
