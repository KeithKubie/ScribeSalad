JESSE HAINES: Hi, everyone.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.480
It's great to see all
of you here today.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.867
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:08.700
My name is Jesse Haines
and I'm the director

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.740
of Google Goods, which is
a product and marketing

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.840
group that focuses on building
tech accessories for Android.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.110
And it is my great
pleasure today

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.390
to have the opportunity
to introduce all of you

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.340
to Jessica Herrin, the founder
and CEO of Stella &amp; Dot Family

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.990
Brands.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.810
Prior to Stella &amp;
Dot, Jessica cofounded

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.291
the WeddingChannel.com when
she was at Stanford Business

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:39.790
School.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.450
She also attended
Stanford for undergrad.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.570
She has won all manner
of awards and accolades,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.130
been on "Oprah" and "The
Wall Street Journal,"

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.090
all over the place.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.700
And now in addition to being
an entrepreneur and a CEO,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.340
Jessica is an author.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.450
And her first book, "Finding
Your Extraordinary,"

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.290
is debuting this month.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.540
So we are so thrilled to
have you here with us today

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.135
at Google Jessica.

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:11.635
Welcome.

00:01:13.704 --> 00:01:15.370
JESSICA HERRIN: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.470
I think you might
need to sit there.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.610
JESSE HAINES: Oh,
OK, let's switch.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.193
JESSICA HERRIN: Not
that I have a side

00:01:19.193 --> 00:01:23.050
in anything other than audio.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.730
Hello Googlers.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.430
It's great to be with you.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.130
JESSE HAINES: Thank you again
so much for being here today.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.689
So Jessica, we have a
couple of things in common.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:33.730
JESSICA HERRIN: Our name?

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.480
JESSE HAINES: Our
name, Jesse, Jessica.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.290
So that's exciting.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.560
And we also are both
involved with accessories.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.200
I, tech accessories,
just getting started,

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.840
and you have built an
accessories empire, which we're

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.820
excited to hear all about.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.840
So I want to talk a
lot about the book,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.750
but maybe we could start by just
hearing a little bit about how

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.640
it all began.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.680
You've been an entrepreneur
since you were very young.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.320
So tell us a little
bit about how

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.060
you got from your beginnings
to where you are today.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.460
JESSICA HERRIN: Well when
I started my career out

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.790
of college and I think about
how incredibly fortunate I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.190
am to have been born in the
US and going to school right

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.350
at the time when women
earned degrees equal to men,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.420
and I go to school in
the heart of Silicon

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.339
Valley, the commercialization
of the internet,

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:31.880
right when Google
was being formed as

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.670
well, in the same neighborhood.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.040
And so in many ways I think you
could have walked into a pole

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.820
and become an entrepreneur
in that climate

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.694
and that environment.

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:42.190
And that was
certainly my interest.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.650
And out of school, I went to
work for technology startups.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.700
And I learned a
tremendous amount.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.460
I loved what being in
enterprise software,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.770
at the time, allowed
me to do, because I

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.760
did a whole bunch of things that
I had no business doing inside

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.560
of a small company.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.059
And I never really felt like I
had to be qualified to go do.

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.880
I had to go do it
to get qualified.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.080
And so it was a great hyperdrive
experience early in my career.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.874
And then I went back to
business school at Stanford.

00:03:11.874 --> 00:03:13.790
And I really went there
to be an entrepreneur.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.410
So when I wrote
the business plan

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.590
for what became
WeddingChannel, we actually

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.890
got called out in a
competition by Kleiner Perkins

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.100
and ended up getting
funded before I graduated.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.790
So I dropped out to do that.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.910
I went there to become
an entrepreneur,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.840
not to get a pedigree.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.580
So it didn't seem
like risk to me.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.060
It seemed like efficiency to
get that done at the time.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.800
And there was a real window
to jump through and start

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.950
that particular
business at that time.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.660
It was the idea for
WeddingChannel, which

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.590
is an aggregated gift registry.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.365
Think back at the time,
this was before retailers

00:03:47.365 --> 00:03:48.240
were on the internet.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.105
It was very much when Yahoo
ruled the world of search.

00:03:52.105 --> 00:03:54.520
So you can date
that in your minds.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.177
And so I worked at a
enterprise software company

00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:00.510
that was aggregating price
and availability for computer

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.290
parts.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.850
And I just sat
there and said OK,

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.340
what's going to go online early?

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.000
We don't have bandwidth.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.280
People don't trust in
ecommerce at the time.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.062
So how can you take that
and apply to the real world?

00:04:12.062 --> 00:04:13.020
I'm like gift registry.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.020
Gift registry, somebody's
already picked it out.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.529
The shopper doesn't care.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.490
It's just a price based
on the relationship.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.670
It's a large market.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.910
Technology isn't used
much by retailers.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.160
They're going to need somebody
to come in and show you

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.701
how to do it.

00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:26.660
So it was this very
analytical, textbook,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.140
find a market opportunity,
use technology to disrupt it.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.224
Build a software platform.

00:04:30.224 --> 00:04:32.140
And then we turned it
into a content platform,

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.970
and ultimately merged
with WeddingChannel,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.580
and then sold it to The Knot.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.830
So I did everything
right academically.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.900
And at the end of the day, did
not feel successful at all.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.710
I created commercial
success but didn't

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.180
care about the mission
of the company.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.562
And then I did the real
soul searching of saying OK,

00:04:49.562 --> 00:04:52.020
if I'm going to work that hard,
because at that time I did.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.980
I worked every day and night.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.340
I also wanted to
become a mother.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.450
Didn't know how I was going
to reconcile those two things.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.741
I wanted to make sure that
the next business I started,

00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:01.880
I felt soulfully
connected to the purpose.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.800
And when I was there, a lot
of people reached out to me

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.047
and said, what's your
best business advice?

00:05:07.047 --> 00:05:08.880
We'd been on "Oprah"
and the "Oprah" version

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.400
of the story looked great,
looked like the American dream.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.900
But the reality is
behind the scenes

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.483
it was a bit of an
American nightmare.

00:05:14.483 --> 00:05:16.580
And so I didn't have
good advice on how

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.310
to democratize
entrepreneurship, how

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.580
to create an experience
where I wasn't saying OK,

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.310
go get a specialized degree.

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.430
Raise venture capital.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.390
Work every night and weekend.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.348
I mean, what kind of
advice is that really when

00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:29.280
someone says what should I do?

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.370
So I wanted to think
about reinventing

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.260
the home based platform.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.320
Yet when I looked at that
industry, it felt very dated.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.210
It felt made for
a 1950s housewife,

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.360
and it did not use
technology at all.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.720
And so I just went
through this experience

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.310
of working with
the retail industry

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.380
and bringing in
ecommerce, knowing

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.252
that you could work
for direct selling,

00:05:48.252 --> 00:05:49.710
and recognizing
that technology was

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.170
going to completely change it.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.760
So what Stella &amp; Dot
really is, is a few things.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.910
It's taking my
technology background.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.700
First I say, of
everything, we're

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:59.120
not an accessories company.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.530
We're a people company
because it's purpose driven

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.570
and it's about creating
flexible work for women

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.730
and a few good men
and reinventing

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.320
flexible entrepreneurship.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.450
So we're people first.

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.410
We're a technology company
because we're really

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.650
a social selling
platform that spans

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.450
several brands across
women's lifestyle businesses.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.570
And we have a killer
design in product.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.620
But really it all
stemmed from my desire

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.910
to be incredibly connected
to the purpose in my work.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.720
And to do what I
learned in business

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.340
and as an entrepreneur,
but apply it to something

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.160
that really, head and
heart came together.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.550
JESSE HAINES: So
cool, and I love

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.250
this concept of sort of
democratizing entrepreneurship.

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.680
Tell us a little
bit about-- unpack

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.650
that a little bit in terms
of how this-- the model does

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.560
seem dated.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.509
How does technology
play into it?

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:53.550
I think that [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.966
JESSICA HERRIN:
It's mostly when I

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:57.480
look at just women in
business, and really people

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.580
who are impacted by
that, which is just

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.770
the children they're raising,
the partner that they're with.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.850
So much is enabled when there's
a little bit of extra income,

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.080
it could create a lot of
opportunity for people.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.260
So I knew that flexible
work had to exist.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.970
It has to exist for people
who-- 80% of our entrepreneurs

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.345
actually, this is
their side gig.

00:07:18.345 --> 00:07:20.803
They have other full or part
time jobs outside of the home.

00:07:20.803 --> 00:07:23.270
But they have incremental needs
that they need to pay for.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.940
So it's students who are working
during the summer, teachers

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.440
who need jobs outside of that.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.730
One of our leading
sellers is an OBGYN.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.900
And she does this
because in her day job,

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.864
she's so frustrated by the
lack of recognition and joy,

00:07:35.864 --> 00:07:37.530
even though she loves
delivering babies,

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.150
she hates administration
and bureaucracy

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.941
and always being told
her charts are wrong.

00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:42.140
And she loves this outlet.

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:44.600
And it also taps into
this other side of her.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.350
So there's a lot
of need out there.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.430
But if you look at the
models of the past,

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.300
there was almost
everything wrong with them

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.310
in terms of the
business model, it

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.644
would be too easy for the
person getting in the business

00:07:55.644 --> 00:07:58.018
to get in trouble and really
be in the business of buying

00:07:58.018 --> 00:07:59.480
inventory rather than selling.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.050
And you really take care
of that with policies

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.480
and ship to customer and
really just changing everything

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.490
about how we work as direct
to the consumer versus selling

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.580
through the distributor.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.290
So there's no quotas,
no territories,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.274
and completely flexible income.

00:08:14.274 --> 00:08:16.190
But with technology, if
you look at our newest

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.310
brand, Keep Collected, which did
$45 million in its first year.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:23.000
It's on the pace to
triple in its second year.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.825
If you're picturing
an old school party,

00:08:24.825 --> 00:08:25.700
that's not it, right?

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.977
They have a mobile app where
they do a virtual design.

00:08:27.977 --> 00:08:28.810
They personalize it.

00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.290
They share it to social.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.390
That gets [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.607
So it's all through
digital tools,

00:08:33.607 --> 00:08:35.690
because we're trying to
take this very busy person

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.611
and say OK, you
got an hour today?

00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:38.860
How do we make you productive.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.776
And that's why I fell
in love with technology.

00:08:40.776 --> 00:08:42.686
It's why I loved, as
nonsexy as it seems,

00:08:42.686 --> 00:08:44.560
that's why I freaking
loved making enterprise

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.910
software for bars
back in the day

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.310
because you take this
person and superpower them.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.394
They would have no information
at their fingertips

00:08:51.394 --> 00:08:53.226
and it would take them
a day to do something

00:08:53.226 --> 00:08:54.500
and it would be error prone.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.041
You could really
take that technology

00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:57.200
to superpower a person.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.640
So that's what we do
in our businesses.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.640
It may seem like it's softer
because its accessories,

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.400
but actually everything that
you're doing on the sales side

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.340
and really customizing
the experience--

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.100
and then there's also an
entire online university

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.180
and incentives platform.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.480
Because for flexible
entrepreneurship,

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.710
you've got very time
limited people that

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.610
need all motivation, no
management to go do something.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.220
And so all of the triggers
and the incentives

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.820
and the recognition
is really powerful.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.020
So knowing what it is, I
can tell if your sales are--

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.000
if your average event has a
few less orders than somebody

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.114
else's, I can look
at that and say,

00:09:35.114 --> 00:09:36.530
you're not inviting
enough people.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.321
I can look at the data
and say oh, you need

00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:39.670
training on hostess coaching.

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.250
I can also look at
the data and say,

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.874
I can see your average order is,
you're not finishing the look.

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.780
You need to let me
coach you on how to say,

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:47.230
would you like
earrings with that?

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.060
So there's just a lot of
power of using technology

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.870
in a classic model
to help that person.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.060
And why that's so
rewarding is that person

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.960
is trying to pay for
fertility treatments.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:01.860
So helping them be really
profitable is really rewarding.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.410
JESSE HAINES: So cool.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.950
So you are very
busy, and yet you

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.330
decided to write this
book in your spare time.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.580
Tell us a little bit
about what motivated

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.710
you to take the plunge
and put all your learnings

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.510
and guidance and--

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:20.590
JESSICA HERRIN: Well I
did not write that book

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:22.715
because I wanted to be an
author, that is for sure.

00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:26.080
I love my day job
as CEO, and that's

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.530
what I want to continue to do.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.950
So I became convinced to write
the book by the phenomenal team

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:33.870
that is here today
because I've come

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.770
to see that in the
businesses that I've created,

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.740
it has really not been just
because I've been successful,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.840
its been because I've had the
ability to develop success

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.930
in other people.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.060
And I've seen the story
unfold in which I've

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.420
come to believe that
there are some key traits

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.520
of an entrepreneurial spirit
that each one of us have.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.850
It's part of our human DNA,
and that you can hone it.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.680
And whether you want to
advance in your career

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.480
inside of a company,
whether you actually

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.600
want to start a
business, whether you're

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.510
leading in your community
and your family,

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.680
I believe these key
success traits can

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.060
be developed in other people.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.768
And by far the biggest
reward I've gotten

00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:10.389
is seeing an impact on
making somebody else more

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:11.430
successful in their life.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.104
And true success,
not just a title

00:11:13.104 --> 00:11:15.020
on your resume and money
in your bank account,

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.144
but happiness in your heart
and peace in your mind.

00:11:17.144 --> 00:11:19.070
So it became for
me an opportunity

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.720
to try to extend outside of
our community, where I've

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:25.870
seen it work thousands of times,
and help other people find

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.325
their extraordinary.

00:11:27.325 --> 00:11:28.840
We take an ordinary
person and help

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.751
them do extraordinary
things by cultivating

00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:33.250
their self-confidence, because
it has to start with a belief

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.791
that success is not
just for somebody

00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:37.590
else, that it is in fact for me
and that I can, in fact, change

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:38.760
the course of my life.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.440
And then put in
place a framework

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.360
of the six Ps of
entrepreneurship,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360
starting with passion.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:44.640
Got to have it.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.390
You've got to have a
path to make it real.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.270
You've got to have the
right positive mindset

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.353
so that you learn how to
see opportunities and not

00:11:50.353 --> 00:11:51.050
obstacles.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.406
Having the right
people around you

00:11:53.406 --> 00:11:55.530
to help lift you in other
ways make it, worthwhile.

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.946
The perseverance to keep going,
the productivity to get it

00:11:57.946 --> 00:11:59.386
all done in a day.

00:11:59.386 --> 00:12:01.010
So putting that
framework out in a book

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.315
is again to try to help other
people be a guide to creating

00:12:04.315 --> 00:12:05.065
their own success.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.559
JESSE HAINES: For
somebody who is working

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:13.100
in a corporate
structure-- and you've

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:17.850
told some of these
stories in the book-- how,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:23.050
when you're not necessarily
actually an entrepreneur but

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:24.810
working in a big
company like Google--

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:26.980
which obviously our culture
is very entrepreneurial,

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.440
but it's still a big company.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.630
How do you kind of
apply that framework

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:35.787
to a large corporate structure?

00:12:35.787 --> 00:12:37.120
JESSICA HERRIN: Well absolutely.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.060
So there's two things on that.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.570
First of all, you are
a leader and the world

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:40.730
is awaiting your instruction.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.188
And that has nothing to do with
the size company you're in,

00:12:43.188 --> 00:12:45.420
what your title is, and
what the org chart is.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:49.150
Leadership is something that
you unleash on the world.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.544
And opportunity accrues to those
who see that and believe that

00:12:52.544 --> 00:12:53.710
and act like that every day.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.780
And I had this experience,
which I am so grateful for,

00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:00.570
because more valuable than
I would say my education

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.210
was in a formal institution.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.180
After doing a startup
at the age of 24,

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.790
when I was really
naive and pretty

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.900
much knew very little-- even
though at the time, of course,

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.170
at that age person you
think you know everything--

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.450
a mentor said to me,
listen, if you ever

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.690
want to go run and
build a large company,

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.390
you should actually work at one.

00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:19.090
I only worked at tech startups.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.437
And I said, that sounds
like a good idea.

00:13:21.437 --> 00:13:24.020
So when I wanted to have a kid,
I followed my husband to Texas

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.060
where he went into
venture capital,

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.450
and I worked at Dell as
a middle manager at Dell.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:28.460
And there were some
of those things

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.710
where I felt like I lived
inside of a Dilbert cartoon.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:33.140
And that was an
incredible company.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.470
Google's one of the
world's best companies.

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.205
And yet, of course
it's a large company,

00:13:37.205 --> 00:13:39.080
so of course there's
bureaucracy and meetings

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.121
and all that other stuff.

00:13:40.121 --> 00:13:42.510
But let me tell
you, I couldn't be

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.710
doing what I'm doing today
had I not had that experience.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:48.720
But I also couldn't be
doing what I'm doing today

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.770
if I didn't show up every
day inside that organization

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:55.220
and be a leader and
be my best, and not

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.290
get frustrated by bureaucracy,
but find an opportunity

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:58.990
to add value.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.270
And I think that comes
from being raised

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.670
by a single dad who had
an immigrant mother who

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.740
was educated in the
fourth grade in Italy.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.170
He started having a paper route.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:12.050
He's an engineer now, got a
master's degree in engineering.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.704
But he had to work to
put food on the table

00:14:14.704 --> 00:14:17.370
when he was in the fourth grade,
and put himself through school.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.080
And so just this DNA
family we have, we

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.520
have this intense work ethic.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.930
Like if you were cashing
a check from somebody,

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.310
you don't act like, what
have you done for me lately.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.430
You show up and say,
how can I serve?

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.860
You got a problem,
I'll solve it.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.484
It's the Vanilla Ice
school of thought.

00:14:31.484 --> 00:14:33.080
Like OK, I am here.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.102
I am lucky to be here.

00:14:34.102 --> 00:14:35.560
I'm going to find
the biggest need,

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.643
and I'm going to solve it.

00:14:36.643 --> 00:14:39.420
And I think sometimes in a big
company you can get frustrated.

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.430
But if you go at it like look,
opportunity is all around me.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.220
How can I go add value
and be entrepreneurial

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:49.030
within that giant beast,
you will make it magnificent

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.000
and have a tremendous impact.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.074
So I think that big companies
are critical to a learning

00:14:54.074 --> 00:14:56.740
development, whether you want to
be an entrepreneur, whether you

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.286
want to make an impact.

00:14:58.286 --> 00:15:00.160
But being entrepreneurial
within that company

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.900
is really, really important.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:03.400
JESSE HAINES: Once
of the things you

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:07.170
talk about is success and
defining success for yourself

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.900
and not falling prey to
sort of society's definition

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:16.020
of success, which maybe
is measured more in kind

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:18.300
of money and promotions.

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.400
I love the way that
you actually define

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.060
the success of
your company, which

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.077
is I think how much
you paid out to--

00:15:24.077 --> 00:15:26.160
JESSICA HERRIN: The business
owners, that's right,

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.326
JESSE HAINES: --your
business owners.

00:15:29.326 --> 00:15:33.790
And I love that idea,
but it's hard in a world

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.284
where there is that societal
pressure around how much

00:15:36.284 --> 00:15:37.700
are you making,
when are you going

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.700
to get your next
promotion, and so forth.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.120
So what are some
tips that you offer

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:46.477
around kind of how people
can define their own success?

00:15:46.477 --> 00:15:48.560
JESSICA HERRIN: Well I did
it the wrong way first.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.320
I achieved success in
other peoples' eyes,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.640
and then I had this feeling
every day going, is that it?

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.530
And so I'd sit there
and think, oh I've

00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:57.696
checked off this resume.

00:15:57.696 --> 00:15:58.820
I've checked off this list.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.220
And yet, I'm not really happy.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.344
And life is short.

00:16:02.344 --> 00:16:04.760
And it's too short not to love
what you do, why you do it,

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:06.050
and who you do it with.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.490
And so if you're always
looking left-right

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.420
for external validation
on other people

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.660
saying I anoint
you successful, you

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.170
can feel like there's
something missing.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:19.630
And so I think that,
one, you've got

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.450
to be willing to ask yourself
these very big questions

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:25.020
and not be afraid of getting
the wrong answer, or the answer

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.478
that you don't
want, which is, do I

00:16:26.478 --> 00:16:28.400
feel soulfully
connected to what I do?

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.360
And if no one paid
me, would I bound out

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.026
of bed in the
morning to do this?

00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:34.900
Now I'm not saying you
should confuse passion

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.652
for a job on the
unicorn farm where

00:16:36.652 --> 00:16:38.860
you don't have to wash
windows and it's not hard work

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.000
or there's not meetings
and bureaucracy

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.570
that you put up with.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.860
But you just have to make
sure that the kernel there,

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.280
the core is really worthwhile.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.370
And so I had to quit
and go do something

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.290
that people thought
was crazy, right?

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.380
When I was the internet
poster child in Silicon Valley

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:57.000
and I quit to follow my job,
my husband's job to Texas,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.910
have a baby, become
a middle manager,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.060
and then started making
jewelry out of my living room,

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:04.859
I had to risk a lot of
people being like oh, there

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:10.079
goes another one dropping
out or doing something female

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.940
or saying something derogatory
about what I was doing.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.640
But at the end of the
day, I had to say look,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.790
there is a very short list of
people I am trying to impress,

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.469
and I am on that list.

00:17:20.469 --> 00:17:22.510
Other than that, it's the
few people that I love.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.780
We spend so much time trying
to impress other people,

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.730
and actually other people
don't even care that much.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:27.569
They're not even
thinking about you.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.069
They're too busy
thinking about what

00:17:29.069 --> 00:17:30.210
other people think of them.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:34.190
So I think you just have to
have a very active discussion

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:37.520
with yourself on
what matters to me.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.470
If I were to look past
my future I actually

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.360
outline very tactical
steps and exercises

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.330
in the book around mindfulness
and doing certain things

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.420
like asking your
future self what

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.130
you want to be
remembered for, working

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.630
backwards in time--
what will matter

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.750
to me at the end of this year?

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.500
Will I have done
[INAUDIBLE] to action it?

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.700
Because I think it's a
discipline to think that way.

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.430
It's not a, I go away
and have a spiritual guru

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.300
moment where someone
says, this is your path

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.341
and this is your passion.

00:18:01.341 --> 00:18:02.410
Aha, you're done.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.680
It's really a
practice that you keep

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.020
present in your life to make
sure that you are really

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:08.730
dreaming bigger.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:10.600
It sounds cheesy, but it's true.

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.880
You've got to ask yourself
these really bold questions

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.296
to come up with
the right answers.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.680
JESSE HAINES: You're a mom in
addition to all your many jobs.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.920
And you write in a
book about a time

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.850
when you asked another
female CEO for some advice

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.580
about starting a
company and having

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.840
a family at the same time.

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.880
And I believe her advice
to you was, don't do it.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.900
How did you react
to that advice,

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.484
and what is your
advice for women who

00:18:43.484 --> 00:18:44.650
want to do all these things?

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:46.400
JESSICA HERRIN: I'm very
honest about it, in the book

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.410
and in life in general.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:51.050
Because I love speaking
at business schools

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:54.670
and communities of younger
people in which they haven't

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:57.260
yet gone to that phase of
having family and work together,

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.764
and they often ask
me, well, tell me

00:18:58.764 --> 00:19:00.680
what was the sales
trajectory of the business?

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.990
What was really the
inflection point?

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.573
And they assume it's
access to capital

00:19:03.573 --> 00:19:04.800
or some change in the market.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.133
I finally stopped breastfeeding.

00:19:06.133 --> 00:19:07.860
I could really travel more.

00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:11.220
And when I had kids,
they really have you.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.550
You don't have them.

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:16.262
I was hesitant to do
my second business

00:19:16.262 --> 00:19:18.470
the way I did my first one
in which you raise venture

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.914
capital, you really commit
to somebody else's timeline

00:19:20.914 --> 00:19:22.330
around liquidity
and exit strategy

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.610
and growth of the business,
because I wasn't sure

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.240
how I would feel
as a working mom.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.700
So I very purposely went
slow those first couple years

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.090
and really focused on doing
out of my living room.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.270
One, because I knew the
business needed a soul.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.180
This type of business
really does benefit

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.260
from me being able to say look,
I did it out of my living room

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.630
while I was pregnant and
had another full time job.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:40.490
You can too.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.698
So I proved that to myself
and I proved it to others,

00:19:42.698 --> 00:19:43.920
and there was value in that.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.110
But when I had my
first daughter--

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:47.465
she's healthy as an ox now.

00:19:47.465 --> 00:19:49.090
So just so you know,
everything's fine.

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.465
But she needed to have heart
surgery when she was little.

00:19:51.465 --> 00:19:54.430
And so all of a
sudden your timeline

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:57.430
that's on some kind of pro forma
looks like-- like who cares,

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.930
right?

00:19:57.930 --> 00:19:59.700
I care only about this.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.830
So you need to be
able to recognize

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.590
that businesses are going
to ebb and flow around life.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.610
So I went to an investor.

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.210
This was easier for me to do
again as a serial entrepreneur,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.110
because I went back to a
partner who had been on my board

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.670
at WeddingChannel and said
look, I'm going to do something.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:16.754
I can't tell you how fast.

00:20:16.754 --> 00:20:19.378
But I can tell it's going to be
big and it's going to be great.

00:20:19.378 --> 00:20:21.460
And I know it's going to
change a lot of lives.

00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:23.210
And oh by the way, I'm
about to have another baby.

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:23.700
You in?

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.075
And luckily we had worked
together and he goes you're in,

00:20:26.075 --> 00:20:27.550
I'm in.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:30.602
But I very much have
communicated from day one

00:20:30.602 --> 00:20:32.560
that this was going to
be mission first, that I

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.730
was going to be a mom first.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.105
I still consider myself a mom
working, not a working mom.

00:20:36.105 --> 00:20:37.780
My family comes first.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.800
But it was really
challenging in the beginning.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.580
And the biggest challenge
of creating this business

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.950
was not competitors or product
or production or people,

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.910
it was my own internal
guilt as a working mom.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.170
Because type-A people that
are the type of people

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.920
that are going to go
be a driver and start

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.030
a business are very
hard on themselves.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.407
So I was that super mom
trying to make the baby food

00:21:00.407 --> 00:21:02.490
and do everything and greet
my husband with a kiss

00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:04.400
and make dinner, and
almost died alone on I

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.690
can do it all island.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.270
And I very much
disclose in the book

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.260
how I had to came to
that breaking point

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.810
with my husband
and partner and was

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:16.210
like OK, everyone's level of
service is being downgraded.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.670
And we are going to have
to rework how we do this.

00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:21.860
So there's a real honest
journey about what it's like,

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.650
and I think it's very
relevant to men and women.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.364
Because the idea that men are
taking paternity leave, I love.

00:21:29.364 --> 00:21:31.030
Because even 10 years
ago, that was just

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.260
never talked about or seen.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.220
So I think today's
group of people

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.450
are going to be far
more coparenting and far

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:39.670
more focused.

00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:41.660
It is really the bedrock
of life and happiness

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.130
is the people that you love.

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.870
And if you want those
people to be happy,

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.780
you've got to be really
thoughtful about what

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:49.280
load you're carrying,
how you're splitting it,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.680
and how you're able to
still be family first,

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.290
but not dim down your dreams,
and be able to have two

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.582
people with ambitious careers.

00:21:57.582 --> 00:21:59.790
JESSE HAINES: I want to talk
a little bit about that,

00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.090
but I also want to
let the audience know

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:07.920
that we want to open this up
for questions for Jessica.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.530
So feel free to start making
your way to the microphones

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:13.820
if you have questions.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:18.010
Just on the topic of working
it out with your partner,

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:20.900
obviously that's a really
important relationship.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:26.820
And with two working parents,
what are your tips there,

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.987
and how have you
negotiated with him?

00:22:29.987 --> 00:22:31.570
JESSICA HERRIN: Well,
so first of all,

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.740
I think there was another book
long ago, "Men are from Mars

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.850
and Women are from Venus,"
which seems to be very accurate.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:40.010
And what I learned
with my husband,

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.600
it was actually
advice given to us

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.720
by our reverend, which we kind
of rented one from the internet

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.960
to get married.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.000
So this was not like a
spiritual guider for us.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.744
But it ended up that
Reverend Vargas' advice

00:22:51.744 --> 00:22:53.160
during our ceremony
ended up being

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.620
the most pivotal in our marriage
when he told us that marriage

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.290
is about taking the
other person's burdens

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.610
and making them half as
heavy, and their joys

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.950
and making them double.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.586
And my husband would be will
willing to do that, but I

00:23:05.586 --> 00:23:07.460
was hoping that he would
just figure this out

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.050
or it should be so obvious
what he should be doing,

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.757
and why doesn't
he just intuiting

00:23:10.757 --> 00:23:12.840
that I'm doing too much
and he's doing too little.

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.170
And actually, you've really
got to be incredibly explicit.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:19.260
And so whence I was able
to clearly articulate, one,

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.650
I don't have to apologize
for being a mom who

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:22.840
wants to start a startup.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.470
That doesn't make
me less of a mom.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.200
I can feel great about how
I want to impact the world

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.590
and still feel great
about being a mother.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.470
So when I figured that out
and got over that guilt,

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.374
and then said to my husband,
look, this is what I want.

00:23:35.374 --> 00:23:36.790
This is how I'm
going to be happy.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.220
Can you help me?

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.070
And he does,
because he loves me.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:43.230
We've been happily married
for 17 years, together for 21.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.960
And we had to negotiate, OK,
this is what this looks like.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.620
Every time the kid
goes to the doctor,

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.490
it is not default
my responsibility,

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:55.630
and then maybe you could
do me a favor if I'm busy.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:57.710
It has to be an assumed
equal partnership.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:01.180
So I talk a lot about
that, like the real tactics

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:02.880
of negotiating that.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.470
But we've also traded off
at times in our career.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:06.620
I moved to Texas for him.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.252
He moved this.

00:24:07.252 --> 00:24:08.960
And I can tell you at
the end of my life,

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:14.580
I am not going to remember every
moment of what our revenue was

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:17.735
in that quarter or what
magazine we were on

00:24:17.735 --> 00:24:18.860
or business accomplishment.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.439
But I will remember, what
will be most valued to me

00:24:21.439 --> 00:24:22.730
are my children and my husband.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.890
And so I just always
keep grounded in the fact

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.010
that these are the people
that I want to make sure

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:27.730
I connect with.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:29.188
I think the other
thing that we all

00:24:29.188 --> 00:24:31.125
need, regardless of
what your role is,

00:24:31.125 --> 00:24:33.760
is remembering the
connection of quality time

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.420
and making sure that you're
still courting that person.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:39.570
When I come in, I'm
not on my phone.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.230
I am still hello handsome.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.090
And that's, I think,
really critical to keeping

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.190
any relationship
alive, not even just

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.900
a parenting one, spousal
one, and friends.

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.070
JESSE HAINES: So you are
a serial entrepreneur,

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:58.470
and you've built this business,
which is now just growing.

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:01.880
How do you continue to cultivate
your own entrepreneurial

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:02.460
spirit?

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:05.580
Do you at times want
to-- and obviously you've

00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.190
added new brands to the
Stella &amp; Dot family.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.720
How do you think about nurturing
that entrepreneurial spirit

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.880
while still growing
this big company

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.410
and balancing between the two?

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.610
JESSICA HERRIN: While as
the company has grown,

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.120
my role has changed
considerably.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.703
And I do think to
grow the company you

00:25:22.703 --> 00:25:25.380
need to grow yourself.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.185
I'm an entrepreneur by nature.

00:25:28.185 --> 00:25:29.560
And I often think
when people say

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:31.150
why'd you be an
entrepreneur, I don't know

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:32.420
I'm 5' 6 and I have brown hair.

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.440
It just turned out that way.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.315
I'm wired to do that.

00:25:34.315 --> 00:25:37.210
I've always looked around the
world and seen how I want to be

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:38.190
rather than how it is.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:40.640
And I have just almost
a tic like desire

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.440
to go fix it and change it.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.740
So that's how I started.

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.990
But to grow a
business and actually

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.360
not have it be about
just what you're doing,

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.360
it really is about other
people and shifting that

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.480
into cultivating the
entrepreneurial spirit

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.450
in others.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.650
And that's been
far more rewarding.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.920
You can get real bored
of yourself fast.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.574
And it's far more
rewarding for me

00:26:01.574 --> 00:26:02.990
to shine the light
on other people

00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:07.030
and watch them thrive as a
leader and an entrepreneur.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.610
So that's been my
focus now as a CEO.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.440
It's not our top line revenue,
it's the growth of our people.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.490
And it's yet still--
a friend of mine

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:22.440
who gave me the great
advice-- who actually told me,

00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.230
when I was struggling with, OK,
I've got nine direct reports.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:29.260
How do I manage this all--
was that just because you're

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:30.995
in charge, doesn't
mean you-- really,

00:26:30.995 --> 00:26:32.370
it sounds very
glamorous, but you

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.140
sort of default into
whatever hole you're missing.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.950
So you have sort of
20 jobs at all times.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:39.810
And I always start to change
the way I think about that.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.597
How do I make sure that I'm
doing enough of what I love?

00:26:42.597 --> 00:26:44.930
And yes, I'll take care of
these other responsibilities,

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.100
but there's nothing
wrong with going

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.150
to get other people
to go do these things.

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.110
And maybe you're
even better at them.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.007
But if you have a
comparative advantage

00:26:52.007 --> 00:26:53.840
in doing something else
that you uniquely do

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.360
or that feed your soul so
that you can have energy

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.610
to do all these other things,
that's a great strategy.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.890
So part of launching these other
brands and part of the role

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.280
that I play in them is
really feeding my need

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.730
to create from scratch,
yet also fulfilling

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.580
what I have found
to be-- I never

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:13.140
thought there would be
anything grander than being

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:14.340
an entrepreneur for me.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.160
But that's not true.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.580
I have found far more purpose
in being a true leader.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.550
In the early part
of my career, I

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.050
can tell you I sucked at that.

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:24.840
I was not a great
people leader, and I

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.298
share some of that
in that journey,

00:27:26.298 --> 00:27:28.400
and then ultimately
waking up and recognizing,

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:33.300
this is the way to make
an impact and grow.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.430
JESSE HAINES: Any questions
from the audience?

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:38.947
We've got plenty-- oh, great.

00:27:41.689 --> 00:27:42.610
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.490
This is more of a
tactical question I guess,

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.080
but you're obviously building
a lot of different kinds

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.330
of businesses.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:50.540
How did you go about
sourcing the things

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.670
you needed as far as
like manufacturers or web

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:54.496
development?

00:27:54.496 --> 00:27:56.514
How do you even start to
do that kind of stuff?

00:27:56.514 --> 00:27:58.180
JESSICA HERRIN: You
kiss a lot of frogs.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.900
You just go out there and
it's volume of activity.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.782
And so if you think about
the businesses I have done,

00:28:03.782 --> 00:28:05.240
first I was in
enterprise software.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.340
And if I knew
anything, it was just

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.720
about software development.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.921
And then to parlay
that into creating,

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:12.170
yes, a software company, an
internet consumer company,

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.320
but in the wedding space, I
had to go out there and find

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.530
everybody who was an
expert at weddings.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:16.446
And how did I do that?

00:28:16.446 --> 00:28:18.363
I literally, who do you
know that's in retail.

00:28:18.363 --> 00:28:19.862
Who do you know
that's in the thing?

00:28:19.862 --> 00:28:21.140
And I just kept asking.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.760
But it's that concept of
prospecting where you're

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:26.870
going to go ask 100 people
to find 10 that are relevant

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:29.940
and one who's going to turn
out to give you something

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.040
that you move forward on.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.440
So it's just a massive
amount of networking

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.550
and putting yourself
out there and being

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:38.885
willing to kiss a lot of
frogs, have a lot of meetings.

00:28:38.885 --> 00:28:40.510
Same thing when we
went into skin care.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.014
I started that
business the same way

00:28:42.014 --> 00:28:43.430
that I've started
every other one.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:46.423
I've got to go find people
who are the best in that.

00:28:46.423 --> 00:28:50.120
And that took years of looking
and research and development,

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.790
adding someone to our board that
had that relevant experience,

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:54.800
meeting with tens
of people in order

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.180
to go identify
the right sources.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.316
So I approached it truly
like an entrepreneur,

00:28:59.316 --> 00:29:00.940
which is why you--
it wouldn't matter--

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.648
well I want everyone
inside this company,

00:29:02.648 --> 00:29:05.619
and every company to be
incredibly entrepreneurial is--

00:29:05.619 --> 00:29:08.160
And that's what I learned from
my dad, who didn't necessarily

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.354
have access or connections.

00:29:09.354 --> 00:29:11.020
He was just like, I
want to teach myself

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:11.853
how to be a builder.

00:29:11.853 --> 00:29:14.440
Great, let me crack a book, get
a magazine, go talk to people.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.480
So it's not that complicated.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:20.130
You just have to keep-- it's
a massive volume of activity.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:21.090
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:22.381
JESSICA HERRIN: You're welcome.

00:29:25.765 --> 00:29:27.140
JESSE HAINES: Any
other question?

00:29:30.044 --> 00:29:34.242
All right, I've
got my-- oh, yes.

00:29:34.242 --> 00:29:36.146
AUDIENCE: I feel
ridiculous in my jacket,

00:29:36.146 --> 00:29:37.100
but it's cold in here.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:37.740
JESSICA HERRIN: No,
it's very cold outside.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.871
You get a little extra dose of
winter going on around here.

00:29:40.871 --> 00:29:42.620
AUDIENCE: First of
all, thank you so much.

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.078
It is a privilege
to have you here.

00:29:44.078 --> 00:29:46.650
My name is a Jen,
and I am a 12 year

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:48.037
Googler, which is crazy to say.

00:29:48.037 --> 00:29:49.370
JESSICA HERRIN: Congratulations.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:50.203
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:50.203 --> 00:29:51.760
I am very proud of that.

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.000
So entrepreneurship,
I love the notion

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.920
of democratizing
entrepreneurship and making

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.380
it accessible.

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.990
I'm curious to know,
so you've innovated.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.480
You've added new product lines.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.850
What's the next thing?

00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:07.034
What are you going to fix next?

00:30:07.034 --> 00:30:08.950
JESSICA HERRIN: It's
really this is it for me.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.760
When people ask me my exit
strategy for my company,

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.900
I think oxygen tank
and a stretcher,

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.710
because my purpose
doesn't need to change.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.650
Will I continue to
expand lifestyle brands

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.770
on this platform and the
social selling model?

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:24.820
I think if you don't
innovate, you die.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.410
So will we evolve our products?

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:27.830
Will we evolve the sales tools?

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.990
Will we evolve the
experience for the consumer?

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:31.580
All of those things will change.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.820
Right now, we've
launched three brands.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:35.270
Two of them are brand new.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.727
So I want to give
them all the oxygen

00:30:37.727 --> 00:30:39.560
they need to grow into
their full potential.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:43.290
Because if I keep diluting it
without putting the same detail

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:46.110
and love I put into the first
one out of my living room,

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:49.810
they won't survive just because
we can rest on our laurels.

00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.720
I've got to go out
there and nurture those.

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.120
But to me, what's next is this.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:54.816
It's continuing.

00:30:54.816 --> 00:30:57.190
I can't wait to have the party
in which we're celebrating

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.270
a billion dollars paid.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:01.770
So that's what's there for me.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.050
And I would say this book,
"Find Your Extraordinary,"

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:05.780
is what's next.

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.530
Again, it's recognizing
that my joy comes now

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:12.250
from seeing that we could be
a spark in someone else being

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.000
an entrepreneur or
helping them grow.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.820
And so putting that
out into the world

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:18.435
is the start of a movement
for me around defining success

00:31:18.435 --> 00:31:20.590
as happiness, cultivating
entrepreneurial spirit

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.640
in other people, giving a
message to women for gratitude,

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.620
not guilt. And I would
love to take this further

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.950
into a platform where
some of those resources

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.750
become available
for free outside

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:34.490
of our family of brands,
just so catalyzing that more

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:35.534
development.

00:31:35.534 --> 00:31:37.950
AUDIENCE: Actually that brings
up another question for me.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.330
You mentioned early on
this online university.

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:42.880
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.004
JESSICA HERRIN: Absolutely.

00:31:44.004 --> 00:31:45.840
So we do have an
online university

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.020
within each of our brands.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.484
So when you log
in to the lounge,

00:31:48.484 --> 00:31:49.900
whether it's Ever
Skincare, you're

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.025
going to learn how to become
a skincare specialist.

00:31:52.025 --> 00:31:53.950
And it has a all online
learning platform

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.170
to train somebody who
comes to us knowing

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.570
nothing, whether it's about
sales or time management

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:01.260
or goal setting or the
product itself, or the tools,

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.760
there's an online
university there.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.030
So we don't just provide
the product to sell,

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.050
there's a whole platform.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:10.760
But what I have come to see
in training tens of thousands

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:14.170
of people is it's not the
how-to that prevents people

00:32:14.170 --> 00:32:17.550
from getting what they want,
it's that the will to do it

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:20.090
and the will to get
back up and do it again

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:23.220
after the first time or the
first 10 times didn't work.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:26.960
So when I thought about
writing this book,

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.150
it was very interesting,
because initially I

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:30.857
thought long and
hard about wanting

00:32:30.857 --> 00:32:33.190
to show that yes, I could
write a serious business book.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.731
I think as a woman
in Silicon Valley,

00:32:34.731 --> 00:32:36.920
you still sometimes have
that desire, that almost

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.530
reflex to try to prove
yourself and wanting

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.660
to go write that very
academic theoretical business

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.912
book to show the
world how smart I am.

00:32:42.912 --> 00:32:45.120
But I realized it's not what
the world needs from me,

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.110
because there's lots of
framework books and things out

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.776
there like that.

00:32:47.776 --> 00:32:49.250
But the reality
is, I think you've

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.120
got to start with the how
do you cultivate someone's

00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:54.140
self-confidence and their will.

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.340
Because it's the
will to go do it

00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:58.270
that is what trips
most people up.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.760
So with our university,
the online university,

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.040
it spans a lot of topics.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.020
And it literally talks
about mindfulness

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.900
and positive intelligence
and time mastery

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:12.100
in addition to just the actual
tactical things around selling

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.980
or coaching other people.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:15.630
So yes.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:17.800
And if you go to
our conferences,

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.900
our most popular workshops are
productivity, time mastery.

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.672
And I realize,
this is an epidemic

00:33:23.672 --> 00:33:25.630
of people feeling time
starved and like they're

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.120
juggling too many balls.

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:29.520
If for our company we could
just put that out there

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:33.157
for people to access,
I'd be happy to do that.

00:33:33.157 --> 00:33:33.990
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:35.073
JESSICA HERRIN: Thank you.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.280
JESSE HAINES: One of the
great things-- and thank you,

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.321
I'm so glad you didn't
write an academic business

00:33:43.321 --> 00:33:46.020
book, because this is
such a pleasure to read.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.102
And I think one
of the reasons why

00:33:48.102 --> 00:33:50.060
so many of the things
that you talk about stick

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.530
is because you anchor them
all with really great stories.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.870
And you talked about how
you've sparked entrepreneurship

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:58.410
in so many people.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:34:02.990
Are there any stories of
individuals that maybe you

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.210
could share with this group?

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:04.910
Because it's amazing.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:05.660
JESSICA HERRIN: Absolutely.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.605
There's ones I love.

00:34:06.605 --> 00:34:07.980
And I often think
that people are

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:11.070
predisposed to think that
success is for somebody else

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:11.860
and not them.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.832
And it has something to do
with their circumstances that

00:34:14.832 --> 00:34:16.290
is going to prevent
them from going

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:17.500
to do something extraordinary.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.833
And yet there are countless
examples and stories in here

00:34:19.833 --> 00:34:23.570
of people who have no reason to
succeed and yet did it anyway.

00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:27.230
And so some of the stories in
that book, one that I love,

00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:30.840
is the one of this
guy Juvenal Chavez.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:34.400
I met him at the Ernst
&amp; Young Entrepreneur

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:35.770
of the Year competition.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.110
I was very flattered
to be up for the award.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:38.889
But then when I met him--
he was also up for it--

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:41.222
I wanted to be like, vote for
Juvenal, vote for Juvenal.

00:34:41.222 --> 00:34:43.080
This guy is amazing.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:47.110
So he was a
schoolteacher in Mexico

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.750
had a young son, decided
to come to America.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.659
Didn't speak English at all.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:55.900
Here could get a job
as a bartender at night

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.520
and was a janitor by day,
but had the American dream.

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.140
So if you look and
say, is this person

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.185
going to go do
something amazing,

00:35:02.185 --> 00:35:04.177
you'd be like no, the
odds are all against you.

00:35:04.177 --> 00:35:05.010
You're an immigrant.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.300
You don't have any money.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.508
You don't speak the language.

00:35:07.508 --> 00:35:09.990
You have no connections.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.470
Right when he got
a huge promotion--

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.817
he was local at Stanford,
so he got this job

00:35:14.817 --> 00:35:17.150
where he was going to make
$14 an hour working in a lab.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.733
So he was going to get to clean
test tubes instead of toilets.

00:35:19.733 --> 00:35:21.894
So he was saying this
is a massive step up.

00:35:21.894 --> 00:35:23.560
There's some safety
there for my family.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.220
I'm going to take this job.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.800
But his brother-in-law said,
let's go start a meat market.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.690
You know, let's just try to go
down and create this business.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:33.120
And he went down there, and it's
this really rough neighborhood

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.900
of East Palo Alto
back at that time.

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.130
And walks in, and it just reeks.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:38.310
There's maggots everywhere.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.240
There's rotten meat.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.490
And he's like no freaking way.

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:41.156
I'm out of here.

00:35:41.156 --> 00:35:42.224
This is mad.

00:35:42.224 --> 00:35:43.640
Why would I try
to do this instead

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.790
of taking this other job?

00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:48.390
And he was with his
wife at the time, who

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.720
I think has that magical gift.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.400
It's one of the pieces
of positive mind,

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.399
was how do you look at
something, like literally

00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:55.890
rotting meat and maggots,
and not see what's there now,

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.230
but see what could be.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:59.410
So out in the parking
lot where he marched out,

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:03.370
his wife turned to him and
said, Juvenal, look again.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:06.310
Don't see what's there,
see what you want to see,

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:07.840
and tell me what it is.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.470
And he looked and
he closed his eyes

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.340
in the direction of
the place and said,

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.860
I see a market
where people could

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:16.170
shop like they do at home,
where the Latino woman is

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.900
cooking for a lot of people.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.370
She shops more frequently.

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:20.760
It's a lot more friendly.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.760
It's sort of a smaller format.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.430
It has different types of food.

00:36:24.430 --> 00:36:25.480
And it's bustling.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.560
And he had the
vision in that moment

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.460
for what would become Mi Pueblo,
which is now a $300 million

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.020
grocery store chain
in Northern California

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:35.260
that he now operates
with his three sons.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.530
And I just think that
that powerful story just

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:41.946
illustrates what's possible,
you know, how lucky we are

00:36:41.946 --> 00:36:43.070
and what is truly possible.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.380
And you don't have
to have anything.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:48.070
But if you have the
entrepreneurial spirit,

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:50.290
then you have the ability
to see what could be

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:51.400
instead of what is.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:55.380
You don't spend your time
in frustration and fear.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.466
You experience it, but you
quickly recover and go back

00:36:58.466 --> 00:36:59.590
to imagining what you want.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.360
So that's one story that I love.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:04.070
There's the stories of one
of our business owners,

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.560
this woman Cindy
Rhodehamel who's

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.600
exactly what you would think
of if I said mom from Ohio.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:14.270
She's this total mom who had
a blank resume for 15 years,

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:16.430
and overnight gets
a knock on the door.

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.640
And her husband is arrested.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.940
He's had a great job.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:20.450
They had a fancy house.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.400
She loved being with
her three girls.

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.070
And he got arrested for
a white collar crime.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.900
And the civil trial
turned criminal.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.030
And he ends up going
away for six years.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:32.740
Imagine, she's in her community.

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.190
Her assets are frozen.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:37.310
She literally can't go to
the ATM to go buy groceries,

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:40.560
and is so mortified
and embarrassed.

00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.240
And so what do you
do in that moment?

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.960
Can you imagine
trying to go get a job

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.200
to support three kids
when you have nothing

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.160
on your resume for 15 years?

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.680
So she hired herself as
a Stella &amp; Dot stylist.

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:53.470
In the five years since, she's
earned over a million bucks.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.980
She's paid for her three
daughters to go to college.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.842
She's paid off the mortgage.

00:37:57.842 --> 00:37:59.300
Her husband just
got out of prison.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.250
She stayed with him.

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.700
So certainly for in
good times and bad.

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.752
He admits to wrongdoing,
but he's still

00:38:04.752 --> 00:38:06.460
fundamentally a good
person and she loves

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:07.751
him, is staying married to him.

00:38:07.751 --> 00:38:11.810
And I think that ability to tap
into that strength in yourself

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.560
and go do something is
just this recognition

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:17.960
that that well of strength
was there all along.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.820
You could use it even if
you're not in a crisis,

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.650
even if you're not
suffering from shame

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.100
and the ATM isn't
working anymore.

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:28.010
So I think that
there's several stories

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:31.260
like that, and many more
that I absolutely love.

00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.500
And do I have time to
tell you one last story?

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:34.110
JESSE HAINES: Yes, definitely.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.220
JESSICA HERRIN: This is
one of my favorite ones,

00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.340
because I think the average age
in this room is-- I don't know,

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.380
it's dark out
there-- maybe in 30s?

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.130
Is that all right?

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.340
Is that a good guess?

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:46.770
I think when people think, here
I am, is it too late for me?

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:48.810
And what have I
done in my career?

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.365
And I've already gotten this
degree and I've gotten this.

00:38:51.365 --> 00:38:51.990
I've been here.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:53.656
I've invested this
time in this company.

00:38:53.656 --> 00:38:54.920
Here I am.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.830
Can I do anything next?

00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:00.450
There's the story of this
woman Helen who was a nurse.

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:03.280
And she was raised in
a time before Title IX

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.450
where women were
made to be athletes

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.210
or to be in the work world.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:09.377
She was raised to-- she
did have a job as a nurse,

00:39:09.377 --> 00:39:11.460
but she wanted to get
married and have kids and be

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.120
a homemaker.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120
So she did get married.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.180
She married well.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.340
She married a younger man
who was the oral surgeon

00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.870
that she was a nurse
for, her husband Norm.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.690
And when she went to
retire, he went to retire,

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:26.780
he wanted to start
running to get into shape.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:30.570
And she had never-- she'd been a
smoker for 25 years, never run,

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.239
thought this sounded like hell.

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:34.280
But she did it because
she wanted to be with him.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.730
So they ran a fifth of
a mile in their backyard

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.700
the first day to
train for this 10K.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:40.570
And she hated it,
I mean absolutely

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.839
like side splitting
hated it, and thought,

00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:44.880
all right, I'm going to
do this 10K for you Norm,

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.030
but then that's it.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.030
And when she
finished, she thought

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:49.040
she'd never do it again.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.248
But he wanted to keep doing
it, so she kept doing it.

00:39:51.248 --> 00:39:54.010
So she's 55, smoked
over 25 years.

00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.410
Then at some point
she started realizing

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:59.170
that she wasn't running for
him and she kind of liked it,

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:01.090
and she started
running for herself.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:05.310
And since then, she's almost 90.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:08.190
She's run a marathon
on every continent

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:09.520
except for Antarctica.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.800
She holds almost every
record in the world

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:13.290
for being an ultra marathoner.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:17.410
This woman has put octogenarian,
grandmother, exsmoker,

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:21.180
and Tahoe Triple record
holder in the same sentence.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.297
And it is unbelievably
mind blowing.

00:40:23.297 --> 00:40:25.380
It's really the inspiration
for the running world.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:26.470
Her name's Helen Klein.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:28.850
If you're a runner, you
might know who she is.

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:35.150
But to me, the idea that you
can go on to, at the age of 55,

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:38.450
you can inspire the world--
literally the world--

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:41.230
in doing something that the
first time you did it you

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.611
hated it so much that
you wanted to quit

00:40:43.611 --> 00:40:45.110
and thought you'd
never do it again,

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:47.969
and she started by going
a fifth of a mile a day.

00:40:47.969 --> 00:40:49.760
So if you can do
something that you suck at

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.380
and that you actually
dislike and believe

00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.380
that you can go on
and inspire the world,

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.320
and getting started in your own
backyard, a fifth a mile a day,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.810
I think that's pretty powerful.

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:03.810
JESSE HAINES: That's
an amazing story.

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:14.060
So to wrap up, what is your--
obviously this whole book

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.940
is about finding
your extraordinary

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:18.480
and it's just giving
a lot of advice.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:22.320
But to Googlers
here, I guess sort of

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.450
if there was one key
takeaway that you

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:26.820
would want to make sure
that they would walk away

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:30.600
from this conversation
with, what would that be?

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:32.370
JESSICA HERRIN: Obviously
it's right there

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:33.744
in the message of
the book, which

00:41:33.744 --> 00:41:35.261
is that you are extraordinary.

00:41:35.261 --> 00:41:36.260
You were never ordinary.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.930
You were never meant to
just live a quiet life.

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:41.310
And that opportunity
is all around you,

00:41:41.310 --> 00:41:43.510
and that includes
right here at Google.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:45.750
You don't have to
radically change

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:48.130
the course of your
life or the position

00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:50.680
that you have in order to
go do something even more

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.540
extraordinary and reach
your full potential.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.910
You have to approach your
existing circumstances

00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:59.020
with that passion, with that
path, with the perseverance.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.900
So everything
that's in that book

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.090
is as much for someone
who's leading in the role

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.495
that they have rather
than thinking hey, I've

00:42:07.495 --> 00:42:09.370
got to snap out of this
and start a business.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:11.930
I actually think that
that's not for most people.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:15.177
As my sibling once told me in a
way that only a sibling can is

00:42:15.177 --> 00:42:17.010
don't expect other
people to do what you do.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:18.260
You're the one that's weird.

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.760
And she's right.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.880
So what your [INAUDIBLE]
that you're doing,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.839
it's not less than.

00:42:22.839 --> 00:42:24.380
I think especially
at Google you live

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.880
in this very
entrepreneurial culture

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.150
where it's very cool to
go out there and start

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.310
a company from scratch.

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:33.370
I don't think that any
other choice is less cool.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:35.780
The diversity amongst
us is beautiful.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:37.360
And your choice of
what you're doing

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:39.270
is incredibly valid and awesome.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:43.440
And what this book is about is
helping unleash every potential

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.130
that you have into your choices
if they're right for you

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:49.014
so that you love your life more.

00:42:49.014 --> 00:42:50.430
Not only that you
accomplish more,

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.270
but that you actually create
the definition of success that

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:55.085
includes happiness and joy.

00:42:55.085 --> 00:42:56.670
JESSE HAINES: Awesome.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:58.810
Jessica, thank you so
much for being with us.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:42:59.000
JESSICA HERRIN: Thank you.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.500
JESSE HAINES: And
congratulations on the book.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.050
JESSICA HERRIN: Thank you.

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:02.056
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:02.056 --> 00:43:04.120
Thanks for having me.
