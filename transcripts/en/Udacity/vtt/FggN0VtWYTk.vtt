00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.740
(Baby babbling)

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:02.800
(Crowd chattering)

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.220
(Typewriter clunking)

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.420
(Scratch of pen on paper)

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:13.420
Language.
It's how we express ourselves, inspire, connect.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.240
Language has helped our society evolve.
Where there is human experience

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.480
experience there is language.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.980
What if we can find insights in all that
speech and all that text that's around us?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.230
Modern computing is now reaching the power to
process human language. From capabilities

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.950
like universal translation to
summarizing legal documents and even

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.510
understanding human emotion. We're just
beginning to explore the possibilities.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.520
That's why we've developed the natural
language processing Nanodegree program.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.240
Master the skills that are changing the
world. You'll build a github portfolio of

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.500
projects with machine translation, neural
networks, and speech recognition.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.300
Because when you teach computers to not just
understand language but to actually

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.190
generate new communication, you can help
take the human experience to

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.140
a whole new level.
