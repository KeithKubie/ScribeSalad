00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.830
YUSUF DAHL: I believe
anything is possible.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.670
Your past does not have
to dictate your future.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.210
My name's Yusuf Dahl.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.850
I am recently graduated
from the Woodrow Wilson

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.160
School of Public and
International Affairs

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.980
with my master's degree.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.260
I grew up in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980
in an environment of
really extreme adversity.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.070
At 18 years old, I was sentenced
to the Wisconsin prison

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.080
system for 10 and 1/2
years for possession

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.880
of a controlled substance.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.210
It was a moment
that I resolved

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.360
I was going to spend every
single moment that I had,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.750
making sure that I
acquired the education that

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.130
would allow me to take control
and change the trajectory

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.710
of my own individual life.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.830
When I was released, I
applied to hundreds of jobs.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.725
My mother had saved a
pair of dress shoes I had,

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:56.070
that I wore to my
sentencing at 18 years old.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.310
I literally wore the
soles out of those shoes,

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.380
going door-to-door
to businesses,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.450
trying to find work.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.000
My big break,
actually, came when

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.270
I was hired by the
state of Wisconsin.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.880
At 28 years old, I received
my bachelor's degree

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.120
in information sciences.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.390
And it was during my time
as a graduate student

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.040
that the foreclosure crisis hit.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.450
And so as my neighbors began
to abandon their homes,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.030
as blight began
to move in, I had

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.280
to make a decision
of what I would do.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.520
I knew that I had a
responsibility to my community.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.290
And without any formal training,
I began to buy foreclosed homes

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.670
and renovate them.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.760
I helped lobby for
significant legislation

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.130
in the state of
Wisconsin, and was

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.860
honored with being present
at two bill signings

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.510
next to Governor Scott Walker.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.020
I knew that I wanted to have
a bigger impact, one that was

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.520
national, rather than local.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.960
And that's when I decided to
apply to Princeton University.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.050
Princeton is just
a phenomenal place.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.500
It's absolutely,
indelibly changed

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.270
how I look at the world,
and how I view my ability

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.310
to have an impact in it.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.350
MARTIN JOHNSON: Yusuf brings
an unusual background,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.480
for a lot of reasons.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.170
He has this awesome
life experience

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.050
that he can bring to the
academic world, which

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.670
not many can do.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.800
And if you're teaching
practical courses,

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.860
like a course on social
entrepreneurship,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.480
this is the kind of guy
you want around you.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.830
This is the kind of guy who can
offer both personal, as well

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.440
as the professional,
and do it in a way that

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.311
is lighthearted and thoughtful.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.650
ANNOUNCER: Yusuf Dahl.

00:02:53.182 --> 00:02:54.640
YUSUF DAHL: Coming
to Princeton was

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.250
the first time I was
in school full time

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.440
since I was 15 years old.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.590
So the level of rigor that
was expected when I originally

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.650
got here was quite difficult. 
After a very rough

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.990
first semester, I made some
changes, met some people who

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.420
were a lot smarter than I was,
built a team of resources,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.270
and I was able to thrive over my
last year and a half on campus.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.260
And through Princeton,
I've been able to spend

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.470
a summer in Africa.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.160
I've been to Germany.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.980
It's just been a
wonderful experience,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.950
and I'm very thankful
for the resources

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.010
that they've provided
for me, to achieve

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.620
my own, individual potential.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.970
I'm extremely proud to be an
alumnus of this university,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.270
and I look forward to being
able to leverage the experiences

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.220
and resources that
I've gained on campus,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.980
to having a bigger impact.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.330
