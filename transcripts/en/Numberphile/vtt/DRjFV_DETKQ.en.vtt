JAMES GRIME: We're at
Numberphile HQ.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.870
We're in Brady's house.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.830
We're in Brady's garden, because
today we're going to

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.080
take part in an experiment.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.370
So this, what we're going
to try and discover, are

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.830
Fibonacci numbers in nature.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.490
Now, we have filmed a video
about Fibonacci, but we

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.485
haven't edited it yet.

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:18.780
It hasn't gone up yet.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.810
So this is a kind of precursor
to that video.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.590
Fibonacci numbers are
famous numbers in

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:25.390
mathematics, though.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.600
You probably know of them.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.970
It starts with 1, and 1, and
then you keep adding the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:30.930
previous two.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.200
So 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.250
Then you add the previous two
numbers, so 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.340
Then you do that again.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.690
2 plus 3 is 5.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.057
Keep going, 3 plus 5 is
8, then you get 13,

00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:46.150
and 21, and so on.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.090
That's the Fibonacci sequence.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.580
So you'll find Fibonacci
numbers in nature.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.810
If you pick a flower and you
count the petals, it tends to

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.470
be a Fibonacci number.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.890
That's why four-leafed
clovers are so rare.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.320
It's because 4 is not
a Fibonacci number.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.280
3 is but 4 isn't.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.680
If you look in spirals of
a pine cone, you'll find

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.880
Fibonacci numbers.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120
And what we're going to do is
this summer, we're going to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.080
try and grow some sunflowers.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.330
And in the head of the
sunflower, that's just packed

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.230
full of seeds.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.340
And they'll grow in spirals.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.960
And the number of spirals,
again, tends to

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.620
be a Fibonacci number.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.320
Imagine it like spokes
of a bicycle.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.960
But instead of just straight
radially coming out from the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.460
center, they'll curve,
so they're spirals.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.870
Like spokes on a bicycle, then,
you can have more than

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.680
one spiral.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.700
And we expect it to be maybe 55,
that's a Fibonacci number.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.460
Maybe 89 if you've got
a large sunflower,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.670
that's a Fibonacci number.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.620
So we're doing this to celebrate
Turing year.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.300
So this year is 100
years since the

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.970
birth of Alan Turing.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.870
Alan Turing is one of our
great 20th century

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.880
mathematicians.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.200
He was a mathematician, a World
War II code breaker,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.990
father of computer science,
and was interested in

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.520
mathematics in nature.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.900
This problem was one of the
problems he studied near the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.600
end of his life.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.390
So to celebrate the life of Alan
Turing and to brighten up

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.210
Brady's garden a little bit,
we're going to plant some

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.610
sunflowers.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.460
There haven't been many
studies of this.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.600
I mean, there have been studies
before, but not many.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.980
There was one in 1890.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.355
There was one in 1930s.

00:02:28.355 --> 00:02:29.350
And that's been about it.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.250
So Manchester Science Festival
have decided to create this

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.140
big experiment this summer for
everyone to plant sunflowers.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.510
We're encouraging you to do
it as well, to join in.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.720
And what we can do then later,
in maybe September, is count

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.700
the spirals you get in
your sunflowers.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.000
Maybe take a photograph, send
it in to the people at

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.680
Manchester Science Festival.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.900
So I've got a selection here.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.360
I've got dwarf sunflowers.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.240
We've got here middling
size sunflowers.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.650
Awesome sunflowers--

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.910
massive, giant sunflowers.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.560
So we've got Brady's
sundial over here.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.966
Brady likes it because it's
got numbers on it.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.600
Stick it in the hole, and our
sunflower seeds, and hope

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.880
Brady doesn't mind.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.800
Planting them in the sun, that's
what we need, and this

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.540
is perfect--

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.738
right in the sun.

00:03:22.738 --> 00:03:23.714
One down there.

00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:25.180
There you go.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.890
Now we wait.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.110
Now we play the waiting game.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.300
So we're going to plant the
dwarf sunflowers in the pot.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.890
So I think that will work.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.610
So we're going to have to
fill it with compost.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.630
There you go.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.930
MALE SPEAKER: What's the
mathematical or natural

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.110
scientific advantage to having a
Fibonacci number of spirals?

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.110
JAMES GRIME: Well, there
is an advantage.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.600
Because by having a Fibonacci
number of spirals it allows

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.830
the seeds to be packed
efficiently.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.600
So if you packed them like it
was spokes on a bicycle--

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.010
let's say it was every quarter
turn, so you get four spikes

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.390
coming out from the center.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.290
You've got all this
dead space.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.100
That'd be no good.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.650
So you don't want to
pack it like that.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.130
Maybe you want a pack
it every 12th.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.009
You do a 12th turn, and then you
put one in, and then you

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:21.240
do a 12th turn and put one in.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.300
But again, you get lots
of dead space.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.650
So you don't want it to be a
fraction of a full circle.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.380
So you want it to be an
irrational number.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.500
So by doing that, it packs
them in more tightly.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.650
If the irrational number can be
approximated, though, by a

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.470
fraction, you'll still get quite
a lot of dead space.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.020
What you want is an irrational
number that can't be

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.670
approximated with a fraction--

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.030
or at least approximated
really badly.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.710
Now, there is an irrational
number that is the most

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.810
irrational number.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.130
By which I mean it can't
be approximated by

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:56.980
fractions very well.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.350
That is a number called
the golden ratio.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.660
It is the most irrational
number.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.040
The best you can do to
approximate it is to use

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.020
Fibonacci numbers-- two
Fibonacci numbers

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.450
dividing one another.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.440
Two consecutive Fibonacci
numbers

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.120
divided by one another.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.730
So 55 divided by 89 would
approximate the golden ratio.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.720
And we will tell you more about
the golden ratio in our

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.970
upcoming video.
