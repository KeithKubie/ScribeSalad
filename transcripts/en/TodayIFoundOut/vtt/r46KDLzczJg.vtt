00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.550
The Black Comedian Who Was Almost One of the
Three Stooges

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.230
There’s a good chance you’ve never heard
of Mantan Moreland.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.480
But, if you are lucky enough to have seen
him in a film—any film—you’ll definitely

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.490
remember him.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.950
Moreland’s comic timing manages to transcend
the decades in films like King of the Zombies

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.430
(1941), where he steals the show, saving what
would otherwise be a completely forgettable

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.670
(and by now, probably long-forgotten) comedy-horror
flick.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.181
While changing attitudes about black roles
in film may have hastened Moreland’s fall

00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:40.070
from popularity, he’s finally being rediscovered
as the talented character actor and comedy

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.700
genius that he was.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.370
Had history unfolded just a little differently,
Mantan Moreland would most likely have never

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.040
become forgotten in the first place.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.670
In fact, he once came awfully close to being
cast as one of the Three Stooges (more on

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.670
that later).

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.530
In an era when segregation was in full swing,
the fact that he was strongly considered to

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.140
be part of the internationally-known trio,
let alone be the choice of Moe and Shemp Howard

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.280
themselves, speaks to his considerable talent
as a comedian.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.530
Cutting his teeth on the brutally competitive
vaudeville stage, Moreland honed his comedy

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.420
skills doing several live shows a day.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.280
Vaudeville was a cutthroat business.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.159
With dozens of performers waiting in the wings,
any act that faltered for even a moment would

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.770
be yanked—if not booed—off the stage.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.780
Former vaudevillians like Charlie Chaplin,
Buster Keaton, and Bob Hope owe their cinema

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.850
stardom largely to the quick-thinking and
high level of professionalism required to

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.850
make it big onstage.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.490
It worked for Moreland, too.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.499
His talent as a comedian on what was then
known as “the chitlin’ circuit”—the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.670
string of nightclubs and theaters deemed safe
for black comedians during segregation—soon

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.100
led to roles in movies.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.990
Moreland’s earliest roles were in “race
films,” made with black actors for black

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.990
audiences.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.740
His first screen role was as a night watchman
in a haunted pawn shop in That’s the Spirit

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.130
(1933), followed by a small role as an angel
in The Green Pastures (1936), a retelling

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.700
of Biblical stories as black American folklore
(Rex Ingram, Disney’s original choice for

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.729
Uncle Remus, played “De Lawd”).

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.209
Moreland was quickly moved up to supporting
roles in all-black westerns like Harlem on

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.690
the Prairie (1937) and Two-Gun Man from Harlem
(1938), playing the comic sidekick to Herb

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.640
Jeffries (better known as the Bronze Buckaroo,
America’s first black singing cowboy).

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.750
Recognizing his talent, studios soon snapped
him up to play comic relief roles in mainstream

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.280
movies (in other words, with white casts),
but his real break came when he was paired

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.590
with Frankie Darro in a series of crime comedies.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.630
The two appeared in the films as porters,
bellhops, or pages who stumble across murder

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.720
cases (hijinks, of course, ensue).

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.360
While Moreland’s performances are stereotypical
of the era (he’s always the frightened one),

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.070
the films represent a huge turning point on
the part of the studio: Moreland and his white

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.180
co-star are depicted as friends and equals.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.740
A high point of the series is when he and
Darro recreate one of the bits that made Moreland

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.120
a hit on the stage.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.850
The “indefinite talk” bit appears in Up
in the Air (1940), and pays homage to the

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.960
routine he developed with Ben Carter, in which
the two would finish each other’s sentences.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:06.960
Like this:

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.810
Moreland: “I haven’t seen you since…”

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:09.810
Carter: “Longer than that!”

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.410
Moreland: “Last time I saw you, you lived
over…”

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.100
Carter: “Oh I moved from there.”

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.100
Moreland: “Yeah?”

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.100
Carter: “Sure, I moved over to…”

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.460
Moreland: “How can you live in that neighborhood?”

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.610
The series came to an end when Frankie was
drafted during World War II, but Monogram

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.300
hung onto Moreland, recognizing him for the
amazing talent he had.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.730
Perhaps intentionally, he was featured in
some otherwise-lackluster films, injecting

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.490
a healthy dose of humor where there would
have been none.

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.230
King of the Zombies (1941) is perhaps the
best known, and nearly every single line spoken

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.100
by Moreland is memorable, from “Move over,
boys, I’m one of the gang now!” to “If

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.750
there’s anything I wouldn’t want to be
twice, zombies is both of them.”

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.070
(You can watch the film here.)

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.980
Moreland was somewhat less valued at other
studios, where he didn’t receive top billing,

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.180
but his role in Universal’s The Strange
Case of Dr. X (1942) caught the eye of Three

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.660
Stooges cast member Shemp Howard.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.630
The two appeared together in a gambling scene,
and Howard was impressed with Moreland’s

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.630
comic timing.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.120
He suggested to brother Moe that Moreland
would be the perfect replacement stooge, should

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.530
the need ever arise.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.120
Meanwhile, Moreland was cast as chauffeur
Birmingham Brown in Monogram’s series of

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.430
Charlie Chan films.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.049
While “chauffeur” certainly doesn’t
sound like a memorable role, Moreland, as

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.360
usual, made the character one of the most
memorable parts of the series.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.740
In fact, he was the only actor to stay on
board for the entire run, appearing in 15

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.180
of the 17 films.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.081
In two of the Charlie Chan films, Moreland
got to reprise his indefinite talk bit with

00:04:34.081 --> 00:04:36.509
original vaudeville partner Ben Carter.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:41.020
Both The Scarlet Clue (1945) and Dark Alibi
feature versions of the routine that made

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.270
him famous, and the movies are worth a watch
if just for those segments alone.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.319
When the series ended in 1949, Moreland saw
less and less work.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.680
Some attribute his disappearance to the decline
of the B-movie in an era that was embracing

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.150
television, but many historians and biographers
think it had more to do with changing political

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.150
attitudes.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.599
Black men as servants and chauffeurs were
not seen as funny so much as demeaning.

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:07.689
It didn’t help that Moreland’s shtick
was to play the skittish, frightened man—another

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:08.710
stereotype.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.279
On the other hand, his performances always
seemed to transcend stereotype (and those

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.379
who knew him said that the deep Southern accent
and the expressions were true to how Moreland

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:17.520
really was).

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.110
His scared-out-of-his-wits characters are
really not that different from the ones played

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.950
by Bob Hope (see The Ghost Breakers, 1940).

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.460
It’s easy to understand, though, why Moreland’s
scared routine sits a little uncomfortably

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.999
today, especially as he plays a servant to
white men to boot—which is not something

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.279
Bob Hope had to do.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:38.659
Remember Moe Howard’s suggestion that Moreland
would be a great Stooge if the need arose?

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:41.560
The need did just that in 1955, with the death
of Shemp Howard.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.599
At a time when Moreland could have used the
work, the comedy team suddenly had need of

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.110
someone with brilliant comic timing and plenty
of experience.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.900
Moreland biographer Michael H. Price talked
to Howard about just what a great idea it

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:53.900
was:

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.249
Mantan was responsive, when Larry (Fine) and
I talked the idea over with him.

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:01.379
I mean, we’d all seen our better days by
that time, but ol’ Moreland, – now there

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:04.129
was a talent that could’ a’ invigorated
the whole act!

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.689
He had the word play – you ever heard him
do that ‘anticipation’ routine, where

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.319
he and one or another of his partners finished
each other’s sentences? – and he had the

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:15.059
physical shtick, the jive moves and double
take receptions that would’ a’ filled

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:18.729
in the gaps when Jerome (Curly) and Shemp
had kept covered.

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.650
The studio had other ideas, though, according
to Howard:

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.940
But of course Columbia (Pictures’ management)
demanded a white guy, because they’d apparently

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.539
been scared off of Mantan, and we ended up
with that prissy damned Joe Besser, who was

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.990
whatcha might call a pain…I’ve always
thought what a great act the Stooges could’

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.590
a’ stayed for a while, if only we’d’
a’ gone with Mantan.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.729
And that was the end of that.

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:43.479
Having appeared in over 300 movies in his
career, Moreland then only worked sporadically

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.850
in the industry until his death in 1973 from
cerebral brain hemorrhage.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:52.669
His last featured role was as a doomed delivery
man in 1964’s weirdly wonderful comedy-horror

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:57.340
film Spider Baby, and though the role was
small, in true Mantan Moreland fashion, it

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.539
is not easily forgettable.

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:02.219
He played a few more blink-and-you’ll-miss-them
roles, wrapping up his film career as a man

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:07.740
almost run over by a motorcycle in the soft-core
film The Young Nurses (1973).

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.050
Moreland made a few TV appearances on shows
like “Adam 12” and “Love, American Style”

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.249
and released a few raunchy “party records”
on the Laff label, including That Ain’t

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:20.110
My Finger (his “mashed potatoes” punchline
famously appears in the Beastie Boys song

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:22.309
“B-Boys Makin’ With the Freak Freak”).

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:26.050
One thing Moreland never stopped doing was
the indefinite talk routine that originally

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:29.389
made him famous, performing it up until the
last year of his life.

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:33.550
Mel Watkins, a black comedy historian, noted
that to black audiences, it was as well-known

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.580
a classic as “Who’s on First?” was to
white audiences.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.819
Once so famous that his films bore his real-life
name (Mantan Runs for Mayor and Mantan Messes

00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:46.279
Up, 1946), the actor is certainly not a household
name today.

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:50.289
While he deserves rediscovery, one thing’s
for sure: if Columbia Pictures hadn’t been

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:54.659
opposed to having a black comedian in one
of the most beloved comedy groups of all time,

00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:58.199
he wouldn’t have needed to be rediscovered
at all, and his name would have been sealed

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:03.740
in mainstream comedy history.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:13.979
