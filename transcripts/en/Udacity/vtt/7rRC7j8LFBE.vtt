00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.130
A couple of cool properties as we said,
that this does,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.810
it's very easy to construct the MHI for
one TAL from the other.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.380
So you can go from TAL 30 to TAL 15 and

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.230
that's basically a linear scaling,
right.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.820
So if I have an action that can go fast,
or go slow, that's okay,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.170
it's not okay for an action that goes
the first half of it is fast and

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.620
then the second half is slow, where
I have to do something more serious,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.210
some more serious dynamic
time-warping or something like that.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.540
The whole idea is that we have these
atomic primitives, that can be performed

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.790
quickly or slowly, but
they don't have lots of parts to them.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.190
It's very, it's,
recursive so it's very fast.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.310
What's interesting is, and I've had
conversations with some, people who do

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.020
work in vision from the neural side, or
from, computational vision from biology.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.440
You could imagine building
something like these mhi detectors

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.450
from very simple neural hardware.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.070
Basically filters with slow responses.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.380
And, the fact that these can work
from very low resolution images,

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.300
which I haven't shown, but

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.519
because it's just a global pattern
you don't need a lot of pixels.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.330
It means that out here in your
peripheral vision where you have hardly

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.120
any resolution at all,
when we do the human vision, lesson.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.010
We'll, we'll talk about how, you think
you can see out here, but not really.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.531
You're just making it up.

00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:19.410
All right, but,
what it means is a very low resolution.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.940
You can recognize things.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.160
So I'm not going to claim anything
in terms of biological reality.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.870
I'll just say that there's some
biological plausibility to,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.290
to this kind of work.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.060
And there's a reference in PAMI,
which sort of talks more about this.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.780
We actually use this system
to build a couple things.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.593
Here's Jim Davis, when we were both
much younger building a aerobics system,

00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:45.690
where you would be taken through
aerobics by the system and

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.470
it would watch you and it would know
which, which aerobic you're doing,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.970
I mean which one you're
supposed to be doing.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.950
It tells you, so
it can recognize it was real easy.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.150
We did have this cool little thing that
the music in Jim is very clever making

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.830
this happen, the music was actually MIDI
controlled so we can control the tempo.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.700
Right, it wasn't just prerecorded.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.430
So that means we could watch you, and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.940
we could always make the music go just
a little faster then you were going.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.320
So we could sort of, just play with your
head and speed you up and make you sweat

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.510
more, but it was cool that the thing
would just recognize the system.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.050
A more compelling use of this
technology, we built this thing called

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.600
the KidsRoom, and it was an interactive
play space for children.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.330
The original intent was to
just illustrate how computer

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.930
vision could do some
interesting cool stuff.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.560
And, what was interesting is,
nice article about it in Presence,

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.170
but, some folks came by,

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.450
I don't remember exactly how it was
that they were at the media lab.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.580
But they really liked it and they
ported it to the Millennium Dome, so

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.200
they built this big thing
called the Millennium Dome,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.410
in London, at the turn of the century,
at the millennium.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.500
And they had all these pavilions,
and they were looking for

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.030
interesting technologies, and this is
one of them that they put in there.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.288
So, I, I have a little video here
that shows you first of all,

00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:57.933
temporal templates being used.

00:02:57.933 --> 00:03:01.710
So the monsters teach the kids these
moves, and then, which is good,

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.105
because if we wanted to we could
actually get training data from

00:03:05.105 --> 00:03:09.265
the actual kids that were there, but the
system is robust enough that we could

00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:12.851
use training data from just a couple
of people that we trained on and

00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.490
it would work for everybody.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.580
We also used temporal templates plus,
this little extra stuff that we used.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.600
It's all in the paper if you
wanted to read about it.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.700
The, the Presence paper.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.680
And then there was a little interesting,
cool thing in, interac.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.900
Well here, I'll just get this started.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.263
Okay, so here we have the last bit
where the monsters are teaching,

00:03:31.263 --> 00:03:34.590
the last two of the moves,
there are only four of them.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.420
First he teaches the kid to do a crouch,
and then she does a crouch in response,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.660
and, he's praising how well she's doing
these crouches, and that's great.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.070
We go to the point where he's teaching
her to do these flapping motions, and

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.480
you can see he's pleased with her.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.150
And he's giving her
lots of good feedback.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.930
And then I think the last one he's going
to teach her how to do is how to spin.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.720
Say something like surely love
do a spin, and ready spin dude.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.530
There he goes, he's spinning, and

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.230
now she starts spinning,
and compliment her on that.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.320
And when the music changes,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.630
basically they're supposed
to do their own moves and

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.720
the monsters will follow them but, it
takes them a little while to catch on.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.730
And from now on he's following her.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.230
Now one of the thing's that we did in
order to make this room look a lot

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.620
smarter.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.764
The monster would say what you're doing,
right?

00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:28.920
And when it would recognize it but

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.630
it only did that,
when it was sure it was right.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.294
If it was close maybe you're spinning,

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:38.580
maybe you're flapping it would just do
whichever one it thought was right.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.370
But it would only say
it if it were sure.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.080
And the reason is,
if the monster goes and

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.120
does something that is not what
you are doing, what do you do?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.340
You say, oh,
he wanted to do something else.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.940
You just describe intentionality
to the character, but, if he says,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.840
oh really cool spin,
and you're flapping?

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.250
He just looks stupid.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.060
So the way you avoid this interactive
system from looking stupid,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.470
is it only speaks when it's sure,
and it acts all the time,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.910
because you'll ascribe intentionality.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.030
We, we wrote that up in the paper.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.420
It was kind of a cool insight in terms
of how to build interactive characters
