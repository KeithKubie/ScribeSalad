00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.820
Find the product 4 times
negative 5 times negative 7.5.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.600
So we're just multiplying
three numbers right here,

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.470
some are positive,
some are negative.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.200
We could actually do
this in any order,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.700
but let's just go left to right.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.565
So let's start with the
4 times the negative 5.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:19.440
And then we'll multiply
whatever we get there

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.950
times negative 7.5.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.460
So let's just
rewrite the problems.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.367
We have 4 times negative
5, times negative 7.5.

00:00:29.367 --> 00:00:31.200
I really don't have to
write that dot there.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.900
If you just have 4 and then
in parentheses a negative 5,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.964
that means 4 times negative 5.

00:00:35.964 --> 00:00:37.630
Now, the first thing
you need to realize

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.590
is that a positive
times a positive

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.220
is obviously a positive.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.940
A positive times a negative,
or a negative times a positive,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.481
when you have
different signs, you're

00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:47.815
going to end up with a negative.

00:00:47.815 --> 00:00:50.189
If you have same signs, even
if you have a negative times

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:52.570
a negative, you're going
to have a positive as well.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.550
So let's just work that
out in this problem.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.870
So you have 4 times negative 5.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.970
4 times 5 would be 20.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.550
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.090
So 4 times 5 would be 20.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.320
But we have a positive
times a negative,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.650
so it's going to be a negative.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.970
Different signs mean we're
going to have a negative.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.120
So it becomes negative
20 times negative 7.5.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.650
So let's figure
out what that is.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.700
We have to multiply
20 times 7.5.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.800
We could do that out here.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.460
So 7.5 times 20.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.460
0 times 5 is 0.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.690
0 times 7 is 0.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.376
Put a 0 here, because
we're obviously

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:32.500
not going to multiply by 2.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.874
We're actually
multiplying by 20.

00:01:33.874 --> 00:01:36.720
So 2 times 5 is 10.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.340
2 times 7 is 14, plus 1 is 15.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.290
And we get a 0, we
get a 0, we get a 5.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.300
I'm just adding here.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.354
You get a 1.

00:01:46.354 --> 00:01:47.770
And then you count
the numbers you

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.430
have behind the decimal point.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.420
We only have one digit
behind the decimal point

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.470
in both numbers.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.300
So you only go one digit
behind the decimal point

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.460
in our product.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.670
So the answer here is 150.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.990
So this is equal to 150.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.610
And now we just have
to think about is

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.110
it going to be
positive or negative.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.400
We have a negative
times a negative.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.600
They are the same sign.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.850
So it's going to result
in a positive number.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.920
So our final answer is 150.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.350
And if we actually wanted
to keep the precision here,

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.320
we could write 150.0.
