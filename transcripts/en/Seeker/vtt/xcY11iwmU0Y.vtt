00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.550
One of my favorite memories as a kiddo was
spending time with my granny in Kentucky-

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.149
not only did she teach me how to shuck corn,
she made the BEST chocolate gravy.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.149
Yes...that’s a thing.

00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:13.299
But did you know grandparents are unique and
that most other species don’t have them?

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.770
Hello, it’s Natalia for DNews!

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.570
From “to grandmother’s house we go”
to “grandmother got run over by a reindeer”-

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.199
grandparents are an integral part of holiday
celebrations!

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.869
This is the time of year that extended families
make the pilgrimage to their elders.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.679
But in a world where most other animals begin
to mentally deteriorate and die once they

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.520
reach the end of their reproductive rope,
why do humans continue on to grow old and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.800
become grandparents?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.940
A few animals, such as dolphins, whales and
humans DO have grandparents which play a key

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.570
role in caring for their grandkids.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.870
And new studies show that there are gene variants
that protect against Alzheimer’s disease

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.120
found in some humans that allow them to continue
contributing to their families long after

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.910
they’re done producing offspring.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.540
Past studies have linked two versions of the
gene CD33 to the development of Alzheimer’s

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.810
disease, however a variant or allele of CD33
has been discovered that actually protects

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.120
against the onset of Alzheimer’s disease.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.230
This interests scientists because humans,
unlike most mammals, continue to live well-past

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.730
our reproductive years.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.150
And living past our ‘prime’ allows humans
to contribute to the success of our grandkids

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.510
by handing down knowledge, supplying food,
and being cost efficient babysitters while

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.020
parents tend to other duties...or children.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.820
This means humans having grandparents gives
our species an evolutionary advantage when

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.760
it comes to having multiple children in shorter
intervals.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.270
However, those grandparents who DO develop
dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can have

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.940
the opposite effect on a mother raising multiple
children- they become more of a burden.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.340
Though there’s no proof this gene variant
was naturally selected for- it could very

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.530
well have been selected for randomly.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.909
And not everyone has this gene variant, however,
learning more about this variant allows researchers

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.370
to develop drugs that mimic the variant and
help protect patients against the effects

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.829
of Alzheimer’s disease.

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.450
These findings may support the popular ‘grandmother
hypothesis’.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.690
The ‘grandmother hypothesis’ was first
introduced in 1997 by anthropologist Kristen

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.560
Hawkes after she worked with the Hazda, hunter-gathers
in Tanzania.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.119
While working with this group of foragers,
she noticed that grandmothers played an integral

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.060
part in feeding their grandchildren, allowing
the mothers to tend to her other children.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.290
This assistance over time has allowed women
to have more children in shorter intervals,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.510
increasing her fecundity.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.620
In 2012 study by Hawkes has been able to further
support the ‘grandmother hypothesis’ through

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.510
computer simulations that prove that a little
grandmothering over time can increase a species

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.819
lifespan by years.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.540
However, grandkids aren’t the only ones
benefitting from having Bubbie and PopPop

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.680
around.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.340
Studies have shows that grandparents who actually
spend time with their grandkids, remain mentally

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.400
alert and physically active long after they
had their own kiddos.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.320
Studies show that post-menopausal grandmas
who spend time with their grandkids have a

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.690
decreased chance of developing Alzheimer’s
disease or other cognitive disorders.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.540
But the study also showed that grandmas who
spend too much time with their grandkids had

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.630
greater cognitive impairments and felt their
children were too demanding with their childcare

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.630
needs.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.989
So, somewhere in between there’s a happy
medium of grandkid/grandparent interaction!

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.020
Something to consider is that nowadays grandkids
don’t always live in close proximity with

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.800
their grandparents so both the grandkids AND
the grandparents potentially miss out on the

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.710
benefits of interacting with one another.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.430
A study released by the National Academy of
the Sciences showed that older men and women

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.610
who spent long periods away from their family
had a 26% higher risk of death in a seven

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.130
year period than those individuals who were
more engaged with their loved ones.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.190
Thus, by you spending time with your grandparents
you may be extending their life...how’s

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.890
that for that pressure?

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.610
Grandparents are most definitely grand.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.610
And unique!

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.120
So be sure to give yours an extra hug this
holiday season.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.300
And if they have departed- raise a glass to
them and thank them for their contribution

00:03:40.300 --> 00:04:05.209
to your survival!
