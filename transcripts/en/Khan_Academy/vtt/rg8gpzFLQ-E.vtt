00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.110
- [Instructor] In this video,
we're going to talk about

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.170
what is arguably my favorite enzyme,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.430
and that is ATP synthase.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.340
And you might be able to predict
from its name what it does.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.920
It synthesizes ATP.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.040
Now you've probably seen it before.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.100
We saw it when we looked at respiration,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.450
or you will see it when
you look at respiration,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.510
which is going on in most
of the cells of your body.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.290
And you also see it when
you study photosynthesis.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.240
The general thing that it does is,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.250
is it sits across a phospholipid membrane.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.970
And through other processes,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.340
you will have hydrogen
ion concentration increase

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.810
on one side of the membrane,

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.450
have a higher hydrogen ion concentration

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.290
on one side than on the other side.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.630
You still might have a few over here.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.100
And a hydrogen ion is
essentially a proton.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.360
So on this side of the membrane,
it'll be more positive,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.670
so there will be a electromotive force

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.720
to go to the other side.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.600
And also, you just have
a higher concentration,

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.800
so there's a chemical gradient,
a concentration gradient,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.780
where if there was some
way for these protons

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.140
to get to this side, they
would want to get there.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.500
So there's an electrochemical gradient

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.900
that they would want to go down.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.900
And ATP synthase provides a
channel for those protons.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.000
But as those protons travel
through the ATP synthase,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.630
they turn this part of it,
which drives this axle,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.140
and then this axle nudges
these parts of the protein

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.010
so that they jam together an ADP

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.590
with a phosphate group to produce ATP.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.030
So down here, you, going into
this part of the complex,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.270
you'll have an ADP and a phosphate group.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.410
And then that rotation force

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.990
that's provided by that
electrochemical gradient,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.220
that then produces

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.380
our ATP.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.190
And that's going to be the
case both in respiration,

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.940
which occurs in the mitochondria,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.940
and in photosynthesis,
which occur in chloroplasts.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.430
Now there's a few differences.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.880
In mitochondria, the
hydrogen ions, these protons,

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.700
the concentration builds up

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.273
in the intermembrane space right over here

00:02:10.273 --> 00:02:13.080
because of the electron transport chain.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.730
And we studied that in other videos.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.790
And then the protons travel
through the ATP synthase.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.920
You could see a little mini
version right over here.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.500
You could imagine that
what we see really big,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.860
that is a blown-up version of
this part of the mitochondria,

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.360
and this is, of course, is not to scale.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.010
So in the case of a mitochondria,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.110
this would be the inner membrane.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.410
Right over here would be
the intermembrane space

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.241
between the inner and the outer membrane,

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:42.140
intermembrane space.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.140
And right over here would be
the matrix of the mitochondria.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.950
And so as the protons go through,

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.923
they're able to produce ATP in the matrix.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.430
Now in chloroplasts,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.910
the hydrogen protons build
up inside the thylakoids,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.660
which are these parts of the chloroplast.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.480
That space inside the thylakoid

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.440
is often called the thylakoid space,

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.070
sometimes called the lumen.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.830
That proton buildup inside
the thylakoids happens

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.890
because of the light reactions,

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.430
the first phase of photosynthesis.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.160
But then those protons will travel

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.450
through the thylakoid
membrane, through to this area,

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.510
which is known as the
stroma in chloroplasts,

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.900
and they produce the ATP in the stroma.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.830
But then the ATP is
used in the second phase

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.600
of photosynthesis to synthesize
carbohydrates, which is,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.370
you could view as one of the
end products of photosynthesis.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.790
So the big takeaway of this video is, one,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.310
ATP synthase is incredibly cool.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.760
If you look up on the internet,

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.150
you can find some simulations
that show ATP synthase

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.780
and how it acts like a motor
to jam the phosphate group

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.580
to the ADP to produce ATP.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.030
And ATP synthase in
mitochondria and chloroplasts

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.840
are remarkably similar,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.080
although they sit in different
parts of these organelles.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.930
And the ATP in mitochondria,

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.590
you can view as the end
product of respiration,

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.630
while the ATP produced in chloroplasts

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.470
is an intermediary store of energy,

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.033
which is then used to
synthesize carbohydrates.
