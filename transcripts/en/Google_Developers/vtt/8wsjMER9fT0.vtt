00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.550
When editing CSS in
DevTools, you can now easily

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.420
increment or
decrement values using

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.452
some new shortcuts we've added.

00:00:07.452 --> 00:00:09.990
In the sources pane, you
can use Alt-Up or Alt-Down

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.660
to increment or decrement
by a value of 1.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.815
You can also use
Alt- Page Up or Page

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:18.640
Down to increment or
decrement by a value of 10.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.300
Now, let's say that you love
working in the elements pane.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.710
Well, you're probably used
to inspecting an element

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.350
and then going to
the styles pane

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.995
to actually go play
around with values.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:30.680
Well, you can go and find
the property to work with.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.400
And similar to what
you're used to,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.600
you can still use
the Up and Down keys

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.715
to increment or decrement
by a value of 1.

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:40.280
You can also now
increment by a value of 10

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.530
or decrement using
Shift-Up or Shift-Down.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.556
And using Shift-Page
Up or Shift-Page Down

00:00:47.556 --> 00:00:50.940
you can increment or
decrement by a value of 100.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.340
And finally, for those
ultra-specific properties

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.900
you can use Alt-Up and Alt-Down
to increment or decrement

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.129
by a value of 0.1.
