Who doesn't love an Easter egg?

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.719
No, we're not talking about the egg-shaped
shells of chocolate goodness that have somehow

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.029
come to be a part of celebrating the resurrection
of Christ, we're talking about the unexpected

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:26.010
features and references in movies that eagle-eyed
viewers enjoy hunting for.Disney definitely

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.439
love Easter eggs.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.840
Their movies are littered with countless examples
for audiences to spot - and, in this video,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.040
we're going to run you through some of the
better examples in your favourite Disney offerings.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.129
So sit back and relax, because you don't even

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:58.280
Here are ten Easter eggs hidden in your favourite
Disney movies.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.400
The Little Mermaid
Let's start with a real classic - in every

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.769
sense of the word.

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.290
1989's The Little Mermaid is a quintessential
Disney movie - and it features cameos from

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.079
some of Walt Disney's utmost classic Disney
mascots.When King Triton assembles a large

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.680
crowd of sea-dwelling beings in the movie's
opening scenes, none other than Mickey Mouse

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.070
himself, Donald Duck and Goofy can be seen
amongst the crowd.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.020
But there's also a fun non-Disney cameo in
the same scene; Kermit the Frog can be seen

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.830
loitering a few rows behind the iconic Disney
trio.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.830
The Incredibles
One of the best known and most regularly occurring

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:29.830
Disney Pixar Easter eggs is the mentioning
of "A113" - whether it be spoken or written

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.830
down somewhere within a movie.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.830
It's the number of the classroom at the California
Institute of Arts where many of Pixar’s

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.830
earlier animators learned their trade.A prime
example is in 2004's The Incredibles (in which

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.830
it is actually mentioned on more than one
occasion).

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.830
Mirage says to Mr. Incredible "you'll be briefed
on your assignment in the conference room

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.830
at two.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.830
D Wing, room A-113."

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.830
Toy Story 2
Another recurring Easter egg in Disney Pixar

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.830
movies is the inclusion of the Pixar corporate
mascot, Luxo Jr. - the little desk lamp that

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.610
appears on the production logo of every Pixar
movie.It has appeared in a number of movies

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.310
in various forms, but none were more imaginative
than its appearance in 1999's Toy Story 2.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.909
It appears in a scene in which Buzz Lightyear
flies back down to Earth.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.890
Luxo J. can be seen in the night sky as a
constellation in the vast sea of stars.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:06.380
Toy Story 3
Ready for some trainspotting?

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:17.930
Good.In the opening sequence of 2010's Toy
Story 3, there's a runaway train that can

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.319
be seen bearing the number "95".

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.430
That number is a reference to the number on
Lightning McQueen in the Cars franchise which

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.920
is, in turn, a reference to 1995 - the year
that the first Toy Story movie was released.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.210
Two Easter eggs for the price of one!

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.569
We're spoiling you here!

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.210
Cars
Having just mentioned the Cars franchise in

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.040
a Toy Story entry, it's now time to do the
reverse.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.599
In 2006's Cars, there's a race called the
Piston Cup - and all of the cars taking part

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.330
in said race have tyres of a brand that is
a clear reference to a certain Toy Story character.Instead

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.520
of being "Goodyear" - like a lot of real world
tyres - these tyres are all of the fictional

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.900
brand "Lightyear".

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.670
This is, of course, taken from the name of
Buzz Lightyear - one of the heroes from the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.280
aforementioned Toy Story movies.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.040
The Hunchback of Notre Dame
Back to another Disney animated classic now

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.990
- it's 1996's The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.840
The majority of the movie takes place in a
single cathedral, which you'd imagine would

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.980
restrict the number of cameos Disney could
squeeze in - but that's not actually the case

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.660
at all!The opening scene alone sneaks in a
vendor selling Aladdin’s magic carpet, as

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.909
well as Belle from Beauty and the Beast out
for a walk.

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:24.909
And Pumbaa from The Lion King franchise even
makes an appearance in the movie - standing

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:25.909
guard as a stone gargoyle on a Paris building.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.440
Finding Nemo
Most of Finding Nemo takes place under the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.939
sea, but there are also some scenes in a dentist's
office where the titular fish finds himself

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.330
- and there are a couple of Easter eggs in
there.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.400
For one, there's a young boy waiting in said
dentist's office, and he's reading a comic

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.379
with a picture of Mr. Incredible on it.Moreover,
as Nemo is looking around said dentist's office

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.830
for a way to escape the fish tank he's being
kept in, a Buzz Lightyear figure can be seen

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.019
lying on the floor in the corner.

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.940
Lilo &amp; Stitch
Fa Mulan - star of Disney's 1998 movie Mulan

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.129
- disguised herself as a man in order to go
to war in place of her aging war veteran father.

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.019
As a result, she clearly made an impression
on the cast of characters in the world of

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.220
Lilo &amp; Stitch!The 2002 Disney movie has a
couple of Easter eggs, both of which honour

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.329
the brave girl.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.100
For one, a poster of Mulan hangs on Lilo’s
sister Nani’s wall.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.400
Second, the family in the movie even walk
past a restaurant called “Mulan Wok”,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.840
which appears to be quite clearly named after
her.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.360
References to a Film That Never Was
This one's a little bit different.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.040
Pixar are known for their foreshadowing Easter
eggs - by which we mean they like to include

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.180
Easter eggs that make reference to their movies
that haven't actually been released yet.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.960
In this case, it's a movie that didn't actually
end up getting released at all.A shelved production

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.630
called Newt was referenced by way of a "Newt
Crossing" sign on Andy's door in Toy Story

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.490
3, and the witch in 2012's Brave can also
be seen holding a newt up when she's concocting

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.410
a spell.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.170
Every Pixar Film
For our final entry, we get less specific,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:59.890
as this Easter egg applies to every single
Disney Pixar film that was ever made.John

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.260
Ratzenberger - yeah, the guy from Cheers and
the Coors commercials - has voiced a character

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.630
in every Pixar film to date (and will no doubt
continue to do so going forward, because Pixar

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.780
consider him to be their good luck charm).

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.320
His characters have included the likes of
Toy Story's Hamm, A Bug's Life's P.T.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:50.750
Flea, The Incredibles' Underminer and Mack
from Cars.
