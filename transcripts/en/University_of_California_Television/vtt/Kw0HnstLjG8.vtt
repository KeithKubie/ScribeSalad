00:00:01.427 --> 00:00:03.427
(beeps)

00:00:05.368 --> 00:00:08.451
(light upbeat music)

00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:26.608
- I wanted to sort of pitch
or present the work today

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:30.160
in the context of the effects of stress

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.410
because of the high
burden that mental illness

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.597
has on young people.

00:00:35.597 --> 00:00:39.829
That is as many as 40%
of young people today

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.004
experience a mental illness.

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:45.398
The majority of these are
related to anxiety and stress.

00:00:45.398 --> 00:00:48.258
And if we don't treat
these early, they can go on

00:00:48.258 --> 00:00:52.368
to lead to chronic
illness, both psychiatric

00:00:52.368 --> 00:00:54.626
as well as physical illness.

00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:57.000
So the questions that we've been asking

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.931
in our laboratory over the years

00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:02.181
is how are these early life experiences

00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:06.904
impacting emotional
well-being and the underlying

00:01:06.904 --> 00:01:10.497
brain circuitry involved
in that well-being?

00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:12.859
And ultimately, what we need to do is

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.549
to use this information
so that we can facilitate

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:18.454
and enhance healthy brain development

00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:21.558
and also, of course,
well-being of young people,

00:01:21.558 --> 00:01:25.168
which is then gonna be
well-being of our society.

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.533
But if we first take
just a simplistic look

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.054
at all the changes that are happening

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:32.555
in post-natal development,
what you'll see is

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:35.055
that there is dramatic changes

00:01:36.056 --> 00:01:40.183
just in the number of
synapses throughout the brain

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.796
that develop regionally.

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:44.337
So we see a proliferation
and a subsequent pruning

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.808
of these connections.

00:01:45.808 --> 00:01:50.139
Simultaneously, their
changes in nerve chemicals

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:52.850
and neurotrophins that
are absolutely essential

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.473
to development and learning.

00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:58.461
And with all these regional
changes, it is co-occurring

00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:02.484
with increased myelination
throughout the brain,

00:02:02.484 --> 00:02:05.452
which is making the connections stronger.

00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:08.488
So we've been focused on
all these dynamic changes

00:02:08.488 --> 00:02:12.275
and trying to understand
with just one picture

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:16.370
using human imaging and
focusing on one circuitry

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.720
that's really important for our ability

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.747
to process emotional information.

00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:26.099
So emotion regulatory and
emotional reactive processes.

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.318
And during this time, during
childhood and adolescence

00:02:30.318 --> 00:02:32.606
there are major changes in this circuitry,

00:02:32.606 --> 00:02:36.756
and we think that they
will, are one pathway

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:38.931
for us to seeing how
early life experiences

00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:42.238
are reflected in them and how
this continued development

00:02:42.238 --> 00:02:45.716
may also be a window
of plasticity of sorts

00:02:45.716 --> 00:02:49.206
where we may have the biggest change.

00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:51.018
Now, in human studies, one of the ways

00:02:51.018 --> 00:02:55.012
that we try to look at
this, at these circuitries

00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:59.177
in the behaving human
brain non-invasively,

00:02:59.177 --> 00:03:02.279
is to use simple stimulator
cues that we present.

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.805
So here are, here's an example of a cue

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:06.658
with emotional information.

00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:11.426
We examine how these cues
impact both brain and behavior.

00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:14.107
These cues can be positive, smiling faces,

00:03:14.107 --> 00:03:17.773
or negative, or they can be neutral.

00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:19.818
But what we see is even if you are

00:03:19.818 --> 00:03:22.538
in the laboratory performing this task,

00:03:22.538 --> 00:03:24.641
if we ask you just to press a button

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:26.636
whenever you saw one of these cues,

00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:29.871
you would be significantly
longer in detecting

00:03:29.871 --> 00:03:33.575
a threat cue, a fearful
cue, than you would be

00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:36.293
to a neutral or happy as you see here.

00:03:36.293 --> 00:03:38.510
So we have a longer latency there.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.616
It's adaptive when we see cues

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:43.369
that have some uncertainty or ambiguity.

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.504
I don't think for a minute
when I present this cue to you

00:03:46.504 --> 00:03:48.315
that you are threatened by that.

00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:51.387
However, we learn over a lifetime
when we see cues like this

00:03:51.387 --> 00:03:53.414
that there might be potential danger,

00:03:53.414 --> 00:03:56.203
and what's very important
for us to understand

00:03:56.203 --> 00:03:59.813
is in this context, is it a threat?

00:03:59.813 --> 00:04:03.271
So if a bear were to come into the room,

00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:05.517
I might have an emotional response.

00:04:05.517 --> 00:04:07.943
But the circuitry is
important if I saw a bear

00:04:07.943 --> 00:04:12.451
in a zoo to know that that
bear, in that situation,

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:16.618
I would be safe because they
were behind a cage or wire.

00:04:17.753 --> 00:04:19.822
So now, if we look at these responses

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:24.382
in this change in our responses
depending on the potential

00:04:24.382 --> 00:04:27.314
threat of information in our environment,

00:04:27.314 --> 00:04:30.008
if we open up the brain and look inside,

00:04:30.008 --> 00:04:32.962
the areas that tend to
be related to that delay

00:04:32.962 --> 00:04:36.329
in our approach behavior
in such situations

00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:40.246
involve the amygdala and
the prefrontal cortex.

00:04:41.091 --> 00:04:43.079
And hopefully, what you
note from this slide

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:45.926
is that the amygdala,
the more active it is,

00:04:45.926 --> 00:04:48.125
the slower you are to respond.

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:50.240
The amygdala is very
important in picking up

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.004
the emotional significance of
information in the environment

00:04:53.004 --> 00:04:56.063
and has been associated
with emotional reactivity.

00:04:56.063 --> 00:04:58.652
In contrast, the prefrontal cortex,

00:04:58.652 --> 00:05:01.407
which has direct projections
to the amygdala based

00:05:01.407 --> 00:05:05.101
on elegant animal work and
more recent human work,

00:05:05.101 --> 00:05:09.268
that area is less active when
you're really slow to respond.

00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:14.265
And the more active it
is the quicker you are.

00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:17.522
That is, you see a potential threat.

00:05:17.522 --> 00:05:20.812
You are able to understand
in this particular situation

00:05:20.812 --> 00:05:22.517
with repeated presentations of it.

00:05:22.517 --> 00:05:23.562
Get over yourself.

00:05:23.562 --> 00:05:24.610
Alright, already.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.804
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

00:05:26.804 --> 00:05:31.609
Now, I've just made a sort
of claim that over time,

00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:33.373
nothing's gonna happen to you.

00:05:33.373 --> 00:05:34.673
Well, let's look at that in the brain

00:05:34.673 --> 00:05:37.536
and what systems are
absolutely essential for that.

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:39.569
What's important when we look at

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.288
with those repeated presentations

00:05:41.288 --> 00:05:44.475
how well you habituate to these cues

00:05:44.475 --> 00:05:47.516
is this inverse coupling
between the prefrontal cortex

00:05:47.516 --> 00:05:49.651
and the amygdala in this circuitry.

00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:53.466
And this inverse coupling
or negative connectivity

00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:56.175
seems to be changing radically

00:05:56.175 --> 00:05:59.418
from childhood to adolescence.

00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:03.922
And it is when you are not
able to habituate that response

00:06:03.922 --> 00:06:07.241
that is associated with
heightened anxieties,

00:06:07.241 --> 00:06:09.958
so I just want you to focus
on this quadrant for a moment.

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:12.752
And basically, if you
look over at the Y axis,

00:06:12.752 --> 00:06:16.186
that's amygdala habituation,
and it's a negative score.

00:06:16.186 --> 00:06:20.353
That means not only was there
not a change in how active

00:06:21.592 --> 00:06:24.341
the amygdala was to these
cues but that it was actually

00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:26.641
sensitized and it was
increasing over the course

00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:28.142
of the experiment.

00:06:28.142 --> 00:06:30.104
And that's related to the highest level

00:06:30.104 --> 00:06:32.488
of self-reported trait anxiety.

00:06:32.488 --> 00:06:34.949
Now, some of these
pictures had a lot of data,

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.218
and I think data slides and pictures

00:06:38.218 --> 00:06:40.116
are worth 100 or 1,000 words,

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:43.275
but movies might tell a simpler story.

00:06:43.275 --> 00:06:47.217
So this is an example of
an individual who reports

00:06:47.217 --> 00:06:49.815
low anxiety, and they're being presented

00:06:49.815 --> 00:06:52.795
with these cues of potential threat.

00:06:52.795 --> 00:06:54.750
So you'll see, there's bilateral activity

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.138
in the amygdala with
repeated presentations,

00:06:57.138 --> 00:07:00.553
but then, it's like the
system begins to return

00:07:00.553 --> 00:07:02.858
to baseline, and it turns blue.

00:07:02.858 --> 00:07:04.635
That represents from the increase

00:07:04.635 --> 00:07:07.615
going back down to baseline.

00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:09.272
In contrast, when we look at an individual

00:07:09.272 --> 00:07:12.747
with high anxiety, we
basically see a similar pattern

00:07:12.747 --> 00:07:17.738
at first with this bilateral
activation of the amygdala,

00:07:17.738 --> 00:07:21.491
but then, it stays up and
it stays up and it stays up.

00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:23.293
And it doesn't return to baseline.

00:07:23.293 --> 00:07:26.509
So it's that vigilant state
of that anticipation of threat

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:30.062
and an uncertainty of what
these cues potentially mean.

00:07:30.062 --> 00:07:33.905
So, two different paths
that we have taken in trying

00:07:33.905 --> 00:07:37.850
to understand these two very
different neurosignatures here

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.622
is to look at differences
in genetic factors

00:07:40.622 --> 00:07:42.881
that may explain this, but in the interest

00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:45.994
of the symposium today,
also, in the environment

00:07:45.994 --> 00:07:48.018
or experiences that we have.

00:07:48.018 --> 00:07:50.552
So how does early life stress impact

00:07:50.552 --> 00:07:53.000
the development of the circuitry?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.027
And we have used really an extreme example

00:07:56.027 --> 00:07:57.777
of early life stress.

00:07:59.037 --> 00:08:02.780
It is an unfortunate but
a natural occurring one.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.930
And that is children who
grow up in the orphanage.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.906
Now, in the orphanage experience,
all the orphanages vary.

00:08:10.906 --> 00:08:14.900
But there's always gonna be
some fragmented caregiving

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.772
because of the high
ratio of so many children

00:08:17.772 --> 00:08:19.890
to a single caregiver.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.916
So what we've been interested in is

00:08:21.916 --> 00:08:24.056
as these children are adopted to families

00:08:24.056 --> 00:08:27.107
in the United States, we've
been trying to understand

00:08:27.107 --> 00:08:30.712
how this disregulation of
their needs not being met,

00:08:30.712 --> 00:08:33.211
how there's not attunement
in the child's needs

00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:35.925
with what a caregiver can
actually provide to them,

00:08:35.925 --> 00:08:38.813
how that impacts their
ability to regulate self.

00:08:38.813 --> 00:08:40.499
But particularly today, I'll talk

00:08:40.499 --> 00:08:43.358
about how to regulate emotion.

00:08:43.358 --> 00:08:46.864
So again, we use these simple cues,

00:08:46.864 --> 00:08:50.156
and we ask children who have been adopted

00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:52.817
from the orphanages as
well as a comparison group

00:08:52.817 --> 00:08:55.581
who have not been adopted,
who live in the United States.

00:08:55.581 --> 00:08:56.559
They all have moved.

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:58.992
The adopted children have been
here for at least two years

00:08:58.992 --> 00:09:00.593
to make sure they get acclimated

00:09:00.593 --> 00:09:04.760
to their new home and their
new culture and environment.

00:09:06.024 --> 00:09:10.233
And what we do is we present
these cues of potential threat.

00:09:10.233 --> 00:09:12.937
But in the task we tell
'em, you know, ignore these.

00:09:12.937 --> 00:09:14.851
Try not to pay attention to them.

00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:17.904
And you find, in the
situations in which you have

00:09:17.904 --> 00:09:20.401
these cues relative to situations

00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:23.922
where you present a smiling face,

00:09:23.922 --> 00:09:27.457
that the adopted children are much slower

00:09:27.457 --> 00:09:29.559
in anticipation of one of them occurring.

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:31.187
So even if it's a neutral
face on the screen,

00:09:31.187 --> 00:09:33.450
if they know they're about
to see a threatening face,

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.803
they're really hesitant to respond.

00:09:35.803 --> 00:09:38.238
But if it's to a happy
face or a smiling face,

00:09:38.238 --> 00:09:40.825
you don't see a difference
between the two groups.

00:09:40.825 --> 00:09:42.724
Now, this is paralleled in the brain

00:09:42.724 --> 00:09:45.807
by enhanced activity in the amygdala.

00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:50.158
And that's shown here on
the left and the right side.

00:09:50.158 --> 00:09:52.322
But what I think is important
about these findings

00:09:52.322 --> 00:09:55.024
if first, this is greater
activity in the children

00:09:55.024 --> 00:09:57.553
who were adopted from orphanages abroad

00:09:57.553 --> 00:09:59.434
relative to the comparison group.

00:09:59.434 --> 00:10:01.774
The area in blue is actually more active

00:10:01.774 --> 00:10:03.454
in the comparison group.

00:10:03.454 --> 00:10:05.182
This is a part of the
brain that's important

00:10:05.182 --> 00:10:07.583
for attention regulation
and emotion regulation.

00:10:07.583 --> 00:10:11.622
So one is being able to regulate
their emotions and ignore.

00:10:11.622 --> 00:10:15.389
And the other is quite
reactive, that group.

00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:18.327
But more importantly, when
you see images like this,

00:10:18.327 --> 00:10:19.700
and you have these neurosignatures,

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.488
it is how does that relate
to their actual behavior

00:10:23.488 --> 00:10:25.505
when you get them outside
of the scanner environment

00:10:25.505 --> 00:10:26.801
or the laboratory.

00:10:26.801 --> 00:10:29.994
And so, we measured how the behavior

00:10:29.994 --> 00:10:33.408
between caregivers and
their adopted children

00:10:33.408 --> 00:10:35.434
when they had been separated briefly

00:10:35.434 --> 00:10:37.079
and then, they were reunited.

00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:38.895
And we looked at the amount of eye contact

00:10:38.895 --> 00:10:42.405
they had with their caregiver
when they were reunited.

00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:46.572
And basically, we see that the
more active the amygdala was

00:10:47.837 --> 00:10:52.188
the less eye contact they
had with the caregiver.

00:10:52.188 --> 00:10:56.409
Also, the less eye gaze they
actually held on the faces

00:10:56.409 --> 00:11:00.965
that they were presented in
the experiment as well, too.

00:11:00.965 --> 00:11:02.933
Now, when we have natural
occurring experiments

00:11:02.933 --> 00:11:06.745
such as this, we don't really have control

00:11:06.745 --> 00:11:09.618
on preexisting conditions
that may be there,

00:11:09.618 --> 00:11:11.291
genetic or environmental.

00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:15.333
So we've actually turned
to use mouse models

00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:18.606
to try to see if we can
control for the genetic

00:11:18.606 --> 00:11:22.333
and environmental confounds
that might otherwise explain

00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:23.937
what we're seeing.

00:11:23.937 --> 00:11:26.879
And so we borrowed paradigms
that have been developed

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:29.903
by individuals like Regina Sullivan at NYU

00:11:29.903 --> 00:11:32.877
and also Tallie Baram at UC Irvine

00:11:32.877 --> 00:11:36.377
to, and do sort of a fragmented caregiving

00:11:37.412 --> 00:11:39.985
of a dam to her pups.

00:11:39.985 --> 00:11:43.016
And so I wanted to show you those movies.

00:11:43.016 --> 00:11:45.575
On the top is a dam where we've taken away

00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:47.272
the nesting material.

00:11:47.272 --> 00:11:49.935
She has a little bit but not sufficient,

00:11:49.935 --> 00:11:52.583
so she is running around,
oh, this is not in real time.

00:11:52.583 --> 00:11:53.416
(laughs)

00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:54.249
(audience laughs)

00:11:54.249 --> 00:11:56.159
She's a little bit slower than that.

00:11:56.159 --> 00:11:59.228
So basically, I don't even know

00:11:59.228 --> 00:12:01.368
if you can see the control dam.

00:12:01.368 --> 00:12:03.398
So she has all the nesting
material she needs.

00:12:03.398 --> 00:12:05.038
And she's spending the
majority of her time

00:12:05.038 --> 00:12:08.288
grooming and feeding, nursing her pups.

00:12:09.479 --> 00:12:12.635
But you can see the mother
above is trying to pull together

00:12:12.635 --> 00:12:15.185
the nesting material
and sometimes her pups

00:12:15.185 --> 00:12:17.547
over to her corner for the nest.

00:12:17.547 --> 00:12:20.380
So basically, you're
seeing this fragmented care

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.123
because she can't attend to her pups

00:12:23.123 --> 00:12:24.592
when she's doing other things,

00:12:24.592 --> 00:12:26.758
which we thought might,
in the slightest way,

00:12:26.758 --> 00:12:30.584
mimic some of the fragmented
care we see in the orphanages.

00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:34.354
And if you look within a two hour period,

00:12:34.354 --> 00:12:38.780
you see a significant
difference in the amount of time

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.320
that the dam is spending with her litter

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.837
relative to controls.

00:12:43.837 --> 00:12:47.897
But quite frankly, if you
look across a 24 hour period,

00:12:47.897 --> 00:12:51.203
they're spending almost as much
time with physical contact,

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:54.092
but it's very fragmented in that contact.

00:12:54.092 --> 00:12:57.145
So there's not that attunement
between the caregiver

00:12:57.145 --> 00:12:58.145
and the pup.

00:12:59.852 --> 00:13:03.097
So then, if we look at
their ability to regulate

00:13:03.097 --> 00:13:06.100
their emotions, not the
dam, but now her offspring

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.007
who've been given this fragmented care,

00:13:08.007 --> 00:13:11.757
basically, what we see
is a paradigm in which

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:15.502
we've trained them that a
nozzle will lead to them

00:13:15.502 --> 00:13:17.298
having access to condensed milk.

00:13:17.298 --> 00:13:19.814
And mice love condensed milk.

00:13:19.814 --> 00:13:23.029
And so we put that nozzle in a novel cage

00:13:23.029 --> 00:13:26.401
with a bright light where there's
potential threat for mice.

00:13:26.401 --> 00:13:29.338
And we see that when we put it there,

00:13:29.338 --> 00:13:31.895
there's a difference between those mice

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:34.870
that grew up with the stress dam relative

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:39.237
to the mice whose dam, their
mother, was not stressed.

00:13:39.237 --> 00:13:40.839
And you don't see any difference in terms

00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:44.505
of how quickly they move to
the nozzle in their home cage.

00:13:44.505 --> 00:13:46.897
And then if we look at
the brain using C-Fos

00:13:46.897 --> 00:13:50.952
activity as an index, we see
heightened amygdala activity

00:13:50.952 --> 00:13:54.055
in this group relative to the controls.

00:13:54.055 --> 00:13:56.737
And so this gives us a bit more confidence

00:13:56.737 --> 00:13:59.517
that what we're seeing in the human data

00:13:59.517 --> 00:14:01.887
that I presented is not as much associated

00:14:01.887 --> 00:14:04.942
with maybe preexisting conditions as it is

00:14:04.942 --> 00:14:09.140
with the early life stress
because these parallel

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.619
quite nicely.

00:14:10.619 --> 00:14:13.621
Now, with the mice,
unlike our human children

00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:16.564
who are usually adopted by super parents,

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.765
if you do nothing after that, you see

00:14:18.765 --> 00:14:22.932
that there's persistent affects
of that early life stress

00:14:24.044 --> 00:14:28.281
so that they're still showing
heightened amygdala reactivity

00:14:28.281 --> 00:14:31.115
in adulthood even though
there's continued development

00:14:31.115 --> 00:14:33.257
of the circuitry.

00:14:33.257 --> 00:14:35.939
Now this persistent effect in these mice

00:14:35.939 --> 00:14:40.265
is somewhat reminiscent
of work that Nim Tottenham

00:14:40.265 --> 00:14:44.499
has done at Columbia in
collaboration with Dylan Gee

00:14:44.499 --> 00:14:47.510
whose now a colleague of
mine at Yale University.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.616
And she's actually shown that if you look

00:14:49.616 --> 00:14:53.331
at this frontolimbic
circuitry, that there may,

00:14:53.331 --> 00:14:55.269
there appears to be something similar

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:58.741
to a premature closing
of a sensitive period

00:14:58.741 --> 00:15:01.290
of neurodevelopment of this circuit

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.457
such that if you just
look at healthy children,

00:15:04.457 --> 00:15:06.250
what I described before,
there are drastic,

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.394
significant changes from coupling

00:15:09.394 --> 00:15:12.191
between the prefrontal
cortex, and it becomes inverse

00:15:12.191 --> 00:15:15.353
or negatively related in adolescence.

00:15:15.353 --> 00:15:18.350
What we see in children who
have grown up in the orphanage

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.360
is you're already seeing
those changes early.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.235
And so now, Nim is
trying to follow and see

00:15:24.235 --> 00:15:26.860
just how rigid does
that make the individual

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.639
when they go through adolescence,

00:15:28.639 --> 00:15:31.115
which is an even more
stressful time of life

00:15:31.115 --> 00:15:32.743
in meeting so many challenges.

00:15:32.743 --> 00:15:35.662
And I just want to end
with one more study,

00:15:35.662 --> 00:15:39.739
an area of work that Dr.
Tottenham is following up on,

00:15:39.739 --> 00:15:43.906
and that is showing how
important the caregiver is.

00:15:44.934 --> 00:15:46.778
And so, in these experiments,
where we're showing

00:15:46.778 --> 00:15:49.910
these very simple stimuli in the scanner

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:51.657
while we're taking pictures of the brain

00:15:51.657 --> 00:15:53.184
and watching how they perform games,

00:15:53.184 --> 00:15:57.351
if you simply put a picture
of the face of the caregiver

00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:02.250
along the screen where
they're performing the task,

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:05.988
and you can counter-balance
that with a face of a stranger,

00:16:05.988 --> 00:16:09.214
she sees that that's associated
with decreased activity

00:16:09.214 --> 00:16:11.796
in the amygdala, so it's a
decrease in that emotional

00:16:11.796 --> 00:16:15.963
reactivity just by having that
parental cue present there.

00:16:17.133 --> 00:16:21.300
And also, there is an increase
in the inverse coupling

00:16:22.162 --> 00:16:25.925
with the prefrontal cortex that is typical

00:16:25.925 --> 00:16:27.957
more of adulthood, but
we're seeing the parent

00:16:27.957 --> 00:16:31.064
has that ability to regulate.

00:16:31.064 --> 00:16:35.392
So I hope what I've shown you
or illustrated is just one

00:16:35.392 --> 00:16:38.440
small set of experiments
that are being performed

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.746
where we can show that early life stress

00:16:40.746 --> 00:16:44.902
can lead to persistent
changes in brain and behavior,

00:16:44.902 --> 00:16:48.232
particularly in terms
of emotional capacities.

00:16:48.232 --> 00:16:51.126
And it highlights, too,
this last bit of work,

00:16:51.126 --> 00:16:54.373
the importance of having
very early interventions

00:16:54.373 --> 00:16:56.824
and also, the importance of the caregiver

00:16:56.824 --> 00:17:00.695
in helping to develop a healthy brain.

00:17:00.695 --> 00:17:04.862
And also, in terms of enhancing
emotional well-being now

00:17:05.935 --> 00:17:08.447
and hopefully, for that individual.

00:17:08.447 --> 00:17:11.804
So I just want to end by
thanking so many individuals

00:17:11.804 --> 00:17:13.952
who have come through my
laboratory over the years,

00:17:13.952 --> 00:17:17.536
the majority of them fellows
who are stellar stars now.

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:20.650
And to also thank you for your attention.

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.390
- I'm really delighted
to be able to participate

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.030
in this wonderful symposium.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:30.197
What I would like to tell you
today is one particular aspect

00:17:31.185 --> 00:17:35.019
that is absolutely essential
for a normal brain development.

00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:37.964
And that is to have proper parenting.

00:17:37.964 --> 00:17:41.291
We've heard from the wonderful talk

00:17:41.291 --> 00:17:45.059
from BJ Casey right
before me how important

00:17:45.059 --> 00:17:49.226
proper nurturing from caregivers
is for normal mental health

00:17:51.232 --> 00:17:54.772
of the infant that then become adult.

00:17:54.772 --> 00:17:59.215
And so the question we've
been very interested in is

00:17:59.215 --> 00:18:01.525
what makes a parent a parent?

00:18:01.525 --> 00:18:05.358
If you think about
parenting involve one, two,

00:18:07.931 --> 00:18:12.767
sometime multiple adults
that take care of an infant.

00:18:12.767 --> 00:18:16.007
The relationship is
completely asymmetrical.

00:18:16.007 --> 00:18:18.846
There is really a very helpless individual

00:18:18.846 --> 00:18:21.161
that requires a lot, a lot of care

00:18:21.161 --> 00:18:23.394
for a very, very long time.

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:26.374
And so what makes parents be parents?

00:18:26.374 --> 00:18:29.646
It's a, I think, a very
interesting behavior,

00:18:29.646 --> 00:18:34.640
long-term behavior, that has
a lot of emotional components.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.640
And so this is a behavior
also that is displayed

00:18:39.581 --> 00:18:41.696
by many animal species.

00:18:41.696 --> 00:18:44.990
It is absolutely essential
for the development of

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.154
and the survival of the species.

00:18:47.154 --> 00:18:49.463
So the idea is that there
maybe some genetically

00:18:49.463 --> 00:18:52.290
pre-programmed neurocircuit in the brain,

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.763
and what we are interested
in is really trying

00:18:54.763 --> 00:18:57.453
to understand the neural basis.

00:18:57.453 --> 00:19:00.585
What are the specific
neurons that are involved

00:19:00.585 --> 00:19:03.035
in the control of parenting behavior,

00:19:03.035 --> 00:19:05.201
in the display of parenting behavior?

00:19:05.201 --> 00:19:09.368
And when is it that this
behavior actually goes wrong?

00:19:09.368 --> 00:19:11.521
And there are a number of circumstances

00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:13.469
in which the behavior goes wrong.

00:19:13.469 --> 00:19:17.219
One, this is one of, I
think, one of the most

00:19:18.812 --> 00:19:23.674
outstanding, really impressive,
or very surprising slide

00:19:23.674 --> 00:19:25.425
related to mental illness.

00:19:25.425 --> 00:19:27.821
That's the number of
psychiatric hospitalization

00:19:27.821 --> 00:19:29.176
after childbirth.

00:19:29.176 --> 00:19:32.496
You can see right at
the time of childbirth

00:19:32.496 --> 00:19:36.611
this enormous peak in
psychiatric hospitalization

00:19:36.611 --> 00:19:40.194
of women, and this are
patients that suffer

00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:43.455
from post-partum psychosis.

00:19:43.455 --> 00:19:45.623
This is very quite rare.

00:19:45.623 --> 00:19:47.913
It requires hospitalization
because these women

00:19:47.913 --> 00:19:51.849
have obsessive thought
about harming their child,

00:19:51.849 --> 00:19:53.672
their children, and
therefore, they require

00:19:53.672 --> 00:19:55.195
very intensive care.

00:19:55.195 --> 00:19:57.862
These very way less severe from,

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.882
which is post-partum depression
that affect 10 to 20%

00:20:04.882 --> 00:20:09.166
of mother and 5 to 10%
of fathers in the US.

00:20:09.166 --> 00:20:12.916
And this also comes right
after birth and result

00:20:12.916 --> 00:20:17.174
in a inability to emotionally
connect with children

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.924
and in effect impaired parenting.

00:20:21.925 --> 00:20:25.286
Now, there are quite a
number of risk factors:

00:20:25.286 --> 00:20:28.230
stress, life circumstances,
prior depression,

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.671
and sensitivity to hormone changes.

00:20:30.671 --> 00:20:34.838
As it turns out, right at
birth, there's an enormous

00:20:36.066 --> 00:20:39.899
change of hormonal levels
in the young mother.

00:20:40.902 --> 00:20:44.739
You can see here progesterone,
estrogen, oxytocin,

00:20:44.739 --> 00:20:48.682
prolactin is really an
enormous and very sudden drop

00:20:48.682 --> 00:20:50.041
in hormone level.

00:20:50.041 --> 00:20:52.711
Some people call these hormonal cows,

00:20:52.711 --> 00:20:55.237
and women, in particular,
that are sensitive

00:20:55.237 --> 00:20:59.460
to these hormone fluctuation
have really a difficulty

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.705
in coping with those changes.

00:21:01.705 --> 00:21:05.970
So how do we understand the
positive and the negative

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.436
regulation of parental behavior?

00:21:08.436 --> 00:21:10.106
Well, let's turn to animals.

00:21:10.106 --> 00:21:14.273
So in animals and human as
well, the primary caregiver

00:21:16.744 --> 00:21:19.054
is usually the mother, and in animals,

00:21:19.054 --> 00:21:21.618
and in mammals in particular,
this makes a lot of sense

00:21:21.618 --> 00:21:24.118
because in mammals, the mother

00:21:25.537 --> 00:21:29.985
nurture the fetus, the embryo,
in utero for a long period

00:21:29.985 --> 00:21:33.217
of time an animal is
involved in lactation,

00:21:33.217 --> 00:21:36.834
so really involve enormous
maternal resources

00:21:36.834 --> 00:21:41.297
in nurturing the infant and
therefore it makes sense

00:21:41.297 --> 00:21:45.119
that mom continued to nurture the infant

00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:46.737
through parental behavior.

00:21:46.737 --> 00:21:48.114
What about males?

00:21:48.114 --> 00:21:52.812
Well, in most mammalian
species, a very large subset

00:21:52.812 --> 00:21:56.701
of mammalian species, the males
actually attack the infant.

00:21:56.701 --> 00:22:00.304
Attack them sometime, or very
often actually kill them.

00:22:00.304 --> 00:22:03.930
And this infanticidal behavior
has been widely observed

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:05.847
in many animal species.

00:22:07.698 --> 00:22:10.464
And it is thought that this is actually

00:22:10.464 --> 00:22:14.631
an evolutionary-driven
aggressive behavior of the males

00:22:15.532 --> 00:22:19.294
in order to gain access to the females

00:22:19.294 --> 00:22:22.876
that are not accessible
when they are nurturing

00:22:22.876 --> 00:22:23.965
their own infant.

00:22:23.965 --> 00:22:26.958
And interestingly, this is
a behavior that is absent

00:22:26.958 --> 00:22:29.905
in monogamous species
in which both the male

00:22:29.905 --> 00:22:33.031
and the female are nurturing their infant

00:22:33.031 --> 00:22:34.899
and therefore, there is not this conflict

00:22:34.899 --> 00:22:38.387
of access of the male to the female.

00:22:38.387 --> 00:22:42.215
Now, infant neglect and
aggression is also occasionally

00:22:42.215 --> 00:22:44.574
displayed by stressed female.

00:22:44.574 --> 00:22:47.788
This is seen in animals
as well as I mentioned

00:22:47.788 --> 00:22:50.972
in post-partum depression
and psychosis in human.

00:22:50.972 --> 00:22:52.343
Now, we're not working with human.

00:22:52.343 --> 00:22:53.841
We're not working with primates.

00:22:53.841 --> 00:22:56.206
We're working with mice, and in mice,

00:22:56.206 --> 00:23:00.236
there is as in this animal
species I mentioned,

00:23:00.236 --> 00:23:04.403
a very clear sexual dimorphism
in the behavior of animal,

00:23:06.655 --> 00:23:08.627
male and female towards infants.

00:23:08.627 --> 00:23:13.318
Females even virgin females or
sexual inexperienced female,

00:23:13.318 --> 00:23:16.501
spontaneously take care of infants.

00:23:16.501 --> 00:23:18.189
They will build a nest.

00:23:18.189 --> 00:23:20.811
They will lick and groom
the pups, retrieve them

00:23:20.811 --> 00:23:24.497
to the nest and huddle around the infants.

00:23:24.497 --> 00:23:28.999
Virgin males in contrast will
spontaneously attack infants,

00:23:28.999 --> 00:23:33.021
wound them, and kill them
through infanticidal behavior.

00:23:33.021 --> 00:23:35.745
So very different set of behavior.

00:23:35.745 --> 00:23:39.536
However, males are not
always infanticidal,

00:23:39.536 --> 00:23:43.703
and in fact, strikingly, males
after mating with the female,

00:23:44.629 --> 00:23:46.652
are no longer infanticidal.

00:23:46.652 --> 00:23:49.194
And the video I would
like to show you here

00:23:49.194 --> 00:23:53.231
is from, if you wish, a
certified infanticidal male.

00:23:53.231 --> 00:23:57.944
This male attacked infants
three weeks earlier,

00:23:57.944 --> 00:24:01.014
and then, we had that
male mating with a female.

00:24:01.014 --> 00:24:03.019
And then, we're testing the behavior

00:24:03.019 --> 00:24:06.412
of this male now with these pups.

00:24:06.412 --> 00:24:09.974
And, as you can see, the
male has built a nest,

00:24:09.974 --> 00:24:13.828
and now, is retrieving
these pups one by one,

00:24:13.828 --> 00:24:17.248
and I should mention by the
way that these are not the pups

00:24:17.248 --> 00:24:18.673
of that particular male.

00:24:18.673 --> 00:24:21.389
This behavior will be
displayed towards any infant

00:24:21.389 --> 00:24:24.306
that is, to which they are exposed.

00:24:25.747 --> 00:24:28.449
So all the pups are now
collected to the nest,

00:24:28.449 --> 00:24:31.171
and as you see, this is a really good dad.

00:24:31.171 --> 00:24:32.004
(audience laughs)

00:24:32.004 --> 00:24:35.465
He is checking that he has
not forgotten any pups.

00:24:35.465 --> 00:24:36.298
Okay.

00:24:37.174 --> 00:24:38.338
Nobody left.

00:24:38.338 --> 00:24:39.523
Good.

00:24:39.523 --> 00:24:40.392
(audience laughs)

00:24:40.392 --> 00:24:42.906
Let's go back to the nest and
then take care of the pups.

00:24:42.906 --> 00:24:46.118
So this is a really
fascinating switch in behavior

00:24:46.118 --> 00:24:50.043
that really indicate that
even in infanticidal males

00:24:50.043 --> 00:24:53.235
there's the ability for
these males to be parental.

00:24:53.235 --> 00:24:55.059
So how is this happening?

00:24:55.059 --> 00:24:57.796
Well, evolutionary
speaking, this is actually

00:24:57.796 --> 00:25:01.193
not that surprising because
if you look at virile

00:25:01.193 --> 00:25:05.628
animal species, insects,
fish, amphibians, reptiles,

00:25:05.628 --> 00:25:09.600
birds, and mammals, they are
species in which the female

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.264
is always the one handling the progeny.

00:25:13.264 --> 00:25:14.528
You can see the little eggs here

00:25:14.528 --> 00:25:16.486
and little larvae over here.

00:25:16.486 --> 00:25:20.055
He's a tadpole on the back of that frog.

00:25:20.055 --> 00:25:23.920
But very similar species,
genetically very similar,

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.633
show animal in which
there's bi-parental care,

00:25:26.633 --> 00:25:30.273
so both the male and the
female handle the nurturing

00:25:30.273 --> 00:25:33.991
of the progeny, and similarly,
also very similar species

00:25:33.991 --> 00:25:37.386
genetically have the male
that exclusively takes

00:25:37.386 --> 00:25:38.921
care of the progeny.

00:25:38.921 --> 00:25:41.665
For example, this beetle here
with the little eggs here

00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:43.822
or this male amphibian with a tadpole

00:25:43.822 --> 00:25:46.450
or here this fascinating
monkey, the Titi monkey,

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.695
in which the male is actually
providing exclusive care

00:25:49.695 --> 00:25:51.335
of the infant.

00:25:51.335 --> 00:25:52.835
So what's happening here?

00:25:52.835 --> 00:25:55.668
Well, in mice, what's happening is

00:25:56.557 --> 00:25:59.622
that there's a dominant male
that mates with the female

00:25:59.622 --> 00:26:01.766
and the female have a communal nest.

00:26:01.766 --> 00:26:04.243
These male is always parental.

00:26:04.243 --> 00:26:08.079
However, subordinate males
that do not have access

00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:11.442
to the female, are
infanticidal will attempt

00:26:11.442 --> 00:26:14.657
to attack the male,
kill the pups, and that,

00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:16.380
in turn, enable them
to mate with the female

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.309
and at that time, they become parental.

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:21.771
Now from a neuroscience standpoint,

00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:24.269
this is fascinating because what it shows

00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:26.947
is that the brain has
actually two types of circuit.

00:26:26.947 --> 00:26:30.391
One driving infanticidal
behavior that is displayed

00:26:30.391 --> 00:26:34.999
by virgin males and one that
drives parenting behavior

00:26:34.999 --> 00:26:38.140
that is displayed by females and fathers.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.755
So the question we are very interested in

00:26:40.755 --> 00:26:43.397
is what are these neurons
that control parenting

00:26:43.397 --> 00:26:45.108
and infanticidal behavior?

00:26:45.108 --> 00:26:46.470
And I would like to tell you today is

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:49.433
how are we able to identify neurons

00:26:49.433 --> 00:26:52.585
that are necessary and sufficient to drive

00:26:52.585 --> 00:26:55.697
parenting behavior both
in males and in females?

00:26:55.697 --> 00:26:59.864
And so, what we use is a
way to identify molecularly

00:27:01.378 --> 00:27:04.588
neurons that are active
during the certain behavior.

00:27:04.588 --> 00:27:06.248
And the idea is that when a neuron

00:27:06.248 --> 00:27:08.203
is firing action potential,

00:27:08.203 --> 00:27:10.613
they're also changing
their gene expression.

00:27:10.613 --> 00:27:13.468
And in particular, they
turn on a particular gene,

00:27:13.468 --> 00:27:15.700
a transcription factor called C-Fos.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:19.683
And so if we have a female or
a male interacting with pups,

00:27:19.683 --> 00:27:23.600
then neurons that are involved
in parenting will fire

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.452
and therefore, they will
express this gene C-Fos.

00:27:26.452 --> 00:27:29.434
So if we look at the
brain of parenting animal,

00:27:29.434 --> 00:27:32.845
both males and female,
compared to infanticidal male,

00:27:32.845 --> 00:27:36.065
we find that there is a
sub-population of neurons

00:27:36.065 --> 00:27:38.354
in one particular area of the brain

00:27:38.354 --> 00:27:42.153
in the hypothalamus, an area
called the medial preoptic area

00:27:42.153 --> 00:27:45.917
in which you see this very
dense collection of neurons

00:27:45.917 --> 00:27:50.548
that express this gene C-Fos
after the animal has interacted

00:27:50.548 --> 00:27:52.776
with pups, both males and females.

00:27:52.776 --> 00:27:54.894
So this is very interesting.

00:27:54.894 --> 00:27:57.587
It's actually not that
surprising because already

00:27:57.587 --> 00:28:01.088
in the 50s, 60s, 70s, a number of groups

00:28:01.088 --> 00:28:05.255
through lesion experiment have
shown that maternal behavior

00:28:06.373 --> 00:28:09.969
requires the function of
the medial preoptic area.

00:28:09.969 --> 00:28:11.881
But what we really would like to know

00:28:11.881 --> 00:28:16.665
is which precisely, what
precisely are the nature,

00:28:16.665 --> 00:28:21.303
the identity, of these neurons
that are C-fos positive?

00:28:21.303 --> 00:28:24.413
And in fact, this area,
the medial preoptic area,

00:28:24.413 --> 00:28:26.331
fulfill a lot of functions.

00:28:26.331 --> 00:28:28.809
It's involved in mating
behavior, thermal sensation.

00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:31.433
All sort of other functions
than just parenting.

00:28:31.433 --> 00:28:35.144
So knowing precisely and
specifically which other neurons

00:28:35.144 --> 00:28:38.424
that express C-Fos is something
that we really need to know

00:28:38.424 --> 00:28:41.311
if we want to understand the
control of parenting behavior.

00:28:41.311 --> 00:28:44.431
So we tested the number
of candidate genes,

00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:47.941
and we found to our delight
one particular gene,

00:28:47.941 --> 00:28:51.995
the gene that in code for
the neuropeptide galanin

00:28:51.995 --> 00:28:56.123
has been very nicely
co-expressed with C-Fos

00:28:56.123 --> 00:28:58.498
when the animal are parenting.

00:28:58.498 --> 00:29:02.669
So interestingly, this,
the number of galanin cells

00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:06.984
in the medial preoptic
area is identical in males

00:29:06.984 --> 00:29:10.874
and females in virgin
males and in virgin male

00:29:10.874 --> 00:29:12.470
and mothers and father.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.315
In other word, these neurons are there

00:29:14.315 --> 00:29:17.316
in the male and the
female brain irrespective

00:29:17.316 --> 00:29:21.195
of whether these neurons
are parenting or not.

00:29:21.195 --> 00:29:24.839
Now, galanin is a peptide
expressed in many different areas.

00:29:24.839 --> 00:29:27.549
It has been involved in
many different functions

00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:30.724
such as nociception, sleep,
thermoregulation, et cetera.

00:29:30.724 --> 00:29:33.639
So we don't know whether
galanin has any role to do,

00:29:33.639 --> 00:29:36.281
to play in parenting
behavior, but the fact

00:29:36.281 --> 00:29:40.476
that we know one genetic
marker gives us genetic tools.

00:29:40.476 --> 00:29:43.678
In other words, we're
able to use a genetic line

00:29:43.678 --> 00:29:46.525
that express this enzyme called cre.

00:29:46.525 --> 00:29:49.509
Think about the scissor
if you wish that enable

00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:52.666
to activate specific molecular tool

00:29:52.666 --> 00:29:55.474
to manipulate the activity of neurons.

00:29:55.474 --> 00:29:58.138
And so the experiments that we've done

00:29:58.138 --> 00:30:02.305
is to inject a conditional
toxin into the preoptic area

00:30:04.796 --> 00:30:07.544
of the galanin cre
mouse, and what this does

00:30:07.544 --> 00:30:11.670
is that it enable us to kill specifically

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:15.754
this galanin neuron present
in the medial preoptic area.

00:30:15.754 --> 00:30:19.921
No other neurons outside of
the brain or within the MPOA.

00:30:21.345 --> 00:30:24.698
Nothing else than the specific
galanin expressing cells

00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:25.828
are affected.

00:30:25.828 --> 00:30:27.734
What's happening when we test the behavior

00:30:27.734 --> 00:30:31.967
of females and fathers when
we kill galanin neurons

00:30:31.967 --> 00:30:33.968
in the medial preoptic area.

00:30:33.968 --> 00:30:35.502
The affect is very striking.

00:30:35.502 --> 00:30:38.559
The ablation of these MPOA galanin neurons

00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:42.794
entirely abolishes both
maternal and paternal behavior.

00:30:42.794 --> 00:30:45.279
And actually, elicits infanticide.

00:30:45.279 --> 00:30:47.797
So there seem to be a
role of these neurons,

00:30:47.797 --> 00:30:49.839
not only in driving parental behavior

00:30:49.839 --> 00:30:54.017
but actually inhibiting
infant mediated aggression.

00:30:54.017 --> 00:30:57.713
Now, we try the other experiment,
a sufficiency experiment,

00:30:57.713 --> 00:31:00.142
which is if we now take an aggressive male

00:31:00.142 --> 00:31:03.796
and activate artificially galanin neurons

00:31:03.796 --> 00:31:07.151
in these infanticidal
males, what's happening?

00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:10.045
What's happening, and we
performed this experiment

00:31:10.045 --> 00:31:11.695
using a technique called optogenetics

00:31:11.695 --> 00:31:15.695
that enable to express a
light-activated channel

00:31:17.046 --> 00:31:19.767
in the neurons and then
using an optic fiber

00:31:19.767 --> 00:31:23.155
to activate these cells, and what we found

00:31:23.155 --> 00:31:26.223
when we shine light and
activate these galanin neurons

00:31:26.223 --> 00:31:30.595
is that infanticidal male
now are longer infanticidal

00:31:30.595 --> 00:31:34.267
and instead display paternal behavior.

00:31:34.267 --> 00:31:36.883
So what it shows is that
this specific population

00:31:36.883 --> 00:31:40.161
of neurons are both
necessary and sufficient

00:31:40.161 --> 00:31:42.040
for the control of parental behavior

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.209
in both males and females.

00:31:44.209 --> 00:31:48.292
Now, the parental behavior
is a complex behavior,

00:31:50.181 --> 00:31:53.330
and what we'd like to do
now is really to understand

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.863
this behavior in mechanistic terms.

00:31:55.863 --> 00:31:58.363
So these neurons as we've seen

00:31:59.302 --> 00:32:01.546
are able to control parenting.

00:32:01.546 --> 00:32:04.170
Parenting means a lot of
things: grooming, licking,

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:06.226
crouching, retrieving, nest building,

00:32:06.226 --> 00:32:08.976
and then inhibiting infanticidal behavior.

00:32:08.976 --> 00:32:12.531
But these neurons do all of
this according, obviously,

00:32:12.531 --> 00:32:15.938
to the presence of an infant but also,

00:32:15.938 --> 00:32:18.449
according to the physiological state.

00:32:18.449 --> 00:32:22.677
Male, for example, will
either trigger this behavior

00:32:22.677 --> 00:32:24.156
or not trigger this behavior according

00:32:24.156 --> 00:32:26.034
to whether they are fathers or not.

00:32:26.034 --> 00:32:29.261
And so, what we would
like to understand is

00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:32.350
how are all these different
displays being performed

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.276
and what is the role of this environment

00:32:35.276 --> 00:32:37.306
in the activity of these neurons?

00:32:37.306 --> 00:32:39.688
And the first set of
experiment that we've done

00:32:39.688 --> 00:32:42.674
is really tried to understand
whether these galanin neurons

00:32:42.674 --> 00:32:46.010
really are involved in
all these different part

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:47.218
of parenting.

00:32:47.218 --> 00:32:49.958
And so, the experiment that
I'm gonna show you here

00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:53.205
is what is called bulk
imaging or volume imaging

00:32:53.205 --> 00:32:55.481
of these galanin neurons.

00:32:55.481 --> 00:32:59.564
The idea is that these
neurons now are expressing

00:33:00.458 --> 00:33:04.139
genetically encoded
indicator of neural activity.

00:33:04.139 --> 00:33:06.958
So these neurons are now
gonna emit fluorescence

00:33:06.958 --> 00:33:11.104
when they are active and
only in this particular area.

00:33:11.104 --> 00:33:15.462
And when we have an optic
prompt that enable to visualize

00:33:15.462 --> 00:33:17.491
the intensity of the signal.

00:33:17.491 --> 00:33:18.766
And so it's called bulk imaging

00:33:18.766 --> 00:33:21.026
because we don't have cellular resolution.

00:33:21.026 --> 00:33:22.885
In other words, we're
looking at the activity

00:33:22.885 --> 00:33:24.585
of all these neurons together.

00:33:24.585 --> 00:33:27.038
And so what you see here is a female

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:29.873
and here a bunch of pups over there.

00:33:29.873 --> 00:33:33.856
And the animal has an optic fiber here

00:33:33.856 --> 00:33:38.673
and what you can see here
is the level of calcium.

00:33:38.673 --> 00:33:41.203
And as the female approaches the pups,

00:33:41.203 --> 00:33:44.703
you can see the level of calcium going up.

00:33:46.083 --> 00:33:47.536
And she's licking the pups,

00:33:47.536 --> 00:33:51.859
and indeed the level
of calcium stays high.

00:33:51.859 --> 00:33:55.442
And then as she brings
the pup to the nest,

00:33:57.551 --> 00:34:01.107
and start licking the pup,
then the level of calcium

00:34:01.107 --> 00:34:03.440
is really going up the roof.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.486
Interestingly, we found
that all of the pups

00:34:08.486 --> 00:34:12.175
composing parental behavior
involved this galanin neuron.

00:34:12.175 --> 00:34:13.533
So that's quite interesting.

00:34:13.533 --> 00:34:15.973
Now, I'm gonna show you another video

00:34:15.973 --> 00:34:18.854
in which this female
here has a very similar

00:34:18.854 --> 00:34:21.024
type of behavior as you can see.

00:34:21.024 --> 00:34:23.760
She's grooming something, licking,

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.453
and then, she's gonna bring
that thing to the nest

00:34:27.453 --> 00:34:29.888
exactly as she has done with the pups,

00:34:29.888 --> 00:34:32.070
but as you can see here, the level

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.152
of C level is completely flat.

00:34:34.152 --> 00:34:35.090
What's happening?

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:37.149
Well, although the
behavior looks very much

00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:38.995
like parenting behavior, actually,

00:34:38.995 --> 00:34:42.064
she's handling a fish
cracker, so that's not.

00:34:42.064 --> 00:34:44.897
(audience laughs)

00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:50.440
And in these circumstances,
galanin neurons

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.120
are totally silent.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.804
Again, although the behavior
looks exactly the same,

00:34:54.804 --> 00:34:56.918
what's happening in the
brain, the significance

00:34:56.918 --> 00:35:00.539
of this behavior is completely different

00:35:00.539 --> 00:35:03.853
and involved in very
different parts of the brain.

00:35:03.853 --> 00:35:07.760
So, in summary, we started by the idea

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.455
that parenting is an essential behavior

00:35:10.455 --> 00:35:14.085
and that in different species
it's displayed differently

00:35:14.085 --> 00:35:16.406
by males, by females, sometimes both,

00:35:16.406 --> 00:35:18.654
and that we were really
interested in going

00:35:18.654 --> 00:35:22.037
to the cellular and molecular
basis of this behavior.

00:35:22.037 --> 00:35:25.715
And we saw in this really
interesting system in a mouse

00:35:25.715 --> 00:35:28.312
in which animal are or not parenting,

00:35:28.312 --> 00:35:31.641
and we found this
fascinating immunocell type,

00:35:31.641 --> 00:35:36.159
this MPOA galanin neurons
that now really give us entry

00:35:36.159 --> 00:35:39.020
into how parenting behaviors control.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.483
What are the different
regulations of these neurons?

00:35:41.483 --> 00:35:43.267
What are their sets of projection?

00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:45.475
What type of input do they receive,

00:35:45.475 --> 00:35:49.528
and how all of these changes
in both during development

00:35:49.528 --> 00:35:54.244
in males and females and
during mental illness.

00:35:54.244 --> 00:35:57.730
And I would to thank the people,
the wonderful collaborator

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.944
in my lab who've performed this work.

00:35:59.944 --> 00:36:00.777
Thank you.

00:36:00.777 --> 00:36:02.973
(audience applauds)

00:36:02.973 --> 00:36:06.662
- I tend to get unsolicited feedback,

00:36:06.662 --> 00:36:08.763
such so that should be a very short talk.

00:36:08.763 --> 00:36:09.596
(audience laughs)

00:36:09.596 --> 00:36:11.353
Isn't that a kind of
contradiction of terms?

00:36:11.353 --> 00:36:13.572
You mean they found one?

00:36:13.572 --> 00:36:15.033
(audience laughs)

00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:16.988
And there's like a book a month

00:36:16.988 --> 00:36:20.085
that sort of piles on in
these unflattering portrayals.

00:36:20.085 --> 00:36:22.182
The Primal Teen, that's
actually not too bad,

00:36:22.182 --> 00:36:24.376
but Mom, I Hate You: Get Out of My Life,

00:36:24.376 --> 00:36:27.306
but First, Drop Cheryl
and I Off At the Mall,

00:36:27.306 --> 00:36:28.914
Now, I Know Why Tigers Eat Their Young,

00:36:28.914 --> 00:36:32.298
or right to the point,
Yes, Your Teen is Crazy.

00:36:32.298 --> 00:36:34.989
But with the technologies such as

00:36:34.989 --> 00:36:38.360
magnetic resonance imaging,
we can for the first time

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:41.344
look under the hood at
the living growing brain.

00:36:41.344 --> 00:36:46.260
And what we've found is that
not only do teens have brains,

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.093
(audience laughs)

00:36:47.093 --> 00:36:49.752
but they're good brains.

00:36:49.752 --> 00:36:51.919
They're as they should be.

00:36:52.826 --> 00:36:54.539
They're not broken.

00:36:54.539 --> 00:36:57.510
And I'd go so far as to
say if they weren't the way

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:01.625
that they are, we wouldn't even be here.

00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:06.317
Evidence from that comes from
a kind of unlikely source

00:37:06.317 --> 00:37:07.507
that I'll get to in a minute.

00:37:07.507 --> 00:37:11.043
So the teen brain's different
than the brain of a child.

00:37:11.043 --> 00:37:12.480
It's different than the brain of an adult.

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.771
It's not just halfway between.

00:37:13.771 --> 00:37:18.325
It's, you know, kind of
its own distinct entity,

00:37:18.325 --> 00:37:20.906
and it's been exquisitely
forged by evolution

00:37:20.906 --> 00:37:22.629
to have certain features.

00:37:22.629 --> 00:37:26.796
Behaviorally, the big three
are increased risk taking,

00:37:27.672 --> 00:37:30.626
increased sensation
seeking, and a move away

00:37:30.626 --> 00:37:32.203
from parents to peers.

00:37:32.203 --> 00:37:34.245
And I think these are really deeply rooted

00:37:34.245 --> 00:37:35.748
in our biology cause it's not just humans.

00:37:35.748 --> 00:37:38.758
All social mammals have
these three features.

00:37:38.758 --> 00:37:41.175
And so, we're probably
fighting mother nature

00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:43.559
by trying to eliminate these.

00:37:43.559 --> 00:37:47.985
And this is always very
speculative to argue these ways,

00:37:47.985 --> 00:37:52.152
but one idea is that it
helped us get out of the home,

00:37:53.183 --> 00:37:55.926
which is a really irrational
thing to do, right?

00:37:55.926 --> 00:37:56.910
(audience laughs)

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:57.743
People love us.

00:37:57.743 --> 00:37:58.576
They feed us.

00:37:58.576 --> 00:37:59.409
They protect us.

00:37:59.409 --> 00:38:00.672
It's a good gig, right?

00:38:00.672 --> 00:38:03.676
But it turns out it works better if we do.

00:38:03.676 --> 00:38:07.640
Less inbreeding, it just
sort of, not morally right

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:12.126
or wrong, it just works
better if this happens.

00:38:12.126 --> 00:38:14.963
And so these features,
they evolved at a time

00:38:14.963 --> 00:38:17.999
without firearms, without,
you know, high speed

00:38:17.999 --> 00:38:20.176
motor vehicles, without
designer drugs and stuff.

00:38:20.176 --> 00:38:23.451
Some of these issues are
kind of the stone-age brain

00:38:23.451 --> 00:38:26.310
in a computer age world aspect.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:30.477
But I think that these
behaviors have virtues as well.

00:38:31.892 --> 00:38:35.877
When I was I was a the
NIH, the Smithsonian Museum

00:38:35.877 --> 00:38:36.710
was sort of close.

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.949
They had this exhibit,
The Hall of Human Origins,

00:38:38.949 --> 00:38:43.264
which I really like, but kind
of not particularly featured.

00:38:43.264 --> 00:38:45.817
A little placard on the floor
looked at the relationship

00:38:45.817 --> 00:38:48.925
between brain size and climate change.

00:38:48.925 --> 00:38:51.209
And the last big increase in brain size,

00:38:51.209 --> 00:38:54.338
500, 800,000 years ago, but
what I thought was intriguing

00:38:54.338 --> 00:38:58.055
was that what would correlate
is the change in climate,

00:38:58.055 --> 00:39:00.089
not the degree.

00:39:00.089 --> 00:39:01.979
So before seeing this, I thought,
yeah, it got really cold.

00:39:01.979 --> 00:39:03.769
You had to be super
smart just to stay alive

00:39:03.769 --> 00:39:06.532
long enough to get food and reproduce.

00:39:06.532 --> 00:39:08.170
But this is subtly different.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.701
Everybody in this room
had ancestors whose brains

00:39:11.701 --> 00:39:13.701
were good at adaptation.

00:39:15.351 --> 00:39:18.758
And were really good at it in terms of,

00:39:18.758 --> 00:39:22.554
even compared to our quite
close, genetically close,

00:39:22.554 --> 00:39:25.868
rather in the Neandertrumps
or Neanderthals.

00:39:25.868 --> 00:39:28.679
(audience laughs)

00:39:28.679 --> 00:39:29.512
I'll pause.

00:39:29.512 --> 00:39:31.665
We can edit that later.

00:39:31.665 --> 00:39:34.546
(audience applauds)

00:39:34.546 --> 00:39:39.037
And there's a, we can tell
an enormous amount from teeth

00:39:39.037 --> 00:39:41.105
and fossilized teeth, which
is actually redundant.

00:39:41.105 --> 00:39:43.351
Everybody's teeth right now are fossils,

00:39:43.351 --> 00:39:47.635
calcified cells, but they work like trees.

00:39:47.635 --> 00:39:49.032
So they have rings.

00:39:49.032 --> 00:39:51.481
So tree rings you can,
this was a wet year,

00:39:51.481 --> 00:39:53.790
a good year of growth,
the rings are wider.

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.427
And across many different
species, the rings

00:39:56.427 --> 00:39:58.919
get closer and closer as you mature.

00:39:58.919 --> 00:40:02.938
The rings stop, and you're
done growing, done maturing.

00:40:02.938 --> 00:40:06.188
And so when you find
these fossilized teeth,

00:40:06.188 --> 00:40:10.627
if you find a fossilized
Neanderthal tooth of a 12-year-old,

00:40:10.627 --> 00:40:12.161
and then check the rest
of the cave, he's gonna be

00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:14.708
with his children, not his parents.

00:40:14.708 --> 00:40:18.599
And this is often portrayed
as surprisingly rapid growth

00:40:18.599 --> 00:40:21.182
in the Neanderthals, but I
think that's the wrong way

00:40:21.182 --> 00:40:22.015
to look at it.

00:40:22.015 --> 00:40:25.732
What's surprising is
our protracted growth.

00:40:25.732 --> 00:40:27.940
We're the outliers by far.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.283
It's one of the most
distinctive things about us.

00:40:30.283 --> 00:40:34.450
And even across, like, crows
and many other species,

00:40:35.511 --> 00:40:38.085
the longer you're under
protection of your parent,

00:40:38.085 --> 00:40:40.511
the more complicated your food gathering,

00:40:40.511 --> 00:40:42.481
your communication, you
know, problem solving.

00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:44.748
Crows are actually really
smart as an example,

00:40:44.748 --> 00:40:49.425
but similar crows in size
and stuff that don't have

00:40:49.425 --> 00:40:51.986
this protective maturation
don't have those abilities

00:40:51.986 --> 00:40:53.169
as well.

00:40:53.169 --> 00:40:55.126
And it doesn't work to
just keep your kids at home

00:40:55.126 --> 00:40:56.088
'til they're 40.

00:40:56.088 --> 00:40:58.070
I don't think on an individual
basis it doesn't work.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:00.612
It's an intriguing trade-off I think

00:41:00.612 --> 00:41:02.417
that we keep options open.

00:41:02.417 --> 00:41:05.514
We keep our brains changeable,
see what the environment's

00:41:05.514 --> 00:41:06.347
gonna to be like.

00:41:06.347 --> 00:41:07.180
We can live on the North Pole.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.611
We can live on the Equator.

00:41:08.611 --> 00:41:10.507
We can even live in outer
space for a little while

00:41:10.507 --> 00:41:12.843
with technologies that are
being made and developed.

00:41:12.843 --> 00:41:15.336
And so this is a good
thing, I think, in terms

00:41:15.336 --> 00:41:20.243
of this ability to keep
options open for a long time,

00:41:20.243 --> 00:41:22.245
but it's really being put to the test

00:41:22.245 --> 00:41:24.578
with the digital revolution.

00:41:25.746 --> 00:41:29.913
And this is just in my short
career, it's a game-changer.

00:41:31.271 --> 00:41:34.267
In the way that we interact
and like we're doing

00:41:34.267 --> 00:41:37.555
at this moment with ones
and zeros and the lights,

00:41:37.555 --> 00:41:40.941
the projectors, you know,
it's changed everything.

00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:43.858
It's changed the way that we learn.

00:41:47.227 --> 00:41:49.039
You know, content that's on internet.

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:51.717
I mean, the greatest minds on
the planet are a click away,

00:41:51.717 --> 00:41:53.044
for free.

00:41:53.044 --> 00:41:54.272
It's amazing.

00:41:54.272 --> 00:41:55.527
It's magical.

00:41:55.527 --> 00:41:58.273
The way that we play, and
the way that we interact

00:41:58.273 --> 00:42:00.090
with each other.

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:03.538
And so, I've been fascinated
by this interaction

00:42:03.538 --> 00:42:07.961
in terms of the, you know,
biology of this changeability

00:42:07.961 --> 00:42:12.128
and the technologies that
have taken over, in a sense,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.606
so of almost 11 hours
a day of screen time.

00:42:17.606 --> 00:42:20.915
And 30% of that time more than one device.

00:42:20.915 --> 00:42:24.705
And so the usual question
is is it good or bad?

00:42:24.705 --> 00:42:26.433
That's the wrong question, right?

00:42:26.433 --> 00:42:30.785
Almost any interesting
question is it depends

00:42:30.785 --> 00:42:34.132
in terms of in what
ways and how it depends

00:42:34.132 --> 00:42:35.499
and what it depends upon.

00:42:35.499 --> 00:42:39.035
But I think that this is
an opportunity in terms

00:42:39.035 --> 00:42:41.368
of to influence adolescence.

00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:46.593
One of the tragedies of my profession

00:42:46.593 --> 00:42:48.625
is that it's almost a 10 year gap

00:42:48.625 --> 00:42:51.904
between onset of illness and treatment.

00:42:51.904 --> 00:42:56.458
It's, we need to do
better, and I think perhaps

00:42:56.458 --> 00:43:00.164
new technologies can help
us get there in terms of

00:43:00.164 --> 00:43:03.511
by monitoring things like
social media activity.

00:43:03.511 --> 00:43:06.486
Maybe even just movement
to best aid harnessing

00:43:06.486 --> 00:43:09.151
these technologies in an
ethically appropriate way

00:43:09.151 --> 00:43:12.504
to help us recognize mental
illness so that we can

00:43:12.504 --> 00:43:16.592
intervene while the brain
is still more changeable.

00:43:16.592 --> 00:43:19.603
And so a lot of the debates around this

00:43:19.603 --> 00:43:22.436
that it's just not natural, right.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:27.082
We evolve to talk to each
other, to be with each other,

00:43:27.082 --> 00:43:29.067
share smells and touches and everything.

00:43:29.067 --> 00:43:33.234
And now, we're looking at screens
for a big part of the day.

00:43:34.174 --> 00:43:35.522
But a kind of argument to that is

00:43:35.522 --> 00:43:38.159
reading's not natural either.

00:43:38.159 --> 00:43:41.222
Reading's only about 5,200 years old.

00:43:41.222 --> 00:43:43.815
So most humanity, nobody read.

00:43:43.815 --> 00:43:46.711
So I don't think that by
itself is a good argument.

00:43:46.711 --> 00:43:50.572
It kind of makes the point that the whole

00:43:50.572 --> 00:43:53.529
aspect of this is the changeability.

00:43:53.529 --> 00:43:55.706
10,000 years ago, hunting,
gathering berries,

00:43:55.706 --> 00:43:57.682
that's the same brain in terms of

00:43:57.682 --> 00:43:59.879
that's a blink of an eye
in evolutionary terms.

00:43:59.879 --> 00:44:01.994
But our brains are amazing.

00:44:01.994 --> 00:44:02.987
We can adapt.

00:44:02.987 --> 00:44:06.956
A lot of us spend a lot
of our day with symbols,

00:44:06.956 --> 00:44:09.168
you know, words, and that,

00:44:09.168 --> 00:44:10.910
and that's so different than, you know,

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:13.384
what our ancestors did.

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:16.782
And so my career has basically been this

00:44:16.782 --> 00:44:20.289
in terms of trying to
understand this plasticity

00:44:20.289 --> 00:44:23.283
in terms of how to optimize the good

00:44:23.283 --> 00:44:25.033
and minimize the bad.

00:44:27.024 --> 00:44:30.408
And this, kind of, how do you help people

00:44:30.408 --> 00:44:34.778
with mental illness is
the fundamental question.

00:44:34.778 --> 00:44:38.723
And so, kind of that
notion of what do we know?

00:44:38.723 --> 00:44:39.642
How do we know what we know?

00:44:39.642 --> 00:44:40.621
What don't we know?

00:44:40.621 --> 00:44:42.325
Why don't we know that?

00:44:42.325 --> 00:44:45.802
But, you know, my first assumption
is the brain's involved.

00:44:45.802 --> 00:44:46.670
I hope so.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.725
If it's like the spleen or
something, I'm gonna feel

00:44:48.725 --> 00:44:50.973
like a complete fool down the road.

00:44:50.973 --> 00:44:55.140
But I think, you know, that's
a good reasonable assumption.

00:44:56.718 --> 00:44:59.288
And Professor Jernigan began this journey.

00:44:59.288 --> 00:45:03.014
BJ and I started together
each following down that path

00:45:03.014 --> 00:45:07.097
of looking at the brain
and how the brain changes

00:45:07.974 --> 00:45:11.722
in both typical development
and in illnesses.

00:45:11.722 --> 00:45:14.825
It's kind of a non-creative
design actually.

00:45:14.825 --> 00:45:17.968
But scan kids, you know,
when they're young,

00:45:17.968 --> 00:45:20.870
and follow them as they grow through life.

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:24.080
See how they're doing at school, at home.

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.233
See what sort of
influences are on the brain

00:45:28.233 --> 00:45:29.893
for good or ill.

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:34.060
And at the NH, we did about
10,000 scans, half the kids

00:45:36.438 --> 00:45:40.339
healthy, half the kids
with different illnesses.

00:45:40.339 --> 00:45:43.672
And what we've found were, it's nuanced,

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:46.431
but like, the brain doesn't mature

00:45:46.431 --> 00:45:48.576
by getting bigger and bigger.

00:45:48.576 --> 00:45:51.812
By first grade, it's already
93% of an adult size.

00:45:51.812 --> 00:45:55.227
It matures by becoming more
connected within itself

00:45:55.227 --> 00:45:57.640
and more specialized.

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:01.632
And this idea of being more connected,

00:46:01.632 --> 00:46:04.494
there's many ways you can approach this,

00:46:04.494 --> 00:46:05.937
but white matter is one of them.

00:46:05.937 --> 00:46:08.571
So this insulating material
that you'll get one

00:46:08.571 --> 00:46:11.882
to two percent more of in
the fourth or fifth decade.

00:46:11.882 --> 00:46:16.049
The brain was able to communicate
amongst itself faster.

00:46:17.081 --> 00:46:18.439
It's not very subtle.

00:46:18.439 --> 00:46:21.875
It's like a 3,000 fold
increase in bandwidth.

00:46:21.875 --> 00:46:25.951
It's, I think, underlies a lot
of the remarkable behaviors

00:46:25.951 --> 00:46:27.201
that we can do.

00:46:28.199 --> 00:46:31.731
But it's not just a matter
of maximizing speed.

00:46:31.731 --> 00:46:33.431
It's all about the timing.

00:46:33.431 --> 00:46:37.381
And so fire together, wire
together, the meaning,

00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:40.616
all the information in these patterns.

00:46:40.616 --> 00:46:42.170
But more and more we're understanding

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:45.187
that's the progression, and
if we look at different parts

00:46:45.187 --> 00:46:46.977
of the brain like letters of the alphabet,

00:46:46.977 --> 00:46:51.144
as we go from an infant to
child latency, teenagers,

00:46:52.184 --> 00:46:55.182
emerging adulthood that
these letters become words,

00:46:55.182 --> 00:46:56.773
the words become sentences, the sentences,

00:46:56.773 --> 00:46:59.159
you know, paragraphs metaphorically.

00:46:59.159 --> 00:47:02.838
And this all goes up in adolescence.

00:47:02.838 --> 00:47:05.112
The brain almost, no
matter how you measure it,

00:47:05.112 --> 00:47:08.945
whether molecular, EEG,
blood flow, it's just,

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:13.337
you know, it becomes more connected.

00:47:13.337 --> 00:47:16.076
And this is a kind of
a fresh look in terms

00:47:16.076 --> 00:47:18.412
of this idea of graph theory networks,

00:47:18.412 --> 00:47:20.398
and it gives us a whole new look.

00:47:20.398 --> 00:47:24.355
So for something like
schizophrenia, before we'd be like,

00:47:24.355 --> 00:47:26.238
is this chunk bigger or smaller

00:47:26.238 --> 00:47:28.541
or a different shape or size?

00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:32.766
But looking at the same
MRI scan and the same data

00:47:32.766 --> 00:47:34.879
and looking at how it's interconnected,

00:47:34.879 --> 00:47:38.412
then we can discern old from
young, healthy from ill,

00:47:38.412 --> 00:47:39.863
cause they bring it back.

00:47:39.863 --> 00:47:43.792
Not perfectly, but it's really
exciting for someone like me.

00:47:43.792 --> 00:47:47.057
I can't do the math, but
to be a consumer of it

00:47:47.057 --> 00:47:51.699
in terms of that, by looking
at this connectivity,

00:47:51.699 --> 00:47:56.001
it gives us a whole new
perspective on these illnesses.

00:47:56.001 --> 00:47:58.267
The other process is
the gray matter process.

00:47:58.267 --> 00:48:02.275
And the one, two punch is
over produce and then war

00:48:02.275 --> 00:48:05.185
or fight it out, so it's
how almost all complexity

00:48:05.185 --> 00:48:06.957
in nature arises.

00:48:06.957 --> 00:48:09.876
Engine of evolution, over
produce something non-random

00:48:09.876 --> 00:48:13.464
selection, and it has
great, you know, potential.

00:48:13.464 --> 00:48:15.748
So it's constantly ongoing.

00:48:15.748 --> 00:48:18.049
It's not like you only over
produce during childhood

00:48:18.049 --> 00:48:21.037
and only prune during
adolescence, but we see this

00:48:21.037 --> 00:48:25.204
upside down U type of curve
where, as we specialize,

00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:29.222
the brain actually becomes smaller.

00:48:29.222 --> 00:48:33.140
So after around 10, 11, 12,
your brain doesn't get bigger.

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:35.880
It gets smaller but leaner,
meaner, more specialized

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.630
based on what is demanding of it.

00:48:39.775 --> 00:48:41.918
But it's not all parts equal.

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:45.977
The prefrontal cortex involved
in controlling impulses,

00:48:45.977 --> 00:48:49.999
long-range planning, it's
particularly late to settle down.

00:48:49.999 --> 00:48:54.166
Some 25 to 30, and that
combined with the hormonally

00:48:56.816 --> 00:49:00.122
activated puberty activated limbic system,

00:49:00.122 --> 00:49:03.352
the path of rewards,
this imbalance creates

00:49:03.352 --> 00:49:07.519
a lot of the specialness
of teen behavior aspects.

00:49:09.182 --> 00:49:12.188
But again, this is how it should be.

00:49:12.188 --> 00:49:16.130
If the prefrontal cortex was already done,

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:19.453
like 11 or 12 and stuff, then,
we wouldn't be as adaptable.

00:49:19.453 --> 00:49:22.679
And so I think this is the
tension or the trade off.

00:49:22.679 --> 00:49:26.276
The other place to start in terms of that,

00:49:26.276 --> 00:49:30.228
these illnesses happen at
different times and not perfectly.

00:49:30.228 --> 00:49:32.448
There's always variation, but
Alzheimer's doesn't happen

00:49:32.448 --> 00:49:36.008
when you're three, and autism
doesn't start when you're 60.

00:49:36.008 --> 00:49:38.653
That characteristically,
certain illnesses tend

00:49:38.653 --> 00:49:40.820
to emerge at certain ages.

00:49:42.538 --> 00:49:43.904
And that's puzzling, you know.

00:49:43.904 --> 00:49:44.851
Why is that?

00:49:44.851 --> 00:49:48.353
In terms of, and when you
start looking at this,

00:49:48.353 --> 00:49:50.581
so much happens in adolescence.

00:49:50.581 --> 00:49:51.914
Not a lot, most.

00:49:53.126 --> 00:49:56.815
So up to 75%, and I still
don't know the answer.

00:49:56.815 --> 00:49:59.957
For 25 years, I've been like, why?

00:49:59.957 --> 00:50:03.267
Because the early answer is
oh, teenagers are stressful.

00:50:03.267 --> 00:50:05.311
It's stressful time of life.

00:50:05.311 --> 00:50:07.417
Kids have their parents
killed in front of them

00:50:07.417 --> 00:50:10.076
or a lot are starving to
death in war-torn countries.

00:50:10.076 --> 00:50:14.160
Enormous stresses, but they
don't get schizophrenia.

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.299
And so that never rang true.

00:50:17.299 --> 00:50:18.804
And I still don't know, I
don't know the answer to this.

00:50:18.804 --> 00:50:22.352
Why do things happen when they do?

00:50:22.352 --> 00:50:26.102
And so just one example
is for schizophrenia.

00:50:27.359 --> 00:50:30.054
All of the findings you
see in adult schizophrenia,

00:50:30.054 --> 00:50:32.933
you could predict, what
if typical teen changes

00:50:32.933 --> 00:50:34.016
went too far?

00:50:35.305 --> 00:50:36.326
Is not causal.

00:50:36.326 --> 00:50:37.337
They already had schizophrenia.

00:50:37.337 --> 00:50:40.175
But it sort of, so far without exception

00:50:40.175 --> 00:50:42.629
in terms of both the MRI changes

00:50:42.629 --> 00:50:44.108
but also the molecular changes.

00:50:44.108 --> 00:50:48.213
And so, it's just, this
point, it's intriguing.

00:50:48.213 --> 00:50:51.488
It doesn't help me help
families with schizophrenia.

00:50:51.488 --> 00:50:53.059
But I think these are the kinds of clues

00:50:53.059 --> 00:50:55.726
that we're starting to understand.

00:50:55.726 --> 00:50:58.458
So in the specialization process,

00:50:58.458 --> 00:51:02.625
in typical development, it's
about 7% from ages 12 to 17.

00:51:03.792 --> 00:51:06.687
In schizophrenia, 28%.

00:51:06.687 --> 00:51:10.288
So it's not subtle, you
know, a four fold difference.

00:51:10.288 --> 00:51:14.338
And so understanding
the typical development,

00:51:14.338 --> 00:51:17.328
I think is key, but about
half of what I deal with

00:51:17.328 --> 00:51:20.046
as an illness, isn't an illness, right.

00:51:20.046 --> 00:51:21.544
Pregnancy is not an illness.

00:51:21.544 --> 00:51:24.238
But it's a big deal, right.

00:51:24.238 --> 00:51:27.435
Relationships, car accidents,
incarceration, you know,

00:51:27.435 --> 00:51:29.770
life decisions, this
happens during adolescence.

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:33.248
And it's frustrating,
you know, as a physician,

00:51:33.248 --> 00:51:35.636
it's like there's no
insurance forms to check

00:51:35.636 --> 00:51:37.621
in terms of for these very real issues

00:51:37.621 --> 00:51:39.905
that aren't an illness.

00:51:39.905 --> 00:51:42.836
And this kind of notion,
is the glass half empty

00:51:42.836 --> 00:51:44.707
or half full?

00:51:44.707 --> 00:51:48.604
Because this changeability
could be a great opportunity

00:51:48.604 --> 00:51:51.710
making it even more tragic
that we aren't recognizing

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.916
the illnesses when they occur.

00:51:53.916 --> 00:51:58.505
And my final sort of analogy
is to use Michelangelo

00:51:58.505 --> 00:52:00.952
in terms of this is a very
famous painting of his

00:52:00.952 --> 00:52:04.447
that by design should look like a brain,

00:52:04.447 --> 00:52:06.531
a cross-section of the brain.

00:52:06.531 --> 00:52:09.341
Yeah, he wrote about it himself and stuff,

00:52:09.341 --> 00:52:11.664
and it's sometimes called
the original synapse.

00:52:11.664 --> 00:52:12.497
You know?

00:52:12.497 --> 00:52:14.250
(audience laughs)

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:16.115
A little neuroscience humor.

00:52:16.115 --> 00:52:17.826
But it's not like that.

00:52:17.826 --> 00:52:21.993
It's much more like his other
expression of art, sculpting.

00:52:23.583 --> 00:52:27.750
And we start with this block
of marble and life experiences.

00:52:29.105 --> 00:52:31.325
So then, we eliminate parts.

00:52:31.325 --> 00:52:34.400
So me might be born with
different chunks of marble,

00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:39.011
from sizes, from genetics,
but within each if we knew

00:52:39.011 --> 00:52:42.196
what we were doing, if we
could guide this process,

00:52:42.196 --> 00:52:44.277
you know, there's masterpieces.

00:52:44.277 --> 00:52:47.616
And, you know, in I
think almost everybody.

00:52:47.616 --> 00:52:52.244
And we don't know very, we
don't know what we're doing yet

00:52:52.244 --> 00:52:56.245
very well, and it's like, most
of the illnesses emerging,

00:52:56.245 --> 00:52:58.720
less than one and a half
percent of the funding

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.294
has been adolescence.

00:53:00.294 --> 00:53:04.585
Until now, finally, now,
we have this project

00:53:04.585 --> 00:53:08.752
that for the first time is
going to really do this right.

00:53:11.248 --> 00:53:14.805
11, 12,000 or, you know, kids, 19 sites

00:53:14.805 --> 00:53:18.638
across the country to
understand what matters.

00:53:20.143 --> 00:53:22.856
How does the brain grow
in health and illness?

00:53:22.856 --> 00:53:25.952
Looking at, you know, everything
we can think of frankly,

00:53:25.952 --> 00:53:28.619
in terms of, influences on this.

00:53:29.848 --> 00:53:33.778
I'm gonna brag for San
Diego a bit in terms of

00:53:33.778 --> 00:53:36.405
there's these 19 sites across the country,

00:53:36.405 --> 00:53:39.663
but the coordinating center
for the quantitative core

00:53:39.663 --> 00:53:43.940
and the neuropsych core
coordinating all the centers

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:45.975
are both here in San Diego as well.

00:53:45.975 --> 00:53:50.024
What a good deal for us in
terms of the opportunities

00:53:50.024 --> 00:53:52.607
to try to understand, you know,

00:53:53.447 --> 00:53:55.870
what matters in teen's lives.

00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:59.244
And so the technology is a big part of it.

00:53:59.244 --> 00:54:01.556
How can we get a better sense of internal

00:54:01.556 --> 00:54:04.586
and external environment with the sensors,

00:54:04.586 --> 00:54:08.490
with devices they're already
using, they're already wearing

00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:10.249
cause this is the crossroads in right,

00:54:10.249 --> 00:54:13.529
this is where people, you
know, make big decisions

00:54:13.529 --> 00:54:16.336
about their direction in life.

00:54:16.336 --> 00:54:19.232
And there's this kind of notion that teens

00:54:19.232 --> 00:54:22.236
are messed up and they're
misguided and stuff,

00:54:22.236 --> 00:54:23.908
and it's dangerous.

00:54:23.908 --> 00:54:26.668
I feel bad that I've, cause I've...

00:54:26.668 --> 00:54:28.405
(audience laughs)

00:54:28.405 --> 00:54:30.734
Oh, I see, people, I don't know.

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:33.320
So this is in the crossroads.

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:35.704
And what happens is even teens themselves

00:54:35.704 --> 00:54:37.340
buy into this, right.

00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.247
Like stereotype threat and stuff.

00:54:39.247 --> 00:54:42.170
If you think that you're not
capable and stuff like that.

00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:43.063
It matters.

00:54:43.063 --> 00:54:44.721
Most teens do well.

00:54:44.721 --> 00:54:45.943
You know, they'll get through this.

00:54:45.943 --> 00:54:46.819
They'll do well.

00:54:46.819 --> 00:54:49.139
But I think we do a
disservice by, you know,

00:54:49.139 --> 00:54:52.878
selling them short, and
I think that, you know,

00:54:52.878 --> 00:54:55.710
we really need to recognize
the huge upsides of this.

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.525
Much more than the downsides.

00:54:57.525 --> 00:55:00.461
That if we can figure out what
we're doing, what matters,

00:55:00.461 --> 00:55:02.963
we can really make a big difference.

00:55:02.963 --> 00:55:03.960
Thanks.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.793
(audience applauds)

00:55:04.793 --> 00:55:07.876
(light upbeat music)
