let me let me put forward a couple of
 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.409
let me let me put forward a couple of
interesting theories to start with the

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419
interesting theories to start with the
 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.390

that sociologists know and psychologists

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580
that sociologists know and psychologists
 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.409
that sociologists know and psychologists
have observed is that population groups

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419
have observed is that population groups
 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.620
have observed is that population groups
within a population that feel vulnerable

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630
within a population that feel vulnerable
 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.260
within a population that feel vulnerable
for whatever reason tend to be low on

fortified to deal with the consequences
 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.070
fortified to deal with the consequences
of misplaced trust so if you think about

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080
of misplaced trust so if you think about
 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.659
of misplaced trust so if you think about
the Millennial Generation and you think

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669
the Millennial Generation and you think
 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.029
the Millennial Generation and you think
about the demographic characteristics a

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039
about the demographic characteristics a
 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.640
about the demographic characteristics a
large share are non-white and a large

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650

socio-economic scale in both cases you

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220
socio-economic scale in both cases you
 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.000
socio-economic scale in both cases you
know that places them or may place them

in in an attitude of vulnerability and

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849
in in an attitude of vulnerability and
 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.610
in in an attitude of vulnerability and
therefore you can't be too careful

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620
therefore you can't be too careful
 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.920
therefore you can't be too careful
I think it's possible that the fact that

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930
