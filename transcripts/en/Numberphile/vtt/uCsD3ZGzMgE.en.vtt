00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
So it's called the Josephus Problem.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.000
It's based on something from history.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.880
There was a group of Jewish soldiers who were surrounded by the Roman army

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.080
and they didn't want to get captured, so they decided to come up with a system-

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.080
-  to avoid getting captured or suicide.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.320
So they'd sit in a circle, and the first man would kill the guy to the left of him

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.060
The next remaining living person would kill the next remaining living person with their sword.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.700
And they'd go around like this, till there's only one person left,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.940
and the last person would have to commit suicide of course, rather than get captured.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.500
And the story - at least the story I was told, I'm not sure if this is historically accurate -

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.720
Was that Josephus preferred captured than suicide,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.580
but he worried that if he said this, the other soldiers would turn on him.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.480
And so he wanted to figure out: WHERE should he sit within the circle-

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.520
- in order to be the last man living.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.520
And then he would surrender, rather than kill himself.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.500
That was the problem

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
It's a little tricky, so let's do a smaller example.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.020
Let's say there are seven people.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.420
And so just to be clear, the way it works is:
person number one kills number two.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
Person number three kills four,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.720
Five kills six,

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.320
But now things gets a little of harder to kind of see in advance

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.240
Because seven, there is no eight, so seven kills one,

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.960
Three kills five,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240
Seven kills three.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.100
So seven's the winner; seven is the last one left over.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.080
For Josephus, there were 41 people.
He needed to figure out where to sit.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.580
The mathematical problem is if there were n people.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.820
Where's the winning seat?

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.720
When I learned this problem I was in high school,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.940
And it was one of the first problems that got me to understand how you approach-

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.940
- difficult and- and...

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.340
Math problems where you don't know the answer in advance, or someone hasn't shown it to you in advance.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.500
And it was a professor of mine

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.880
his name was Phil Hanlon

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.900
who played a big role in, kind of, leading me to math.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.780
And he suggested: what we should do is we should gather data.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.440
Just...

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.860
Take various values of n and just do it by hand

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.180
and start looking for a pattern.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.420
I don't know, maybe we should just do that?

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.520
n is the number of seats,
and w of n will be the winning seat.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.080
And what we know so far is that:
n is seven, w of n it turns out is also seven.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.460
And so what I would do is I'd start doing some other values

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.880
So, I don't know, why don't I do five?

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.140
One kills two,

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.360
three kills four,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.020
five kills one,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.360
three kills five.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.580
The winner is three.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.060
I guess there was no reason for me to skip six,
so why don't we fill in six.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.340
One kills two, three kills four, five kills six...

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.980
... one kills three and five kills one.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.080
The winner is five.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.580
So

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.300
If you're watching you might already start to notice some patterns.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.000
For instance, they're always odd.
I mean, that's maybe the first thing you notice

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.640
And you can start asking "why are they always odd?"
And maybe you can already see that-

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.460
- in the first loop around, all the even people get killed.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.100
So

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.940
So you can - even with a tiny amount of experiment - start to see some patterns.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.200
- *Brady* So you DON'T want to sit in an even seat?
- Don't sit in an even seat, no no no.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.140
And maybe we're even getting some glimmers of other patterns

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.200
But before I really try to phrase those,
I'd like to fill in the table a little bit more.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.800
So let's do some.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.480
So if there's only one person...

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.980
well...

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.640
That person's the winner, so that one was easy.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.600
If there's two people: one kills two. One is the winner

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.080
If there's three people: one kills two, three kills one. Three is the winner

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:17.500
If there's four people: one kills two, three kills four, one kills three.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.520
If there's eight people: one kills two, three kills four, five kills six, seven kills eight,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.260
one kills three, five kills seven, one kills five.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.740
The winner is one.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.260
Alright so it was one, one, three, one, three, five, seven.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.820
One, three, five, seven, nine.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.420
And you could keep going,
but maybe you can see the pattern now?

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.420
- *Brady* Is thirteen a one?
- NO! Good guess actually!

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.420
But it is not a one. So let's do thirteen.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.000
*Brady* This is good, I don't know then, I can't see the pattern.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.940
So as you see it's jumping by two each time,
but then it resets at some point

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.440
and

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.440
And I want to go back to this, so we'll see what thirteen is quickly

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.340
So we didn't reset that,
and I claim we won't reset it the next one either.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.120
Fourteen will be thirteen

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.300
and here, by the way, we're be starting to make predictions.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.680
It's worth noting we've-

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.240
Even though we maybe can't say
exactly what like 178 would be-

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.760
- we're starting to see well enough so we can make a prediction.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.260
So...

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.740
so you could guess. Is it really true that fourteen is going to give you thirteen?

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.920
We could do it out, and you'll see in fact that's what you'll get

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.940
So we're getting some understanding...

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.420
But I want to go back to this point you had, you asked if it's going to reset and go back to one there

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.980
And the answer was no, and it's worth looking.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.100
Because this is the next thing I was going to do.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.680
Where do we get the ones?

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.440
So if you look for a sec, there's something very special about the numbers that give you ones.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.180
It's the powers of two.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.000
And so maybe you can now guess that if i put in a sixteen, I would get a one back.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.680
And that'll be right, and that's actually going to be a real key in unlocking this.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.560
The professor I was learning this from made a really big point out of this.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.160
And I thought, you know, well

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
I don't know what the general answer is yet!

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.500
And he made a big point: If you know something...

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.260
Prove it, and make sure you really understand that one thing, and that often unlocks the rest.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.320
So

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.540
So he really pushed us when I was first doing this, to try to state a conjecture and then prove a theorem-

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.280
based on what we just saw here.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.280
And so that's what I want to do, so here's the conjecture:

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.520
If n is a pure power of two, then the winning seat is one.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.080
I want to think about this for a second and maybe see why this might be true.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.340
So let's do the next biggest power of two,
maybe the biggest one I can bother writing down.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.480
So let's do sixteen

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.180
So I want to do one pass through the circle.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.980
- *Brady* Take out all the evens.
- Take out all the evens.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.520
And now, fifteen has just killed sixteen.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.760
So I'll put a little dot here so we'll remember it's number one's turn again.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.280
And it's number one's turn again, and we've removed all the evens.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.100
And what's left is therefore exactly half as many.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.480
So if i relabel at this point

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.760
You can see that there's a power of two to start with.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.940
I pass through the circle once, I get rid of all the evens, I have half as many.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.940
And I'm back at number one's turn.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.520
So now if I do this again,
the same thing ought to happen.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.160
Right? I should kill all the evens on the new labeling

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.460
And now there are four people left, and it's STILL number one's turn

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:28.980
So you go through again...

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.120
Kill those guys, there's two people left,
it's still number one's turn-

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.100
- and that one kills that, and it's still number one's turn and that chair wins.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.720
So let's say we believe that.
We know what happens to two to the n.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.700
So how do we explain what happens between the pure powers of two?

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.240
If you see the pattern, you know- we know what happens at eight, and we know what happens at four...

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:54.240
... but between them it goes up by twos until at this point, if I added two to seven, I'd have a nine

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.340
Which would be too big anyway, so that's our reset

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.900
But we knew it was going to reset because it's a pure power of two.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.200
So how do we explain this jumping by two phenomena inbetween?

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.220
So what I'm going to do- I'm gonna just mention that:

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.880
For any number-

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.080
- you can write it as
a big power of two plus something else

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.700
Take the biggest power of two you can subtract from a number-

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.700
And then what's left should be smaller than that.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.700
When you express a number in binary notation-

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.440
- ou choose zeroes or ones, and that gives it out as a sum of a bunch of powers of two...

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.200
... and you just choose the biggest one.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.840
So 77. The biggest power of two I can get is 64.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.860
And then, what is it, it's 64 + 13.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:39.560
So then for 13, the biggest power of two is
8 + 4 + 1. Did I do this right?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.880
72... 77, there you go. And these are all powers of two!

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:50.880
And this is unique. This is the unique way to write 77 as a sum of powers of two.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.560
Where no powers repeated, that's a key point.

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:59.800
So if you wanted to take a general number, take the biggest power of two - 64 - and then the remaining part.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.380
*Mumble* Twelve... Thirteen.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.520
I'm going to call this part two to the a,
and the remaining part I'm going to call l

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:12.400
And I claim that this l is going to tell us which of those odd number between are going to show up.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.520
So let's see how. How about we do thirteen.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.420
n is thirteen.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.220
This is the binary expansion, but using our new method the eight will be the two to the a-

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.440
- and the five (which is the four plus one) that'll be the l.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.440
And here's the thing that's going to happen with the l:

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.440
I'm going to do five steps.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:35.720
So 1 kills 2, 3 kills 4, 5 kills 6, 7 kills 8, 9 kills 10.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.100
So now I've dropped...

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.860
l people.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.020
And it's number eleven's turn.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.240
Now watch what happens, how many people are left?
Well what's left is a power of two.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.840
And we know who wins in a power of two,
it's whoever starts!

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.080
*Brady* The first killer.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.060
The first killer! So now, if we go from here I claim that eleven is going to win.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.940
And just watch, it's going to be.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.420
11 kills 12, 13 kills 1, 3 kills 5, 7 kills 9

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.180
Back to eleven, and now there's only four people left.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.340
11 kills 13, 3 kills 7...

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.440
Back to eleven, two people... Eleven wins.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.080
And so this is really the key to the final answer.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.100
Which is

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.420
If you've written your number as two to the a plus l-

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.920
- after l steps, whosever turn it is is going to win.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.120
Because it's going to be their turn and there'll be a power of two left.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.520
And so the winning seat will be two l plus one.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.920
If you write it in this way, because that's whose turn it is after l steps.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.940
The theorem or the claim, is that if you've written n in this way...

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:38.140
So if n is two to the a plus l, where l is less than two to the a.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.940
It has to be strictly smaller

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.480
So in other words: two to the a is the biggest power that sat inside of n.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:47.120
Then the winning seat is going to be 2 l plus one.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.380
So we've already seen it was true here, right?

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.220
l was five and the winning seat was eleven, which is two times five plus one.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.280
And if you start going back through you'll see it's the same thing for all the answers.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.780
We've already illustrated the mechanisms, which is after l steps-

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:11.080
It's the turn of person 2 l plus one, and after l steps, there are a power of two number of people left.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.760
and...

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.940
Everyone knows that the power of two people, the first person who kills, that's who's going to be the winner

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.940
*Brady* Let's see if Brady has learned!

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.560
*chuckle* Yeah! Alright! Let's do it

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.540
*Brady* - I think I follow. Now in the Josephus problem...

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.040
- Yep!

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.700
- ... There was Josephus and 40 soldiers.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.360
- That's right. Oh yeah! We got to go back and do that!

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.460
- Alright so we got 41 people...

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.080
- So n is 41

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:40.140
- Alright, now I think - expressing that in the way you told me to - it's going to be 32 + 9?

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.460
- There you go, 32 + 9

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.800
- So...

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.320
Two lots of nine... plus one...

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.060
- Mhm

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:49.060
- ... is nineteen

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:51.820
- There we go

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.820
- So we want to sit in position nineteen.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.220
- There you go. You want to sit in the nineteenth chair.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.540
So here we go we're going to do n = 41

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.700
- Alright. Put them in, in the cave, waiting their fate.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.920
- Not a very good circle but...

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.460
- It's getting smaller now...

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.820
- I know.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.860
*Brady and Daniel chuckles*

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.480
*Daniel chuckles*

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.060
Should I redo this?

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.140
- Nah you're okay.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.540
*Daniel mumbles* 40... 41...

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.660
- Okay there we are.
So we got a little tight at the end

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.960
- Look at that, this is a lession about
planning ahead, people.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.080
Okay so let's do it. So one kills two...

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.440
- We're losing our even numbers.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.280
- Yep.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.160
Okay now... 41 kills 1.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:37.500
*Daniel mumbles* three kills five...

00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.680
And 19 kills 35 and there we go!

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:53.620
- Alright.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.500
I was right!

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:55.860
- There we go, nineteen!

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.820
Oh and one other thing in this
problem which is kind of fun...

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.220
So this formula I wrote can be interpreted in binary notation.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.760
When we wrote a number as a sum of powers of two...

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.100
This can be re-expressed in binary notation.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:11.460
So what was this... 32 + 8 + 1

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.220
So that's...

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.920
2⁵ + 2³ + 2⁰

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.720
And binary notation...

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:23.320
The digits correspond to the various powers of two, and all the digits are either zero or one.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.720
So 41 in binary notation would be
one copy of 2⁵,

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.340
zero of 2⁴,

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.340
one of 2³,

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.960
zero 2², zero 2¹ and one 2⁰

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.040
Here's the trick for the Josephus problem.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.880
Which I won't justify but it's super cool,
and you can try it own your own.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.620
The way to find the winning solution if this is n-

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.760
- the winning solution in binary is you take the leading digit-

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.160
- and you put it at the end.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.160
So in other words I claim that if I write

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.460
*Mumbles* Zero... One...

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:57.820
So I take this part and then I add the first digit to the end.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.680
That number in binary code is... Well let's see...

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:10.140
It's 2⁰ + 2¹ + (I skipped 2² and I skipped 2³) and I add 2⁴

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:14.040
So it's 2⁴ + 2¹ + 2⁰

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.420
Which is

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.180
16 + 2 + 1

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:21.280
Which is nineteen, which is exactly what the winning seat was.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.000
and...

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.560
And so there's this super efficient way in binary code to jump straight from the number n-

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:30.580
- to the winning number w of n.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:35.580
So if you're writing you numbers in binary code, the pattern would've been even more quickly apparent

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.960
Isn't that cool?!

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.280
*Brady agrees and chuckles*

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:38.900
Isn't that cool?

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:39.560
- Yeah

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:45.100
This video was filmed at the
Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI)

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.460
That's the building behind me.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.780
If you'd like to find out more about them, link's in the video description.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:55.120
They do some really important serious mathematics here, and they're also a big supporter of math outrage.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.160
As evidenced by this video.
