00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.696
Now, conveniently, there's an equation we can use to relate the ratio of carbon

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:11.820
14 to carbon 12, to the time that has passed. That equation is this, R equals

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.520
10 to the negative 12, times e to the negative t over 8223. In this equation, R

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.690
is that carbon 14 to carbon 12 ratio. And t is the age of the material we're

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.328
looking at measured in years. Now you just found that R for the parchment is

00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:36.490
0.795 times 10 to the negative 12. So using this equation, how old is the

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.270
parchment? Please round to the nearest year. Think about the techniques you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.850
know using logs to simplify and then solve this equation.
