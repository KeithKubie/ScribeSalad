00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.399
Energy is pretty amazing! So amazing that
as a species we use around 15 terawatts at

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:11.309
any given moment! That’s equivalent to 15
trillion watts. Consider this average light

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.490
bulb which consumes roughly 100 watts. One
single terawatt could power 10 billion of

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.199
them at the same time.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.640
Of the world’s energy, the US consumes about
25% , while Google alone accounts for roughly

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.859
0.013%. This is enough energy to continuously
power 200,000 homes

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.190
Food also contains energy, which is measured
in calories or joules. 1 Food Calorie is equal

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.050
to roughly 4200 Joules of energy. So how long
would you have to plug yourself into a wall

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.649
to get a days worth of food energy? If we
take a standard daily diet for a male of around

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.170
2500 Food Calories, we find that our bodies
need around 10,000,000 Joules of energy each

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.399
day. Take something like your laptop, which
charges at about 50 Joules per second, and

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.350
it would take roughly 55 hours to charge yourself.
On the other hand, if we charged at the energy

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.570
input of a microwave which is roughly 1,500
Joules per second, it would only take 1.9

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.860
hours! Even more amazing is the fact that
this much energy would cost roughly 33 cents

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.920
in North America. 33 cents for your daily
intake of energy! It’s too bad we can’t

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.730
just plug in.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.750
But if you took all that energy, how big of
an explosion could it make? Well, 1 Food Calorie

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.190
is conveniently equal to 1 gram of the explosive
TNT. So if you eat 2,500 food calories in

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.750
a day, you’re looking at the equivalent
of about 44 WW2 hand grenades. That’s a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.100
pretty big explosion!

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.510
But it should be no surprise that energy can
cause damage; after all we’ve all experienced

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.600
an electric shock. But how much electricity
does it take to actually kill a human? 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.500
Surprisingly little. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380
7 milliamps, for as little as 3 seconds, to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.440
be exact. This is equivalent to a AAA battery
straight to the heart. You see, electricity

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.000
actually kills by interrupting the heart rhythm.
The reason you don’t see people dying when

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.670
they get shocked is that But our body has
built in protection, like your skin, so it

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.980
doesn’t go straight to your heart. However with
something like lightning, all bets are off.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.520
In fact, a lightning bolt can hit over 1 billion
volts! The reason some people survive lightning

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.620
strikes is based on the path it takes through
their body. If the heart goes untouched, you

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.740
can come out alive.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.070
Which shows you just how awesome and powerful
nature really is. What may surprise you more

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.470
is that every minute, enough sunlight reaches
the earth’s surface to satisfy the world’s

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.450
energy demands—for an entire year. That’s
right, roughly 174 petawatts of energy hits

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.830
the earth from the sun! Of course the biggest
challenge is finding efficient ways to properly

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.530
harness this solar power.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.670
And all this energy and heat are a major contributing
factor to the creation of wind; sometimes

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.550
so powerful that we see things like hurricanes.
But not only can wind turbines take advantage

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.650
of the wind to create power, scientists have
shown how they can, in high enough concentrations,

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.470
help prevent hurricanes. Simply put, wind
turbines remove some energy from the wind

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.230
to generate power. And simulations have shown
that,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.090
 hypothetically, if you put enough wind
turbines together in an at risk region, major

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.980
wind disasters could be minimized substantially.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.690
But apart from this, is wind energy actually
worth it? Click here to check out our AsapTHOUGHT

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.890
video where we explore how exactly wind turbines
work, how much energy they actually produce,

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.350
and the crazy new technologies that will change
our future. I mean, could the whole world

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.390
be powered by wind? 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.890
We went to the GE Global Research Centre in
Germany, a leader in wind energy, to find

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.900
out. There’s a link to it in the description
below.
