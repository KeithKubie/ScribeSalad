00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.370
[CHEERING]

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.840
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Oh, my god.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:14.230
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Welcome.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.310
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.880
We're so excited to
have you here at Google.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.796
Thank you so much for
taking the time to come.

00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:20.500
And this is Jessica
Williams everybody.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.050
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Hey, how you doing?

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.758
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: This
is Phoebe Robinson.

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:23.930
Hey.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.310
PHOEBE ROBINSON: YKY.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.060
JESSICA WILLIAMS: And
we're 2 Dope Queens.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.920
So we're so happy to be here.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.824
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah,
thanks for having us.

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:31.990
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Absolutely.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.090
So just for those
of you who don't

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.940
have an extensive background
about "2 Dope Queens," "2 Dope

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.610
Queens" started as a
comedy show between two

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.490
best friends in Brooklyn, hosted
by these two wonderful ladies

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.420
here to my left.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.240
It launched as a
podcast in March 2016.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.960
And it is produced
by WNYC Studios.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.380
So the "2 Dope Queens" podcast
is appraised by "The Guardian,"

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.940
by "The New York Times."

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.245
It was actually rated
the best podcast of 2016.

00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:04.180
So let's give it up.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.142
JESSICA WILLIAMS: What?

00:01:05.142 --> 00:01:06.104
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:01:06.104 --> 00:01:07.547
OK, you knew that.

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:09.433
I was like-- we talked about it.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:10.433
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: I know.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:13.434
They're like comedy
show in New York.

00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:14.850
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
That is amazing.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.100
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Right, so
just gonna let that soak in

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.300
and simmer and
sparkle for a second.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.760
So you have Season
3 starting soon.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.640
Is that right?

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.960
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yes.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.030
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes, Season
3 starts Tuesday, April 4th.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.880
Are you ready?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.590
Ready to go?

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.220
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yes, of course.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.670
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: All right.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.670
We have some pretty cool
guests that are coming.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.160
We've heard that we have
Jon Hamm, Gabrielle Union.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.720
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yes.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.280
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
That show's gonna

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.780
to be "2 Dope Queens"
and another queen.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.060
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It's
like 2 Dope Queens

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.910
and like a Khaleesi.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.118
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: And like a--

00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:39.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.319
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
It was really cool.

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:42.054
Yeah.

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:43.220
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Absolutely.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.870
All right, so let's get
into some questions.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:45.290
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Cool.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.915
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: I tried to set
up some hard-hitting questions.

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:49.520
Let's not get too serious.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.730
PHOEBE ROBINSON: OK.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.830
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: But
we can get serious.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.430
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We can
do whatever, honestly.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.880
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: I
think we're going

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.435
to go in really deep at first.

00:01:53.435 --> 00:01:54.435
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Great.

00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:55.190
Whatever you want.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.315
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: All right.

00:01:56.315 --> 00:01:58.970
I want to talk to you
guys about your show

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.020
in the context of modern comedy
and intersectional feminism.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.292
How do you feel your show fits
into that social commentary?

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.000
PHOEBE ROBINSON: That's
a great question.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.280
I love that question.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.539
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It just
seems like such a normal--

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.010
it's not hard-hitting to me.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.040
It feels just like a
straight because we

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.150
think about it all the time.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.066
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:18.590
I think when we
started the podcast,

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.870
we just recognized that
the podcasting world

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.317
was very white.

00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:22.816
And--

00:02:22.816 --> 00:02:23.315
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:25.100
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Hmm, really.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.350
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And
everyone kind of sounds

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.120
like Ira Glass, which
is great because he

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.285
has a beautiful voice.

00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:32.451
JESSICA WILLIAMS: He has
the best voice, best voice.

00:02:32.451 --> 00:02:35.510
PHOEBE ROBINSON: But I think
it can make women or people

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.060
of color, people are from the
LGBTQ+ community feel like,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.156
well, this isn't a space for
us because the only things that

00:02:42.156 --> 00:02:45.260
are getting shine or are
breaking out mainstream-wise

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.284
are white people.

00:02:47.284 --> 00:02:48.950
And so when we started
the show, we just

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.610
said that we want
to do shows, comedy

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.650
shows especially in New York,
which are also mostly white.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.180
So we just wanted to do shows
of women, people of color,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.305
people from the queer
community because we're like,

00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:03.180
there's so many brilliant
people that aren't necessarily

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.560
on Netflix's radar, like
Comedy Central's radar yet.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.360
But they're really
talented and funny.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.490
And they have stories
to tell that are just

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.446
as valid and just as important
as the white dude stories.

00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:15.320
You know what I mean?

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.350
And sometimes even, like, more
important, like "La La Land.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.787
Like, sorry, but that was trash.

00:03:19.787 --> 00:03:21.120
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: That was crazy.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.940
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It
was like, oh, you're

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.470
going to save jazz, Ryan?

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.022
OK.

00:03:25.022 --> 00:03:25.522
Um--

00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:26.790
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
All by hisself.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.140
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I can't.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.940
It's like, oh, you
can't sing either?

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.610
Good luck with that.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.170
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Alone.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.920
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Sorry,
that was too much.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.461
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
That was just drag.

00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:36.824
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It angers me!

00:03:36.824 --> 00:03:37.310
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
That was like--

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.820
I knew.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.300
But it's like "La La Land," it
cracks me up because it's so

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.320
triggering for you.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.181
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It
makes me so upset.

00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:44.681
I just--

00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:46.004
[PRETENDS TO VOMIT]

00:03:47.205 --> 00:03:48.830
But anyway, the point
is that we wanted

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.480
to just do something
that was going

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.910
to be representative
of our conversations

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.470
with people that
we hang out with.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.120
And the conversations
that you guys

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.137
have at home or at
work or at the gym.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.720
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
That some of us have.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.928
JESSICA WILLIAMS: At the gym?

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:03.170
I ain't talking to
nobody at the damn gym.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.397
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:04.397 --> 00:04:06.771
PHOEBE ROBINSON: You don't
hang out and chill at Equinox?

00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:07.854
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I don't.

00:04:07.854 --> 00:04:10.430
Like, that's like such a
"Sex in the City" lifestyle

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.180
sort of reference that you
know none of us fucking do.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.431
None of you people do.

00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.269
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I don't know.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.100
Maybe people, like dudes--

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.959
JESSICA WILLIAMS: You
guys have a gym here.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:18.990
PHOEBE ROBINSON: You
have a gym here, right?

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.540
I'm sure you guys talk to--

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.920
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
That's pretty cool.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.045
Do you guys, like, talk,
or are you just mortified?

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:24.140
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Right.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.792
You're like, oh, my god.

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:28.250
Karen in accounts payable wants
to talk to-- headphones in.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.194
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah,
like if you paid me--

00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:32.600
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: We barely talk
to each other outside the gym.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.099
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, well, I know

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:35.970
we're always talking about--

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.310
we're both members of
Equinox, AKA, Eeks.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.070
And so we're always joking about
going to a class or something

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.570
together.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.240
And I'm always
like, I don't know.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.320
I'm not really available.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.420
Just because the
idea of being super

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.380
close to you and sweating,
I'm really scared.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.274
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Who cares if you--

00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:52.170
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I'm scared.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.964
It's vulnerable.

00:04:52.964 --> 00:04:53.880
It's like the real me.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.630
I might be ashy.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.045
My lips might get dry.

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:57.170
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Who cares?

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.320
I'm not checking you out.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.320
I just want to do Pilates
to get my core strong.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.620
Do you know what I mean?

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.366
So it's fine.

00:05:02.366 --> 00:05:03.240
Let's do it together.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.560
JESSICA WILLIAMS: OK,
OK, I think I might.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.890
PHOEBE ROBINSON: OK.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.306
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I'll see you
upstairs, like, after this.

00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:07.912
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:07.912 --> 00:05:10.370
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: But now that
we've covered in "La La Land"

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.730
and how much we hated it--

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.040
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I thought
it was fine, to be honest.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.710
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: I detested it.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.272
OK, so Team Phoebe here
with the hated "La La Land."

00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:20.230
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Cool.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.900
Well, all right.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.490
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: So now that
we've covered that, making sure

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.510
that the landscape wasn't
super white and male,

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.930
let's talk about the impact that
you think this show has had.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.380
What do you think the impact
the show has had in 2016?

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.985
And what would you like
it to be in the next year?

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:37.110
JESSICA WILLIAMS: You know?

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.000
It's funny.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.060
I feel like the best part
about, for me, at least,

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.720
about "2 Dope
Queens" is that now,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.800
when we go out around
Brooklyn, there's always

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.840
really cool women that come up.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.970
And they're like, oh,
dude, I love your podcast.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.400
And it feels like I'm
hanging out with my friends.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.190
And that, to me, is
really important.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.520
And that's a part
of the reason why

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.440
we do the show is because
we like each other.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.430
And we think friendship
is important.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.100
And female friendship is really
at the core of this podcast.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.180
And I really do think and
hope that we encourage

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.170
female friendship in general.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.580
And I also just feel like people
are always tweeting at us,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.090
trying to figure out
who the comedian was

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.185
that we had on our show.

00:06:22.185 --> 00:06:25.800
And it'll be a lesbian
comedian or anybody

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.160
of the LGBT community.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.090
And I feel like they're
also getting a platform.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.500
So I think that's been such
a huge part of everything.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.330
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
And I also think

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.300
we reach people that
we never expected

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.420
would be into the show.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.470
Like, Kevin Bacon was
like, I love this show.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.330
He's like, I subscribe to
it, and I listened to it

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.660
every week.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:46.326
And I was like--

00:06:46.326 --> 00:06:48.090
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
We were like, what?

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:50.465
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Kevin, you
have so many things going on,

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:51.630
and your looking--

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.532
you know what I mean?

00:06:52.532 --> 00:06:54.680
It was crazy because he
was like, I love this show.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.430
He's like, my daughter
listens to it.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.013
And I'm just like,
that's really cool.

00:06:58.013 --> 00:06:59.550
And like, Bono sent us flowers.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.762
I made it 10 minutes.

00:07:00.762 --> 00:07:02.470
I made 10 minutes
without bringing up U2.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.860
You should be proud.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.276
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
It's like, not--

00:07:05.276 --> 00:07:09.510
[INAUDIBLE] though because
we were looking at a U2 fan

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.200
account in the car
on the way here.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.950
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It's
called U2 Blog News.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:16.770
JESSICA WILLIAMS: But it
got, like, 94 followers.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.160
And a lot of the
photos were blurry.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.135
They were out of focus.

00:07:21.135 --> 00:07:23.070
They were formatted oddly.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.910
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
They're working on it.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.990
JESSICA WILLIAMS: They're
getting it together?

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.340
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I gotta
keep up with my U2 news.

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.370
But it was really cool
because Jess and I

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.950
do a lot of philanthropic
stuff with "2 Dope Queens."

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:36.420
And we did something for
Poverty is Sexist Campaign.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.120
To have Bono be like, thank you
for doing that was really cool.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.110
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah,
it was pretty dope.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.070
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah,
so I think the fact

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.050
that we can highlight
people, and also,

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.350
people that we're fans
of can be into our stuff

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.670
and what we're doing
feels kind of crazy.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:51.482
Because sometimes I'm like, I'm
just talking about nonsense.

00:07:51.482 --> 00:07:52.440
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.180
PHOEBE ROBINSON: You know?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.210
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
We are just talking

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.280
about things that we
like and things that

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.570
tickle us and make us laugh.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:00.970
And I know, for me, one of my
favorite parts about the show

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.130
is making you laugh.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.010
And I feel like you've told
me you feel the same way too.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.100
And so it's really exciting
that people respond to that.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.940
It's like, oh, cool.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.067
So we can do more of
what's fun for us,

00:08:11.067 --> 00:08:12.150
and people really like it?

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.762
That rules.

00:08:12.762 --> 00:08:13.470
That's the dream.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:13.790
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yeah.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.290
That's cool.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.170
I was listening to
"Hated It" the other day.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:16.920
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Oh, good.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.050
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: There was
at least two to three seconds

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.680
where the two of
you were laughing,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:21.940
and I found myself laughing.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.350
And it was just really
interesting to be

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:24.780
sitting in the middle
of Google, and I'm just

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:25.600
laughing really loud.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.492
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Oh, way.

00:08:26.492 --> 00:08:27.255
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
But feeling like

00:08:27.255 --> 00:08:29.380
I'm laughing with a group of
girlfriends, really lovely.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:29.940
JESSICA WILLIAMS: That's good.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.710
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Disturbing some
of my coworkers who are here.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.162
That's all right.

00:08:33.162 --> 00:08:34.120
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Sawwy.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.979
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Sorry, not really.

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:35.789
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Sorry, not sorry.

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.080
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: OK, so in
that vein, what do you think

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.138
is the most single bit
of positive feedback

00:08:40.138 --> 00:08:41.429
you've received about the show?

00:08:45.704 --> 00:08:47.120
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
We don't get it.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.050
I'm just kidding.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.950
I'm just kidding.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.194
PHOEBE ROBINSON: No comments.

00:08:50.194 --> 00:08:51.360
No one ever writes anything.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.160
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Everybody hates us.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.240
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Remember, they don't.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.490
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I don't know.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.720
It's always like
when it's just like--

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.560
when we did Sketchfest at Cobbs.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.840
And this, I guess,
was two years ago.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.790
And this black
woman came up to us.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.600
And she was starting
to cry a little bit.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.600
And I was like, whoa,
this is like Bieber level.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.756
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:11.756 --> 00:09:13.772
JESSICA WILLIAMS: That
literally is not Bieber.

00:09:13.772 --> 00:09:14.980
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It's Bieber.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.127
It's Bieber chasing.

00:09:16.127 --> 00:09:18.800
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It's
literally not in his borough.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.430
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It's like,
OK, maybe not Justin Bieber,

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.816
maybe like the least famous
Jonas brother, Kevin.

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:26.274
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, like Kevin.

00:09:26.274 --> 00:09:27.696
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It's
like Kevin Jonas.

00:09:27.696 --> 00:09:29.487
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah,
that's pretty cool.

00:09:29.487 --> 00:09:32.881
I feel comfortable with
being Kevin, K Jonas.

00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:34.880
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And so
she just started to cry.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.159
She said, you guys, your
podcast means so much to me.

00:09:38.159 --> 00:09:40.450
And these are conversations
I have with my girlfriends.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:43.750
And I just felt like I wasn't
represented in the media.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.320
And this show is a way for
me to feel like I'm looking

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.320
at myself in the mirror.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.320
So I was like, that was pretty.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.400
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
That's really cool.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.316
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:09:50.316 --> 00:09:52.540
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
I remember we had

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.140
Gabrielle Union on the show.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.720
And she gave us
really cool feedback.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.150
And like she's a
fan of the show.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:02.540
And she was saying how she loved
listening to it because she

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.851
feels like back in the day,
she couldn't get away with,

00:10:05.851 --> 00:10:07.850
as a black actress, saying
the things that we're

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:08.660
allowed to say.

00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.940
And so it was
really, really cool

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.850
that we are able to
express ourselves freely.

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.050
And we're like, well,
thank you for what you did.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.140
And so having like a legend
say something like that to us,

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.611
I know we just died.

00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:22.860
And then we came back to life.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.370
And so here we are,
though we definitely died.

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:27.170
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: And
so now you're here.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.620
OK, and so all right.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.944
So that's super positive.

00:10:29.944 --> 00:10:31.360
And we can see how
it impacts you,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.040
I think, that the
energy you get, you guys

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.250
obviously give
back to your show.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.520
Right?

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.360
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Mm-hmm, yeah.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.943
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: But
what do you think

00:10:36.943 --> 00:10:40.690
has been the most critical
feedback that you've received?

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.319
And how do you manage that?

00:10:43.319 --> 00:10:44.610
JESSICA WILLIAMS: That's funny.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:49.950
I stopped reading any
sort of reviews of us

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:52.380
a long time ago, like right
after we started the show.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.610
But one of them that I read
was that my laugh was annoying,

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.730
which is fine.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.650
Because it's like,
there's nothing I can do.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.050
But also, they're
like, it's not for me.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.500
I don't the inside
friendship stuff.

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.852
And it's like, oh, well,
that's not for you.

00:11:09.852 --> 00:11:10.920
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It's like,
you don't like "Friends"?

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.570
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Like, that's crazy.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.284
Literally one of the most
successful shows of all time,

00:11:15.284 --> 00:11:16.200
it's called "Friends."

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.523
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: It's
called "Friends."

00:11:17.523 --> 00:11:19.290
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Yeah, and not like,

00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:21.590
Outside Small Talk
with Strangers.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:22.545
It's called "Friends."

00:11:22.545 --> 00:11:23.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.389
JESSICA WILLIAMS: And it's
also like, how long have

00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:26.680
you hated things that are good?

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:27.620
You know what I mean?

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:27.880
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Forever.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.283
Forever.

00:11:28.283 --> 00:11:29.741
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
And how does that

00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:31.610
affect your day-to-day life?

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.200
Like It's like,
we're not for you.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.730
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: They
looked up and decided

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:35.340
they hated friendship.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.066
Friendship is awful.

00:11:36.066 --> 00:11:37.000
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah,
like who hates that?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.920
You know what I mean?

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.670
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah,
that's just stupid.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.440
Also, I used to
be on top of the--

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.140
because we have a fan
page on another website,

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.539
and I don't want to say it
here because I don't know

00:11:48.539 --> 00:11:49.830
if you guys are beefing or not.

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:50.390
Just kidding.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.314
It's Facebook.

00:11:51.314 --> 00:11:52.240
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Oh.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.230
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Is that OK?

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:53.920
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
We're frenemies.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.340
It's OK.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.423
PHOEBE ROBINSON: OK, cool.

00:11:55.423 --> 00:11:57.480
And so I used to
check the messages.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.609
And there was this one guy--

00:11:59.609 --> 00:12:01.150
it's always, like,
a dude, of course.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:03.810
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Always
some freaking Tom or Tad.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:04.726
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:12:04.726 --> 00:12:06.096
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Kevin, Seth.

00:12:06.096 --> 00:12:09.080
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And
he didn't like how much

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.410
we said the word "like."

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:14.410
And so he was telling us
that we should work on it.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.250
And you know, I'm
thinking, literally this

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.840
is just how everyone talks.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.070
Everyone says "like."

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.495
Barack Obama says "like."

00:12:21.495 --> 00:12:22.370
You know what I mean?

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.760
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It's called,
like, being a human being.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.093
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Right, like
Justin Trudeau says "like."

00:12:26.093 --> 00:12:27.680
I've heard it.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.520
That's just a filler word.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.130
Get over it.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:34.500
But it's just stuff like that,
where men want to try and tell

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.710
us how we should speak
differently that would

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.985
be more pleasing to them.

00:12:38.985 --> 00:12:39.860
And it's just there--

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.830
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
This ain't for you.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:41.130
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Right.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.340
JESSICA WILLIAMS: This
shit isn't for you.

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.298
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Right.

00:12:43.298 --> 00:12:46.170
And it's how society trains
people to think of the way

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.150
that women naturally speak
is somehow incorrect,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.674
and the way that men
speak is somehow the ideal

00:12:51.674 --> 00:12:53.090
and what people
should strive for.

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:54.170
And I'm just, no.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:54.650
JESSICA WILLIAMS: No.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:55.149
Hell no.

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:56.320
We ain't got time for that.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:56.480
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.200
Speak how you want to speak.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.020
And so that was kind
of really irritating.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.960
And then I think
sometimes people will

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.999
say, you and Jace-- uh, Jace.

00:13:05.999 --> 00:13:07.290
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It's Jessica.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.010
My name's Jessica.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:08.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.585
PHOEBE ROBINSON: All right.

00:13:09.585 --> 00:13:10.417
I thought--

00:13:10.417 --> 00:13:12.000
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Can
we call you Jace?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.830
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Can
we call you Jace?

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.038
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I guess so.

00:13:14.038 --> 00:13:16.020
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I
was going to say race.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:16.977
And then I said Jace.

00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:18.310
JESSICA WILLIAMS: You went Jace.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.050
It's funny that, like,
you're one of my best friends

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.290
and you just called me Jace.

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.801
So I'm gonna remember
that forever.

00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:24.300
Keep going.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.129
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:26.129 --> 00:13:28.170
PHOEBE ROBINSON: This
person said that Jess and I

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.480
talk too much about race.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.810
And it was just kind
of like, one, we don't.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:33.440
And also--

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.804
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We do though.

00:13:34.804 --> 00:13:35.303
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:35.303 --> 00:13:36.225
We do.

00:13:36.225 --> 00:13:37.225
It's like, our identity.

00:13:37.225 --> 00:13:38.683
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
It's not too much.

00:13:38.683 --> 00:13:40.290
It's the proper
amount because we all

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.550
talk about race in a
real way in this country

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.850
in the first place, which is why
we have the president we have.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.042
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:13:47.042 --> 00:13:48.000
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Sorry.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.605
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Now I'm getting--

00:13:49.605 --> 00:13:50.980
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Let that simmer.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:53.130
"Which is why we have
the president we have."

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:54.046
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:13:54.046 --> 00:13:56.380
But I think us talking
about racist cab

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.512
drivers or bad
customer service, these

00:13:58.512 --> 00:13:59.970
are all things that
people of color

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.450
go through in the country.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.000
These are all things
that every day,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.780
we face these
microaggressions that--

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.915
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
You have to stomach.

00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:11.700
Like oftentimes, I know for
us, we grew up in the suburbs.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.680
It's like you're
around white people who

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.032
oftentimes don't understand
what microaggressions are.

00:14:17.032 --> 00:14:18.240
You have to hold your tongue.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.680
It's like you have to
really keep it composed.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.210
And then when you find somebody
who is a person of color,

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:27.090
or a member of the LGBT
community, who understands

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.730
that, it's the best connection.

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:31.800
It's like the most
life-affirming thing ever.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.220
It's like when women get
catcalled, most of the time,

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.999
that's a very personal
experience that you just log

00:14:38.999 --> 00:14:40.290
and then you go about your day.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:42.510
But if you explain
that to another woman,

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:44.430
it feels so good.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:45.900
And it feels really
life-affirming.

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.520
And that to me--

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.770
Also, this is a show
about friendships

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:50.850
with people of color.

00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:53.370
And that's how we
talk to each other.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.710
So it really is--

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:58.080
that means that you don't
have enough friends that

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.030
are minorities, I
think, if you feel

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:03.330
like we talk about race
too much because every day,

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:07.470
we are reminded of our race,
and we are constantly confronted

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.020
with that in our day-to-day.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:12.150
And I just feel like it's
the most natural thing

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.280
to talk about
things that make you

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.940
laugh or sad or angry or
happy with how you look

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.042
and your race.

00:15:19.042 --> 00:15:21.000
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: And
Phoebe, you alluded to it.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.790
But I just want to
make sure that we talk

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.066
about it a little bit more.

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:26.940
You did have an episode
where you guys talked

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.600
about an experience in a
cab with a racist cabdriver.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.400
And in terms of the validation
of not just talking as friends,

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.890
but it's also really
valuable that you

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.660
talked about your
thought process

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.160
as you went through
that experience.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.660
Like, was that racist?

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.470
Was that not racist?

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.390
Do I react now?

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.860
Do I not react now?

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.130
Do I allow my partner, who's
a white male, to react?

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:52.920
How do I process this feeling?

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.200
Do you find that a
lot of your viewers

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.250
respond to that as well?

00:15:56.250 --> 00:16:00.930
Not just how you react together,
but the verbal storytelling

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:04.170
that goes with how
you experience racism

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.260
as black women.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.180
Yeah.

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.410
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Yeah, I mean, I think

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.430
we both have racist
cabdrivers in the same week.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.430
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We all
have racist cabdrivers.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:15.042
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It'd be synced
up like it was our period.

00:16:15.042 --> 00:16:16.024
It's not--

00:16:16.024 --> 00:16:17.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.714
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yes.

00:16:18.714 --> 00:16:19.820
Yes.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.809
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And so
it was just very funny

00:16:22.809 --> 00:16:24.850
how we both-- we were
like, OK, so this happened.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.516
She was like, wait,
this happened to me.

00:16:26.516 --> 00:16:28.380
And so those are
conversations that

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:30.630
happen all the time every day.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.760
And I think part of
it is that people

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.870
think that racism happens
one time to you, one time

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.350
in your life, and that's it.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:41.530
And it's like, no, it happens
every week, or every month,

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:42.760
every year.

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.810
And so I think when we both have
these different experiences,

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.810
like how Jess's
cabdriver only stopped

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.010
once he saw her boyfriend--

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:50.490
JESSICA WILLIAMS: That's right.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.470
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Or how
the guy said the N word

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.678
because he was like, well,
my daughter is half black,

00:16:54.678 --> 00:16:55.530
so I can say it.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:56.750
And it was just these weird--

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:57.750
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Weird.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.624
PHOEBE ROBINSON: --weird
kind of like-- we're

00:16:59.624 --> 00:17:01.440
supposed to live in a
post-racial society,

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.570
but things like this
are still happening.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:08.339
So I think it just kind of made
the black women, hopefully,

00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:10.172
who listened to the
episode be like, yeah, I

00:17:10.172 --> 00:17:13.060
have my own really
shitty cab experience.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.250
And maybe I didn't tell anybody.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.010
And the fact that
we said something,

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:18.099
maybe they're like,
well, next time

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:19.319
I am going to say something.

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.300
And I'm going to let people
know that this is terrible.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.800
Like, when I was
in that situation,

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.690
I didn't say anything
to the guy because I

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.349
was like, this is weird.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:27.569
This is crazy.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:28.800
He knows where I live.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.430
I don't want to anger
anyone who's driving me.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.450
But it is in those situations
where you hopefully

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.750
learn that you can stand
up for yourself more.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:43.110
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah, and I
think this show has given me

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.140
a lot of things.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.806
But one of the things
that it's given me

00:17:45.806 --> 00:17:48.660
is strength to speak up a lot.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.950
I feel like there's this
idea of the black woman as

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.540
angry or confrontational.

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:59.190
But oftentimes, I find
that I shrink into myself,

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.310
and I get really quiet
when something is like--

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.790
there's a microaggression, or if
there's something racist that's

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.600
happened.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.200
But I feel like the
more that I do our show,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.610
and the more that
we get feedback

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.526
from other black women--
because really, we're

00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:17.040
just two black women in a
world full of black women.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.750
You know?

00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:21.210
I'm like, oh, I
should speak up more.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:24.490
It kind of gives me the
courage to speak out, I think.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:25.610
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Right.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:26.670
And you did it so differently.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:27.169
Right?

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:29.430
So in that episode,
at one point,

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.860
when you got into the cab
and he had hailed the cab,

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.160
you said, ha, ha!

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.115
I like this moment.

00:18:34.115 --> 00:18:34.615
Right?

00:18:34.615 --> 00:18:35.100
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Surprise.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.068
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Like oh, I got you!

00:18:37.068 --> 00:18:37.962
Got you.

00:18:37.962 --> 00:18:39.086
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Surprise.

00:18:39.086 --> 00:18:40.780
That's my white boyfriend.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.224
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:18:42.224 --> 00:18:43.890
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: And
then you responded.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.306
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Customer service.

00:18:45.306 --> 00:18:46.510
I emailed.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:48.824
And I said, hi, I'm black.

00:18:48.824 --> 00:18:51.450
That's a great subject line.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:53.280
Really gets people
on high alert.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.486
They're like, oh, shit.

00:18:54.486 --> 00:18:55.800
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
When you see yourself

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.841
looking at your computer.

00:18:56.841 --> 00:18:58.380
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
And I got a refund.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:00.120
And they're like, we're
going to reprimand this guy.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.230
And I was like, great.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:02.685
So it was awesome.

00:19:02.685 --> 00:19:04.140
JESSICA WILLIAMS: That's great.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:06.699
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: So
thank you for that.

00:19:06.699 --> 00:19:09.240
Thank you for going down that
path because definitely for me,

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.781
that was one of my
favorite episodes.

00:19:10.781 --> 00:19:13.470
If you haven't seen it, you
need to go start listening

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:15.580
to the entire podcast,
but start with that one.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.432
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Thank you.

00:19:16.432 --> 00:19:17.848
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
That was awesome.

00:19:17.848 --> 00:19:20.767
What advice would you give
other black women or just

00:19:20.767 --> 00:19:22.350
intersectional women--
because I think

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.840
we've talked a lot
about intersectionality

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.631
and about allyship.

00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:27.270
But trying to get
into this industry,

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.270
trying to start a podcast,
trying to really make their

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.962
voices known.

00:19:32.962 --> 00:19:34.670
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Do
you want to go first?

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.650
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah,
well, first of all,

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:38.000
please start a podcast.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.980
Because the amount
of feedback we've

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.720
gotten from "2 Dope
Queens" is great.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.680
But there are so many
black female voices

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.940
that need to be heard.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:49.220
And I think the response
that we've gotten

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.000
is just evidence that oh,
there needs to be more

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.490
black female stories out there.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:00.150
But also, if you're doing
it with another person,

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:04.230
find someone that excites you
and that you can geek out with

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.760
and that you enjoy.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.150
And also, if you're doing
it with another person,

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:10.740
realize that it's
kind of a marriage,

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.100
and it's a relationship.

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.650
And it's a team.

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.050
And you have to
sort of figure out

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.570
how to work together
and do give and take

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.750
and communicate and
figure that out.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.720
And also, be the most
yourself that you possibly can

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.790
is the biggest one, because
it's super valuable.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:33.480
And it keeps it from
being just another podcast

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.470
about white dudes, whiten it up.

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:41.520
Just be yourself because
that is the most interesting

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.330
fascinating thing.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.430
And if you're speaking
from a point of truth,

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.321
then it will
resonate with people.

00:20:46.321 --> 00:20:46.820
Really.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.130
It's impossible for
it to not resonate.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:51.750
That would be my advice.

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.920
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.040
I think if you think
you have a story

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.740
to tell that's worth hearing,
you're probably right.

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.360
So you should just go for it.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.750
And it doesn't matter if
there's not an example there,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.190
a blueprint for you to follow.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.400
You can be the first one.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.540
And you can figure things
out yourself and what works

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:10.300
and what doesn't.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.480
So don't be afraid
to take a leap.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.990
And WNYC is getting really more
involved with other things.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.200
So we're both wearing pins for
their latest podcast that's

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.180
coming out called
"Nancy" on April 9th.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.340
And it's an LGBTQ+ podcast.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.440
It's going to be a lot
of storytelling, also

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.430
investigative stuff.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:30.510
And they just decided, hey,
we want our voices out there.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.400
And these are stories
that should be told.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.770
And now it's a podcast of WNYC.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:39.480
So I think if you just really
believe in your idea 1,000%.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.540
And maybe you can't
start at WNYC.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.150
Maybe you have to
start in your apartment

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:46.770
and do a podcast I did that.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.140
I was doing a podcast in
my apartment in Brooklyn,

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.410
in a shitty one
bedroom apartment.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.580
And she was there.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.107
She saw it.

00:21:54.107 --> 00:21:56.190
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Well, I
allegedly did a podcast,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.900
an episode of this
when we first met.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:00.022
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I
accidentally deleted it.

00:22:00.022 --> 00:22:01.730
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Try
and get a producer.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.840
You guys work at Google.

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.267
That would never happen.

00:22:04.267 --> 00:22:05.850
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Maybe get a producer,

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:08.840
because I did not know how
to work SoundCloud properly.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.277
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It was
three hours of my time

00:22:11.277 --> 00:22:12.318
that I'll never get back.

00:22:12.318 --> 00:22:14.640
But she completely deleted it.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.640
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Which
I've paid back in spades.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.570
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We sat
at her kitchen table.

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.028
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
It's Google Talks.

00:22:20.028 --> 00:22:21.200
Like, it was worth it.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.005
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I don't know.

00:22:23.005 --> 00:22:25.131
They're not going to
delete this footage.

00:22:25.131 --> 00:22:27.064
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:27.064 --> 00:22:29.480
PHOEBE ROBINSON: But yeah,
just start out wherever you can

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.532
and hone your voice
and hone your vision.

00:22:31.532 --> 00:22:33.990
Because that thing that's going
to set you apart the most--

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.866
you think it's oh, I
have to sound like this.

00:22:35.866 --> 00:22:37.448
I have to do what's
already been done.

00:22:37.448 --> 00:22:39.570
The thing that's going
to set you apart the most

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.520
is if you stay
true to your voice.

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:44.539
Because ultimately, people
want that new thing.

00:22:44.539 --> 00:22:46.830
And a lot of times, people
are scared to take that risk

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:47.460
on a new thing.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.293
But if you can just
establish your own stuff

00:22:49.293 --> 00:22:52.554
and your own following, and
just believe in your own vision.

00:22:52.554 --> 00:22:53.970
And be a business
person about it.

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:54.660
That's the other thing.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.900
It's not just creativity.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.890
You have to be a businessperson
about whatever endeavor

00:22:58.890 --> 00:22:59.870
you go into.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.060
You're going to be fine.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.430
And it's not going
to happen overnight.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.990
It's going to take a while.

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.420
But keep the faith.

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:09.020
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Be yourself.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.707
Don't be afraid to start.

00:23:10.707 --> 00:23:12.790
Be all the way, all the
way, all the way yourself.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:14.760
Don't try to moderate
or change your voice.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.710
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's
the hardest thing to do.

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:21.046
I think it's life's
journey, hashtag #SelfHelp.

00:23:21.046 --> 00:23:22.420
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
It's a marriage.

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.220
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Oprah's
like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.136
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Yeah.

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:26.710
So you two are best friends
in real life, really,

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:27.940
really, best friends.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.650
What's it like?

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.191
I'm going to ask
you a few questions.

00:23:30.191 --> 00:23:32.697
A, we talked a lot about
what are the feelings

00:23:32.697 --> 00:23:34.280
and motivations that
you have to have,

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.772
really being true to yourself.

00:23:35.772 --> 00:23:36.980
How did you guys get started?

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.820
How did you decide?

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.290
You were hanging
out, having pizza.

00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:42.570
How did you look
over to your girl

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:44.970
and say, we should
start a comedy show?

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.950
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Well, we
met when I did background

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.010
on a "Daily Show" piece
she did about black hair

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:50.790
in the military.

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.248
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
And I had already

00:23:52.248 --> 00:23:54.240
known who she was
because she was

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.720
in Upright Citizens
Brigade, as was I.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.040
And she had a [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.970
She was really funny.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.860
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And so we met.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.590
That was July 2014.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:09.540
And I was like, hey, do you
want to come do my podcast?

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.639
And I was like,
this is not jank.

00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:12.680
Like, I interview a lot--

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.810
JESSICA WILLIAMS: She was
like, it's super legit.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:17.220
Deleted my shit.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:18.440
She deleted my shit.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.010
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I was like,
I interview whites and act

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.210
like this is, like, legit.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.626
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Getting deleted.

00:24:22.626 --> 00:24:24.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.574
I was like so hateful to
you after you deleted it.

00:24:27.574 --> 00:24:28.990
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Well, I was like,

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.330
let me do a new, different
recording process this time.

00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.455
I shouldn't have done that.

00:24:33.455 --> 00:24:33.760
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
You shouldn't have

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.770
switched the style up on me.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:35.770
You know what I mean?

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:37.850
That's like
black-on-black crime.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:40.049
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:40.049 --> 00:24:41.673
PHOEBE ROBINSON: But
you have to learn.

00:24:41.673 --> 00:24:42.710
I'm an experimentor.

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.020
I'm like Benjamin Franklin.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.603
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
You're literally not

00:24:45.603 --> 00:24:47.000
like Benjamin Franklin.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.324
That is so disrespectful.

00:24:48.324 --> 00:24:50.052
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:50.052 --> 00:24:54.320
You deleted a podcast, and
you're Benjamin Franklin.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:54.947
Yes.

00:24:54.947 --> 00:24:56.780
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I'm,
you know, in training.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.280
Anyway.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.910
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Geez Louise.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:00.920
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And
so we just hit it off

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.470
when we were taping the podcast.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.287
And she said her
birthday was coming up.

00:25:04.287 --> 00:25:05.870
And I asked her what
she wanted to do.

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.240
She said, I always
wanted to do stand-up.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.480
And I said, well, I can
do a monthly stand-up show

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.127
at UCB East.

00:25:12.127 --> 00:25:13.960
Do you want to co-host
it with me as a goof?

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.720
It'll be fun.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.770
We'll just hang out.

00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:19.140
And then, like, it will be a
nice treat for the audience.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.890
And then we ended up
having so much fun doing

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.100
that we were like, all right,
let's do another show together.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.223
And then we were like,
let's just keep doing this.

00:25:27.223 --> 00:25:31.520
And then we moved to Union
Hall because we were like,

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.921
we want to get paid, and UCB
doesn't pay, which is fine.

00:25:34.921 --> 00:25:35.420
I mean.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:35.650
It's--

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.780
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
It's like just do you.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.280
Do whatever.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.482
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:25:38.482 --> 00:25:40.065
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I'm
a businessperson.

00:25:40.065 --> 00:25:42.688
That's the most
Jay-Z thing about me.

00:25:42.688 --> 00:25:44.062
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:46.352 --> 00:25:48.320
I'm reaching real high
with these legends.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:48.790
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I know.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:49.712
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Comparing myself.

00:25:49.712 --> 00:25:51.712
JESSICA WILLIAMS: You're
literally like reaching

00:25:51.712 --> 00:25:53.150
and pulling, like, a lot.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.440
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Like,
I'm ruining his life.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.398
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:25:55.398 --> 00:25:56.132
And legacy.

00:25:56.132 --> 00:25:56.632
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:56.632 --> 00:25:58.080
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.240
And we had a really
amazing show at Union Hall.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:04.160
We were both like, this
could be a podcast.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.839
And I was like, well, what if
we just record it ourselves?

00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:08.880
And she was like, we should
make it professional.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.338
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
You deleted our--

00:26:10.338 --> 00:26:11.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.240
The track record is you
deleted our podcast.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.740
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
And she was like, I

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.720
know some people at WNYC.

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.770
Let's figure out a game plan,
pitch it and everything.

00:26:21.770 --> 00:26:23.650
And the rest is just herstory.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:24.150
Hi.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.040
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Hey.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.290
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: That's great.

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:31.550
So OK, what has been
your favorite episode

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.360
and your favorite guest and why?

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.996
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:38.388 --> 00:26:41.280
Are you going to say-- are
you going to say Jon Hamm?

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.244
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:42.244 --> 00:26:44.654
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yes.

00:26:44.654 --> 00:26:46.582
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Well,
I was just thinking.

00:26:46.582 --> 00:26:47.798
I'm trying to think.

00:26:47.798 --> 00:26:49.300
We had Carrie Brownstein on.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.325
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
That I was cool.

00:26:50.325 --> 00:26:52.200
JESSICA WILLIAMS: And
I am obsessed with her.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.350
And so that was kind
of a dream come true.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.320
I had seen her in high
school a couple times

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.310
doing shows and stuff.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:01.460
And we're such fans
of "Portlandia."

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:04.130
She was amazing and super fun.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.060
And I think we
crowdsurfed with her too.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:07.370
PHOEBE ROBINSON: No, we didn't.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.023
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Oh, yeah, we did.

00:27:09.023 --> 00:27:10.022
PHOEBE ROBINSON: We did!

00:27:10.022 --> 00:27:10.910
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We did.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:11.950
And it was, like, iconic.

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:13.450
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
It was really cool.

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.660
Did we get video of that?

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.300
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, I hope so.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.255
I hope we did.

00:27:17.255 --> 00:27:18.088
PHOEBE ROBINSON: OK.

00:27:18.088 --> 00:27:18.964
Thanks.

00:27:18.964 --> 00:27:19.840
Thanks, Joanna.

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.110
JESSICA WILLIAMS: And then that
same night, Phoebe personally

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.760
crowdsurfed with Jon Hamm.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.750
And I got video of that.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:27.110
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
That was really cool.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.830
JESSICA WILLIAMS: And that
was really fun because--

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.300
PHOEBE ROBINSON: We held hands.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.010
It was like literally
after our wedding,

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.740
we just crowdsurfed
out of our wedding.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.000
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Like,
everybody was like--

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.690
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Yeah, like mazel!

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:38.317
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, like literally.

00:27:38.317 --> 00:27:39.980
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And we were
like, none of us are Jewish.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.155
But thank you.

00:27:41.155 --> 00:27:42.980
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, that was amazing.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:44.950
And then I realized
too that episode

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:47.584
was very overwhelming because--

00:27:47.584 --> 00:27:49.000
I haven't been
single for a while.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.610
But I realized when we
were doing the Jon Hamm

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:56.820
episode that I was,
like, very overwhelmed.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.520
And so I couldn't say
things that were real.

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:01.240
And I couldn't say words.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.900
I couldn't put things
together coherently.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.660
And I realized
that about myself.

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:10.790
I was, like, reverting back
into the third grade me.

00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:12.040
Those were really fun times.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.280
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
No, you were great.

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.030
JESSICA WILLIAMS: You
think I was great?

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:13.420
OK.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.230
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Yeah, you were great.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:15.689
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Cool, because I

00:28:15.689 --> 00:28:17.480
feel like I spit a lot
during that episode.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.938
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
No, you were fine.

00:28:18.938 --> 00:28:21.160
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I was,
like, shvitzing everywhere.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.535
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Well, part of it

00:28:22.535 --> 00:28:25.270
is because he is, hands down,
the most attractive person we

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.410
ever had on the show.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.357
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Right, no
tea, no shade to everybody

00:28:29.357 --> 00:28:30.190
who's done the show.

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:32.749
But y'all know what happened.

00:28:32.749 --> 00:28:34.290
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
It's the Hammaconda.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:35.745
And so we were--

00:28:35.745 --> 00:28:37.421
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:37.421 --> 00:28:39.462
JESSICA WILLIAMS: This is
like no a casual phrase

00:28:39.462 --> 00:28:40.902
that you can slip in like that.

00:28:40.902 --> 00:28:41.902
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: No, no.

00:28:41.902 --> 00:28:43.225
PHOEBE ROBINSON: You
can't slip in Hammaconda?

00:28:43.225 --> 00:28:44.110
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: No, you can't

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.250
JESSICA WILLIAMS: You were
just like, Hammaconda.

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:46.090
Like, that's crazy.

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.074
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: You did it.

00:28:47.074 --> 00:28:47.566
You did it.

00:28:47.566 --> 00:28:49.330
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Like, you
workshopped that in your brain.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:50.115
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Yeah, I was like,

00:28:50.115 --> 00:28:52.150
I'm going to put
that in a Hammaconda.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:52.675
JESSICA WILLIAMS: That's insane.

00:28:52.675 --> 00:28:53.270
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Hammaconda, baby.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.228
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: I going
to look that up later.

00:28:55.228 --> 00:28:56.260
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.560
But the thing that I loved--

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.120
when we did the LA
show, we told Chenoae,

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:05.800
who's one of our producers
on our podcast-- we're like,

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.390
our dream guests are
RuPaul and Jon Hamm.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.220
And we're still
holding out for Ru.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:10.900
So Ru, please.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.106
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Ru!

00:29:12.106 --> 00:29:13.070
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Ru!

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.570
Please!

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:14.445
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Ru!

00:29:14.445 --> 00:29:15.220
Please, please.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.594
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Please come, Ru.

00:29:16.594 --> 00:29:21.880
And so Chenoae reached out to
Jon because he was supposed

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.280
to do something else
and then he couldn't.

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.110
And he told Chenoae,--
but I really

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.030
want to do "2 Dope Queens."
and we were both like, wait,

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.255
he listens to "2 Dope Queens"?

00:29:29.255 --> 00:29:29.550
What?

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.350
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Like, we died.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.870
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It was crazy.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:32.590
It was like, this is "Mad Men."

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:33.740
But like, no disrespectful.

00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.406
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
This is not "Mad Men."

00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:36.670
Two women.

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:39.209
There is, like, more than
one woman of color on there.

00:29:39.209 --> 00:29:41.375
PHOEBE ROBINSON: We have
our rights and, like, jobs.

00:29:41.375 --> 00:29:42.586
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We can vote.

00:29:42.586 --> 00:29:43.502
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:29:43.502 --> 00:29:44.976
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.059
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We did vote.

00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:48.850
Oh, yeah, we voted.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:49.660
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: We voted.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.980
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Oh, we voted.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:53.986
It's not-- because
now I'm getting--

00:29:53.986 --> 00:29:54.977
we voted.

00:29:54.977 --> 00:29:56.060
PHOEBE ROBINSON: We voted.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.101
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We did.

00:29:57.101 --> 00:30:01.480
We did our shit so nobody
can tell me nothing.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.850
Really.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:05.399
94% of black women.

00:30:05.399 --> 00:30:06.274
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: 94%.

00:30:06.274 --> 00:30:07.271
We voted.

00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:07.771
OK.

00:30:07.771 --> 00:30:09.960
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And
so he just showed up.

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.802
And was so nice.

00:30:10.802 --> 00:30:12.010
He was like, I love the show.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.510
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
And we were like--

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.591
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:14.655 --> 00:30:16.488
PHOEBE ROBINSON: But
he was literally, like,

00:30:16.488 --> 00:30:17.890
the most chill.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.307
It was like the
most chill person.

00:30:19.307 --> 00:30:21.306
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah,
he was, like, very fine.

00:30:21.306 --> 00:30:22.630
But we didn't do any of that.

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:24.592
PHOEBE ROBINSON: We were just
like what are you going--

00:30:24.592 --> 00:30:26.005
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: What was
that about catcalling?

00:30:26.005 --> 00:30:26.480
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Literally.

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:26.745
Literally.

00:30:26.745 --> 00:30:27.920
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah,
and we were like,

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.550
what do you want to do?

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:29.940
He's like, I'll
follow your lead.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.750
It's totally fine.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:32.170
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I was
like, wow, that's hot.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:33.021
Even that was hot.

00:30:33.021 --> 00:30:33.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.377
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I was like,
this is like really sexually

00:30:36.377 --> 00:30:36.877
intense.

00:30:36.877 --> 00:30:38.370
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, he's like,

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:39.495
just explain the bit to me.

00:30:39.495 --> 00:30:40.453
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Right.

00:30:40.453 --> 00:30:42.140
And so basically,
we were just like,

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.204
we're just going to
hit you for 20 minutes.

00:30:44.204 --> 00:30:45.120
And he was like, cool.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.078
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Cool.

00:30:46.078 --> 00:30:46.775
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:46.775 --> 00:30:48.900
And we were like, thank
you for being a good sport.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.990
But he's, like, woke and--

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.780
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Yeah, he's woke.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.026
He said some great things.

00:30:52.026 --> 00:30:53.276
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It was nuts.

00:30:53.276 --> 00:30:56.104
And we did a little
bit we do sometimes.

00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:57.770
If we have a celebrity
guest that nobody

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:00.547
knows is coming out, we'll
be like, can we get some wa--

00:31:00.547 --> 00:31:01.130
we're thirsty.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:01.720
It'll just be us.

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.490
And we'll be like,
we're thirsty.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:03.420
Can we get some water?

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.840
And then a celebrity--

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.390
PHOEBE ROBINSON: We don't
do it like that though.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:06.515
JESSICA WILLIAMS: But I do.

00:31:06.515 --> 00:31:10.440
And the celebrity comes
out and brings us water.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.740
But it was crazy
because with him, he's

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.190
such an amazing actor that he,
like, took an extra second.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:19.080
And we genuinely didn't know
if he was coming out or not.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.570
So we, like, literally
acted with Jon Hamm.

00:31:21.570 --> 00:31:23.405
Like, we basically won an Emmy.

00:31:23.405 --> 00:31:26.480
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I did, like,
a stage cough, like water.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.442
[COUGHS]

00:31:27.442 --> 00:31:28.277
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:28.277 --> 00:31:29.902
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
And I was like, what?

00:31:29.902 --> 00:31:31.624
What an actor's
choice, like, literally

00:31:31.624 --> 00:31:33.550
Viola Davis over here.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.550
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It was
like "Fences" basically.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:36.984
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It
was literally "Fences."

00:31:36.984 --> 00:31:37.940
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Just kidding.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.860
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It was
her "Fences" performance.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.810
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: We've covered
all the Academy Awards.

00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:42.726
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:31:42.726 --> 00:31:43.762
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: OK.

00:31:43.762 --> 00:31:44.720
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
But he came out.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.200
It was amazing.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.130
We, like, acted with him.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.588
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Yeah, it was cool.

00:31:47.588 --> 00:31:49.460
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: The
best show, best guest.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.501
We're holding out RuPaul.

00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:52.670
Ru, look in the camera.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:55.425
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
RuPaul, RuPaul Charles.

00:31:55.425 --> 00:31:59.210
I'm watching Season
9 this Friday.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:00.579
Please, just do our show.

00:32:00.579 --> 00:32:01.120
It'll be fun.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.440
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
We would love you.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.540
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: OK,
so last question,

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.400
and we're going to
try to be serious,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.900
but I know that we can't.

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:14.910
OK, so how do you balance your
need to bring joy, levity,

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.360
bring your voice, highlight the
voices of other great comedians

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:23.780
and other great actors with some
of the very real traumatizing--

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.850
I can't even find
another word for it--

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:30.630
political change and environment
that we find ourselves in?

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:35.145
I was literally studying
your post-election episode,

00:32:35.145 --> 00:32:36.770
trying to get through
the feels, trying

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.210
to work through the feels.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.430
How did you plan that show?

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:41.990
How do you process this now?

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.480
How do you bifurcate
what's happening

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.090
with the social-political
landscape

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.909
and the goals of
"2 Dope Queens"?

00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:50.950
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Well, I
think that episode was--

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.889
Joanna, I think that
was your idea, right?

00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:55.180
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah, it was.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:57.294
PHOEBE ROBINSON: To
do the post-election.

00:32:57.294 --> 00:32:58.710
Were you not paying
any attention?

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.210
Cool.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.775
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:00.775 --> 00:33:02.483
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Joanna, Joanna, Joanna.

00:33:02.483 --> 00:33:04.649
PHOEBE ROBINSON: We're
literally at our Google Talk.

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:06.041
JOANNA: It was Rachel.

00:33:06.041 --> 00:33:07.502
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Oh, it was Rachel.

00:33:07.502 --> 00:33:09.050
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Oh, sorry, Rachel.

00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:11.060
you were nice about it.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.710
Sorry we dragged you.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:14.626
You, like, don't
deserve any of that.

00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:14.982
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:33:14.982 --> 00:33:16.040
But, like, pay attention.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:16.915
It's our Google Talk.

00:33:16.915 --> 00:33:19.260
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
But also, she edits

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:20.610
every one of our episodes.

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:21.484
Sorry we dragged you.

00:33:21.484 --> 00:33:24.550
PHOEBE ROBINSON: We love
you, Joanna, like you are.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:28.490
So yeah, I think we were all
just feeling, like, a little--

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:31.490
because I think we all kind
of assumed that America would

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:34.110
be like, OK, the joke is over.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.964
We're going to not
elect Donald Trump.

00:33:37.964 --> 00:33:39.380
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
We had to record

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.210
two versions of that episode.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.040
And the first one
was if Hillary won.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.660
And then, we were
like, yeah, great.

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:46.580
And then they were like, well,
why don't we just in case

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.205
do the other one,
where she didn't win?

00:33:48.205 --> 00:33:50.412
And we were like, what the
fuck you talkin' about?

00:33:50.412 --> 00:33:52.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.200
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And
then, yeah, it happened.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.970
And I don't even want to say it.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.970
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It's
like literally Voldemort.

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.201
If you read a Harry
Potter book, you

00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:01.425
know what I'm talking about.

00:34:01.425 --> 00:34:01.870
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Yeah, it happened.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:03.170
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It happened.

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:07.940
And I think everyone,
a lot of people,

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.159
were in a state of shock.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:12.500
And so I think we all just
agreed with Rachel that it

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.230
would be good to have an episode
where we just addressed it

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.519
openly and honestly and be
like, hey, let's just talk

00:34:18.519 --> 00:34:20.060
through what we're
feeling right now,

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.320
just get these emotions out.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:23.195
Because I know-- like,
I was crying for days.

00:34:23.195 --> 00:34:24.361
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Days, yeah.

00:34:24.361 --> 00:34:26.179
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I
think everyone was.

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:28.880
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Just
the idea that somebody

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.280
who is supposed to
represent you completely

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.870
doesn't have your
interests at heart--

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:35.579
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: No, has really
your destruction at heart.

00:34:35.579 --> 00:34:36.620
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Really.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:40.159
And it's really, really
deeply upsetting.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:42.710
Like honestly, like, I
go to therapy every week.

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:45.181
And my therapist has been
like, yeah, all everybody

00:34:45.181 --> 00:34:47.639
wants to talk about is the fact
that we have this president

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.704
and how it bothers them.

00:34:50.704 --> 00:34:51.540
Yes, but continue.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.248
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah,
no, that was good.

00:34:53.248 --> 00:34:55.750
And so I think when we just
sat down, it wasn't like Jess

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.650
and I had anything prepared.

00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:00.680
We really just spoke from
the heart about how we felt.

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.180
We said some ignorant
things I think

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.347
they cut out of the podcast.

00:35:03.347 --> 00:35:05.555
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I want to
hear the ignorant things.

00:35:05.555 --> 00:35:06.192
Who did that?

00:35:06.192 --> 00:35:07.136
Joanna?

00:35:07.136 --> 00:35:08.457
Was that you?

00:35:08.457 --> 00:35:11.040
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Well, you know
we can just go off and just

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:11.540
speak.

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.380
All right, this is--

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.290
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We
can really pop off.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:14.440
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.190
JESSICA WILLIAMS: These
are for our texts.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.420
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Right.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.590
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
These should be tests.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:20.270
PHOEBE ROBINSON: But yeah,
no, it felt really kind of--

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.200
I don't know.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.510
I think it felt, like,
cathartic for us.

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:25.820
And I think for a
lot of listeners,

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:28.280
we say a lot of things
they were thinking.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.760
So it just felt really good.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.667
And I think going
forward with the show,

00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:34.250
we just want to keep doing the
same thing with our show, which

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.610
is just highlight
different voices,

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:42.350
promote comedy that's about
punching up, not punching down,

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:45.830
and just keep
telling our stories.

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:48.269
And I think if
everyone just keeps

00:35:48.269 --> 00:35:50.060
putting their stories
out there and putting

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:51.590
their lives out
there, we're going

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:53.060
to drown out the nonsense.

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:53.830
We're going to drown
out the haters.

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:55.060
We're going to drown
out the ugliness.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:56.100
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.220
And it's nice,
too, because I feel

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.570
like one of the
reasons comedy is

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:05.010
great is because it transcends
differences in a way.

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:07.920
And I feel like if people
can listen to our podcast

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.400
and feel a little bit of comfort
for 45 minutes to an hour,

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.550
then we've done our job,
just taking a second

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.190
and just really being like,
oh, it's going to be OK.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:19.310
Oh, there's still
great comedy out there.

00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:22.410
Oh, OK, this is a transgender
person doing stand-up.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:23.010
Oh, cool.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:26.910
If we can continue to
up with those voices,

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:31.140
then we're going to be
OK the next four years.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.330
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:33.550
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Well, on that note,

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:36.175
thank you for the encouragement
because I think we all need it.

00:36:36.175 --> 00:36:38.040
I think everyone
watching needs it.

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:40.119
I know that I can feel
the energy in the room.

00:36:40.119 --> 00:36:42.660
For those of you watching, the
energy in the room is amazing.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.950
I just want to make
sure that we actually

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.000
open up the floor to the room.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.810
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Oh, yeah.

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:47.510
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: I want to
thank you ladies for coming.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:48.470
It's been amazing.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:49.608
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Thank
you for having us.

00:36:49.608 --> 00:36:51.149
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: A
round of applause.

00:36:51.149 --> 00:36:52.053
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:56.454
Yeah, that's OK.

00:36:56.454 --> 00:36:58.751
We'll keep clapping.

00:36:58.751 --> 00:37:00.500
Are you ready for
round-of-fire questions?

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.190
There are two mics.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.510
There's one here and one there.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.570
We're going to
start on the right.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:04.778
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Oh, my gosh.

00:37:04.778 --> 00:37:06.720
Everyone's wearing white so far.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.950
JESSICA WILLIAMS: If
you're not wearing white,

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:08.650
don't come to the mic.

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:09.642
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Yeah, a lot of talk.

00:37:09.642 --> 00:37:11.270
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Don't come to the mic.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:12.340
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: And make
sure that you balance load

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:12.965
the mics, guys.

00:37:12.965 --> 00:37:13.940
So don't crowd one.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:14.710
Anyway, don't crowd one.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:16.085
Anyway, go ahead,
[? Kinnechi. ?]

00:37:16.085 --> 00:37:17.190
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.700
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
What's your name?

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:18.560
AUDIENCE: [? Kinnechi. ?]

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.070
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Hi, Kinnechi.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.153
Nice to meet you.

00:37:20.153 --> 00:37:20.986
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Hi.

00:37:20.986 --> 00:37:21.527
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.390
That came out less strong
than I wanted it to.

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:27.855
JESSICA WILLIAMS: All
right, work into it.

00:37:27.855 --> 00:37:28.810
AUDIENCE: My question--

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:30.351
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Believe in yourself.

00:37:30.351 --> 00:37:31.748
AUDIENCE: I believe.

00:37:31.748 --> 00:37:34.560
When I look at you, I believe.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.960
Anyway, my question
is, whenever I've

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:40.050
listened to your podcast,
my favorite parts--

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:43.110
actually, my favorite part is
before the show actually starts

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.070
and you're talking
to the sound guy.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:48.385
And I start crying during that
part because it's so hilarious.

00:37:48.385 --> 00:37:50.960
And my question is
actually have you

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.280
thought of making episodes
of just the banter and just

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.600
the friendship, like a few
episodes without guests?

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.690
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We get a
lot, actually, that feedback.

00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:06.330
And we really want to make sure
that we are giving platforms

00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:08.310
to people that otherwise
wouldn't have it.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:09.984
So I think we want
to use it for that.

00:38:09.984 --> 00:38:10.900
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.600
And we do the bonus shows.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:13.775
We did the advice episode.

00:38:13.775 --> 00:38:14.880
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah,
the bon-bon shows.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.421
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Which is really fun.

00:38:16.421 --> 00:38:18.589
And my brother wants to
do an advice episode.

00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:19.672
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Does he?

00:38:19.672 --> 00:38:21.456
Oh, that's going to be amazing.

00:38:21.456 --> 00:38:22.350
PHOEBE ROBINSON: That
will be really funny.

00:38:22.350 --> 00:38:23.040
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah,
that's going to be great.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:23.820
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
So I think stuff

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:26.153
like that, those episodes
where you can get a lot of us.

00:38:26.153 --> 00:38:29.097
But like she said, we really
want to showcase people.

00:38:29.097 --> 00:38:31.680
I mean, that's the heart of the
show is showcasing-- well, no,

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:32.846
we're the heart of the show.

00:38:32.846 --> 00:38:34.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:36.522
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
That's right, girl.

00:38:36.522 --> 00:38:38.907
Uh!

00:38:38.907 --> 00:38:41.490
PHOEBE ROBINSON: But the guests
are like the risk of the show.

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:42.150
I don't know.

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:43.775
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, no, absolutely.

00:38:43.775 --> 00:38:47.636
Mistakes, mistakes,
the risks, the theme.

00:38:47.636 --> 00:38:50.010
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah, the
forearm of the show, whatever.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.080
Their the other body parts
that aren't the heart.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.862
And we just want to make
sure those people are heard.

00:38:54.862 --> 00:38:55.820
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Ears.

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.736
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Ears.

00:38:56.736 --> 00:38:58.467
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Thank you Thank you so

00:38:58.467 --> 00:39:00.180
much for the feedback though.

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:00.681
Hi.

00:39:00.681 --> 00:39:02.555
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming to talk to us.

00:39:02.555 --> 00:39:03.750
And thank you for your work.

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.960
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Thanks.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.668
What's your name?

00:39:04.668 --> 00:39:06.050
Can everyone just
say their name?

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.482
AUDIENCE: Regina.

00:39:06.482 --> 00:39:07.346
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Hi, Regeen-geen.

00:39:07.346 --> 00:39:08.429
AUDIENCE: Good to see you.

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:09.690
I have so many questions.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.847
And I loved "Sooo
Many White Guys."

00:39:11.847 --> 00:39:12.972
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Thank you.

00:39:12.972 --> 00:39:15.300
AUDIENCE: But I'll
keep it to one.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.447
You've touched on
this a little bit.

00:39:17.447 --> 00:39:19.905
How much do you leverage your
your network for your guests?

00:39:19.905 --> 00:39:21.970
Because your guests are awesome.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:25.410
And how much do you put
your wish list together?

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:27.120
So as professionals,
if we're all

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.290
being businesspeople
about what we do,

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.700
how much would you
recommend that we leverage

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.550
what we have, or, like,
go out and just put it

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.692
in the universe for your dream?

00:39:37.692 --> 00:39:39.900
PHOEBE ROBINSON: I mean,
I'm all about putting things

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.810
in the universe and talking
about things all the time

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:46.050
to manifest it.

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:47.310
But you work at Google.

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:50.770
Like, I would literally just
be like, hi, I work at Google.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.230
Can I get this soup for free?

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:54.140
You know what I mean?

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.310
And, like, literally, every
[INAUDIBLE] would be like,

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:58.480
sure, here you go.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.860
So you have, like,
such a great net--

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:06.617
I think with our show, because
we found out Carrie Brown--

00:40:06.617 --> 00:40:08.700
like, all these celebs
were listening to the show.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.850
We were like, oh, we should
just ask them to do it.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:12.390
They won't say no.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:15.485
And so I think once we know
that it's on someone's radar,

00:40:15.485 --> 00:40:20.370
we then go for it and we ask
them, like, on a first date.

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:22.020
But yeah, you work at Google.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.890
Lead with that.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:24.572
Be like, we've done
this, this, this.

00:40:24.572 --> 00:40:26.280
PHOEBE ROBINSON: You're
like, our office,

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.780
there's a whole
floor of our office

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.065
that's just
dedicated to seasons.

00:40:29.065 --> 00:40:29.564
Yeah.

00:40:29.564 --> 00:40:30.863
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:32.276 --> 00:40:35.100
It's just these are seasons.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.695
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Like, we have snacks.

00:40:36.695 --> 00:40:38.278
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Like, that's insane.

00:40:38.278 --> 00:40:39.980
You guys have,
like, walls of moss.

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:42.166
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:42.166 --> 00:40:46.284
And, like, a massage chair and
five restaurants on one floor.

00:40:46.284 --> 00:40:48.450
PHOEBE ROBINSON: It's like
Oprah designed this place

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:48.780
and then left.

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:49.738
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:40:49.738 --> 00:40:50.265
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:50.265 --> 00:40:52.250
PHOEBE ROBINSON: She's
like, my work is done.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:55.042
JESSICA WILLIAMS: She, like,
sprinkled her fairy dust on you

00:40:55.042 --> 00:40:55.750
and then bounced.

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:56.860
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: They've
seen one floor, guys.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:57.635
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:57.635 --> 00:40:59.260
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
But we have to, like,

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.450
low-key kind of drag
you guys because that

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.770
is fucking amazing.

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:04.630
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:10.390
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I work off
of a couch in my apartment.

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:11.899
AUDIENCE: Come anytime.

00:41:11.899 --> 00:41:12.940
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Really?

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:14.545
Like for lunch, exclusively?

00:41:14.545 --> 00:41:15.776
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Aw, thanks.

00:41:15.776 --> 00:41:18.910
But yeah, use your network.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:19.900
You use that power.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.650
Because a lot of times, people
would be like, oh, Google?

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:24.100
OK, I'll listen to this.

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:25.900
As opposed to,
like, hi, I'm like--

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.038
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Working at?

00:41:29.038 --> 00:41:30.349
I work for myself.

00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:32.140
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And
they're like, oh, boo.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.430
[BLOWS RASPBERRY] Fart.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:35.635
So yeah, use the
Google connection.

00:41:35.635 --> 00:41:36.760
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Oh, fart.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.360
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Oh, barf.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.300
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Over to the right?

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for being here.

00:41:39.410 --> 00:41:40.196
My name is Mike.

00:41:40.196 --> 00:41:41.320
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Hi, Mike.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.028
How tall are you?

00:41:42.028 --> 00:41:43.320
AUDIENCE: I am 6'6".

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:43.663
JESSICA WILLIAMS: 6'6"?

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:44.980
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Very cool.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.146
PHOEBE ROBINSON: That's hot.

00:41:46.146 --> 00:41:48.990
JESSICA WILLIAMS: It's like
if somebody is six feet tall.

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:52.174
If it's like six feet or
over, I'm like [PURRS].

00:41:52.174 --> 00:41:54.460
So it's not you.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.620
It's more my body is--

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.290
I'm like, uh!

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.790
It's like--

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:00.261
AUDIENCE: You just
can't control it.

00:42:00.261 --> 00:42:02.260
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Mike,
what do you do at Google?

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.785
AUDIENCE: I do
university programs.

00:42:03.785 --> 00:42:05.410
So I'm the recruitment
side of things.

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:06.370
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Cool.

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:08.434
Like, like, are you single?

00:42:08.434 --> 00:42:09.100
Like, what's up?

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:09.653
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:09.653 --> 00:42:10.944
JESSICA WILLIAMS: I don't know.

00:42:10.944 --> 00:42:11.866
He seems young.

00:42:11.866 --> 00:42:12.848
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:12.848 --> 00:42:14.348
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
How young are you?

00:42:14.348 --> 00:42:16.100
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
How old are you?

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:17.048
AUDIENCE: I'm 29.

00:42:17.048 --> 00:42:18.944
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Oh,
yeah, that's cool.

00:42:18.944 --> 00:42:19.892
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:19.892 --> 00:42:21.004
Do you have a headboard?

00:42:21.004 --> 00:42:21.920
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.504
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:42:22.504 --> 00:42:23.420
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Cool.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.034
That's cool.

00:42:24.034 --> 00:42:25.575
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, that's, like,

00:42:25.575 --> 00:42:28.330
a sign that you're, like,
man, having a headboard.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:28.830
That's cool.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:29.120
Yeah?

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.230
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Yeah, that's cool.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.164
JESSICA WILLIAMS: He's cool.

00:42:31.164 --> 00:42:32.098
And he's got good style.

00:42:32.098 --> 00:42:33.556
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Where do you live?

00:42:33.556 --> 00:42:34.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.670
AUDIENCE: I live
in Crown Heights.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:39.560
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Oh, see,
I used to live by there.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.100
Are you Williamsburg?

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.600
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
No, Crown Heights.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.880
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Really,
really Crown Heights?

00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:43.962
OK.

00:42:43.962 --> 00:42:45.190
I used to live out there.

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:45.805
That's cool.

00:42:45.805 --> 00:42:47.370
All right, get to your question.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.390
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Ask
him-- as him where he--

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:50.973
AUDIENCE: So what
I'm thinking about--

00:42:50.973 --> 00:42:53.140
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Ask him
where he gets his clothes.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.312
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Yeah,
your clothes are cool.

00:42:55.312 --> 00:42:56.395
Are they Urban Outfitters?

00:42:56.395 --> 00:42:57.230
What is it?

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:58.667
AUDIENCE: I got this secondhand.

00:42:58.667 --> 00:43:00.460
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Cool, even better.

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.384
AUDIENCE: Is that good?

00:43:02.384 --> 00:43:04.308
JESSICA WILLIAMS: And
then there's the jeans.

00:43:04.308 --> 00:43:05.897
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Mike, Mike, we're

00:43:05.897 --> 00:43:06.980
going to make this happen.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.160
But you should
ask your question.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.560
AUDIENCE: So my question--

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.960
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Such a
waste of everyone's time.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.860
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: You
should ask your question.

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:16.030
PHOEBE ROBINSON: You know, this
is how I'm going to data from

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.880
now on, I'm just
going to hold Q&amp;As.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:18.250
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.214
PHOEBE ROBINSON: And
just only invite guys.

00:43:20.214 --> 00:43:22.255
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Can you
step to the mic please?

00:43:22.255 --> 00:43:23.140
Step to the mic.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.400
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Ask
all the questions.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:24.899
Yeah.

00:43:24.899 --> 00:43:25.742
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:25.742 --> 00:43:26.950
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Sorry, Mike.

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:27.656
Go ahead.

00:43:27.656 --> 00:43:29.790
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, sorry, not sorry.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:31.520
AUDIENCE: So I'm
thinking about allyship

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:33.720
as being a really
awesome thing in general.

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:36.510
One of the things I've been
talking about and reading about

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:37.926
recently is the
idea of people who

00:43:37.926 --> 00:43:39.215
are, like, woke misogynists.

00:43:39.215 --> 00:43:42.220
I had a friend who said,
I just saw "Get Out."

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.619
I feel like a woke racist.

00:43:43.619 --> 00:43:44.785
Like, I just didn't realize.

00:43:44.785 --> 00:43:46.240
I'm not thinking
about these things.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:47.406
JESSICA WILLIAMS: That's OK.

00:43:47.406 --> 00:43:50.200
AUDIENCE: First, have you had
any situations, anecdotally,

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:52.930
that you're like, no, I
thought you were on my team,

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.670
and then this happened?

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:57.070
And then, also, generally,
other than shutting down the

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:57.570
bullshit--

00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:58.380
JESSICA WILLIAMS: That's
the black experience.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:43:59.120
Every day.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:00.480
PHOEBE ROBINSON: All the time.

00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:00.980
Being alive.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.396
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Literally,
like, the entire country just

00:44:03.396 --> 00:44:04.058
did that.

00:44:04.058 --> 00:44:05.920
The entire country
just did that.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.790
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Like,
literally living.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:08.730
AUDIENCE: Other than
consistently shutting down

00:44:08.730 --> 00:44:10.330
the bullshit, how
do we prevent people

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:14.217
from being so comfortable
having that sort of identity?

00:44:14.217 --> 00:44:15.550
JESSICA WILLIAMS: You know what?

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:17.810
That's a good question.

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:21.520
I think it's a give-and-take.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:25.030
First of all, surround yourself
with friends and people that

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:29.170
are woken, are kind
and nice and generally

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:30.280
aware of what's happening.

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:33.310
But also realize that certain
things are out of your control

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:34.580
too.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:36.790
I think you should only
do that to the extent

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:39.820
that you're not exhausting
yourself and you're not tired.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.770
Because one of my
favorite things

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:45.610
that my therapist says to me is,
you don't have to fight today.

00:44:45.610 --> 00:44:47.830
Sometimes, it's good
to crawl into bed

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:50.890
and just watch reruns of
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:52.480
or play the Sims if you're me.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:57.520
And I feel like it is only
doing it to an extent,

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:02.990
but also realizing that you
can't control everybody,

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:06.530
and just making sure that
with your immediate group,

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:09.800
and when you're out and about,
you express your allyship,

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.687
and you make sure that you
advocate-- as a white male,

00:45:12.687 --> 00:45:14.270
make sure that you
advocate for people

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:17.090
that otherwise wouldn't get
in rooms that you're able to.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.500
But only so much.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.250
And I also think
that if it's, like,

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:25.400
your family, if it's like
somebody old, if it's Grandma,

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.350
it's like she's going
to die soon anyway.

00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:30.611
Like, let her go.

00:45:30.611 --> 00:45:32.440
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
Let her float away.

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.689
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Like, just
let her take it with her.

00:45:34.689 --> 00:45:35.660
Yeah, like, it's crazy.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.070
She's seen a lot of crazy shit.

00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:38.390
But it's like, just let her go.

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:41.804
But yeah, what is your advice?

00:45:41.804 --> 00:45:43.220
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
I also think it's

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:45.920
like we all have to remind
ourselves that we always

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.466
have to be learning.

00:45:47.466 --> 00:45:49.310
ABL, just made it up.

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:51.382
Always Be Learning.

00:45:51.382 --> 00:45:52.840
Yeah, I stole it,
but I made it up.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.950
Like, for me, I'm
constantly having

00:45:57.950 --> 00:46:00.230
to learn about trans issues
because that's something

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:01.479
I don't know everything about.

00:46:01.479 --> 00:46:03.800
And it's being like, I
don't know everything.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.070
Let me go read a book.

00:46:05.070 --> 00:46:06.210
Let me go educate myself.

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:08.990
And so I think it's great that
your friend saw "Get Out,"

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:12.430
and then was like, oh, I'm
more racist than I thought.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:15.716
And that person's going to go
check themselves and evaluate

00:46:15.716 --> 00:46:17.840
their behavior so they can
do better in the future.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.730
And I feel like once you know
better, you can then do better.

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:24.310
So I think really just
checking yourself.

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:26.440
And just be like, hey, am
I doing everything I can?

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:27.940
And be a good person.

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.340
Do I still think
these shitty things?

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.670
Or do I occasionally make a
bad joke that I shouldn't say,

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:36.540
but it makes people laugh,
and so that's why I do it?

00:46:36.540 --> 00:46:39.250
So I think as long as people
are really open about,

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:42.385
I don't have all the answers,
but I really want to learn.

00:46:42.385 --> 00:46:44.510
And they're not like, oh,
well, Jess, you're black.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:45.790
So I'm going to ask
you everything so I

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:46.998
can learn about black people.

00:46:46.998 --> 00:46:49.422
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
What did you call me?

00:46:49.422 --> 00:46:51.130
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Not
like turning someone

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:52.900
into like learning annex.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.540
But educating yourself,
I think, is great.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.045
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Course works?

00:46:57.045 --> 00:46:58.920
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: So
you're the last question.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.430
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Oh, my gosh.

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:00.580
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Hi.

00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:02.260
PHOEBE ROBINSON: No one else
wants to ask a question?

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.218
JESSICA WILLIAMS: We,
like, totally just, like,

00:47:04.218 --> 00:47:07.420
hit on this dude relentlessly
for four to five minutes.

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:08.380
I understand.

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.290
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
It's a good strategy.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:10.695
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Hi.

00:47:10.695 --> 00:47:13.030
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Kayla.
just thank you for coming.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.725
And thank you for
everything that you do.

00:47:14.725 --> 00:47:15.720
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Hi, Kayla.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.440
I love the way you're pulled
together right now, like that--

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.980
PHOEBE ROBINSON: That's cute.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.287
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Kayla
is a huge fan of yours.

00:47:21.287 --> 00:47:23.120
She's been pinging me
about this for a week.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.661
You should know that
she's a big fan.

00:47:24.661 --> 00:47:28.075
AUDIENCE: So of what you can
share, what other side projects

00:47:28.075 --> 00:47:31.060
do you guys have
coming up this year?

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.180
PHOEBE ROBINSON: For me, I'm
going to be in LA April and May

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:36.820
because I'm writing on the
last season of "Portlandia,"

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:39.670
which is very exciting.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.524
And yeah, I think that's it.

00:47:41.524 --> 00:47:42.940
JESSICA WILLIAMS:
Yeah, and I just

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.130
went to Sundance with a movie
called "The Incredible Jessica

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:45.700
James."

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.140
And we sold it to Netflix.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.000
So it'll be on Netflix
in the next couple

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.052
months, which is very exciting.

00:47:52.052 --> 00:47:53.677
So look for me there.

00:47:53.677 --> 00:47:54.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.031
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Thank you.

00:47:56.031 --> 00:47:56.905
Thank you, everybody.

00:47:56.905 --> 00:47:59.419
AUDIENCE: Wait, should we
do this one last-- or no?

00:47:59.419 --> 00:48:00.960
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ:
Megan didn't say no.

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:01.870
Go ahead, go, go, go.

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:02.820
PHOEBE ROBINSON: Go, go, go.

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:03.950
AUDIENCE: This is the worst.

00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:04.960
I didn't even have a question.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.501
I just came here
for your commentary.

00:48:06.501 --> 00:48:08.307
Actually, I really
have enjoyed how

00:48:08.307 --> 00:48:09.682
you interact with
people and also

00:48:09.682 --> 00:48:12.904
to tell Jessica that I miss you
so much more than Jon Stewart.

00:48:12.904 --> 00:48:14.570
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Oh,
thank you so much.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:15.464
Like, aw.

00:48:15.464 --> 00:48:17.032
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:17.032 --> 00:48:18.240
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: That's true.

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.406
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Thank you.

00:48:19.406 --> 00:48:22.000
I appreciate it.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.183
I'm not capable of
growing a I don't work

00:48:24.183 --> 00:48:25.353
in late night anymore beard.

00:48:25.353 --> 00:48:26.764
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:26.764 --> 00:48:28.680
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: Well,
we have a gift for you.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.890
We're going to get you a gift.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:31.510
And we want to thank
you again for coming.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:32.210
PHOEBE ROBINSON: What?

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:33.566
JESSICA WILLIAMS: Did you
get us a massage chair?

00:48:33.566 --> 00:48:34.240
DEMMA RODRIGUEZ: We tried.

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:34.680
We tried.

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:35.846
