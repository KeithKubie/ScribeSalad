00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:07.986
&gt;&gt;Suzanne Reeves: If I was to imagine
creating a school from scratch,

00:00:08.226 --> 00:00:10.786
I would look at "What am I
preparing my students for?

00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:13.366
What is this world that
they're gonna be going into?"

00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:14.976
and "how can I make their experience

00:00:15.136 --> 00:00:18.616
in school feel more close
to that outside world?

00:00:19.056 --> 00:00:20.956
How do I sort of turn
the school inside out?"

00:00:34.046 --> 00:00:35.176
&gt;&gt;Adrienne Curtis Dickinson:
We are in the process

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:40.336
of re-designing thirty courses, which
affects nearly seventy-five teachers.

00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:43.906
This is not easy, we're engaged
in work that asks teachers

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:47.296
to really examine classroom practices
that have been things they've done

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:49.926
for a really long time,
and so helping teachers

00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:55.226
to re-define curriculum is a
really challenging mental shift.

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:57.326
&gt;&gt;Suzanne Reeves: So
we're really focused

00:00:57.326 --> 00:01:00.116
on giving students a problem-based
experience across the whole school

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:02.996
and we've had to think about
"How does that really look?"

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:03.916
and "how does it apply?"

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:05.936
There are places where
it's less intuitive

00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:07.416
and where it's a little
bit more challenging.

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:11.036
English and math are ones
where people don't think

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:12.436
about problem-based learning.

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:16.436
&gt;&gt;Danielle Lynch: I was very unsure,
I didn't know, "What does this look

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:18.446
like in a math classroom?"

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:23.376
I think overall that there's
a little bit of apprehension,

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:26.226
just when you're talking about
doing something completely new.

00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:30.906
It's really exciting to see all
students engaged in your class,

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:34.476
and I think that the
difference of having PBL

00:01:34.576 --> 00:01:39.506
in classrooms really is helping
overall engage our students.

00:01:39.556 --> 00:01:43.296
&gt;&gt;Alicia Kallay: I think
there have been varying levels

00:01:43.296 --> 00:01:44.536
of acceptance of PBL.

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:46.776
What I think has worked
for teachers to buy

00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:52.066
in to PBL is having teachers
create their own courses

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:56.986
by giving them the voice and
also giving them this time to try

00:01:57.096 --> 00:01:59.626
to figure out what it looks like
within their own subject area.

00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:12.706
&gt;&gt;I think we really struggled to find
a way to inject PBL into English.

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.956
We didn't want the study
of literature to be lost.

00:02:15.116 --> 00:02:18.126
I don't want to lose
what inspires people.

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:22.326
For literature it is harder

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:24.806
because the authentic
problems are these really big

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:27.016
philosophical questions.

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:31.696
Being able to see what
else students could do

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:34.206
and moving beyond the
traditional essay

00:02:34.206 --> 00:02:36.926
that follows reading,
it was a challenge.

00:02:36.926 --> 00:02:40.716
&gt;&gt;Suzanne Reeves: One starting point
for all the courses is thinking

00:02:40.716 --> 00:02:45.686
about what professionals in this
discipline really do and then say,

00:02:45.866 --> 00:02:48.866
"How do we give students
more of that experience?"

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.926
&gt;&gt;Alicia Kallay: Before,
it was all about the text,

00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:55.246
but I feel like now it's about
them engaging with the text

00:02:55.246 --> 00:02:57.716
in a different way,
and it's engaging them

00:02:57.716 --> 00:03:00.256
with a text as a writer themselves.

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:07.066
A book that students read is Eli
Wiesel's Holocaust memoir "Night,"

00:03:07.116 --> 00:03:10.136
as they're reading they're
seeing what are the consequences

00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:11.016
of remaining silent.

00:03:11.506 --> 00:03:15.726
We ask them to start to look
for groups or individuals

00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:19.776
who are silenced in some way
and, like Eli Wiesel is doing,

00:03:19.776 --> 00:03:22.186
is give voice to a
voiceless population.

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:25.196
So what you're actually asking
them to do is apply the themes

00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:27.046
that they've seen in
the text themselves.

00:03:27.156 --> 00:03:32.726
&gt;&gt;Emma: I think using PBL in English
classes, or in any other class,

00:03:32.726 --> 00:03:36.616
really kind of changes your
perspective on what that subject is

00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:38.246
and what that subject entails.

00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:42.456
You really see how the subjects
you're learning at fifteen years old,

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.786
how you can use them for your future
and for the rest of your life.

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:49.896
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Making a tool
would be to have a--

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.916
&gt;&gt;Danielle Lynch: Our
leadership team said,

00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:53.556
"We don't know what this
looks like for math.

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:57.206
You guys need to, by trial and error,
figure out what does it look like?

00:03:57.326 --> 00:03:58.006
What's gonna work best?"

00:03:58.746 --> 00:04:02.776
I think each group of
teachers that works together

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:05.536
to design functions a
little bit differently.

00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:10.286
We wanted to be able to not
lose any content in our course

00:04:10.286 --> 00:04:13.926
and still really enrich it
with problems or projects.

00:04:14.116 --> 00:04:19.976
We don't have a PBL-based
unit for every concept

00:04:19.976 --> 00:04:21.036
that we teach in Algebra 2.

00:04:21.726 --> 00:04:24.246
We really just looked at
where it fits and I think

00:04:24.246 --> 00:04:26.216
that is our best approach in math.

00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:28.966
&gt;&gt;Suzanne Reeves: This problem-based
learning isn't gonna look the same

00:04:29.386 --> 00:04:35.546
in every class and so if we're just
trying to kind of shoehorn the way

00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:38.576
that we teach into this kind
of mold that we think is trendy

00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:41.486
or that we think we're supposed to do
because the administration told us,

00:04:41.486 --> 00:04:42.446
then, yeah, it won't work.

00:04:42.826 --> 00:04:45.536
&gt;&gt;Danielle Lynch: Well, I think that
the idea of problem-based learning is

00:04:45.726 --> 00:04:48.196
to engage those students who normally

00:04:48.196 --> 00:04:50.466
in a traditional math
classroom wouldn't be engaged.

00:04:50.466 --> 00:04:55.376
So one example is in our probability
unit: We have students create games.

00:04:55.376 --> 00:04:58.536
For students who may not be pro-math,

00:04:58.846 --> 00:05:01.856
math may not be their favorite
subject, I think when they think

00:05:01.856 --> 00:05:06.346
about "Okay, I have free rein to
create a game," that's something

00:05:06.346 --> 00:05:08.266
that can kind of hook
them into the unit.

00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:11.416
Then you can connect
that saying, "Okay,

00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:14.476
how can we find the
probability of what you created?"

00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:18.346
&gt;&gt;Angelo: The project helps
me, like, to be focused more.

00:05:18.996 --> 00:05:23.046
Making the game project
it's fun and then there's,

00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:24.466
like, a connection to it.

00:05:24.646 --> 00:05:26.936
It makes me more engaged
through math.

00:05:27.246 --> 00:05:28.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Do your best
to work around that.

00:05:28.616 --> 00:05:29.476
&gt;&gt;Adrienne Curtis Dickinson:
I am so excited

00:05:29.476 --> 00:05:31.526
about the progress at Sammamish.

00:05:31.726 --> 00:05:35.586
We have really seen some enormous
outcomes for our students already.

00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:38.976
&gt;&gt;All of that is coming through the
hard work our teachers are doing.

00:05:39.116 --> 00:05:42.756
&gt;&gt;Suzanne Reeves: It's exciting
professionally to be pushed,

00:05:42.756 --> 00:05:45.396
to have the opportunity
to collaborate

00:05:45.396 --> 00:05:46.876
with colleagues in a new way.

00:05:47.226 --> 00:05:49.206
&gt;&gt;Danielle Lynch: It's like anything.

00:05:49.206 --> 00:05:51.726
You have days where you
can get a lot accomplished.

00:05:52.456 --> 00:05:56.506
There're days where you feel
stuck, but we're working together,

00:05:56.686 --> 00:06:01.976
we're a team we're all working
towards the same goal of learning.
