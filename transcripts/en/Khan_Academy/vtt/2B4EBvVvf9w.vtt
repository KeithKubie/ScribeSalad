00:00:00.522 --> 00:00:01.980
What we're now
going to think about

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.829
is finding the
differences between sets.

00:00:04.829 --> 00:00:06.370
And the first way
that we will denote

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.760
this is we'll start with
set A. I've already defined

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.650
set A. Let me do it in
that same shade of green.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.410
I've already defined set A here.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.160
And in both cases, I've defined
these sets with numbers.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.830
Instead of having numbers as
being the objects in the set,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.380
I could have had farm animals
there or famous presidents,

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.460
but numbers hopefully
keep things fairly simple.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.610
So I'm going to start with
set A. And from set A,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.620
I'm going to subtract set B.
So this is one way of thinking

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.210
about the difference
between set A and set B.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.960
And when I've
written it this way,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.550
this essentially says give me
the set of all of the objects

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.740
that are in A with
the things that

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.239
are in B taken out of that set.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.780
So let's think about
what that means.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.560
So what's in set A with the
things that are in B taken out?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.610
Well, that means-- let's take
set A and take out a 17, a 19--

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.040
or take out the 17s,
the 19s, and the 6s.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.660
So we're going to be left with--
we're going to have the 5.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.080
We're going to have the 3.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.415
We're not going to have the
17 because we subtracted out

00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:12.970
set B. 17 is in set B, so take
out anything that is in set B.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.300
So you get the 5, the 3.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.820
See, the 12 is not in set B,
so we can keep that in there.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.340
And then the 19 is
in set B, so we're

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.690
going to take out
the 19 as well.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.190
And so that is this
right over here

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.880
is-- you could view it as
set B subtracted from set A.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.210
So one way of thinking
about it, like we just said,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.480
these are all of
the elements that

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.601
are in set A that
are not in set B.

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:39.100
Another way you
could think about it

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.260
is, these are all of the
elements that are not in set B,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.160
but also in set A. So
let me make it clear.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:55.130
You could view this as
B subtracted from A.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.090
Or you could view this as
the relative complement--

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.450
I always have trouble
spelling things--

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:14.960
relative complement
of set B in A.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.170
And we're going to talk a
lot more about complements

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.160
in the future.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.880
But the complement is the
things that are not in B.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.560
And so this is
saying, look, what

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.490
are all of the things that are
not in B-- so you could say

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.300
what are all of the things
not in B but are in A?

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.925
So once again, if you said all
of the things that aren't in B,

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:35.800
then you're thinking
about all of the numbers

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.809
in the whole universe
that aren't 17, 19, or 6.

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:40.600
And actually, you could
even think broader.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.433
You're not even just
thinking about numbers.

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.590
It could even be the color
orange is not in set B,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.340
so that would be in the
absolute complement of B.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.860
I don't see a zebra
here in set B,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.240
so that would be its complement.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.531
But we're saying, what are
the things that are not in B

00:02:53.531 --> 00:02:55.540
but are in A?

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.280
And that would be the
numbers 5, 3, and 12.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.859
Now, when we visualized
this as B subtracted from A,

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.650
you might be saying,
hey, wait, look, look.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.150
OK.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.520
I could imagine you
took the 17 out.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.310
You took the 19 out.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.680
But what about taking the 6 out?

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.054
Shouldn't you have
taken a 6 out?

00:03:12.054 --> 00:03:13.875
Or in traditional
subtraction, maybe we

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:15.950
would end up with a negative
number or something.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.650
And when you subtract a set, if
the set you're subtracting from

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.270
does not have that element, then
taking that element out of it

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.270
doesn't change it.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.890
If I start with set A, and if
I take all the 6s out of set A,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.952
it doesn't change it.

00:03:27.952 --> 00:03:29.160
There was no 6 to begin with.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.260
I could take all the
zebras out of set A;

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.390
it will not change it.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.950
Now, another way to denote
the relative complement

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.810
of set B in A or B
subtracted from A,

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.190
is the notation that
I'm about to write.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.685
We could have
written it this way.

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:47.760
A and then we would have had
this little figure like this.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.440
That looks eerily
like a division sign,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.380
but this also means the
difference between set A

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.222
and B where we're
talking about-- when

00:03:58.222 --> 00:03:59.680
we write it this
way, we're talking

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.580
about all the things in
set A that are not in

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.900
set B. Or the things in
set B taken out of set A.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.061
Or the relative
complement of B in A.

00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:11.810
Now, with that out of
the way, let's think

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.660
about things the
other way around.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:19.510
What would B slash--
I'll just call it

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.990
a slash right over here.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.640
What would B minus A be?

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.170
So what would be B minus A?

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:37.890
Which we could also
write it as B minus A.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.920
What would this be equal to?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.170
Well, just going
back, we could view

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.490
this as all of the
things in B with all

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.820
of the things in
A taken out of it.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.022
Or all of the things--
the complement of A

00:04:52.022 --> 00:04:55.270
that happens to
be in B. So let's

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.930
think of it as
the set B with all

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.760
of the things in
A taken out of it.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.900
So if we start with
set B, we have a 17.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.360
But a 17 is in set A, so
we have to take the 17 out.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.110
Then we have a 19.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.690
But there's a 19 in set A, so
we have to take the 19 out.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.547
Then we have a 6.

00:05:11.547 --> 00:05:13.380
Oh, well, we don't have
to take a 6 out of B

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.680
because the 6 is not in set A.
So we're left with just the 6.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.420
So this would be just the set
with a single element in it,

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.020
set 6.

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.140
Now let me ask another question.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:35.220
What would the relative
complement of A in A be?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.170
Well, this is the same
thing as A minus A.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.170
And this is literally
saying, let's take set A

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.910
and then take all of the things
that are in set A out of it.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.074
Well, I start with the 5.

00:05:46.074 --> 00:05:47.240
Oh, but there's already a 5.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.230
There's a 5 in set A. So
I have to take the 5 out.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.680
Well, there's a 3, but
there's a 3 in set A,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.720
so I have to take a 3 out.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.595
So I'm going to take
all of these things out.

00:05:53.595 --> 00:06:00.640
And so I'm just going to
be left with the empty set,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.350
often called the null set.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.130
And sometimes the
notation for that

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:08.670
will look like this, the
null set, the empty set.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.230
There's a set that has
absolutely no objects in it.
