00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:09.170
I don’t keep a passcode on my phone, I just
make my life too boring to hack.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.430
Hey iPhone Addicts, Jules here for Dnews!

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.000
It’s 2017, and passwords are soooo passé!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.679
It goes without saying that our phones have
become our main confidants, and the information

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:19.679
on them; sacrosanct.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.240
In the last few years, we’ve seen countless
variations on phone security, and new authentication

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.149
methods on the part of companies like Android
and Apple.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.859
Things like fingerprint scanning, encrypted
passcodes, even complex patterns that have

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.329
to be inputted to gain access into the device.

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.610
But technology researchers will soon present
a scary reality at the Network and Distributed

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.469
System Security Symposium of 2017.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.260
They used covertly taken video of someone
using Pattern Lock on their Android device

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.290
and paired it with computer vision algorithm
software, which was then able to produce the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.019
correct pattern within just five attempts.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.730
The software was able to do this by tracking
the victim’s fingertips, from as far as

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.129
2 and a half meters away.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.170
So, if you thought Pattern Lock was safer
than a passcode, maybe it isn’t.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.479
Plus, most people don’t use difficult to
guess patterns or passcodes, making the job

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.560
of cracking them even easier.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.070
Some security analysts suggest that the method
of locking is less important than using multiple

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.350
encryption.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.880
Most phones have an option where after a certain
limited number of attempts, the phone locks

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.659
itself down until you can get it to a computer
for validation, or it simply wipes the device

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.659
clean.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.509
But even this encryption can be subverted
by making multiple copies of the phone’s

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:27.509
software.

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.329
So maybe the solution is to have a better
password than just a four digit number of

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:32.720
nine-point pattern.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.780
A four digit pin has about 10,000 possible
combinations, a four-to-nine-point pattern

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.409
has closer to 400,000 combinations, but if
you use an actual, alphanumeric password,

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.659
the number of options increases exponentially.

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.030
Even if you use a five-character alphanumeric
password, with 90 different character options,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.690
you’ll end up with almost six billion different
combinations.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.359
That’s pretty secure.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.070
But of course, if someone sees you input your
password, whether it be a camera, or just

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.729
someone looking over your shoulder, your security
is gone altogether.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.710
So what about fingerprint scanning?

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.979
That’s safe, right?

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.270
Well, for starters, your fingerprint isn’t
really protected.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.850
As we’ve talked about before on DNews, a
number of companies have shown that fingerprint

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.930
unlocking can be done using 3D printed prints.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.950
In 2013, a hacking group called the Chaos
Computer Club took a photograph of a fingerprint,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.280
laser printed it, poured rubber over the pattern,
and was able to use this mold to unlock a

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.280
phone.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.690
And of course, there’s the less scientific
method of just knocking you out and pressing

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.380
your thumb against the phone.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.440
And legally, a fingerprint is not even considered
a “password”.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.830
That might seem obvious, but an important
example is if you are arrested and the police

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.350
want to go through your phone.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.100
The Fifth Amendment says that you cannot be
compelled to provide self-incriminating evidence,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.760
like a password, but according to a court
in Virginia, your fingerprint is not incriminating

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.760
information.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.420
Other biometric ideas are in the works to
help keep phones secure, and may one day be

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.750
standard on all phones.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.970
It’s already possible to recognize a designated
person using their heart-rate, their vein

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.370
pattern under the skin, even by the iris and
retina in the eye.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.340
For now, it may just be a good idea to keep
sensitive data off your phone.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.940
If you want to know more about how phones
can be hacked, check out this video here.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.170
So that’s hacking your phone, but did you
know you can hack your body and implant technology

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.170
in it?

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.530
Our friends at Zoetic cover that in this video,
here.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.540
And what do you guys use?

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.270
A pattern? a pin? a password?

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.270
Your fingerprint?
