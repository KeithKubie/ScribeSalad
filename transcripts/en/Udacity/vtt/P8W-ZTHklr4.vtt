00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now I'd like to ask you to do a slightly more challenging programming assignment.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Imagine we have a die that has an arbitrary number of sides

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and each side can be labeled anything we want.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And the die can be fair or it can be loaded.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I called that here dist.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You can think of it as a distribution of values

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or, more formally, a probability distribution,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but that doesn't really matter for this exercise

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
because in the lecture we learned about likelihood in the context of coins.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Here I'd like to ask you about in the context of a die that can have any number of sides,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
labeled anything, with any probability.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And I'd like you to write a function called likelihood

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that takes the data and the distribution and returns the likelihood.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I wrote one. Let's see what it produces.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You can see we get a very, very small number.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That's actually quite common with likelihoods

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because there are so many different data values,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
any given one likely has a pretty small value.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That said, they can still be interesting.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now let's look at the code you're going to have to write.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Here is the function.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Likelihood that takes a distribution and data, just as we saw below.

00:01:12.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Insert your code here. Have fun.
