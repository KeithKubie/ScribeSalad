they don't have a flavor they can be
 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.910
they don't have a flavor they can be

and there's no reason for them to be in
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.700

the food supply at all so in that sense

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710
the food supply at all so in that sense
 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.479

foie gras one is much more complicated

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550
foie gras one is much more complicated

because if you're going to eat animals

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410
because if you're going to eat animals
 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.160

in general you're going to they're all

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170
in general you're going to they're all
 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.230

going to be killed any animal that you
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480
going to be killed any animal that you
eat is going to be killed and so the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
eat is going to be killed and so the
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.820
eat is going to be killed and so the
question is then how do you kill them

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
question is then how do you kill them
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.030
question is then how do you kill them
