00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.600
This is the sun.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:08.600
It has a diameter of 864,000 miles

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.260
and a mass of 330,000 times that of our planet.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.700
The star that is the basis of the solar system

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.840
that sustains life on earth.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.100
We bring this up to you because you seem to be under

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.740
the misunderstanding that the center of our solar system

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.960
that the earth continues to revolve around is you.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.080
The earth in fact does not revolve around you

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.200
and you are not the center of our solar system.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.700
We apologize that you were ever under this delusion

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.180
Please don't mate.
