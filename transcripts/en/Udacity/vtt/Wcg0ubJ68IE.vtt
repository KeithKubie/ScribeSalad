00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now you've seen that you can encode

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
4 things in bits.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You can encode any number though, we just need more bits.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So if we have more bits, we can encode more different things.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So here I've got 4 bits.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That means I have 4 yes/no choices,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and I can encode 16 different numbers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And the reason for that is because 2 to the 4 is 16.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Every time I add 1 more bit,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I double the number of things

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because I have 1 more yes/no question.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So for just this part of the graph, I had 8 things.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I have 3 bits.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I could distinguish between the numbers 0 through 7.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Adding 1 more bit

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
doubles the number of things I can distinguish.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So that's a way to measure information.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And once can distinguish any number of things,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
well we can send any kind of data we want.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Anything that's discrete, we can turn into a number.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So we can turn letters into numbers if we have a long string.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We could have a sequence of numbers,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which we can turn into 1 really big number.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So once we can send bits,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we can send anything we want.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So that's what bandwidth is.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's a measure of the amount of information that we can send,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and we're measuring the number of bits.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Each bit is 1 yes or no decision.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In computing we usually think of that as either a zero or a 1.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So that long string of zeros and 1s is the information we are sending,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and it could be encoding a string of text

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
like it does in a web page,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
it could be encoding an image,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
it could be encoding a number.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And to measure our bandwidth, we need to know who many bits

00:01:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
can we send per second.
