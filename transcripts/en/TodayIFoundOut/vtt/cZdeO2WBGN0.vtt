00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.029
The primarily purposes of a fence include
to keep animals in, people out, and perhaps

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.029
even so others can’t see into your yard.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.480
But if this is the case, why are there laws
that limit how tall fences can be?

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.700
Also, what would happen if you ignored the
law and built a monstrous fence anyway, or

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.889
planted a row of tall trees around your property
instead to try to get around the fence height

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:12.889
restrictions?

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.759
Contrary to what you’d expect from such
an innocuous object as a fence built on your

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.890
own property, the laws surrounding the building
and regulation of fences are hugely complex.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.690
As noted by the Lectric Law Library, fence
ordinances in suburban and urban areas can

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.160
be remarkably robust and are often bewilderingly
complicated and austere.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.999
Also, since the majority of fence laws are
handled on a local level, some of what we’re

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:41.879
about to say may not specifically apply to
the area in which you live.

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.739
All that said, although the rules surrounding
the building of a fence are very strict, they’re

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.699
notoriously difficult to enforce.

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.550
For example, let’s say that the fence laws
in your area state that no fence can exceed

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.239
6 feet in height, which is fairly common in
many regions.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.370
If you went ahead and built a fence that was
7 feet tall, it’s generally only going to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.630
be an issue if someone complains.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:09.299
And even then, there’s no guarantee anything
will come of that complaint, particularly

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.549
if your neighbors wait awhile before complaining
or the structure was there before a new neighbor

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.640
who then decides to complain moved in.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.130
This is because local authorities are usually
unwilling to weigh in on very minor infractions

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.600
of such laws because the cost of doing so
outweighs the potential benefits.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.310
So, if nobody complains and the fence is of
otherwise sturdy construction, it’s highly

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.030
unlikely you’re going to be forced to tear
it down.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.980
This is in part due to a legal principle known
as “substantial compliance“, which is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.670
defined as follows:

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.719
substantial performance is a legal principle
which says that if a good faith attempt is

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.189
made to perform the requirements of the agreement
even if it does not precisely meet the terms

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.939
of the agreement or statutory requirements,
the performance will still be considered complete

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.789
if the essential purpose is accomplished…

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.630
In regards to fence laws, this basically means
that as long as a fence you build is mostly

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.299
compliant with the local laws of your area,
you can argue yourself some wiggle room if

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.950
it’s not exactly the correct height.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.370
But why is there a limit on how high fences
can be anyway?

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.230
Well, broadly speaking this is mostly for
the benefit of other people.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.569
While a 30 foot high fence may not bother
the person who built it, it could very easily

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.720
impact the day-to-day life of his neighbour
by blocking light, air flow, or view to their

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.980
home, among other things.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.670
As mentioned, an accepted (but by no means
universal) rule of thumb is that a back yard

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.159
fence should be no more than 6 feet tall.

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.841
Of course, there are exceptions, for example
if your back yard borders a busy road, you

00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:41.621
can apply for a one-time permission from your
local authority to build a much taller fence

00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:45.700
to block out noise and view of the cars and
trucks driving by.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.930
Of course, if there is an intersection near
where you’re building that fence or if the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.090
road is curvy, so your fence might block the
view of drivers around a corner, then you’ll

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.000
probably be denied.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.030
This brings us to front fences.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.840
In this case, a commonly accepted but not
universal idea is that they should be shorter

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.909
than a back yard fence, often limited to between
3-4 feet in height.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.030
Why?

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.200
Well it may be your first instinct to assume
that this is something to do with maintaining

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.470
the aesthetics of a given neighbourhood.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.700
But no, as alluded to a few sentences ago,
the main reason front fences are invariably

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.680
required to be shorter is because roads tend
to border them and taller fences can obscure

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.680
the vision of drivers.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.920
For instance, a driver in this case may not
be able to see kids playing in the road right

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.920
around a bend.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.870
And, of course, with fences around houses
that happen to be on corner lots, an overly

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.260
tall fence could potentially turn an intersection
into a collection of deadly blind corners.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.489
So what about natural fences like trees and
bushes?

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.689
Well, for the most part they’re treated
the same way fences are.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.019
Although, in some cases border trees or shrubs
are allowed to be slightly taller than fences.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.049
But, in general, they’re held to approximately
the same standards as a man-made fence, so

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.490
no loophole in the law here.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.959
If your trees or shrubs impact your neighbour’s
enjoyment of his or her property, said individual

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.939
may be able to legally compel you to trim
or even remove them.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.890
On the flip-side, as with fences, if you plant
a giant row of trees or bushes and nobody

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.840
complains for a good amount of time and your
plants don’t obscure traffic, you’ll probably

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.950
be allowed to keep them even if someone many
years later complains, unless something significant

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:16.950
has changed about the tree or bush in the
interim.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.880
In the end, while there are numerous laws
surrounding this topic, it almost always comes

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.139
down to how nice or laid back your neighbours
are and whether your fence or shrub is causing

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.740
any traffic safety problems.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.800
Weirdly, the one thing the law really can’t
dictate is what your fence looks like, to

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.640
quote FindLaw: “In most cases, except in
a very few communities, the appearance, style,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.880
or design of a fence is unregulated by local
law.”

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.880
Which means that although your neighbour can
complain about you building an 8 foot tall

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.350
fence, there’s generally nothing they can
do to stop you building a 6 foot tall one

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.220
and covering it in pictures of Justin Bieber.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.250
The only exception is if your new fence violates
a blight ordinance, which varys from state

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.720
to state, or if it’s constructed maliciously
for the express purpose of annoying your neighbour,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.620
in which case it can be legally defined as
a spite fence.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.620
(Yes, that’s a thing.)

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.520
In regards to spite fences, they’re defined
as “A fence built not to any beneficial

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.470
purpose but, rather, to annoy a neighbour.”

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.389
Perhaps the most famous spite fence of all
was the one built by Charles Crocker in the

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:14.590
late 19th century.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.169
Crocker wanted to purchase a small San Francisco
property from one Nicholas Yung, but Yung

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.700
refused to sell unless Crocker doubled his
offer.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.400
Crocker, instead, responded by building a
massive 40 foot tall wall around his property.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.520
The two men took their dispute to the grave
and the wall only came down when their heirs

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.669
settled their differences.

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:41.259
Today, such constructions are illegal, thanks
in part to cases like the one between Crocker

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:55.759
and Yung.
