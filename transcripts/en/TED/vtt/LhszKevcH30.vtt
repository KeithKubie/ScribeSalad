00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.760
I became obsessed with records
when I was about 12 years old.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.576
My parents used to give me money to eat

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.336
and on most days, instead of eating,

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.736
I would save it and buy myself
a record at the end of the week.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.816
Here I am with a gigantic Walkman
that's about half my leg --

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.696
(Laughter)

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.576
It actually looks more like a VCR.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.456
(Laughter)

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.736
So when I was a teenager,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.736
the obsession of buying cassettes,
vinyls and CDs just kept growing.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.736
I was even working
in a record store for many years

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.600
and only ever got paid in records.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.456
One day I realized
that I had thousands of records more

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.056
than I could even listen to in my life.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.056
I became what many of us are:

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.856
record junkies --

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.680
or record diggers,
as we like to call ourselves.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.536
Record digging, as the name suggests,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.696
means getting your hands dirty.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.256
It means spending hours
rummaging through warehouses,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.536
church basements,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.816
yard sales, record stores --

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.336
all to find records that have been
forgotten for decades.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.480
Records that have become cultural waste.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.496
The earliest record collectors
from about the '30s to the 1960s

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.336
found and preserved
so many important records

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.040
that would have been lost forever.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.216
In those days, most
cultural and public institutions

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.456
didn't really care
to preserve these treasures.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.360
In many cases, they were just
throwing them into the garbage.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.616
Record digging is a lifestyle.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.056
We're absolutely obsessed
with obscure records,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.256
expensive records, dollar-bin records,

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.576
crazy artwork,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.960
sub-subgenres.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.456
And all of the tiniest details
that go with each release.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.576
When the media talks
about the vinyl revival

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.656
that's been happening
these last few years,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.576
they often forget
to mention this community

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.336
that's been keeping the vinyl
and the tradition and the culture alive

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.960
for these last 30 years.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.136
It's a very close-knit
but competitive society, a little bit,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.216
because when you're hunting
for extremely rare records,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.656
if you miss your opportunity,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.920
you might not see that record
ever in your life.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.816
But I guess the only person in here
truly impressed by record collectors

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.360
is another record collector.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.936
To the outside world,

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.016
we seem like a very weird,
oddball group of individuals.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.256
And --

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.696
(Laughter)

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.936
And they're mostly right.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.616
All the record collectors I know
are obsessive maniacs.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.680
We know we're all crazy in some way.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.256
But I think we should be viewed
a little bit more like this.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.296
(Laughter)

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.656
We're music archaeologists.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.880
We're hunting down the lost artifact.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.936
We all have a list of records that we
would do anything to get our hands on,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.616
that we've been chasing for years,

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.960
and we actually call this list
our "holy grails."

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.816
When you're digging for records,

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.976
you're surrounded by music you don't know.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.296
You're surrounded by mystery
and by all these dreams --

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.280
records that people once believed in.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.736
Imagine the thousands of artists
who were destined to be legends

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.376
but for various reasons,
were just overlooked.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.616
Many of these records
only exist in a handful of copies,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.896
and some have never even been found,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.136
never been heard.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.240
They're literally endangered species.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.736
I'll tell you a story

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.696
that for me sort of sums up
the value of the work of record diggers.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.760
The story of a brilliant
Montreal musician and composer.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.536
Henri-Pierre Noël
was born and raised in Haiti,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.080
but he lived briefly
in the US and in Belgium.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.856
He passed through Montreal
what was supposed to be for two weeks,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.056
but he ended up
staying for the next 40 years.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.136
When he was young,
he learned to play piano

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.096
and developed a very particular way
of playing his instrument:

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.000
very fast and almost like a percussion.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.056
His style was a mix
of his Haitian influences and folklore

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.616
mixed with the American influences
that he grew up hearing.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.800
So he created a mix
of compas mixed with funk and jazz.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.016
As a young man,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.936
he played and toured with live bands
in the US and in Europe,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.320
but had never recorded an album
or a song before moving to Canada.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.656
It was in Montreal in 1979

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.296
that he released
his first album called, "Piano."

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.320
Completely on his own,
on Henri-Pierre Noël Records.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.320
He only made what he could afford:
2,000 copies of the record.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.840
The record received
a little bit of airplay,

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:31.495
a little bit of support
in Canada and in Haiti,

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:33.976
but without a big label behind it,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.600
it was very, very difficult.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.616
Back then,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.336
if your record wasn't getting played
on mainstream radio,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.576
if you weren't in jukeboxes
or if you weren't invited to play on TV,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.416
the odds were completely against you.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.056
Releasing an album
as an independent artist

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.176
was so much more difficult
than it is today,

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.816
both in terms of being heard
and just distributing the thing.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.016
So, soon after,
he released a second album,

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.096
kept a busy schedule playing piano
in various clubs in the city,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.280
but his records started
to accumulate dust slowly.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.816
And those 2,000 copies
in the span of 30 years

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.816
easily started to get lost

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.000
until only a few copies
in the world remained.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.216
Then in the mid-2000s,

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.096
a Montreal record digger
that goes by the name Kobal

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.240
was doing his weekly rounds
of just hunting for records.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.376
He was in a flea market

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.496
surrounded by thousands
of other dirty, dusty, moldy records.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.440
That's where he found the "Piano" album.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.456
He wasn't specifically looking for it.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.816
Actually, you could say
it sort of found him.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.816
You could also say that after 20 years
of record digging every single week,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.400
he had developed a sixth sense
for finding the gold.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.816
He took the record and inspected it:

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.656
the front, the artwork,
the back, the liner notes,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.376
and he was intrigued by the fact
that this Haitian musician made a record

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.736
in Quebec in the late '70s,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.600
so he was intrigued.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.816
He took out his little,
plastic, portable turntable

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.696
that he brought with him
whenever he was on these digging quests

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.376
and put the record on.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.040
So why don't we do the same thing?

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.000
(Music)

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.736
He fell in love with the music instantly,

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.816
but he had to know
the backstory behind it.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.560
He didn't know where it came from.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.016
He knew the artist,

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.456
at the time of the recording,

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.736
was living in Montreal,

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.760
so for months, he tried to track him down.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.120
He even found Noël's business card
inside the record sleeve.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.160
That's how DIY Henri-Pierre Noël was.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.176
So he found the card
inside the record sleeve --

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.616
of course he did try to call,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.040
but after 30 years,
the number didn't work anymore.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.936
So it was only in Belgium,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.536
where the artist had once lived,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.696
that Kobal managed to find someone
that knew the artist personally

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.040
and gave him the contact.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.576
So when he finally
sat down with the artist,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.800
he made him a promise to someday
find a way to get the album rereleased.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.816
He then arranged for a British label
called Wah Wah 45s

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.720
to get the two albums reissued.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.496
And what happens very often is,

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.776
in these reissue projects,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.936
that it becomes very difficult
to find the master tapes --

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.056
the original recording of the sessions.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.056
Art can be destroyed
by fires, floods, earthquakes,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.296
thrown in the garbage,

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.816
or just lost forever.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.056
But thankfully,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.896
the Henri-Pierre Noël tapes were safe

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.640
and they were ready for remastering.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.296
The record was finally rereleased

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.320
and received praise from music critics,
DJs and listeners worldwide --

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.200
the praise that it should have
received in 1979.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.816
The artist was so inspired that he decided
to revive his music career,

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.600
get back on a stage,
and play for new audiences.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.456
The artist, now in his 60s,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.776
told me, "This changed everything for me.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.456
I went from planning my retirement

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.080
to playing on the BBC Radio in London,
and on Radio Canada and more."

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.576
But also it gave him a chance to play

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.096
in front of his three sons
for the first time.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:43.176
To me, this story shows perfectly
the work of record diggers at its best.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.176
Beyond the rarity and the dollar value --

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.135
and I'll be honest,
we're totally obsessed by that --

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:51.616
the true beauty
is to give art a second chance;

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.240
to save art from oblivion.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.776
The work of a good record digger
is a constant loop of three phases.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.440
The first thing we do is hunt.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.136
We spend hours, days, years of our lives

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.216
rummaging through
dirty and dusty record bins.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.360
Everything that we can do
to find our hands on the gold.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.256
Yes, you can find good records online,

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.736
but for the deepest treasures,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.000
you need to get off the couch
and into the wild.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.296
That's why we call it record digging
and not record clicking.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.456
(Laughter)

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.680
So what we are is music archaeologists.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.416
But then the next thing
we do is we gather.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.696
Based on our taste,
expertise, personal agenda,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.056
we choose carefully which records to save,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.256
which records mean something to us.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.936
We then try and find out every
little thing we can about that record --

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.416
the artist, the label

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.456
and supervital information

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.000
like "Who's that playing trumpet
on track three?"

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.936
Then we file them, we contextualize them,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.216
and we keep them safe.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.720
We are music archivists.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.136
And the last thing we do
to close the loop is we share.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.816
Most record diggers that I know
have some sort of a way

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.256
to share their discovery
and elevate the artist

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.536
through an album reissue,

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.880
a web article, a radio show.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.880
We give records back
their rightful place in music history.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.096
We are tastemakers and curators.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.400
We are musicologists.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.936
So for myself

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.936
and most of the record collectors
I've encountered in 20 years,

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.376
I think that we all
have some sort of an outlet

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.656
for these discoveries.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.736
I think it's our way to keep our sanity
and sort of sense of purpose

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.536
in this very maddening obsession,

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.456
because it can be sort of a lonely one.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.195
But I think we also do it
because it serves the human need

00:10:29.219 --> 00:10:30.819
to pass along cultural knowledge.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.096
Speaking of the need for curation,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.016
in an era of overwhelming choice,

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.296
it's been demonstrated

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:39.936
that too much choice
actually hinders discovery.

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.176
For example,

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.816
if you're trying to watch
something on Netflix,

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.336
you're actually only browsing
through a catalog of 6,000 titles.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.256
Now, compare that with Spotify;

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.376
if you want to pick
something to listen to,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.136
you're browsing through a catalog
of 30 million songs.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.416
So I think as you can see,

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.616
this notion of paralysis by choice

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.696
affects music more than movies,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.136
for example.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.416
And there's a few studies

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.616
that are starting to show
the effects of this.

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:09.376
A recent look at the UK music market

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:14.816
shows that the top one percent of artists
in the UK are actually earning 77 percent

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.456
of the total revenues
inside the music industry.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.976
That's 2013,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.216
and that's progressively getting worse,

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.016
or progressing.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.896
Anyway, if you're in the one percent,
I'm sure you're happy.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.176
(Laughter)

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.560
So the takeaway for me is

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.680
it's easier for people
to listen to music than ever before.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.696
People have more music
at their disposal than ever before,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.496
yet people choose to listen to more
of the same music than ever before.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.760
And that's a sad thing.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:51.896
Inspired by my love for music research,
record digging and curation,

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.056
I started a website called
"Music Is My Sanctuary" in 2007.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.816
Our slogan has always been
"Future Classics and Forgotten Treasures."

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.336
And it shows our love
for discovering music

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.936
and introducing music both old and new.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.216
From humble beginnings,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.056
we've built a worldwide platform
with a massive audience

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.256
with over 100 collaborators.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.616
We've created over
10,000 pieces of content,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.000
over 500 hours of audio content.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.376
Our audience consists of people

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.856
who just want more
than what's being offered to them

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.376
by mainstream music channels.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.600
They want to do --

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.656
they want to dig deeper,

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.600
but they don't necessarily
have 20 hours a week like us nerds,

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.240
so they trust us to do that for them.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.536
Curation is at the heart
of everything we do.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.120
We believe in human
recommendations over algorithms.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.336
I could talk about the passion
of record digging for days,

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.576
but let me conclude this way.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.336
After many years of doing it,

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.160
a record collector's collection
becomes sort of his autobiography.

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.136
Last year, I was DJ-ing in Poland,

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.136
and the people that were hosting me,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.256
they had this amazing record collection,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.896
and of course I was intrigued

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.496
and I said, "Are you selling these?"

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.096
They then explained to me
that it was the collection

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.000
that belonged to their dear friend Maceo
who passed away a few months earlier.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.176
And they were doing a project
of inviting different people

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.096
to take the collection
and to create something new from it,

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.576
whether it's sampling or DJ mixes,

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.776
you know, just to give it a second life.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.776
And so after a few hours
of going through the collection myself

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.976
and creating a DJ mix from it,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.456
even though I never
got the chance to meet him,

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.096
it felt like in a special way,

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.336
me and him,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.480
we got to talk
about records for a few hours.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.800
So, as record diggers,

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.856
our work and our record
collections are there

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.760
to be passed on to the next generation.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.480
Beautiful art deserves to be cherished,
shared and rediscovered.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.816
Embrace curators;

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.016
we are alternative voices
to the mainstream music channels,

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.400
digital or otherwise.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.720
Go beyond the algorithm.

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.496
Whatever kind of music you like,

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.896
there are so many websites,
radio shows, DJs, record stores out there

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.656
that are just waiting
to share their discoveries with you.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.016
We do this work for you.

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.056
All you have to do
is open your ears and take risks.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.016
This music will change your life.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.256
Thank you.

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.280
(Applause)
