You are listening to radiolab radio that

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.620
from w n y.

3
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:11.790
S e n n p. R.

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.240
<v 1>Three two one. Hey there. I'm Robert Krulwich. Jad is on paternity leave.</v>

5
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.340
This is Radiolab, the podcast,

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and today I thought I'd introduce you to a particular guy on a particular day in

7
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:29.750
Manchester, England. It's 1952 an Alan Turing, a math professor,

8
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:33.980
discovers that a number of things have disappeared from his home. Look,

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.490
kind of like a Berkeley. He was missing a shirt, a pair of shoes,

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.440
<v 0>an old pair of pants, maybe a compass. It was stuff.</v>

11
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:43.080
It was just household stuff. Nothing of any value.

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.060
<v 1>That's Jan 11 and David Levin.</v>

13
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.120
Both of them have written books about Alan Turing,

14
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.890
<v 0>and so being very literal minded, he thought, well,</v>

15
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:51.720
what do you do when you're robbed? You called the police,

16
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.200
so the police come to his house. The detectives,

17
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:58.110
he has this conversation and they say, you know, he's kind of a curious chap.

18
00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:01.290
They let him talk and they're like, it's a real shame.

19
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:05.070
We're going to have to arrest him. Tearing.

20
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.180
<v 2>Okay,</v>

21
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.920
<v 1>why would they have to?</v>

22
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.920
They're just telling me just these effectively implicated himself in terms of

23
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:13.190
here's what happened. The belief set, tearing down, said, Oh,

24
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:15.930
who do you think made off at those things of yours? And he says to them,

25
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.770
he suspected the thief was an acquaintance of his boyfriend,

26
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
his boyfriend. Yes. Yes. She has a time.

27
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.500
There was a law in England

28
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.080
<v 0>which criminalized quote unquote acts of gross indecency between adult man in</v>

29
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:31.190
public or private.

30
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.680
So we told the cops that he was having sex with a guy who was like,

31
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.660
why do we doesn't exactly say we're having sex? But he, um,

32
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.060
says enough that it's clear he was never ashamed of being gay.

33
00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:47.360
This is just not something, again, that he understood what the fuss was about.

34
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.960
And what happened was he, was he convicted? Yeah, he's convicted and he's,

35
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.000
what's his sentence? Estrogen pills and um, implants. Mr Janie implants.

36
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.600
Oh my God. Yeah. Chemical Castration.

37
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.740
<v 1>And when I learned this,</v>

38
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.850
I wondered if those policemen had any idea that the guy they were arresting was

39
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.481
first of all,

40
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:10.040
one of the great minds of the 20th century or war hero who single handedly,

41
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.780
almost by himself shortened World War II by at least two years.

42
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.600
And the questions he posed way back then, I still,

43
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:22.370
I think the most provocative ideas I know, but we're getting ahead of ourselves.

44
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:27.371
So let me back up to when he was a schoolboy around 15 or 16 in England,

45
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.690
<v 0>he gets to Sherbourne school, which is the, uh, public school,</v>

46
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.970
as they say in England. I guess we would call it a boarding school,

47
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.930
boarding school for boys. Where, um, what did he look like? He had dark hair,

48
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:42.660
very dark hair, sort of square face. He, he wasn't unattractive.

49
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.550
He was just so goofy. So did the other kids make fun of him at school or,

50
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.520
or did he, I mean, he's teased, bullied,

51
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.740
but he's not completely unhappy.

52
00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:57.400
He falls in love with another student named Christopher Moore.

53
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.630
Com is very charming, socially smooth, handsome.

54
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.780
They have this bond of a science. It's an unrequited love.

55
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.010
Did he express his love to this other kid or, I think it was pretty obvious.

56
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.730
He was always sort of there sitting next to Chris Marcom,

57
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.570
every class right behind him right next to him. And I think, um,

58
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.980
at some point Chris commented that, you know,

59
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.310
maybe it's a little too much attention. Um,

60
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.790
but I don't think he really made a formal declaration of his love.

61
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.840
But he did maintain a relationship with Chris's mother. Um,

62
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.190
even after Chris died,

63
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.140
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

64
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.990
<v 0>Chris Morgan died while he was still in school of, um, Bavarian tuberculosis,</v>

65
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.940
um, and had kept his illness a secret. Just one day.

66
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.380
It was just this announcement. He was dead.

67
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.930
So I think it came as a complete shock to Allen.

68
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.680
<v 1>His memory really lingered and I think that, uh,</v>

69
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.450
how do we know that a kid had a boy crush in school?

70
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.040
Their letters most moving are the letters that he wrote after more comes death.

71
00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.140
We actually went out and found a few of them.

72
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.260
And here's one that he wrote to his mother. He says,

73
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.010
I feel sure that I should meet mark them again somewhere.

74
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.610
And there will be some work for us to do together as I believe there was for us

75
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.950
to do here now that I'm left to do you want it to believe it.

76
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.730
<v 0>Christmas spirit lived on and, and he was sort of awkwardly trying on these um,</v>

77
00:04:17.731 --> 00:04:20.870
ideas that he had inherited from his religious upbringing and,

78
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.270
and you can see this in the letters to try and begins to lose his faith

79
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.300
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

80
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.950
<v 0>and eventually comes to the sort of brutal conclusion that when Chris was gone,</v>

81
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.843
he was gone.

82
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.200
<v 1>The only love he had left at that point was mathematics.</v>

83
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.920
So he goes off to kings college, Cambridge to study math. Yeah, exactly.

84
00:04:37.921 --> 00:04:41.280
He was still kind of a loner. If you look at photographs of touring,

85
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:44.520
I think I'm always struck by the fact that he looks like he's not actually

86
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.110
there. He looks like he's like a lot of mathematicians. He,

87
00:04:48.111 --> 00:04:50.700
he lives simultaneously in two different worlds. The,

88
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.270
the world that the rest of us live in any world lived in a kind of extraordinary

89
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:55.770
world of, of abstraction.

90
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.060
<v 0>No lying in the fields and Cambridge,</v>

91
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.330
just him and his thoughts staring up at the sky or was that just didn't do that.

92
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.580
He would literally go and lie in the meadow and he would have these Epiphanes,

93
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.443
these realizations

94
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.890
<v 1>and one day he's lying in Grandchester meadows that's near the campus and he's</v>

95
00:05:13.891 --> 00:05:15.600
thinking over a pretty tough problem.

96
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.660
Is there a quick automatic way to prove or disprove a mathematical proposition?

97
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:25.290
And this was a big question in math at the time, the ins and outs of,

98
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.160
we're trying to all that important to us what's important is that it led to Alan

99
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.120
Turing's idea for of all things the machine, the machine doesn't exist.

100
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.450
The machine is never built. It is never meant to be built.

101
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.420
This is James Glick as science writer who has studied touring.

102
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.770
It's the world's most impractical machine, but it's very simple.

103
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.100
These were the elements of the machine, number one piece of tape,

104
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.660
infinitely long.

105
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.070
So therefore it's already never going to exist because we can't have infinitely

106
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:56.070
long pieces of tape. And number two,

107
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.280
something that reads rights ones and Zeros

108
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.190
<v 4>on the tape device. And number three, a set of instructions.</v>

109
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.980
So if you've got as zero,

110
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.530
then you go to the left and you write a one.

111
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.480
Or if you've got a one go to the left and you write another one or you you,

112
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.410
yeah, and you've got to remember where you've been.

113
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:15.230
So you have a certain amount of memory, but that's it.

114
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.040
And then he proved that the machine could do anything.

115
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.700
You could add a course and then you could subtract and multiply.

116
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.790
You could also do a little calculus, actually a lot of calculus.

117
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:30.110
You could do trig and mathematical proofs and sophisticated mathematical proofs.

118
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.140
Anything that could be done in mathematics mechanically could be done by his

119
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:41.270
imaginary idiot. Simple machine. Is this such a big idea?

120
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:41.570
I mean,

121
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.510
all you're saying really is he figured out how to put logic or actually had a

122
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:47.720
program and machine. Okay. But, but no, Robert,

123
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.680
you're already cheating because as soon as you say you're going to give them

124
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.460
machine some logic. Yeah. And then as soon as you used to work program,

125
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.990
you're using very modern bits of knowledge that we've all internalized.

126
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:03.560
But the idea of putting logic into a machine,

127
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.530
no one thought of that. That's just weird machines at that time.

128
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.740
Bear in mind, we're generally single fund.

129
00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:16.700
<v 5>The idea that you do your email on your computer and Photoshop,</v>

130
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.970
you know you don't buy a different machine. That is ingenious.

131
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.210
That traces back to touring's original idea that I can build an

132
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.420
electromechanical brain and I can teach it how to do different things.

133
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.920
This was the dawn of the computer age. Computer used to mean a person,

134
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.500
<v 4>usually a woman who would sit and do mathematics and now we've got this guy who</v>

135
00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:38.720
saying that with a simple formula, tape code and a set of instructions.

136
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.110
We can give human liabilities to a machine and not just the abilities of our

137
00:07:44.361 --> 00:07:48.800
hands, but the nimble ability of our beautiful brains. It's a beautiful,

138
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.660
magical, simple idea.

139
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.130
Turns machine is say as Hans watercolors,

140
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:57.590
it's it's box prelude.

141
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.580
He was a lonely 22 year old just thinking and he invented a thing that lives in

142
00:08:06.891 --> 00:08:11.180
the mind of every computer scientist today.

143
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.280
He didn't realize that just a few years later he was going to be applying these

144
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:20.270
same skills to winning the war for, for England.

145
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.420
<v 6>The Battle of London, which began with strong fast is a Nazi.</v>

146
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:26.980
Obama's attacking the Capitol at night led to a big fire on the water side.

147
00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.710
<v 5>It's 1940 and the German high command is sending secret messages written in Code</v>

148
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.680
to naval commanders to u boat captain saying,

149
00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:37.140
I'd sink that ship mind this harbor.

150
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.160
The messages are encrypted in this crazy fangled encrypting thing that they

151
00:08:41.161 --> 00:08:44.160
called the enigma machine, kind of a typewriter.

152
00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:47.490
So they would type bomb that boat in German of course,

153
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.570
and the machine would swap the letters and turn the type into jibberish.

154
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.720
But they changed the settings every,

155
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.040
and what this meant was that it was considered by both the Germans and the

156
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:03.330
British to be uncrackable except Winston Churchill thought, Al, let me try.

157
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.700
So in total secrecy,

158
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:09.300
British intelligence brought together the most talented amateur decoders that

159
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:11.930
they could find. They chose Mathematicians, champions,

160
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.710
people who could solve the Sunday Times crossword puzzle extremely fast.

161
00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.940
And they were all instructed to go to a set of buildings halfway between Oxford

162
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:23.430
and Cambridge. It was a place called Bletchley Park,

163
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.300
but the architect of the effort was really Alan Turing who was an odd kind of

164
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:32.160
Joyce because in many ways he was a very strange man. He was kind of paranoid.

165
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.300
I think there was clear,

166
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:38.301
I mean he had this system where his bicycle chain came off every certain number

167
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.620
of revolutions and uh,

168
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.070
he knew how many revolutions he was able to ride before the chain would come

169
00:09:44.071 --> 00:09:47.700
off. And it was, I think in order to stop other people from riding his bicycle.

170
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.070
But he was the one who again,

171
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:54.030
had a very typically tyring ish sort of breakthrough. He thought, well,

172
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:56.460
this code is generated by a machine,

173
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.900
therefore a machine can be built that will be able to break the code.

174
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.480
So he built this machine that was called the bomb and it was a [inaudible].

175
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.520
It was huge. It was the size of, of I, of a wall.

176
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.140
And it could try out all kinds of different solutions to this breaking the code

177
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:18.141
problem and tiering decided to focus this machine on one little Achilles' heel

178
00:10:18.391 --> 00:10:22.170
that he found in the code itself. At the beginning of a typical message,

179
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.100
a German would get on the machine and he'd have sort of habitual openings,

180
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.540
you know, phrases that were very,

181
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:30.720
very commonly used and the Germans were fairly unimaginative,

182
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.640
unimaginative at the start, like, you know,

183
00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.950
hi HIPAA or good morning or something.

184
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.020
Exactly how Hitler or the weather so high would be h. E. I. L.

185
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.410
They use your in.

186
00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.990
<v 7>Then they realized that they could actually crack the code because of this.</v>

187
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.870
I would say Mr People. Hell, the end of the war in Europe.

188
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.150
<v 5>When English realized that Alan Turing and his team had broken the code,</v>

189
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.420
did that make Allen turning into a superstar? I mean,

190
00:10:57.421 --> 00:11:00.390
did he get the greetings from the Queen? Not at all,

191
00:11:00.391 --> 00:11:02.640
because it was all top secret. What does that mean?

192
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:05.880
That King George didn't know volunteering or Winston Churchill didn't know.

193
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.020
Central certainly knew.

194
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:09.300
Churchill definitely took a particular interest in sharing and trains

195
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:12.050
transmissions. Oh, he did? Sure. Oh no, he's a war hero.

196
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.160
There's no question about that.

197
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:19.440
His contribution is of crucial importance in terms of turning the tide of the

198
00:11:19.441 --> 00:11:23.610
war in favor of the allies. And yet, as far as I'm aware,

199
00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:28.530
a Turing was never thanked or acknowledged for what he did.

200
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:33.540
If I were King George, I would like to sent him a little, um, and he didn't.

201
00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:39.050
Having defeated the enigma machine touring now goes back to his first love.

202
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.070
The touring machine.

203
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.630
Mathematicians all over the world are now building computers and big risks.

204
00:11:44.631 --> 00:11:46.400
Frigerators highs contraptions. Actually,

205
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.210
there was one at Manchester University where touring took a teaching job and the

206
00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:53.890
one there more than just math and the machine do all sorts of things.

207
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:57.940
I believe it could sing. I'm pretty sure he could sing. Um,

208
00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.010
God saved the king.

209
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.660
<v 7>Not very well. This is what it actually sounded like.</v>

210
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.210
It's not something you'd really want a much too.

211
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:11.980
<v 5>It was not the machine. The uttering ideally would have liked to build.</v>

212
00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:15.880
Touring had a bigger idea at this point, the idea of the thinking machine.

213
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.450
He really invented the field of artificial intelligence and was the first person

214
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:24.451
to hypothesize about whether a machine could actually be said to think and not

215
00:12:25.271 --> 00:12:26.410
just think that touring,

216
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:31.300
but maybe flirt with you a little bit or joke with you to have a ascension's

217
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.900
insight in electronic manufactured mind. And when people said,

218
00:12:34.901 --> 00:12:38.830
how would you know that mine was truly sentient? He said, just ask it,

219
00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:44.050
just ask it. Uh, can truly [inaudible]

220
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.070
well, it's not going to be ever that easy. But Turing did come up with a test.

221
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.660
It's a way to test whether a machine is doing something like thinking like human

222
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:57.670
thinking, what we now call the touring test.

223
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.820
We've described it on our show before, how we'll know this is from, um,

224
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:03.310
from the show. We called the talking to machine yet a person,

225
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.150
sit him down at a computer, have them start a conversation in texts. Hi,

226
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:11.470
how are you? Inter good. Pops up on the screen, sort of like Internet chat. Yep.

227
00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:14.770
So after that first conversation, have them do it again. And then again,

228
00:13:14.771 --> 00:13:17.320
you know, hi, hello, how are you? Et Cetera, back and forth.

229
00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:20.890
But here's the catch. Half of these conversations will be with real people.

230
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.900
Half will be with these computer programs that are basically impersonating

231
00:13:25.901 --> 00:13:26.734
people.

232
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.040
If you can put this thing behind a curtain and you talk to it and it convinces

233
00:13:32.141 --> 00:13:36.730
you that it's intelligent and, and alive and sentient than it is,

234
00:13:36.731 --> 00:13:40.000
what's the big fuss? But there was a big fuss. Um,

235
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.510
one second. A neuroscientist at the time,

236
00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.420
Sir Jeffrey Jefferson turned attorneys. It, how dare you.

237
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:51.150
No machine will ever think like a human right? Because no machine can feel it.

238
00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.640
We do it in all the ways we do pleasure at its success.

239
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:58.270
Grief when its valves fuse, be warmed by flattery,

240
00:13:58.271 --> 00:14:01.390
be made miserable by its mistakes. Be charmed by sex.

241
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:06.340
Be angry or miserable when it cannot get what it wants. Huh?

242
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.640
And Turing's response to that was, well,

243
00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:14.560
I can say the same thing to you. You know, I can say to you, Robert,

244
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.980
I don't know what's going on inside your brain.

245
00:14:17.981 --> 00:14:20.590
You tell me what you're feeling and what you're experiencing,

246
00:14:20.591 --> 00:14:21.730
but how do I know that? What your,

247
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.930
how do any of us know that any other human being is a human being?

248
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:28.550
<v 0>Touring is really one of the first to say.</v>

249
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.450
He's the first to say it's not just that I want to build a machine that can

250
00:14:32.451 --> 00:14:37.451
think it's that we are machines that think we are nothing more than flesh blood

251
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:44.120
neurons. We are just machines ourselves.

252
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:48.620
Just soulless biological machines. And this isn't a dark moment for him.

253
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:52.010
It's a moment of acceptance. Says Jana this time it's not about

254
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.530
<v 1>math or science, it's about something bigger.</v>

255
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:57.470
It's about the nature of the universe and our place in it.

256
00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.210
And according to David,

257
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.960
not only did touring feel like himself as kind of a machine,

258
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.970
he felt a kinship with all the thinking machines that would ever be manufactured

259
00:15:07.971 --> 00:15:10.730
in the future. All those mechanical minds,

260
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:13.280
he felt he had something in common with them

261
00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.310
<v 5>for touring the machines who are more likely to be victims,</v>

262
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:18.140
victims of prejudice,

263
00:15:18.141 --> 00:15:22.970
victims of injustice vis victims of people like Jefferson.

264
00:15:23.630 --> 00:15:26.900
Jefferson is saying to the machines, you don't think,

265
00:15:26.901 --> 00:15:30.440
because I say you don't think, and you know,

266
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.090
England was saying to touring,

267
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.630
you can't be what you are and we're going to change you.

268
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.380
<v 1>Which brings us back to where we started this show.</v>

269
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.050
It is now 1952.

270
00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.550
Alan Turing has been convicted of gross indecency, a crime punishable by,

271
00:15:45.551 --> 00:15:46.181
as we told you,

272
00:15:46.181 --> 00:15:50.590
a jail term or the court can order you to take a hormone injections.

273
00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.610
<v 5>And he was given a choice.</v>

274
00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:55.600
He could go to prison or he could be quote unquote cured.

275
00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.670
And the cure consisted of massive doses of estrogen.

276
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:04.180
<v 1>Nobody importance went and said to the judge, here's a character reference.</v>

277
00:16:04.181 --> 00:16:07.620
By the way, this guy won the world war that we just fought art.

278
00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:08.071
<v 5>Well,</v>

279
00:16:08.071 --> 00:16:12.050
I suppose you could say that they were cutting him a break by not sending into

280
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.750
prison by giving him this horrific,

281
00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.900
horrific alternative. What were the hormones supposed to do?

282
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.690
It was the crudest kind of pseudoscience.

283
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.720
There was some clap trap theory that homosexuality could be cured through

284
00:16:27.721 --> 00:16:30.420
injections of estrogen. Uh,

285
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.170
what it really did was it made him, uh,

286
00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:38.010
impotent and profoundly depressed.

287
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.140
He grows breasts. Um,

288
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:43.560
it certainly doesn't work to represses homosexuality.

289
00:16:43.561 --> 00:16:45.390
He's still vocally gay,

290
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:48.000
<v 1>but he's also worried that because he's now famously gay,</v>

291
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.220
his court case being in the papers and all that,

292
00:16:50.221 --> 00:16:55.010
everybody from now on will dismiss his ideas. Writing once to a friend.

293
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:55.500
<v 5>He said,</v>

294
00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:59.160
I'm a rather afraid that the falling cylinders and may be used by some in the

295
00:16:59.161 --> 00:17:03.600
future. Touring believes machines think touring lies with men.

296
00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:07.860
Therefore, machines do not think it is signed.

297
00:17:07.861 --> 00:17:09.300
Yours in distress, Allen,

298
00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:15.470
<v 8>the hormone treatments ended. He kept working, but his mood darkened.</v>

299
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:20.740
Turing's favorite film was Snow White and the seven doors and he particularly

300
00:17:21.171 --> 00:17:26.171
loved the scene where the witch dips the apple in the brew and she chants dip

301
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:30.620
the apple in the brew, let the sleeping death seep through.

302
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:34.580
One night in 1954 it was June 8th,

303
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:39.850
he was at home and at some point during that night he calls himself how he laces

304
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.180
and apple with cyanide and he bites from the poison apple

305
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:49.750
[inaudible].

306
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.320
<v 9>He left</v>

307
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.153
<v 8>no note.</v>

308
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:58.310
<v 1>55 years later, in 2009 the prime minister of Great Britain,</v>

309
00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.131
Gordon Brown,

310
00:17:59.131 --> 00:18:04.131
issued a formal apology to Alan Turing and in 2011 coming up on his hundredth

311
00:18:05.071 --> 00:18:05.904
birthday,

312
00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:10.560
23,000 people sent a petition to the British government asking that Alan Turing

313
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:15.240
be given a posthumous pardon for the so-called crime of moral turpitude.

314
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.460
In 2012 a government minister, Lord Tom McNally said, no,

315
00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.250
that we will not do. Here's the statement.

316
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:28.050
A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly

317
00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:31.050
convicted of what was at the time a criminal offense.

318
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.980
He would have known that his offense was against the law and that he would be

319
00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:35.814
prosecuted.

320
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:46.580
<v 8>It's an amazing life and I'm in awe that anybody could have accomplished quite</v>

321
00:18:46.711 --> 00:18:50.370
as much as he did and suffered as much as he did.

322
00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:55.260
It's almost overwhelming, but when I think about it,

323
00:18:55.290 --> 00:19:00.290
here's a piece of what Alan Turing thought up that just hurts a little,

324
00:19:00.811 --> 00:19:01.560
at least me,

325
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.560
this idea that machines can one day become in effect,

326
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.100
our equivalent.

327
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:15.100
<v 4>This is still such a powerful and emotional question for us to deal with.</v>

328
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.400
And I guess we're still divided between people who think that would be kind of a

329
00:19:21.741 --> 00:19:26.240
cool thing and people who think that'd be a horrible thing. And um,

330
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.490
the people who think it would be a horrible thing.

331
00:19:28.491 --> 00:19:33.491
I guess I was feel that way partly because it makes us feel kind of bad about

332
00:19:34.371 --> 00:19:38.690
ourselves. You know, we, because we aren't, we aren't,

333
00:19:38.691 --> 00:19:42.600
there's nothing magical about us if we're just machines

334
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.750
falling on one side of these lines. Are you saying, well,

335
00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:51.760
I think what I'm willing to say is I think we're just machines and I think we're

336
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.270
just made of matter.

337
00:19:53.271 --> 00:19:57.830
I'm sorry to be giving religious opinions here because these are religious

338
00:19:57.831 --> 00:20:00.410
opinions, but for me,

339
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.000
that doesn't make me feel that we're any less special at mics.

340
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:10.420
I think what a wonderful thing that a collection of matter created by a process

341
00:20:12.321 --> 00:20:14.900
of evolution that lasted billions of years.

342
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:20.260
How wonderful that this process and that these little collections of matter are

343
00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:26.630
able to produce saisons watercolors and box preludes.

344
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:28.850
Uh, I can live with that.

345
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.033
<v 1>Could you,</v>

346
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:35.310
if I built you a computer that could create equally beautiful watercolors

347
00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.500
and equally beautiful musical compositions,

348
00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:44.200
would you feel happier or diminish?

349
00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:49.030
<v 4>I mean, I think in a way you're asking if you see how the trick is done,</v>

350
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.990
does it then vanish? Does it just become a trick?

351
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.370
The trick being a great painting or a great piece of music?

352
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.140
Um,

353
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:04.140
I feel the art I love is always art that I don't fully understand.

354
00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:08.170
There's some mystery there always.

355
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.380
I don't quite fathom it now.

356
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:16.381
So if the computer is churning out a bunch of notes and you know exactly what

357
00:21:19.151 --> 00:21:23.440
the rules are that the computer is following and there's no mystery,

358
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.520
how can that possibly be a great piece of music?

359
00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.720
And the answer is we don't know how the computer is going to do it.

360
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.060
We don't know how the machine is going to do it.

361
00:21:34.061 --> 00:21:39.061
And when the machine produces music that is as lovely as the music that you and

362
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:41.884
I love,

363
00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:48.700
I believe it will still be unfathomable.

364
00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.040
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

365
00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:02.780
<v 8>James Glick is the author of the information.</v>

366
00:22:02.781 --> 00:22:06.290
It's a book about information theory in artificial intelligence.

367
00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.400
David Levitt has a book called the man who knew too much.

368
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.020
It's a biography of Alan Turing,

369
00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:16.490
and Jan 11 has a novel about turning and Kurt Goodell, another mathematician.

370
00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:20.210
She calls her novel, and it's, it's quite something to actually,

371
00:22:20.211 --> 00:22:23.030
so it's kind of odd, but anyway, it's called a mad man.

372
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.900
Dreams of turning machines. Jad we'll be back soon.

373
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.780
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab.
