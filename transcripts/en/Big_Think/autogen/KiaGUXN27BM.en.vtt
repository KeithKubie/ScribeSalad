happen that the new president will
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.830
happen that the new president will
arrive and I expect that the new

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
arrive and I expect that the new
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.900
arrive and I expect that the new
president will face some dramatic tests

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910
president will face some dramatic tests
 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.170
president will face some dramatic tests
there that that will be more likely to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
there that that will be more likely to
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.670
there that that will be more likely to
be true if it's Hillary Clinton than if

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
be true if it's Hillary Clinton than if
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.080
be true if it's Hillary Clinton than if
it's John McCain and more likely again

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
it's John McCain and more likely again
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.669
it's John McCain and more likely again
to be true with Barack Obama than

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679
to be true with Barack Obama than
 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.810
to be true with Barack Obama than
Hillary Clinton but there'll be some

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
Hillary Clinton but there'll be some
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.310
Hillary Clinton but there'll be some
dramatic tests to take the measure of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320
dramatic tests to take the measure of
 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.400
dramatic tests to take the measure of
this person and I think that there one

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
this person and I think that there one
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.380
this person and I think that there one
and that test is as likely to Iraq

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
and that test is as likely to Iraq
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.660
and that test is as likely to Iraq
arrived in Iraq as anywhere else and I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
arrived in Iraq as anywhere else and I
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.490
arrived in Iraq as anywhere else and I
think that test is going to persuade the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500
think that test is going to persuade the
 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.729
think that test is going to persuade the
new president that they have to they

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
new president that they have to they
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.380

trends in Iraq are more positive than
they have been for some time and if that

they have been for some time and if that
 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.750
they have been for some time and if that
trend continues and the next president

beginnings of a success I mean it'll be

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
beginnings of a success I mean it'll be
 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.539
beginnings of a success I mean it'll be
up to that President to continue the

up to that President to continue the
 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.270
up to that President to continue the
success and make it a success if as that

under different circumstances a long
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.819
under different circumstances a long
time ago and had we you know that

you the gases would have covered the
range anywhere from 15,000 to 40,000 I

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
range anywhere from 15,000 to 40,000 I
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990
range anywhere from 15,000 to 40,000 I
don't think anybody would have imagined

don't think anybody would have imagined

the highest estimate I've heard for the
 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.810
the highest estimate I've heard for the
cost of the Iraq war comes from an

and he says if you add up all the costs

and he says if you add up all the costs
plus the future medical and then add to

plus the future medical and then add to
