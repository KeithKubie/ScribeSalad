ANTOINE BELLO:
Thank you, Olivier.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.910
Thank you for giving me the tour
of the premises here in Paris.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.880
I was very impressed,
but I guess

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.350
I don't have to tell you that.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.530
I visited the Google campus
in Mountain View in California

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.680
and I have to say this one is
just as nice, if not nicer,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.860
because it has this
Parisian cachet that they

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.630
don't have in California.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.350
So kudos, guys.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.260
It must be super
nice to work here.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.290
Thank you for having me.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.850
The truth might not exist, but
I know that you guys at Google

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.580
look very hard for
it so this should

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.070
make for an interesting
conversation.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.270
Bear with me a moment.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.290
I would like to take you
on a journey in the quest

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.530
for the elusive truth.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.960
So we start our journey
in a small town courtroom

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.430
where a man is tried for
the murder of his wife.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.210
According to the prosecutor,
he killed her in cold blood

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.370
at night in their home.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.550
Everything seems to be
stacked against him.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.110
He had money problems.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.340
His rich wife threatened
to divorce him.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.210
He had a mistress.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.640
And jurors have been discussing
his fate for three days now,

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.220
and in a matter of
minutes they will

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.710
return to the courtroom
with the verdict

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.990
and they will tell
us, at last, what

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.500
happened on that fateful night.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.410
And the journalists, of
course, are fretting.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.300
At last we're going to
know the truth, they say.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.040
The truth.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.640
There could hardly be
a less accurate word

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.990
to describe what's about to
unravel, for the man will

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.410
initially be sentenced
to 30 years in jail

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.430
but will appeal the
judgment and receive

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.780
a much lesser sentence of five
years the second time around,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.500
because the cold blood
murder will have turned

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.560
into an unfortunate accident.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.390
The cold-hearted
killer will have

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.450
been demoted to a clumsy
and temperamental husband,

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.890
and in a matter
of months, justice

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.160
will have spoken two
different truths.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.400
As hard as it is to admit,
we'll never know for sure

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.830
what happened on that night.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.540
Who should we believe?

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.130
Should we believe
the husband who

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.980
swears that he pulled
the trigger by mistake

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.690
and claimed that his
wife used to make

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.120
him beg for pocket money?

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.330
Or should we believe
the prosecutor

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.750
who invokes premeditation
and portrays the victim

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.330
as a humiliated woman?

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.780
Even facts don't
help us that much.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.930
The man's fingerprints were
found on the rifle's trigger,

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.490
but it doesn't prove anything.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.792
It doesn't prove that he
pulled it in cold blood.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:09.750
He could have stumbled.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.880
Maybe he was
provoked by his wife.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.560
We'll never know.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.890
Even the accused doesn't
know anymore, for reasons

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.440
that we will discuss later.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.620
OK.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.980
So at this point, we have
established that journalists

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.130
have a tendency to speak
a little bit too casually

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.020
about the truth, but
this is hardly a scoop.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.720
Journalists are not alone.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.330
We all have a strange
rapport with the truth.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.550
Simply put, we tend to confuse
the truth with reality.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.340
Reality is what is.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.530
It is unique and
can be expressed

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.600
in purely factual manner.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.750
The shot was heard at 10:43 PM.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.620
The shooter was within
six feet of the victim.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.260
$1,000 were withdrawn
from the joint account

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.570
on the day of the murder.

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.220
That's reality.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.480
But truth?

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.120
Truth doesn't exist,
or rather, there

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.269
are an infinity of truths
depending on who you ask.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.570
If you believe the
prosecutor, the man

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.710
calmly took aim at his wife
and put a bullet in her gut.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.810
But if you ask the
defense attorney,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.870
his client was nervously
clenching the trigger

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.600
and the gun
accidentally went off.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.870
Those affirmations posing
as truth are nothing

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.880
more than interpretations, the
expressions of subjectivity,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.900
or, to be more
provocative, just fictions.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.960
For 15 years, I've been
trying in my novels

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.910
to explore the reasons why
we confuse fiction and truth.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.840
I will share with you some of my
findings, and as you will see,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.560
they have a lot to do with
the way our brain works.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.060
Let's start at the beginning.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.770
What separates man from animal?

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.070
Some people will tell
you that conscience does,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.260
others that it's language.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.620
For me, the answer is stories.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.540
The Homo sapiens has always
produced and consumed

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.160
an astounding
quantity of stories,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.190
from the inhabitants
of the caves of Lascaux

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.810
to the clients of Netflix
who binge on TV series.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.360
But luck has no
place in evolution.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.860
If the frequency of a hereditary
feature increases over time,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.380
it is because it
improves the survival

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.930
prospects of the species.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.830
Modern man being the result of
millions of years of evolution,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.090
if we keep telling stories, we
must derive benefits from it.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.680
Which benefits?

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.720
I see two main ones.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.870
First, unlike animals,
we have the ability

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.190
to believe in inter-subjective
realities, such as nations,

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.440
church, or money.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.480
As Yuval Harari
explains in his book,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.080
"Sapiens," you will never
take a banana from a monkey

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.130
by telling him he will
get 100 in the afterlife.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.460
We humans buy into
those stories.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.400
They enable us to create
larger and more complex

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.560
societies than animals.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.960
Once you've reached the
threshold of a few hundred

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.780
individuals, you
need glue to maintain

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.610
the cohesion of the group.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.530
Stories are that glue.

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.030
The second advantage of stories
is of greater concern to us.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.100
To use a simple analogy,
stories are a life simulator,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.920
comparable in
principle to the flight

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.860
simulators on
which pilots train.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.560
The anecdotes that
pepper our conversations,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.150
the books we read,
the movies we watch,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.450
prepare us to the situations
we will encounter,

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.270
sparing us costly
mistakes and giving us

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.500
the opportunity to live
hundreds of lives at once.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.430
Before a teenager says, "I
love you" for the first time,

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.930
he or she has experienced
hundreds of love stories

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.730
by proxy.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.550
The soldier about
to be deployed knows

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.570
what to expect thanks to "Saving
Private Ryan" and "Full Metal

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.040
Jacket."

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.880
And all husbands know the
risk of an extramarital affair

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.162
after they have seen
"Fatal Attraction."

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.130
Because we consume
so many stories,

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.570
our brain has gotten used to
connecting facts in that form.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.950
The following example comes from
my novel, "The Showrunners."

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.600
Let's say you get on to a
train and walk to your seat.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.750
The ticket inspector
stands next to a passenger,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.560
a young backpacker with a
three-day stubbled beard.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.500
The young man is
searching his pockets.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.690
You don't really pay
attention to the scene

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.750
until the next day when
a friend of yours talks

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.590
about the cost of fraud
in public transportation.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.550
You then share with him
the episode you witnessed.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.790
I intentionally use
the word episode,

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:20.120
for your brain will have
organized this handful of facts

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.520
in a cohesive story with
a beginning, a middle,

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.890
and an end.

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.050
It will play
something like this.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.290
The train inspector asked
to see everybody's tickets.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.419
The backpacker didn't have one.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.490
The inspector wrote
him up a ticket.

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.390
The backpacker dug in
his pockets for money.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.860
Now please consider the
number of implicit assumptions

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.480
in this scenario.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.850
A man with a blue
shirt and a cap

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:49.580
is automatically
a train inspector.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.820
A backpacker is a natural
candidate for fraud,

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.930
and anybody with their
hands in their pockets

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.490
has to be searching for money.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:00.980
I'm sure you realize
that this scene offers

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.750
several other explanations.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:06.640
Maybe the train inspector
had finished the service.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.270
He was headed to the restaurant.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.330
His son, who was
traveling with him,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.870
was giving him money
to buy a sandwich.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.940
Or the inspector
wrote up a ticket

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:22.340
to an old lady who gave
him a 100 Euro banknote,

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:27.020
and the inspector
asked other passengers

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.790
to help him with the change.

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.310
Those would be
possible scenarios.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.610
Of course your scenario,
the initial scenario,

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.920
is by far the most likely.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.080
But that's exactly my point.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.720
From the moment that
a likely scenario

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.870
takes shape in your brain,
it becomes a certainty.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.190
You're convinced you
witnessed a train inspection.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.000
Scratch that.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.070
You witnessed a
train inspection.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:53.990
The story has become a fact.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:57.140
Fiction has become reality.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:00.380
Just to be sure, you will
have retained no other memory

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.910
from this train ride.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.110
You walked up the aisle.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.790
A backpacker had no ticket.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.400
That's all you'll
remember in a week or two.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:13.370
At the time, though, you had
noticed a few other details--

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:17.000
a scarred man in
uniform, newspapers

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.010
cramming into the trash can.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.740
Those details vanished
almost immediately,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:28.460
dispelled by other equally
insignificant details.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.720
You forgot them because they
weren't part of a story.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.660
Which leads us to another
function of stories.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.120
They are mnemonic devices.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.720
Because it's easier to remember
the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.040
5 than 5, 3, 2, 1, 4,
our brain provides us

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.050
with the illusion of an order by
positing a chronology or causal

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.760
links that do not exist.

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.410
That's how a woman walking down
the street at 8:00 AM holding

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.870
the hand of a young
girl with a backpack

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:04.010
automatically becomes a mother
taking her daughter to school.

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:05.960
If you have taken
one of those tests

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.710
where you have to commit to
memory as many random objects

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.290
as possible in a
limited time, you

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:16.580
know the secret is to weave the
objects into a little story.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.090
That's exactly the same point.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.790
Recent discoveries
in cognitive sciences

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:25.220
have shown that we
have two selves.

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.960
The first one feels.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.970
The second one
narrates and gives

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:31.310
meaning to what we experience.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:35.060
The first one feels a stinging
pain in your index finger.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.040
The second one
says, oh, you just

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.950
burned yourself by taking
a dish out of the oven.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.280
Our memories are stories too.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.200
We tend to think
that our brain stores

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.680
memories like YouTube videos
you can replay on demand.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.520
That would be nice.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.650
Big market for you.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.410
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:00.340
Sounds, pictures,
smells, emotions

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:03.670
are stored in different
areas of your brain.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.920
When you're about
to tell an anecdote,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.155
you summon all these
memories and hastily craft

00:12:09.155 --> 00:12:13.990
a speech based on who you
talk to and how long you have.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.720
The first times you
tell the anecdote,

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.670
your story is still fluid.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.260
You experiment with words.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.030
You try variations.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:26.260
Over time, however, your
story tends to solidify.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.680
You use the same adjectives
over and over again.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.550
You make the jokes that you
know will get you the laughs.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.100
The final version
usually has little

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:42.790
to do with the
original one, which

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:47.680
doesn't prevent you from being
100% sincere when telling it.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.440
In "The Showrunners,"
again, a character

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.820
called Vargas asks the
hero, Sliv, to share

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.760
with him a personal memory.

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.210
Sliv, who lost his father to
a brain tumor when he was 10,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.510
chooses to recount the last few
weeks of the [? diseased. ?]

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.290
How his dad repainted
the yard fence because he

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.290
wanted to leave a
clean house behind him.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.560
How every morning he would
recite the first verses

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.980
of the saga of Erik
the Red when shaving

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.710
to check that his
memory was still intact.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.200
How he died on the
gloomiest of days

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.920
with all the lights in the
house turned on despite the fact

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.960
that it was noon.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.690
"What a beautiful
story," commends Vargas.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:33.760
"Too bad it isn't true."

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.400
And Sliv takes offense,
as you probably would,

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.320
of Vargas's insinuations.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.570
It's the most painful
episode of his life.

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.290
Why would he make any
of those details up?

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.570
But Vargas seems pretty adamant.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.750
He insists that Sliv compare
his memories with those

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.230
of other members of his family.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:56.230
So Sliv flies to Iceland
to confront his mother,

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:58.270
and much to his
surprise, he discovers

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.010
that Vargas was right.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.850
Sure, Sliv's father
repainted the fence,

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:08.740
but he did it two years prior
to being diagnosed with cancer.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.810
He didn't recite the Saga of
Erik the Red in the morning.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.180
He didn't know one
verse of poetry.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.520
And Sliv's mother remembers
that the sun was shining when

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.830
she closed her husband's eyes.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:23.410
"How can one die on
such a beautiful day?"

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.870
she remembers
thinking at the time.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.620
Sliv and his mother have
lived through the same scene,

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:36.340
but they've each come away
with a different interpretation

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.300
of that day.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:40.150
Once again, one
reality has given birth

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.230
to two different truths.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.430
So memories are stories.

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.440
History, with a capital
H, is a story too.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.810
Take the example of jazz.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.210
Encyclopedias will
tell us that jazz

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.700
is in African-American
music, a mix of gospel,

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.900
blues, and of the songs
that the slaves used

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.210
to hum in the plantations.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:07.720
Some sources also mention the
role played by the Jim Crow

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:13.030
laws in the 1890s that increased
segregation in the South

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.790
and led African-American
musicians to regroup

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.860
in small bands.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:19.480
At this stage of
my presentation,

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.210
though, I hope you
realize that all this is

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.990
pure speculation,
a ludicrous attempt

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.960
to connect independent facts.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.630
Just as we established the
difference between reality

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.960
and truth, we need to understand
the difference between the past

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.490
and history.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:38.840
The past is what
really happened.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.320
It is a fact that
African-American slaves

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.980
used to sing gospel at the
end of the 19th century.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.560
It is a fact, too, that
the parliament of Louisiana

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.950
passed a particular law in 1892.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:54.070
Yet making those
events milestones

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.970
in the birth of a movement, one
we'll arbitrarily call jazz,

00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:00.250
is telling a story,
like gathering

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.420
beads of various colors and
sizes to make a bracelet.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.360
The truth does not exist.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.610
It is constantly
being recreated.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.420
You know the saying, history
is written by the victors?

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.280
This is so accurate.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.800
Imagine what our children
would be learning in school

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.260
if Hitler had won World War II.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.750
It would read something
like, "The biggest benefits

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.580
of the war is to have
rid us of the Jews,

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.360
a harmful and
despicable race which

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.750
used to control all the levers
in international finance."

00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:34.510
No comment.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.310
If you start paying
attention, you

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.490
will notice that stories
are everywhere-- in manuals,

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.310
in our memories, in
religion, in current events,

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:44.650
and even in science.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.080
This might come as
a surprise to you.

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.300
In science?

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.740
But of course.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.450
For centuries the
Earth was flat.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.160
Then it became round.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.980
Then it started to
revolve around the sun.

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.990
Every time the followers
of the old theory

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.740
called the new theory a hoax,
and every time the disruptors

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.020
thought they had revealed
the laws of the universe

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.130
and believed they would
never be supplanted.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:10.510
Copernicus was right to
claim that the Earth revolves

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.760
around the sun, but
he wrongly assumed

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.520
that the Earth followed
a circular trajectory,

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.720
while in fact it's elliptical.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.260
Copernicus's mistake
was pointed out

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.810
and rectified by
Galileo and Newton, who

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.589
then made other mistakes.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:27.609
It's the nature of the
scientific process.

00:17:27.609 --> 00:17:30.580
Some of the theories our
children learn in biology class

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.530
today would have been
deemed heretic 30 years ago.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.170
Which leads me to an
obvious observation.

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:40.840
Theories are stories too.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.590
Let's take the example of the
Big Bang, the massive explosion

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.640
that gave rise to the universe
some 14 billion years ago.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:53.500
As I speak, there are about 100
theories about the Big Bang.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.520
Most of them come from
phonies, but 10 or 12

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.210
emanate from highly
distinguished astrophysicists.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:05.080
Since only one of these
theories, at most,

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:09.200
can be correct, it means that
all the others are stories.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.290
I can't think of a better
word to describe them.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.390
Stories.

00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:17.050
Stories crafted in good faith,
but stories nonetheless.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.470
Besides, and I will push the
envelope a little bit here.

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:25.820
Besides, even if one of these
theories turned out to be true,

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.300
I would personally still
consider it a fable.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.880
If there are
scientists in the room,

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.270
and I bet there are today,
they must think I'm crazy.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:39.100
Newton's Law of Universal
Gravitation is not a fable.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.900
Yet I persist.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:45.190
Granted, objects are attracted
toward the center of the Earth,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.310
but when Newton attributes
this phenomenon to a force

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.250
equals gravity, I
personally attribute it

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.160
to the god, Gravitor,
who punishes

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:58.870
men for Icarus's arrogance
by pinning him to the ground.

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.780
Moreover, I'm sure you
know that Newton's theory,

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.010
though it accurately predicts
the movement of asteroids,

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.690
it's useless to
predict the movement

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.990
of very small particles,
which means it is wrong.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.880
I'm not worried.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.590
Someone will improve on it.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.990
Every story displaces
the previous one.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:20.350
There was a time when the
universe was 6,000 years old.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.900
Then it was 100 million
years, then a billion.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.099
We currently stand at 14.

00:19:25.099 --> 00:19:26.140
Why should we stop there?

00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.980
So now you might wonder--

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.850
I wonder that
question all the time,

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:37.530
especially since my job is
to craft good stories when

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.000
I write books--

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.310
what makes a story powerful?

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.530
The stories we're
talking about, they

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.810
conform to the
laws of Darwinism.

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.550
Only the best stories survive.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:52.860
One day, one year, centuries
for the most robust ones.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.580
As a rule of thumb, art
is stronger than reality,

00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:59.100
myth are more
resistant than fables,

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:03.870
and religions have a thicker
skin than political ideals.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.770
But why is it that some stories
withstand this test of time

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.290
while others are soon forgotten?

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:13.710
In other words, what
makes a story powerful?

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.400
It is a subtle alchemy,
the miraculous combination

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.320
of eternal ingredients--

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.030
mankind's biggest
myth, of course,

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.250
but also local cultures and
the spirit of the times.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:28.410
Take, for instance,
the movie "Titanic"

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:33.330
and see how many timely
themes it calls upon--

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:39.870
the hubris of man, true love,
impossible love, class warfare,

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.540
and so many others.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.360
Every country has their
own prism through which

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:46.900
they see the world.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.660
Americans, for
instance, can't get

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:50.730
enough of superhero stories.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:54.780
Think Batman, Spiderman,
X-Men, and you can name

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.410
probably many, many others.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.650
This taste for superheroes
has several roots--

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:03.240
the protestant belief
in predestination,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.330
the myth of America
as the promised land,

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:10.560
and, last but not least,
a die-hard [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.320
For many Americans, the
world is fundamentally

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.400
the place where the good
and evil battle it out.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.730
As George W. Bush put it when
he was trying to recruit allies

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:24.540
before invading Iraq, "You're
either with us or against us."

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:30.720
We, the French, have a
fondness for have-nots and

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.060
underprivileged characters.

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:36.720
Mexicans are suckers for
a good revenge story.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.590
The Japanese can't resist
a tale of heroic sacrifice.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.640
Once in a while, a story
arises that transcends

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.550
ethnical and religious
divides and reminds us

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:49.650
that we belong to
a greater whole,

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:51.690
a bit like the
brother and sister who

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:56.160
bury the hatchet the day when
they step into a new school.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.520
Space travel, or first contacts
with alien civilizations,

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.470
are among the truly
universal themes.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.200
So what we called the
truth does not exist.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.570
Most of the time, it's only a
shortcut, an interpretation,

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.070
a story something
is trying to sell us

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.990
or one we're trying
to sell to ourselves.

00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:20.950
You might wonder whether
being aware of it

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.870
has changed my behavior.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.550
It has.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:28.690
First, I don't fall as
blindly for my own tales.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.840
Every time it's possible,
I go back to the facts.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.140
I don't ignore my
emotions, but I

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.590
try to understand
where they come from.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:41.320
In a way, I try to separate the
feeling me from the narrating

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:41.920
me.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:45.700
Very important to know which
one is talking at the moment.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.030
Second, I can tell when
the person speaking to me

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.060
is making up their own truth,
and surprisingly, this often

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.220
triggers a rush of
empathy towards them.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:00.540
Third, I'm wary of the
simplistic messages

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:04.470
of political leaders, large
corporations, intellectuals,

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:06.600
and generally speaking,
all the people who

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.130
claim they hold the truth or
even a fragment of the truth.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:15.300
And last, I support
all attempts to rise

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.240
above the very notion of truth.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.640
From that perspective,
no project

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.820
is more admirable to
me than Wikipedia.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.350
I'm sure you know and use
it as an encyclopedia,

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:31.830
but Wikipedia is
much more than that.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:36.480
It is, in my eyes, a tool
to get closer to the truth.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:41.160
As you well know, any user can
create and modify an article

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.960
without any
credentials and without

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.700
any technical knowledge.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:49.210
Some articles get modified
dozens of times in a day.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:52.830
Let's take, for instance,
the page of George W. Bush.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:57.510
Bush is, to use a euphemism,
a controversial figure,

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.350
a hero to some and a
numbskull to others.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:05.640
Yet his Wikipedia page
is remarkably balanced.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.020
Why is that?

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:11.580
Because by nature Wikipedia
doesn't tolerate extremism.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.390
Try to write, "Bush is a
moron," and your contribution

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:18.120
will be overturned immediately.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.350
But write that "One of
the reasons Bush ignored

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:26.100
the intelligence reports
of his own administration

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.600
is that he was surrounded by
neoconservative advisors who

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.090
wanted to restore American
military supremacy

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:37.410
in the Middle East," and you
will last a little bit longer,

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:41.010
because somewhere in Texas,
a die-hard Republican will

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.170
be going over your
lines, looking

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:46.350
in vain for a good
reason to reject them.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.070
From the confrontation
of your two brains,

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.240
a new formulation will arise.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:53.640
It will not be the
truth, since remember,

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.600
the truth does not exist.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.570
But it would be a
start, a first step

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:00.120
toward the construction
of a representation

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.150
acceptable by all or nearly all.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:04.564
Thank you.

00:25:04.564 --> 00:25:09.534
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.184
AUDIENCE: Maybe I can
ask the first one.

00:25:20.184 --> 00:25:20.975
ANTOINE BELLO: Yes.

00:25:20.975 --> 00:25:22.660
AUDIENCE: Hopefully
I'll inspire others.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:27.070
So with that premise,
how do you live your day?

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.600
It seems like everything
you're saying makes sense,

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.180
and yet we must carry on.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.430
You probably have
your own beliefs.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.280
How do you make sense of
your intellectual stance

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.230
on the issue of truth,
but then decisions

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.900
you make about what you
do with your day, what

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.080
you make of current events?

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:46.540
ANTOINE BELLO: I'm extremely
skeptical of current events.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.730
I read several newspapers.

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.870
The founding experience for
me was when I moved to the US

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.460
in 2002.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:59.680
It was at the time when
Bush was building up

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.290
his coalition to invade Iraq.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:05.950
And in France, when I
used to live in France,

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.930
I would read "Le
Figaro" and "Le Monde"

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:10.420
and I thought I was
pretty well-informed.

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.130
And I arrived in
the US and I started

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.546
to read the "New York Times"
and the "Wall Street Journal"

00:26:14.546 --> 00:26:19.030
and, oh my god, this is a
completely different story.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:22.120
This story has just nothing
to do with the French one.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:25.300
And that, I think, for me it
was a formative experience

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.350
because I started to realize
that it's all our perception.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.080
It has to do with our
country, with our religion,

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.440
with our culture, with, you
know, they are Protestant,

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.910
we are Catholic.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.260
They practice religion.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:38.980
We don't.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.280
They have a certain
vision of the Middle East.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.340
We have a totally different
one, for historical reasons.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.590
And instead of being--

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.930
you can get stuck
there and say, OK,

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.090
there is no reason
to do anything,

00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:57.490
because I could read the
papers from the other country

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:03.920
and that would completely
negate my reasoning.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.310
But I think it's the opposite.

00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:11.680
You try to go on with your
day knowing that everything

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:14.920
around you is competing
stories, stories competing

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:20.470
for your attention, stories
competing for your addition,

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:24.370
and you don't have to
be a prisoner to that.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.920
You can see that, with
a bit of perspective,

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.190
a bit of a grain of
salt, and I think

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:35.080
that makes you a happier man,
a freer man, that's for sure.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.900
It might be a little bit
challenging sometimes.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.540
You said, you must have
beliefs like anybody.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.010
Of course I have beliefs.

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:44.920
I think the key is to know
when your beliefs are beliefs

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.340
or when your beliefs are
certainties or truth.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.700
It's not the same thing.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.620
I don't mind having beliefs as
long as I can keep telling they

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.690
are beliefs and not
everybody shares them.

00:27:58.841 --> 00:27:59.674
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:05.494 --> 00:28:06.160
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.530
Thanks for the talk.

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:11.750
Are you not concerned that by
preaching about there not being

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.600
any truth, that
everything is stories,

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.000
you could be discouraging
people from learning?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.640
And for a pragmatic
example, let's

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:21.990
take an example from nutrition.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.280
There will be people
who will be saying,

00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.490
oh, for every paper that says
that coffee's good for you,

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.070
there's another that says that
it's bad for you, so I give up.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:30.140
I will not educate myself
because there is no consensus

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:30.729
to be found.

00:28:30.729 --> 00:28:32.270
Even if there is a
consensus and they

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.810
could have healthier
lives, [INAUDIBLE] there

00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:37.469
is some truth to be learned.

00:28:37.469 --> 00:28:39.260
ANTOINE BELLO: That's
a very good question.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:49.227
I have four kids, and
when they were babies,

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.060
there was the question
of should we lay them

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:56.100
down lying down on the back
or lying down on the belly.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.800
And this is funny,
because you read

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.080
a book that was written 20
years ago, it was one way,

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.390
and now it's the opposite.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.850
And oh my god, you could
be endangering your kids

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.250
if you lie down on the belly.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:09.900
But that's what our
parents have done.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.480
Oh yes, but they were
taking such risks.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.950
They didn't know it
at the time, but--

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.820
and what's funny is that
10 years down the road,

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.690
it's going to be the opposite.

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:25.020
In some instances, on
some particular facts,

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.270
there seems to be so
much flip flopping

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:32.910
that I can't fathom how people
can still be serious about it.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:37.620
I think if I was a pediatrician
I would tell my patients,

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.250
yes, right now we say that
you should lay them down

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:43.140
on the back, but honestly
we don't have a clue.

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.320
This could change.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.030
So if you have to
choose, choose the back.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:50.580
Maybe a 60% chance.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.000
I would be honest about it.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.520
But I think I would
lose a ton of patients.

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.360
It's not the right way to do.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:03.810
Our system, in a way, is
geared toward more conviction,

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:07.770
more beliefs, people affirming
their beliefs even more.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.410
And I would say
probably the less sure

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:13.300
they are about their beliefs,
the more they affirm them.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:18.160
And that's something that, to
me, that's extremely worrisome.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:23.520
So what I tell my kids today,
for instance, about nutrition

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:32.010
or about other
subjects, is study.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.220
Get your facts together.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.960
Try to develop an opinion.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.180
Confront your
opinion with others.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.230
Remember it's an opinion.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.935
Remember it's a way
of articulating facts.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.940
It's the image that I
used earlier in the talk

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:55.200
when I said it's about picking
beads from various sizes

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.470
and colors to make
up a bracelet.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.870
You have different points.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:04.170
You think you have the one
path that unites them all

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.950
and you're saying that
this is the truth.

00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:06.658
Well, guess what.

00:31:06.658 --> 00:31:08.730
There are many ways
to unite all those.

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.680
You could be doing like this.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.140
It would be a completely
different idea,

00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:20.550
but it wouldn't be less
structured an opinion.

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:26.550
So no, it's still possible
to live with this belief

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:28.143
that stories are everywhere.

00:31:33.950 --> 00:31:35.440
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.740
So I had an anecdote to start.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:42.720
Back in, I think, 2005, I was
living in Asia at the time,

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:47.810
and I went to the island
of Sumatra in Indonesia.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:51.000
And at that time that island
suffered, over two years,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.160
I think, both a
massive earthquake

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.690
and a tsunami, two
natural disasters

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.010
of quite big proportions.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:04.080
And the local newspaper
reported a story

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.970
that a certain
party of I would say

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:12.090
fundamentalist Islamic
people were explaining

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.370
to the population
that the reason why

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:17.310
these disasters happened
was because they had been

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.060
bad Muslims and they
hadn't really followed

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.160
the rules of their religion.

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.460
And to my absolute
huge surprise,

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.420
I heard that this political
party was actually

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:35.550
gaining a lot of traction, were
actually showing up as likely

00:32:35.550 --> 00:32:37.800
to win the next elections.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.060
So my question to
you would be this.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.780
This is obviously a
story and not the one

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:48.630
that I would have
invented for myself.

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:51.360
Though I think that there had
been two disasters in a row,

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:55.710
I would not have
attributed that to a god.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:33:00.840
But do you think
that some stories

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.610
have a higher value than other,
or are better than others?

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:03.890
ANTOINE BELLO: Of course.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:06.030
AUDIENCE: Do you think it's
possible to create a hierarchy?

00:33:06.030 --> 00:33:06.630
ANTOINE BELLO: Of course.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:07.570
Of course.

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:10.380
If it were not, I guess I
wouldn't be doing this job.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:15.990
I wouldn't have been
an entrepreneur before.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:20.880
I would be a prophet or
I would be evangelizing

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.470
these very credulous people.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.830
Of course there is a hierarchy.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.260
I have the utmost respect
for the scientific process,

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.110
for the scientific profession.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.740
We need people to keep working
on the edge of the universe.

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:43.680
We need people to keep working
on the trajectory of asteroids.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.690
We need that.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.960
They give us
invaluable information,

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:51.940
and that information, once we
have it, we cannot forget it.

00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:54.460
We cannot pretend
that it doesn't exist.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:34:01.420
So everything we know about
climatology, for instance,

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:05.040
tells us that there is a very,
very, very low probability

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.210
that those two catastrophes
that you mention

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:13.739
were caused by the behavior of
some Muslim people somewhere

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:15.750
in Sumatra.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.530
So I attach a very,
very, very low proportion

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.280
to that probability.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:29.179
Yet what I think is crucial is
to know that some people pin

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:31.730
a pretty high probability
to that scenario,

00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:33.139
and we live with those people.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.360
We share the same world.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.612
And it can be a bit
scary sometimes,

00:34:38.612 --> 00:34:40.820
but it's not something that
you can afford to forget.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:51.409
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:54.234
[INAUDIBLE] I think we moved
to the US at the same time.

00:34:54.234 --> 00:34:55.150
ANTOINE BELLO: Really?

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.483
AUDIENCE: The war, [INAUDIBLE],,
to have a French accent

00:34:57.483 --> 00:35:00.430
was a horrible time, to have
a French accent in New York

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:02.050
or Miami.

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.510
You were saying that--

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:06.130
my question is,
what worries you?

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.402
Because [INAUDIBLE] and I agree
with you, but what worries you?

00:35:09.402 --> 00:35:11.860
Because we are in this society
that we have all more access

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.400
to information, so we can
check different stories

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.100
and bring our own truth.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:19.910
But also, everybody
has an opinion,

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:24.640
so even anybody can do a YouTube
video and explain dumb stuff

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.110
and have a follow-up.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.690
So my question is,
what worries you

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.880
and what do you think
will be a solution on top

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.501
of better education, et cetera?

00:35:32.501 --> 00:35:34.792
Could you say it worries you
that we live in this world

00:35:34.792 --> 00:35:35.292
right now?

00:35:43.215 --> 00:35:44.840
ANTOINE BELLO: From
the top of my head,

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.920
intolerance is the one thing
that worries me the most.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:57.110
It's the reason why I commit
so much for Wikipedia.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:36:02.080
I've been a strong supporter
of Wikipedia for years now.

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:06.520
I think they do an excellent
job and a very important job

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.780
at disseminating information,
and disseminating information

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:15.620
that has managed to
build a consensus.

00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.790
And that, to me, is
absolutely crucial.

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:23.560
And it's not a coincidence if
Wikipedia is banned in China,

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:29.680
is banned in Turkey, was
sometimes banned in France.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.060
Would you believe it?

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.160
Certain articles were
blocked in France,

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.139
which is no longer possible.

00:36:36.139 --> 00:36:37.930
Wikipedia has changed
the way they operate.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:41.350
Now you have to ban
the entire site.

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:45.370
You cannot ban only a
selected few articles.

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:51.250
So intolerance
obviously scares me.

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.550
And intolerance, I think--

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:57.160
what scares me is
people, what they

00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:02.530
call the useful idiots or the
people who think they know,

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:05.260
they think they are
in control, and they

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.730
should be the one admitting that
they know very, very little.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.920
Citizens who don't inform
themselves, for instance,

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.100
who don't do their job.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.560
I think citizen is a job.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.910
Citizen is not a right.

00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:18.220
Well, it is obviously
a right, but it

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.610
comes with duties
and responsibilities.

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:24.580
Going to vote without
doing your homework, to me,

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.480
is a betrayal of
the democratic pact,

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.150
and it is a betrayal
that many, many people

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.580
are guilty of today.

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.310
So that worries me.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.560
AUDIENCE: First of all, I never
realized that storytelling

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.110
was so pervasive.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.090
Maybe a lot of you
are similar to me,

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:55.690
but I have a longtime
friend that we've

00:37:55.690 --> 00:38:01.060
known for several years and
who consistently tells stories.

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:07.540
We've stuck with him
throughout-- a lot

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:09.940
of people, when they meet
him, they kind of find

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.210
it kind of comical.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.220
We call it giving
him an 80% discount,

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:18.400
because we know that
probably his story started

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:23.170
with a fact somewhere, but then
he added 80% to 90% of a story

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.840
on top of it.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:28.780
My question is, because
we have discussions

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:34.570
amongst friends about, should
we try to intervene and get him

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:35.860
some help?

00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.100
Because it affects
his personal life.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:43.510
Most people are not attracted
to a person where they obviously

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:51.550
are telling stories that are
obvious stories all the time.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.560
Or should we just leave
it, because his ego

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.440
is now all caught up.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.160
He believes his own
stories, of course,

00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.490
so his ego is all
caught up in the stories

00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:04.870
that he's fabricated on this
fictional life, essentially.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:05.935
So it's a complex issue.

00:39:05.935 --> 00:39:07.310
I just wanted to
see if you had--

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.800
ANTOINE BELLO: How old is he?

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.590
AUDIENCE: He's in his mid 40s.

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:14.980
ANTOINE BELLO: My last book,
the one that some of you

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.620
have in front of them,
[SPEAKING FRENCH],,

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.430
is about a pathological
impostor and his relationship

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:25.030
with his psychiatrist, and
the way this relationship

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:29.380
develops over the years,
over the decades, even.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:33.940
I've documented myself
quite a bit for that book.

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.920
I've read a lot about
pathological liars

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:38.320
and imposters.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.940
My experience-- the take
away from my reading

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:44.150
is that you won't change him.

00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:45.340
He's too old.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.900
He's too old.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:51.190
If someone maybe had attracted
his attention earlier

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:54.580
and had showed him exactly
where he had derailed

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:58.940
and the impact and the damage
it could do to his entourage,

00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:03.310
maybe you would have been able
to put him back on tracks.

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:06.190
But I don't really believe that.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:09.970
Even in his 20s it would have
been difficult. In his 40s

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:11.465
he's probably a lost cause.

00:40:11.465 --> 00:40:12.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:14.430
I kind of share that
opinion as well.

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.930
Thank you.

00:40:17.435 --> 00:40:19.060
AUDIENCE: There's a
question over here,

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.737
but it could come
back to me after.

00:40:22.737 --> 00:40:23.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:24.780
Thanks [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:29.830
So it was just about democracy,
because [INAUDIBLE] before.

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:32.450
So democracy writes
their own stories,

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:35.495
and they are very [INAUDIBLE]
against the stories

00:40:35.495 --> 00:40:36.870
by extremism.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.389
And I just want to know
what you think about that.

00:40:39.389 --> 00:40:40.430
ANTOINE BELLO: I'm sorry.

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.900
What I think about what?

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.950
AUDIENCE: About this,
I think democracies

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.649
have [? a hard ?] time to
write compelling stories.

00:40:46.649 --> 00:40:47.440
ANTOINE BELLO: Yes.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:50.220
AUDIENCE: Compared to the
stories made by the extremism.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:54.170
ANTOINE BELLO: OK.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:55.980
I get the question.

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:57.410
I'm not really sure about that.

00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:00.710
Probably the best
story about democracy

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:03.170
is the American story.

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:05.090
They did a pretty good job.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.800
They did a very, very good job.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:10.460
The house up on the hill
and the promised land

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.800
and the Constitution,
the Founding Fathers,

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:18.080
all that wisdom pouring into
the country; a text that

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:25.730
has withstood the test of
time; the justices that

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:29.780
can tell the law once
in a while when need be;

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:33.600
the president, the
checks and balances--

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.240
it's a very, very good story.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.860
I live there and I base
in that story every day,

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:44.420
and I have to say, as a
storyteller, everyday I think,

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:45.687
they're pretty good.

00:41:45.687 --> 00:41:46.520
They're pretty good.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:57.170
Yes, the fascist
regimes, for instance,

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.020
have different stories and
can have compelling stories

00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:03.680
if you are in the right camp.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.970
If you're not one of
the Jews or homosexuals,

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.130
I guess you might
like that story.

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:12.690
Some people don't.

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:16.470
But those stories, honestly,
I'm not sure they're that good.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:20.010
I mean, when you think about
the national socialism,

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.930
it lasted for only
10 years, 12 years.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:26.990
Communism is almost--
well, I won't

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:32.540
say forgotten, but
except for Venezuela

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:37.370
and I won't say
China, but it has

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:42.060
disappeared from almost
everywhere in the world.

00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.330
It's what I was trying to say.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.350
Religions usually last much
longer than political ideals.

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:55.130
Political ideas pass much
more quickly than we think.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:42:59.070
Yes.

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:03.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
sharing your story about truth

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:04.230
and its non-existence.

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:11.090
I also admire Wikipedia
a lot, and you

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:13.320
said it's a place
that helps people

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.060
as they move to better
stories, you might say,

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.220
or stories that are more useful.

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.307
So Wikipedia is
built on a governance

00:43:20.307 --> 00:43:21.390
which is really effective.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.220
People can bring ideas.

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.450
They can bring
credibility and expertise

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:27.720
and there's a whole
bunch of mechanisms

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.222
that help that process.

00:43:30.222 --> 00:43:31.680
That sort of
governance seems to be

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.220
important to allow stories to
get better and to be explored.

00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:39.330
Where are some other
places in which governance

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.409
exists that you admire and
respect of that nature,

00:43:42.409 --> 00:43:44.700
whether it's in the pursuit
of better stories or better

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:45.540
institutions?

00:43:50.722 --> 00:43:52.680
ANTOINE BELLO: First, a
side note on Wikipedia.

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.580
The governance is much
lighter than you think.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.980
For instance, the credibility
of the person who writes

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:01.260
is never taken into
account, and you

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.870
would think, oh my god,
that's how you end up

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:05.700
having so poor pages.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.000
But that's quite the opposite.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.710
People who don't feel empowered
to write about the subject

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:12.781
simply don't.

00:44:12.781 --> 00:44:14.280
And I can tell you
on the other end,

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.040
I've tried to rectify
something on my Wikipedia page.

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.620
I was banned from it.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.600
You would think
that you know best.

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:24.660
No, you don't.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:27.690
Because maybe, Mr. Bello, you
have a problem with the truth.

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:36.120
Maybe your memories
were a story as well.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:41.430
So I'm not sure I really
see that type of governance

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:45.030
anywhere else or I
admire it anywhere else.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.150
What I see is that large
companies like yours

00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:53.190
are trying, at the moment, to
get to something like that.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.580
Facebook is trying very hard
with their tens of thousands

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.880
of fact checkers.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:06.312
And Google, you have a
lot of processes in place,

00:45:06.312 --> 00:45:16.290
the right to be forgotten
and you can report bad pages

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:22.800
or you can report every time you
suspect a scam or an operation

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:27.840
to increase the search
engine ranking of a page.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.730
You can alert Google to it.

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.770
I think that's pretty powerful.

00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:34.080
It's only the beginning, though.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:38.280
And your company, probably,
among all the others,

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.400
probably has the
biggest responsibility.

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:44.190
If I remind correctly,
the goal of Google

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:49.330
was to organize all the
information around the world.

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:49.830
Wow.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.300
That's a tall order.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.302
You'd better get it
right for our sake.

00:45:54.302 --> 00:45:55.510
AUDIENCE: It's not just that.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:59.420
It's also to make it universally
useful and accessible,

00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:01.670
and that question of universally
useful and accessible

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:05.310
is obviously a question which
involves multiple perspectives.

00:46:05.310 --> 00:46:07.920
ANTOINE BELLO: Yes,
exactly, and I'm not--

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.220
for instance, there is
this debate right now

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:14.490
about should Google go back
to China, for instance,

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:17.790
and tailor the search
engine to the needs

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.790
of the Chinese government.

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:24.540
I follow this debate and
I find it fascinating,

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.330
to be honest, because I don't
have the answer to that.

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.940
There is a part of me who
says, no, of course no.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.500
Don't go to China.

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.610
They banned Wikipedia.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:38.400
Why would Google go and get in
bed with the Chinese leaders?

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:44.150
And at the same time
I have to think,

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:48.030
a search engine that would
do 99% of what Google does

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.190
in the rest of
the world would be

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:51.990
a nice service to
the Chinese people

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:55.945
and would accommodate,
like you said,

00:46:55.945 --> 00:46:58.800
their vision of the world
which is not the same as ours,

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:03.000
and ours is not better.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.920
So it's typically the type of
subjects where I am divided

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:12.300
and I refrain from
the temptation

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.290
of judging too quickly.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.640
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.297
AUDIENCE: Two more
questions, please.

00:47:19.297 --> 00:47:20.380
ANTOINE BELLO: Over there.

00:47:27.565 --> 00:47:29.490
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:32.890
I'm curious in the idea
of bringing this consensus

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:37.240
to the political area
to explain my point

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.760
and to ask your opinion.

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:43.130
Some democracies that try
democracy by consensus,

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:45.250
it brought some
weaknesses to them

00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:48.310
because it takes time and
effort and it's easier

00:47:48.310 --> 00:47:52.410
to be quick and not
make the efforts.

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:54.787
Do you have an opinion
on that or do you--

00:47:54.787 --> 00:47:55.870
ANTOINE BELLO: Not really.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.480
It would be a stretch to say
that I have an opinion on that.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.070
I lived in Japan for a while.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:02.830
I lived in Japan for a
year and a half in the '90s

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:09.550
and I was extremely impressed
by their governing by consensus.

00:48:09.550 --> 00:48:11.320
It was extremely
impressive, the way

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:16.630
they were able to raise the
age of retirement at the time

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:21.740
without any dissent, without
anybody taking to the streets.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:26.410
It was a lesson to me
in reason and democracy.

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:28.690
At the same time,
I know it comes

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.930
with plenty of inconvenience.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:35.620
Like you said, the democratic
process in Japan is slow.

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.780
Political parties
and politicians

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:43.900
are corrupted and can be easily
bought, from what I hear.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:46.440
So I won't make it an example.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:49.590
But no, I don't have a
firm opinion on that.

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.960
AUDIENCE: Last question.

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:55.126
AUDIENCE: One last question.

00:48:59.914 --> 00:49:00.455
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:00.455 --> 00:49:02.880
Thank you for the talk.

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.140
I was curious what's your view
on artificial intelligence

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.770
and the evolution of
that technology based

00:49:09.770 --> 00:49:13.706
on the fact that more and more
we'll be using data provided

00:49:13.706 --> 00:49:16.970
by, or information provided by
machines, as the truth somehow.

00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:19.490
ANTOINE BELLO: I'm so interested
by artificial intelligence

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:21.680
that I wrote a whole
novel about it.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:24.421
It's called "Ada,"
A-D-A. It's the name

00:49:24.421 --> 00:49:26.670
of an artificial intelligence
developed in the Silicon

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.900
Valley, not far
from Mountain View.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.400
In Mountain View,
actually, I think.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.070
No, in Stanford.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:36.450
And that gets stolen.

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:40.850
And the program gets stolen,
disappears from the hard drive,

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:45.260
and the question is, now we have
this program out in the open,

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.420
what will anyone do with it?

00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:48.625
What will it do with itself?

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:54.950
My role as a writer is
not to provide answers.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:58.260
I think it's to ask the
questions in an elegant manner.

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:03.770
So I think that's what I
tried to do in "Ada," explore

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:08.310
all the possibilities offered
by artificial intelligence.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:10.100
And there are
many, but of course

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:16.620
reminding the reader of all
the risks that go with it.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:20.180
And there is no real conclusion
at the end of the book.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.010
I think any
conclusion would have

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:30.125
been a usurpation of my powers
and privileges as a writer.

00:50:30.125 --> 00:50:30.958
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:36.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you, everyone.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:37.990
So I think it's the end.

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.740
ANTOINE BELLO: OK.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.695
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much, Antoine.

00:50:40.695 --> 00:50:41.570
ANTOINE BELLO: Merci.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:45.520
[APPLAUSE]
