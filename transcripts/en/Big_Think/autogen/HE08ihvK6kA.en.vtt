to say if if not dead it's on life

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170
to say if if not dead it's on life
 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.080
to say if if not dead it's on life
support you know it's this idea that if

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090
support you know it's this idea that if
 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.390
support you know it's this idea that if
you do well you can get ahead in life

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400
you do well you can get ahead in life
 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.640
you do well you can get ahead in life
and if you have family and kids they can

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650
and if you have family and kids they can
 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.890
and if you have family and kids they can
perhaps do a little bit better than you

perhaps do a little bit better than you

did and what we know by the numbers is

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789
did and what we know by the numbers is
 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.079
did and what we know by the numbers is
that the median wages in this country

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:23.089
that the median wages in this country
 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.929
that the median wages in this country
haven't budged meaningfully in nearly

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939
haven't budged meaningfully in nearly
 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.880
haven't budged meaningfully in nearly
forty years and yet the cost of living

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890
forty years and yet the cost of living
 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.329
forty years and yet the cost of living
has increased by some counts by up to

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:31.339
has increased by some counts by up to
 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.970
has increased by some counts by up to
thirty percent so there's a sense that

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980
thirty percent so there's a sense that
 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.340
thirty percent so there's a sense that
people are working hard but only a small

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350
people are working hard but only a small

lucky while everybody else is really

lucky while everybody else is really
 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.479
lucky while everybody else is really
staying in place and you know I think

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489
staying in place and you know I think
 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.799
staying in place and you know I think
that we have the power to change that

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809
that we have the power to change that
 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.869
that we have the power to change that
that's the key idea that I talked a lot

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879
that's the key idea that I talked a lot
 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.450
that's the key idea that I talked a lot
about in the book is that we've created

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460
about in the book is that we've created
 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.310
about in the book is that we've created
an economy that is structured this way

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320
an economy that is structured this way
 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.610
an economy that is structured this way
we made specific decisions around how to

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620
we made specific decisions around how to
 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.819
we made specific decisions around how to
encourage automation globalization and

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829
encourage automation globalization and
 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.930
encourage automation globalization and

the rise of Finance that have created a
 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.990
the rise of Finance that have created a
small group of very lucky people and we

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000
small group of very lucky people and we
 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.490
small group of very lucky people and we
have the power to change it to make sure

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500
have the power to change it to make sure
 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.109
have the power to change it to make sure
that economic prosperity is much more

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119
that economic prosperity is much more
 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.810
that economic prosperity is much more
broadly shared so I know when it comes

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820
broadly shared so I know when it comes
 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.429
broadly shared so I know when it comes
to the position that we're in now I

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439
to the position that we're in now I
 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.380
to the position that we're in now I
don't think it was one single moment or

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390
don't think it was one single moment or
 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.510
don't think it was one single moment or
one single event that got us here I

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520
one single event that got us here I
 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.980
one single event that got us here I
think instead it was the collection of a

think instead it was the collection of a
 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.960
think instead it was the collection of a
lot of different decisions that began to

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970
lot of different decisions that began to
 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.080
lot of different decisions that began to
be made in the late 1970s in early 1980s

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090
be made in the late 1970s in early 1980s
 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.789
be made in the late 1970s in early 1980s
and we've continued to make in fact all

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799
and we've continued to make in fact all
 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.469
and we've continued to make in fact all
the way up through for instance the end

most important things we've consistently
 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.179
most important things we've consistently
lowered tax rates on corporations and

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189
lowered tax rates on corporations and

fundamental worker protections to make

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009
created the opportunity for companies
 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.249
created the opportunity for companies
like Facebook and Google and many others

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259
like Facebook and Google and many others
 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.059

the
positive things that come with that

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360
positive things that come with that
 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.470
positive things that come with that
growth have not been evenly distributed

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480
growth have not been evenly distributed
 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.660
growth have not been evenly distributed
a small group of people are doing

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670
a small group of people are doing
 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.570
a small group of people are doing
extremely well and at the same time as

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580
extremely well and at the same time as
 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.370
extremely well and at the same time as
everybody else is trying to make ends

everybody else is trying to make ends
 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.140
everybody else is trying to make ends
meet and just as we had the power to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150
meet and just as we had the power to
 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.360
meet and just as we had the power to
create the economy in this current

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370
create the economy in this current
 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.980
create the economy in this current
configuration I do believe we have the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990
configuration I do believe we have the
 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.140
configuration I do believe we have the
power to change it there's been debate

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150
power to change it there's been debate
 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.540
power to change it there's been debate
for decades about whether trickle-down

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550
for decades about whether trickle-down
 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.990
for decades about whether trickle-down
economics is it's the way to go and we

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000
economics is it's the way to go and we
 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.580
economics is it's the way to go and we
could talk a lot about economic theory

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590
could talk a lot about economic theory
 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.110
could talk a lot about economic theory
but in some ways I don't think we really

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
but in some ways I don't think we really
 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.340
but in some ways I don't think we really
have to we can just use a little bit of

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350
have to we can just use a little bit of
 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.140
have to we can just use a little bit of
common sense if you put a hundred

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150
common sense if you put a hundred
 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.130
common sense if you put a hundred
dollars in the pockets of someone who's

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140
dollars in the pockets of someone who's
 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.470
dollars in the pockets of someone who's
working hard to make ends meet

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480
working hard to make ends meet
 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.060
working hard to make ends meet
they're gonna spend a lot of that money

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070
they're gonna spend a lot of that money
 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.980
they're gonna spend a lot of that money
most of that money on things like child

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990
most of that money on things like child
 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.500
most of that money on things like child
care housing health care wherever their

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510
care housing health care wherever their
 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.200
care housing health care wherever their
bills are the highest you give someone

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210
bills are the highest you give someone
 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.090
bills are the highest you give someone
who's in the 1% an extra hundred bucks

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100
who's in the 1% an extra hundred bucks
 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.550
who's in the 1% an extra hundred bucks
that might spend one or two but the vast

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560
that might spend one or two but the vast
 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.020
that might spend one or two but the vast
majority of that money is going to get

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030
majority of that money is going to get
 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.440
majority of that money is going to get
parked in a bank account and not really

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450
parked in a bank account and not really
 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.080
parked in a bank account and not really
become part of the productive economy so

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090
become part of the productive economy so
 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.870
become part of the productive economy so
one study by the Roosevelt Institute

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880
one study by the Roosevelt Institute
 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.460
one study by the Roosevelt Institute
showed that if you provided five hundred

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470
showed that if you provided five hundred
 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.700
showed that if you provided five hundred
dollars to every American every month it

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710
dollars to every American every month it
 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.050
dollars to every American every month it
would increase gross domestic product by

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060
would increase gross domestic product by
 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.000
would increase gross domestic product by
about seven points over the next eight

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010
about seven points over the next eight
 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.410
about seven points over the next eight
years so this idea is not just about

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420
years so this idea is not just about
 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.660
years so this idea is not just about
making sure that that the wealthy pay

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670
making sure that that the wealthy pay
 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.600
making sure that that the wealthy pay
their share it's also about creating a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610
their share it's also about creating a
 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.210
their share it's also about creating a
kind of broad-based prosperity that's

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220
kind of broad-based prosperity that's
