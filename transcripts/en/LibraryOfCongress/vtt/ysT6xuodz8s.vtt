&gt;&gt; Peter Vankevich: Well,
it's been a long day

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.200
and what a beautiful, wonderful
day it has been certainly

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.750
in our fiction stage here.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.860
So Ron Charles, book critic

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.430
for the Washington Post
Style section is here

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.100
and he will start taking over
with introductions for Ms. Meg.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.840
OK. Welcome.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.540
First, a word of
thanks to our cochairman

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.970
of the festival David Robinstein

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.860
and other generous sponsors
who've made this event possible.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.540
If you'd like to add
your financial support,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.060
there's a note in the
program, please seek that out.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.270
We'll have some time after this
conversation for your questions.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.580
And I've been asked to remind
you that if you come to one

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.600
of these microphones, you will
be included in the video tape

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.640
of this event in the
library's permanent collection.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.470
So keep that in mind if you
don't want to be recorded.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.510
My guest today is Meg Wolitzer.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.160
[ Applause ]

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.080
The author of "The Ten-Year
Nap" and "The Uncoupling"

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.450
and "The Interestings" and more.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.660
But I want to talk and
we will talk about the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.960
"The Female Persuasion".

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.420
But first, I want to
talk about "The Wife".

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.720
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Oh yes.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.120
"The Wife".

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.420
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: My cousins.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.910
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Well,
this came out 15 years ago

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.600
and now we're all
talking about it again.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600
It must be incredibly exciting.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.120
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yes, I
brought a sort of show and tell.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.840
So this is the movie tie-in
addition which is very exciting.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.870
And I went and looked
it up on Amazon.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.110
It's number one in movie
tie-in editions, so very proud.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Starring
Glenn Close.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.710
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Starring
Glenn Close and Jonathan Pryce.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.080
And I have to say--
I mean, I'm prejudice

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.380
but they're incredible.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.680
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.980
I mean people are
talking about Oscars.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.280
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yes.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.880
Now, this is very,
very exciting.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.180
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
It's very exciting.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How did
the project come about?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.780
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Well,
so I wrote this novel.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.080
It came out in 2003.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.830
And the wonderful screenwriter
Jane Anderson got involved

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.280
at some point not
too long after that.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.110
And she had a lot of
trouble getting it made.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.380
It was hard getting a
male star who wanted

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.190
to play this real jerky guy.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.610
And it was-- the movie
was called "The Wife".

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.910
Not only that.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.280
So that was sort of difficult.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.590
But suddenly, things got moved

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.460
and Glenn Close got
attached to it.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.570
And she's-- I have to say
she's really brilliant in it.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.870
She's wonderful in it.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.810
Please go-- Oh excellent.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.650
And it got a great review in
the Washington Post which --

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.950
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.250
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: -- made
me very, very happy.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.660
But it's been really--
having a movie made is sort

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.960
of the icing on the cake.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.660
It's like I came up with
those character's names.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.360
Why are famous movie stars
saying them out loud?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So did you
get involved in the script?

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.630
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: No.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.110
You know, somebody-- I had
a book turned into a movie.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.310
It was the first film
that Nora Ephron directed,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.070
"This is My Life" long time ago.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.210
And I was interviewed for
it, and somebody said to me,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.250
"Aren't you afraid what they're
going to do to your book?"

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.620
And I said, "My book
is on shelf.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.130
They're going to do what they
do but my book doesn't change."

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.600
So I try to sort of leave the
writer to do what she does.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: But
what's it like?

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.200
You're sitting in a dark room

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.500
and you're seeing these
characters you created

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.800
up there come to life.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.310
What does it feel like?

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.610
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
Well, it's really fun.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.900
I mean, it's-- and when
your name gets up there,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.290
it's kind a like you
kind of look down shyly.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.510
You know, it's tremendous
because writing is so solitary.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.690
I mean I'm basically mostly--

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.170
like writers are so excited
when we get to go somewhere.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.340
Like coming to the National
Book Festival is sort

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.390
of like a dog being taken for
a ride in the car [laughter].

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.140
I mean, I am usually at
home in a big t-shirt

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.480
that says ultimate
Frisbee or something on it

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.350
that I don't play and I don't
know where it came from.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.990
When you get to go somewhere,

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.060
it's just really,
really thrilling.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.280
So having a movie made is just--

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.300
it's dreamy and it's
not solitary.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.600
That's the thing.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.700
When you go to the set of a film
or a television show that's made

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.120
of you, like, they
have to be nice at you.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.310
They take you to the
table craft services

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.070
where the food is and feed you.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.780
But the idea of being with
people that there is a group

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.020
of people involved with
making something is

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.580
so different is the
opposite of what I really do

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.440
because I'm just by myself,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.040
talking to myself
in my apartment.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Has there been
some exciting Hollywood moments?

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.230
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: In other
people's lives [laughter]?

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.100
Yes, there are a lot.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.970
Well, the new book,
"The Female Persuasion",

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.290
Nicole Kidman is
attached to star.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.770
So that was really fun.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.620
But this is like when
you're writing a book,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.920
you don't think about
any of this.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.880
For me, people say do
you picture who's going

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.600
to play these parts
and of course, no.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:36.900
It's a book it's not a movie.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.410
I kind of think that my
characters are sort of like,

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.690
you know, if you watch
a reality TV show

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.590
which I've heard some people do.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.010
If you want a reality TV show,
the people who don't want

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.310
to be photographed

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.900
in the background have
their faces blurry.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.150
That's how I picture
my characters.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.520
I don't quite see
their faces but I know

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.100
who they are very deeply.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Let's talk
about "The Female Persuasion".

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.920
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Sure.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.550
Now, it's about bright, young
college student named Greer

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.850
who has a chance encounter

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:07.300
with a feminist icon
woman named Faith,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.320
a kind of glorious item
figure who changes her life.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.330
And your timing feels uncanny.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.630
When did you start this?

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.820
Was it long before the
Me Too Movement or?

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.850
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Around the
time I got that crystal ball.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.150
Yeah. I started it years ago.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.620
I mean somebody asked me in
an interview, did you write it

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:28.010
after the Me Too Movement?

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.860
It was like I would have to have
gotten a lot of people together

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.350
in a room and I would have
said you take this chapter,

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.650
you take that chapter.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.420
Yeah. Because the ideas
in this book are--

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.250
I mean, ideas around
female power and mentorship

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.270
and misogyny and making
meaning in the world are things

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.920
that I had just been
thinking about forever

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.220
and I think probably most

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.520
of us have been thinking
about forever.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: They're
all new problems though.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.680
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Well,
we're in a weird moment--

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.980
When the book came out,

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.000
it was sort like a
game of musical chairs.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.500
You know, it happened to
come out in this moment.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.100
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: But it was a
time that people we're talking

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.530
in a new way or in
a heightened way

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.830
about so many of these issues.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.500
So I certainly had
something to say.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did the book
change as you were writing it,

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.020
as you responded
in your own life

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.320
of what was happening
in the world?

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.720
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: The only
thing that I went back

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.770
and changed really was
the last chapter because--

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.860
I mean, have some of you
read "The Female Persuasion"?

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.160
Oh, thank you.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.000
I'm going to have to ask
the rest of you to leave.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This is for those people
who've read it, just for us.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.920
So the book is about
a famous feminist,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.280
as Ron said, in a younger woman.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.420
It's about the person you might
meet who changes your life,

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.570
who sees something in you, a
mentor, this famous feminist

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.400
who sees a very shy college
student and helps her.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.240
I imagined when I was
writing this book that we--

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.150
that when it came out, we would
have the first woman president

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:52.450
as president.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:54.840
And as some of you may have
heard that didn't happen.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Spoiler alert.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:57.790
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: I
know, I hate that.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.280
Don't you hate when
people do that?

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.020
I often find-- here's
a big parenthesis.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.790
I often find that when I'm
talking to a group of people

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.130
and some have read a
book and some haven't,

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.000
you have to thread this needle.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.240
So that you don't bore the
room nor do you ruin things--

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.840
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: --
for the rest of them.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.140
It's very, very difficult to do.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.310
But I finished the book
and I felt not quite right

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.610
about how it ended it.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.450
And I asked my editor if I
had a little time to go back

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.890
into the last chapter.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:28.590
And I wrote a last chapter
that kind of goes forward.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.600
It goes into the future to
a moment when maybe it's not

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.000
that sometimes things are
a little better for women

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.300
and sometimes they're
a little worst.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.180
Sometimes maybe the
tablecloth gets rip out from

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:43.110
under everything like
in that magic trick.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.330
And I wanted to kind of speak
to the future a little bit.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.880
So I did go back and
add a last chapter.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Now, you said

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.050
about the major themes
is female mentorship.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.920
Were there women like
that in own your life?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.400
Was there a mentor in your life
that made a big difference?

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.700
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.000
There were a couple.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.300
I'll mention two.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.600
One is my mother.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.100
My mother is a novelist
Hilma Wolitzer and she's 88.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.510
And she's just amazing.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.050
She started publishing
in the '60s.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.740
And for her first short story
which to give you a sense

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:16.070
of her mindset at the time.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.010
She was a housewife
in the suburbs.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.350
Her book-- Her story was called

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:21.670
"Today a woman went mad
in the supermarket".

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.930
And I'm telling you, she
would have gotten mad

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:26.230
if she hadn't start writing.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:30.630
Something happened to me when
I gave a reading some years ago

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.660
that I put in my novel "The
Interestings" in a kind

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.400
of slightly different form.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.070
I was at a reading and
I gave a Q&amp;A afterward.

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.560
And a woman stood up said
my daughter really wants

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:43.350
to be a playwright but I know
how I incredibly hard it is

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:46.210
for any one, a woman,
or anyone to make it.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.510
What should I tell her?

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.000
And I said well is she
talented and she said yes.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.100
And I said and is she
burning to do this.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.420
And she said yes.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:57.720
And I said well, I think you
should tell her that's wonderful

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.910
because the world will
whittle your daughter down

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.820
but a mother never should.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.120
And my mother never did.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.200
And I think that's
partly why I'm here.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.510
So she is the one person
because I think of that as sort

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.930
of feminism in action.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.160
But the second person is Nora
Ephron who I mentioned earlier.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.170
She's somebody who--
We became friends

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.360
after she directed the
film based on my book.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.770
And she was somebody
who you always wanted

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.310
to show your book to-- well,

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:25.360
I always wanted to
show my book to.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.000
She was someone whose
opinion I valued,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.180
who is opinionated
and very, very funny.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.420
And she actually-- I think
one thing that she gave is--

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.170
well, I talk in the
book about those people

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.470
who give you permission.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.010
Do you know-- Do you have
people like that in your life

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:43.420
that you meet when you're young

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.200
and maybe they give you
permission to be a certain self?

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.060
I kind of was afraid of being
funny, that it wasn't serious.

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:52.580
And Nora was funny and serious.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.650
And there was a little line that
I put in this book and I thought

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.610
about how maybe I wouldn't
have written it if not

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.250
for Nora's encouragement
or enjoinment

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.050
of certain jokes that I did.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:07.790
There was a moment where Greer
when she's in school as a child,

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:10.530
she's sort of stuck with
the weird girl in the class,

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.920
and they're sitting under the
whiteboard eating Pringles.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.220
And the weird girl says
to her, "Do you ever think

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.320
about murdering our teacher?"

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.840
No, actually no.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.140
I got it wrong.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.160
"Do you ever think about
poisoning our teacher?"

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.620
And Greer says no.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.200
And the girl goes,
yeah, neither do I.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.260
And I thought that that's humor.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.990
That it's not there just for the
sake of itself, but it's there

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.850
to show something
about a character

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.700
and the way the other
character interacts with her.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.570
And it's worth putting in
even though it stops things

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:43.870
for a moment.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.320
You get something of
the writer's sensibility

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.140
and you get more of
the character's world.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Could
you read a bit for us?

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.600
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Sure, it
will cost you but yeah.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:59.740
Yeah, I'll just read
the opening.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.810
"Greer Kadetsky met Faith
Frank in October of 2006

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.660
at Ryland College, where Faith
had come to deliver the Edmund

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.080
and Wilhelmina Ryland
Memorial Lecture.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.790
And though that night the
chapel was full of students,

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.950
some of them boiling over
with loudmouthed commentary,

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:20.340
it seemed astonishing but true
that out of everyone there,

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.330
Greer was the one
to interest Faith.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.100
Greer, a freshman then at
this undistinguished school

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:30.810
in Southern Connecticut, was
selectively and furiously shy.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.010
She could give answers
easily, but rarely opinions.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:37.150
'Which makes no sense, because
I am stuffed with opinions.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.960
I am a piñata of opinions,'
she'd said to Cory during one

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.950
of their nightly Skype sessions

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.300
since college had
separated them.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.440
She'd always been a tireless
student and a constant reader,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.020
but she found it impossible to
speak in the wild and free ways

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:53.440
that other people did.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.000
For most of her life it hadn't
mattered, but now it did.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.300
So what was it about her

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.950
that Faith Frank
recognized and liked?

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:04.010
Maybe, Greer thought, it was
the possibility of boldness,

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:07.240
lightly suggested in the streak
of electric blue that zagged

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:12.190
across one side of her otherwise
ordinary furniture-brown hair.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:15.820
But plenty of college girls had
hair partially dipped the colors

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.780
of frozen and spun treats
found at county fairs.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:23.870
Maybe it was just that Faith,
at 63 a person of influence

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:27.090
and a certain level of fame who
had been traveling the country

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:30.510
for decades speaking
ardently about women's lives,

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.940
felt sorry for 18-year-old
Greer, who was hot-faced

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.250
and inarticulate that night.

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.960
Or maybe Faith was automatically
generous and attentive

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.460
around young people who were
uncomfortable in the world.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.940
Greer didn't really know
why Faith took an interest.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.320
But what she knew
for sure, eventually,

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.310
was that meeting Faith Frank
was the thrilling beginning

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:51.610
of everything.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.790
It would be a very long time
before the unspeakable end."

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:57.250
So that's just the beginning.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.510
Thank you.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:03.730
[ Applause ]

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Tell
us about this title

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.370
and its Jane Austen echo.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:08.670
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Oh
my god, you're right.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:09.970
No, I did know.

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.730
I did think of that.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:14.530
Wasn't there a Monty Python

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.370
with a guy whose name was
somebody smokes too much?

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.740
And somebody said oh people must
say things too all the time,

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.190
it's like what do you mean?

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.990
Yes. I love-- I like
declarative titles.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.790
I love that there is a little
Austenian thing in there.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.400
But also it sounds
to me like the title

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.810
of a feminist nonfiction book
from the old days, doesn't it,

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.110
because it's a little bit
sort of the feminine mystic.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:44.710
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: It
just got those qualities

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.010
and the word persuasion.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:48.390
There's a pun in the title
too because it's really

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:52.970
about those people who persuade
us, who teach us and who we want

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.320
to be like in some way.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.620
So that's all part of it.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I
was so fascinated

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.420
by the way novel explores
tensions not between men

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.400
and women but between women
within the feminist movement--

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.700
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- between
different generations

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.300
of that movement.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:07.600
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah, it was--

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.020
my last novel, "The
Interestings" was

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.400
about everybody who
was exactly my age.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.010
Because I'm really bad at math,
so it made it so easy to sort

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:19.220
of say that year,
she was, you know,

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.720
I knew what I was
doing that year.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.180
It was easy.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.350
But this time around,
it was really

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:27.860
about two generations talking
to each other and I got to think

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.040
about my own becoming
a feminist.

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.870
When I was a kid, I was

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:37.870
in a consciousness racing
group that we started.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.050
And we rode away to the
National Organization

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:42.260
for Women asking for
a list of topics.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:46.300
And they sent us things like
orgasm and you when we wanted--

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.600
when your mom won't listen.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:52.910
I mean we were so young but
it meant a lot to be talking

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.290
to other, you know, girls,

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.910
young women about how
we felt about things.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.610
And it just had a
tremendous effect on me.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How would you
characterize those different

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.120
generations and their
attitudes about feminism,

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.420
when they all identified
as feminist?

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.720
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Well, you
know, one of the things

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.530
that feminism has had to do and
is in the process of continuing

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.460
to wrestle with is
to be more inclusive.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Mm-hmm.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.060
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
And that's something

00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.360
that social justice
movements do have to do.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.460
And they have to-- they have
to be willing to change.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.950
And of course, there's
a lot of tension

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.190
between the generations
and we've seen that.

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:24.850
That's a real thing.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:26.230
But one of the things
that I thought

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.530
about when I was
writing this novel

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.370
because when you're writing
a novel and not a track--

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.660
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: -- it's the
characters that we remember.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.250
I mean, somebody said what we
remember of the books we love is

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:39.790
in plot, but character and I
think that's really true for me.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.760
But one thing that occurred
to me is that these women

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.620
of a different-- of
different generations

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:47.670
who call themselves feminists,

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.190
they grow up in a
different world.

00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:50.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.010
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: So their
experiences are different.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:54.700
But there is this one
experience at the very beginning

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.720
of the book, Greer in
her college experienced,

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.610
the very beginning, she goes to
a frat party and she's groped

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:04.850
by a frat brother at the party.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:08.080
And she has this moment
that I wanted to kind of try

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:11.190
to describe where
something happens to her

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:14.380
and she doesn't know, wait
a minute, does this count?

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.380
Am I allowed to be
as upset as I am?

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.680
Is it an assault?

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:18.980
Is it real?

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.110
And so many women I
had spoken to just

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:25.150
over time had an experience in
their life or certainly several

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.470
in which something happened
and their face went hot.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.210
And they thought, wait a minute,
is this just what it's going

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.720
to be like being female?

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.330
Like, it could even be
something very, very small.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.880
And I wanted to track
that because the feeling

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.180
of being a woman in the world,

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:41.950
there are some overlaps
regardless of generation.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:43.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Interesting.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.550
And another tension
in the book is

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.450
between idealism and capitalism.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.480
Faith's organization
is funded by a man

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.580
of somewhat questionable
morals, very wealthy man.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.970
And she's willing
to make compromises

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.000
that Greer is not, ultimately.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.580
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: You
know, Greer sees herself.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.550
She's at the beginning of her
career and she imagines things

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.540
in a certain perfection.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.930
But when money gets involved,

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.250
things always get
messed up, right?

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.550
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.850
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
Money and doing good.

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.370
To me as a novelist
that's kind of catnip,

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:12.190
the idea of putting
them both together

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.900
because you know it's
going to be complicated.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.300
And if Faith's not-- Faith is
willing to accept the money

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.600
and do good things with it,

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.930
Greer thinks the money
has to come clean.

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:23.230
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.960
I mean, those are questions
that are interesting.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.940
Like Faith thinks, well, at
least I'm reaching some people.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.560
I know it's not pure.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.860
I don't take sides.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:33.180
That's the thing about being
a novelist is I really don't

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.480
take sides.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You didn't
think one of them was right,

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:38.140
one of them was wrong, one of
them is being questionable.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.810
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: I
don't think that way.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
don't think that way.

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:42.410
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: I mean,
I don't want to do that.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:45.420
I feel like a novel is a
place where you don't have

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.510
to do the every other place
in our lives right now, right?

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.410
We go home and we're on the
internet or at least I am

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.900
and you have strong
feeling and everything.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.260
It's like in this moment
of the 24-hour news cycle,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.560
everything is a hot take.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.040
I prefer, if I can, to sometimes
be a master of the warm take,

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.190
you know, or even lukewarm take.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:08.590
The idea of just
saying what is it

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.930
like for this people,
what is it like?

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:13.990
And not particularly
coming down on sides.

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Let's
talk about Cory.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:16.840
Such a fascinating character.

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.140
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Sure.

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And we're
not giving anything away Cory

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.740
of course because--

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.040
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: And not boring,
those who haven't read it.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Exactly.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.640
OK. But he's a young man.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.280
He's on a classic course of male
success and his life changes.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.640
And he is-- Is he kind
of a male feminist hero?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.990
Is that too much to say?

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.450
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Well, one
of the things that I got--

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.200
I always hesitated to
use the word learned.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.610
There was Seinfeld, I
think, there was a mandate

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:40.910
that they had for the show.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.750
No hugging, no learning.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.590
I feel that way a little
bit about my novels.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:49.260
But one of the things that I
did kind of learn, I guess,

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.930
is that you follow your
characters where your ideas,

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.010
the imperative of the
book, will take them.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:01.170
And I started to see that
in this book that deals

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.190
with a famous feminist,
this cool--

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.870
she wears sexy boots
and she's well known.

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.380
And she has certain--
a catchphrase almost.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.980
She-- And then, someone who
works for her foundation.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.530
What about the people
who just quietly go

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.140
and do good every day?

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:21.420
As one of the-- the best friend
in the book in an argument--

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:24.660
big fight scene says I think
there are two kind of feminists,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.420
the famous ones and
everyone else.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.050
And that's what it's like
I think for people who--

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.900
you don't have to say I'm
political or I am a feminist

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.040
but you can do feminist or
good work in your lives.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.910
And I think one of the
other things of the book is

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:40.330
about doing-- making
meaning for yourself.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:44.120
And Cory has a tragedy
in his family and ends

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.440
up not having this big
consulting job but staying home

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.220
and taking care of his mother.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.710
And she cleans houses and he
starts cleaning her houses.

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.940
And it's seen as women's work.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.540
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
So yeah, I really--

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.160
I liked getting to
know that story.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Cory, yeah.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.760
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I did too.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.360
I was of course surprised as
everyone is who reads the novel

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.660
about what happens to him

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:08.460
and really moved by
the way he reacts.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.650
A few years ago, you wrote an
essay called "The Second Shelf".

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.940
You wrote in there women's
fiction is relegated

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.240
to that closed cornered
lower shelf

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.310
for books emphasizing
relationship

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.060
and the interior lives of women.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.640
Has that affected your work?

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.340
You seem very successful.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.640
It's-- That's hard to believe

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.380
that such prejudice affected
the marketing of your own books.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.820
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: I don't--
I wouldn't say the marketing

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:35.700
of my own books but
certainly we've seen that.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:40.170
One of the things I talked about
in the piece was the way books

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.730
by men and women, you know,
have looked over time.

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.400
And you might have what I sort

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.790
of a little snidely called
little girl in a field of wheat

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.810
on a cover, you know, in
a book that was by a woman

00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:57.630
and you would have this sort
of big boldface type in a book

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.060
by a man that sort of said
this book is in event.

00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:01.680
In addition to little
girl in a field of wheat,

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.390
there's another kind of book
though that I sort of women

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:06.970
in water, the dreamy
and essential book.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.570
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
I guess the thing

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.320
about those books is you can
understand publishers wanting

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:17.350
to find audiences but books that
seem to exclude the possibility

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:21.160
of welcoming readers, that's not
what I would want for my book.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.370
The idea of-- picture two men
standing on a train platform.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:25.670
"What's that you're reading?"

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:26.970
"The little girl in
a field of wheat."

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:28.270
"Oh, yeah, I loved it.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:29.570
I read it."

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.780
"Did you read the sequel, little
girl in the field of rye?"

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.780
You know, you can't see it.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:38.880
You-- The idea of fiction as
being inclusive because we all--

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.470
Look, there was that
study that said

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:41.770
that fiction teaches empathy.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.990
We all knew that, we just didn't
have the data for it in advance.

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.300
But I think one of the things
that made me start writing

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.420
that piece, and I talk
about this in that piece,

00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:54.720
was I was at a party and I met
a man and he heard I was writer.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.300
Well, first, he said-- he
asked me the worst question.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.860
Don't ever ask this of a writer.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:01.160
He asked the worst question.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.900
He said, "Would I
have heard of you?"

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.480
It's a terrible question.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.040
There is one really
good answer though,

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:12.880
in a more just world [laughter].

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.860
But-- [applause].

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.360
But he said, would
I have heard of you

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.660
and he asked me to
describe my books.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.510
And I, you know, what themes did
I write about and I, you know,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:29.270
men, women, sexual
power, marriage.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.380
And his eyes sort of started
rolling up in his head.

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.090
And he was like you
should talk to my wife.

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:37.920
And he just got out of
there as fast as he could.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.680
So that started me thinking.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: About what
men and women want to read?

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.600
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.900
And why? And are we
programmed for that?

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.200
And how can we change that?

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.500
Yeah.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There
isn't that much difference

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.100
between the great
novels women write

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:52.760
and the great novels men writes
but they are marketed in--

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.060
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
Sometimes they are.

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.360
I hope things are changing.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.400
It's hard to know
where, you know,

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.960
we're seeing some
signs of change.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.560
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: You know,

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.120
Jesmyn Ward has won the
National Book Award twice.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:07.720
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Right?

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.020
So-- But you know what,

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.350
you write the books
you want to write.

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:13.450
I mean I want to write the books
that I want to write and hope

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:16.660
that readers respond
as they will.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.390
Because, you know,
reading fiction--

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:22.410
Look, being in a convention
center, if I have to be

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.580
in a windowless place all day,

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.950
you were the people
I want to be with.

00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:30.260
Because we love fiction.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:33.020
And that's not-- It's
more really about that.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.970
Like, we live in such
a nonfiction world.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.270
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:37.570
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: You know, our
lives are anxious and we're

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:43.380
on mind, you know, stalking old
boyfriends or I've heard tell.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:46.610
But actually, I will say this.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:50.130
The internet has had certainly
a bad effect on some--

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:52.550
on writing and reading
in so many ways.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.550
You could be writing like
a super lyrical passage

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.850
and you need to take
a break from it.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:00.570
You go online and
you see best resorts.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.210
And you start looking at a
list of the best resorts.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.190
And now you go back to
your lyrical passage

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.180
and it suddenly takes
place in Aruba.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:11.700
You know, I feel that the
distractions are so profound--

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:13.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.300
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: -- that we need

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:15.600
to force ourselves
away from them.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.980
But being among readers
is so hopeful.

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.920
It-- Because reading matters.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.710
I mean, when you think about,
you can't quantify the ways

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.250
in which reading
fiction is so important.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.100
But all I need to do
is imagine a culture

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.650
where there were
no novels in it.

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.870
It just-- It's just-- I get
so much from reading fiction.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:37.530
I feel so moved by
reading about other people.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The book has
been out about four months.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.170
Have you had interesting
experiences with women coming up

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:46.150
and telling you their own
experiences with their lives,

00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:48.860
their response to
the Me Too Movement?

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.920
Is it, yeah, is it
calling out that kind

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.280
of response among your readers?

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:55.740
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Well, one thing
that's happened is I have signed

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.740
a lot like a copy for
someone and her daughter.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.340
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Very nice.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.940
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: So that's
been really, really nice.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.540
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah, I
think when you meet a reader

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.840
and you hear a story about
how something affected them,

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.140
it's wonderful.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.990
People-- One thing actually in
October before the book came

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:16.270
out long ago, almost a year ago,

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.320
my publisher had a
little media event.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:21.170
And everyone was given a
little nametag and they had

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.770
to write someone who
had been an influence

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:25.930
to them when they were young.

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:29.690
There were a lot of Michelle
Obamas and some dance teachers.

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:31.440
But everybody-- It
was a great icebreaker

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.810
because if you had someone
who saw something in you

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:36.770
when you were younger,
you haven't forgotten it.

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.690
Yeah. Now this hasn't been
so serious about the book,

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.120
but the book is really funny.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.490
You are really funny
as they can tell.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.790
How do you-- When you're
writing, you're alone

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:48.090
as you said, how can you tell

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.770
if what you're writing
is in fact funny?

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.070
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: I can't.

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:54.060
You know how you-- You
know what's it like,

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:59.070
the horrible thing about writing
a novel is in terms of humor,

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.690
well, there are many horrible
things about writing a novel.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.990
Where to begin?

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:03.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Let's
stick to the humor part.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.590
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Where to begin?

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.820
But when I give like the
first reading from a book--

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, yes.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.420
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
-- and people laugh

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:10.720
at something like-- I'm like--

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Is
it a surprise?

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.320
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: --
wait, that was meant

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.620
to be lyrical and moving.

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:15.920
Why are you laughing at that?

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.220
Or surprised when they
laugh at another line.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:21.380
It's sort of as if you made a
very grand recipe and tested it

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.190
out in front of the queen of
England for the first time.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.860
I mean, you don't know
if it's funny or not

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.160
until you read it aloud.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.570
Because I don't sit
there trying to--

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.390
nobody cracks themselves up.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:32.920
I mean comedians don't.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.520
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Right.

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.820
They sit there, you
know, grimly.

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.420
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
No, I never know.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Interesting.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.020
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: But I know--

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.320
But again, it's about
sensibility.

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.620
I guess the thing is
with writing humor,

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.920
it's not insert joke here.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.220
It's Mad Libs.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.520
It's just-- It has
to-- It often comes

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.820
out of character or sensibility.

00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.420
Now you're working
at a new novel called

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.140
"To Night Owl from Dogfish".

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.440
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
It's coming out.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.740
It's done.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's done.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.340
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: It's
a kid's book, yeah.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: For
us it's coming out--

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.940
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: -- in February?

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.540
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yes.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:05.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.140
Tell-- Can you tell
us anything about it?

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.440
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Sure.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.740
I wear at least two hats.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.040
And I do write books
for kids and this is

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.340
for middle grade readers.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.640
It's so funny when I refer
to my adult fiction, I--

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.280
it sounds like porn,
my adult novels,

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.120
the ones with the plain covers.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.680
But this book is co-written with
Holly Goldberg Sloan who wrote

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.300
"Counting by 7s" of some of you.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.600
Yeah. OK. Great.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:29.900
And she's just-- It's a novel
told in emails and letters

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.120
from two girls whose fathers are
single gay dads and fall in love

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.840
and want the girls
to be friends.

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.780
And there's a summer
camp plot because as with

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.980
"The Interestings", I can't
stay away from summer camp.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.770
It was a very important
experience in my life.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:46.350
I went to summer-- to an
arts summer camp and I was

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.540
so pretentious at this camp.

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:52.000
Every play that I was in, I
used what can only be described

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.920
as my Katharine Hepburn voice.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.050
It could be a Neil Simon
comedy or The House

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.680
of Bernarda Alba by Lorca.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:04.840
And I was like mother,
where are you?

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:06.140
Where are you, mother?

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.940
You know, I just could
not break out of that.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.900
And I was super-- I
would carry that summer--

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.320
I wanted so much to be
sort of intellectual.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:14.790
I would carry a book under my
arms so people could see it,

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.470
and just like parts of it.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.460
It would say "The
Magic Mountain"--

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.820
like, you could not
quite see the whole title

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.120
of "The Magic Mountain".

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.420
I would carry it under my arm.

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.850
And I also started
writing in a diary thinking

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.260
that maybe I would
be sort of a member

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.440
of like the Bloomsbury Group

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.350
like the Long Island
version someday.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.280
And I started writing
very faithfully

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.640
in my diary every day.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.960
Like today, I watched
Bewitched and then [laughter]--

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.500
and then I stop, I forgot.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.830
And I got oh no, months
later, I found the diary.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.660
I was like, oh no, I
better write in it.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.020
And I went back and I
wrote on every page,

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.650
nothing happened today.

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.840
[Laughter] Cleaver.

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:57.270
That's the long answer
to your question about--

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:58.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:28:59.870
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:01.170
It was completely
unrelated children's book.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.470
I'm so sorry.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Did
you construct the novel

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:05.070
as email back and forth?

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.370
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yes.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:07.670
Well, here's the
funny thing that--

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:08.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I mean she
wrote half and you wrote half?

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:10.270
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Well, what
happened was Holly's husband--

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.790
When Holly and I met at a kid's
book conference actually and--

00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.090
because I had written
a book for--

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.330
a young adult book and
a book for kids as well,

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.590
and she had these
wonderful books.

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.440
And we talked about
writing a book together.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.390
And her husband said,
"Why don't you

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.550
and Meg send emails
to each other?"

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:29.540
And we thought he meant do
it as a novel in emails.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:30.910
He said, "Oh I never meant that.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.760
I meant just kick around ideas."

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:37.310
But it turned out to be--
Right away, I started writing

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:40.190
in this sort of highly
neurotic voice.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.730
I don't know where
I got my ideas.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:46.810
And-- But then we went back
and we aren't either character.

00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:48.300
They're two very
different girls.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:51.830
But we went and sort of
overwrote each others parts.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.470
And both of the girls, both

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:55.020
of the characters
are very much in us.

00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:58.190
So we wrote the whole thing
separately and together.

00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:59.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: How fun.

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.790
What ages is that for?

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.670
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Like 10 and up.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.270
How fun that would be.

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:07.570
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:08.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The last--

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.170
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: It's so weird.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:11.470
We're like, what age is this?

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:12.770
What age is this for?

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.070
Oh, you know, it's like--

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:15.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, 22 to 65

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:16.760
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Right, 22
through the AARP years, yes.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And last
year, you edited a volume

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.740
of Great American Short Stories.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.040
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Best
American Short Stories, yes.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So that meant
you read a lot of short stories.

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.790
You may be the current expert
on what's being written

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:27.090
in short stories of American?

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.390
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yes I am.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:29.690
I--

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:30.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Do
you have any wisdom?

00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:32.290
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Well, I
think that short story--

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:34.300
the short story is alive
and well in this country.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:37.710
There-- There's not
any one kind of thing.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:39.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You must have
seen just tremendous variety

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.110
to choice from.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.410
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: I did.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.580
It's really hard to do to put
it together but I laid them

00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:47.470
out all-- you know, on my--
in the floor in my apartment

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:50.950
and walked around them and
picked them and it was great.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:53.050
It was really exciting to put
something like that together.

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Not bad.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:55.650
Not bad. Would you
take some questions?

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:56.950
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah, I will.

00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:58.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: OK.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.550
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Sure.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:00.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: About
any of the books.

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:02.150
We've got a microphone
here and here.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:03.450
Just come up and Meg
will point to you.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:04.750
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.050
&gt;&gt; Hi

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:07.350
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Hi.

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:08.650
&gt;&gt; I was introduced to you
by my daughter who gave me

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:09.950
"Female Persuasion"
for Mother's Day.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:11.250
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Oh, great.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.550
&gt;&gt; And I'm now learning

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.850
about your work backwards
on a timeline.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.930
I've just finished
"The Everythings".

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:19.900
And it seems to me particularly
listening to you today

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:26.300
that there is a similarity
between Greer and Jules in terms

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.800
of their-- at least in the
beginning of the development

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:32.620
of the characters,
they're insecure,

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:34.860
they're not very self-aware.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.560
And we see them really grow

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.900
and become more powerful
as they get older.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.500
And of course I've only
read these two books

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.890
but I just wonder if
you do make connections

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:51.720
to characters either
willingly or not?

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.050
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: I think that
I don't do it consciously

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.620
but I think it's
definitely there.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.140
I mean, I don't like to
write autobiographically.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:01.260
I don't think either of
those characters is me

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.580
but it doesn't come from outer
space, it comes from something

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.570
like you're marinating
in these ideas.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:10.670
I gave a reading-- an event
at Ann Patchett's bookstore.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.510
Wonderful bookstore Parnassus
and she was asking me questions

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:17.580
from the stage about--
and I said something like,

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:21.120
I think everybody maybe has
like three or four arias

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.380
to sing and Ann said one.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.460
And that may be true that we
are a person living in the world

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.900
so there's going to be a kind

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.320
of Venn diagram overlap
I think among characters.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:32.620
Sure.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.920
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.220
I love your work.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.520
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Thank you.

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.240
&gt;&gt; Hi, my friend wanted me to
ask about the end of "The Wife".

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.760
And I did not read your book
so I apologize right now.

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.060
But now I'm going to read it now

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.970
that I've seen the movie
and it's out there.

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:52.590
But is she writing her story at
the end when she turns the page

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.110
and she's on the airplane?

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:56.780
Does that coincide
with your book?

00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.440
Or like you said, you
didn't have to take

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.060
in the-- of the movie.

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:02.140
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: The movie is a
little different from the book.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.480
You're talking about
the movie, right?

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.780
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.080
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yeah, the
movie is a little different

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.380
from the book.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.680
&gt;&gt; How are we supposed

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.980
to interpret the
ending of the movie?

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.280
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Oh.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.580
&gt;&gt; Did you-- at the end of it.

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:13.880
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: I would
never tell anyone how

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.180
to interpret an ending.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.480
I also kind of feel with--

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.780
when you leave your
characters behind, I leave--

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.390
do you remember in "The
Truman Show" when he discovers

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.180
that the world is
sort of enclosed?

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:26.190
I kind of feel like my
characters are in a snow globe

00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:28.070
but I'm sort of leaving
them there.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:30.580
But without a doubt, at
the end of "The Wife",

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.160
certainly at the end of
the novel of "The Wife"

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:35.320
and in the firm,
there is a new moment

00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.600
for this character Joan
Castleman, who was the wife

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.750
of the famous bloated novelist.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:46.930
I think that I would hesitate
to be more specific than that.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.230
&gt;&gt; OK.

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:49.530
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Sorry.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.160
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Have you ever
gone back written a sequel

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.460
of any kind?

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.760
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: No.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.320
No. I mean, I guess
I love leaving--

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.490
It's not exactly leaving
things up to interpretation,

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.740
but I would say that she's--
the difference between the book

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.030
and the firm is-- one
of the differences.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.210
Well, one thing is
they made the--

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:10.050
I made up a prize that the
husband wins called the

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.350
Helsinki Prize.

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:13.230
It's like two or three
steps down from the Nobel.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:14.910
They made it the Nobel
Prize in the movie

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:17.280
that the novelist husband wins.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:24.740
But I sort of loved the idea
of her-- she's in first person,

00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.860
the novel is in first person,
and it's funny and angry.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:32.110
And the firm it's all
in Glenn Close's face

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:36.310
in so much close-ups of her, and
so much of what she finally gets

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:39.470
to say as it starts to unfold.

00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:41.090
We definitely know
that she's moving

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.300
into something knew
in both cases.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.600
&gt;&gt; Right. Thank you.

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.510
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Sure, thanks.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.770
&gt;&gt; Hi, Meg, it's good
to see you again.

00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:50.070
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Hello.

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.370
&gt;&gt; Hi. We grew up together,

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:53.170
Meg and I in the same
street in Syosset.

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:54.810
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: This is true.

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.110
This is true.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.130
&gt;&gt; I have a comment.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:01.300
I don't read a lot of fiction
but when your book came out,

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:06.150
I went to our local library and
I said, please order this book.

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:09.820
So I filled out the form and
I got the book and I read it

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.190
and I thought I'm so glad you
wrote a book about feminists,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.680
feminist history and feminism

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.510
because I thought
man it's about time.

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:19.810
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Thank you.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:21.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.410
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Nice
to see you, Terry.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:26.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.450
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm a big fan of you
novel, "Belzhar" personally

00:35:31.450 --> 00:35:33.980
because it incorporates
talking about writing

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:38.960
as therapy while not making
overshadow the other elements

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.320
of the novel.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:45.210
So how did you make that balance
of talking about the need

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:48.120
for writing and the
need for expression

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.260
but also incorporating other
elements of story time?

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.560
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Thank you.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.690
So I wrote this young adult
novel that she's referring

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.910
to called "Belzhar" which is
kind of a play on "The Bell Jar"

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:02.060
which is a book that was
really important to me.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.650
It takes place at a school

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:09.050
for highly intelligent
troubled teenagers.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:10.430
I would have killed
to go to that school.

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:11.730
I have to say.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:13.030
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
weren't troubled enough?

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.330
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: I
wasn't troubled enough.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:17.310
And as you know, I had
to stay in Syosset.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:21.980
But the characters in the
novel are put into a class

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.820
where they write in a
journal and when they write--

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.930
there's a kind of sort
of fantasy element.

00:36:27.930 --> 00:36:30.950
They write in a journal and
they sort of brought to a moment

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.820
of where a crisis
happened in their lives.

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.790
I feel expression is everything.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.680
Being able to say what you feel.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.530
We say it politically
with the Me Too Movement.

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:41.420
We see it with writers.

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.990
The need to hear how-- what
someone's experience was.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.740
It's terribly important.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.670
So, yeah, that was
important to them especially

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:52.300
at a moment of adolescence.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.670
I mean, one of the reasons I
like writing about teenagers is

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:57.680
because it's a time of firsts

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.900
and that definitely
comes across in the book.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.700
I hope. Thank you.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.060
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to
ask you very boring

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.070
and cliché author question.

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:10.290
It's about characterization
specifically Greer

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:11.590
and Faith Frank.

00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:14.670
I just-- I'm just
curious about the lens

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:19.060
in which you wrote these very
lovable flawed characters,

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.530
sort of you process, and I know
they're meticulously detailed

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.670
down to the Blue Streak Tier
[assumed spelling], the boots,

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:30.480
but I just wanted to know I
guess like what inspired you

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.700
for their traits, did
it come naturally?

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.030
Or was it something that
was more prescribed?

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:38.330
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Thank you.

00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:41.250
Coming up with character
to me is,

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:43.210
it's sort of you can't force it.

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:45.870
You know a little bit and then
you know a little bit more.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:48.510
Kind of like a rip
gets worst and worst

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.370
and hopefully this is
the opposite of a rip,

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.370
it gets better and better.

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:55.220
But I think of character
this way.

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:58.770
You know how you're at home
and you suddenly want to talk

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.420
to a particular friend.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.150
It-- And there may be nothing
you need to tell that friend

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:06.230
and there may be nothing
you need to hear news-wise

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:09.840
from that friend, but you feel
the desire to speak to them.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.670
I feel that that thing
that you can't quite name,

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:16.250
the way the room temperature
changes when you talk

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:20.270
to that friend, character
ought to be that way.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:24.530
So that when a character
comes into being on the page,

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.210
there's a certain feeling.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:29.830
And then when she returns later,
that feeling might return too.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:32.620
It's almost like a theme in
like "Peter and the Wolf",

00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:35.030
like there is a sense of that.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.910
And the more you get
to know her, the more--

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:40.890
or him, the more that comes
about through being aware

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.370
of how are things shifting
when that character is there?

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.170
I just try to explore
that a little bit,

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:47.920
and then the details
kind of come,

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.220
and that's the pleasurable
stuff.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.900
It's like a waterfall
of details.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.220
Faith wearing boots.

00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:54.800
I knew she was a
charismatic figure.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.290
But then I wanted
to make it specific.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:58.590
She's so charismatic.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:38:59.970
She's so exciting to people.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.970
There's-- The "Female
Persuasion" is kind

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:03.270
of dual love story.

00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:05.990
It's a love story between Greer
and her boyfriend and also

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:08.870
between Greer and Faith, this
feminist who inspires her.

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:12.710
And the idea of someone
who you really look up to,

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:16.830
let's give her hair, let's
give her boots, and Faith--

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:18.690
and then we know her in a way.

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:22.290
So it comes about
that way, I think.

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:24.110
Thank you.

00:39:24.110 --> 00:39:29.680
&gt;&gt; I read "The Female
Persuasion" and I loved it

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.060
and I've been looking
at articles

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.480
and seeing people talk about it.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:36.960
And people talk so much about
the relationship between Faith

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.470
and Greer and also about
Cory's development,

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.030
but I don't see a lot of
people talking so much

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.080
about the character of
Zee and I don't want

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.530
to be spoilerly [phonetic]
about anything,

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.070
but I just thought her
journey was so interesting.

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:52.600
I mean beyond what
happened with Greer,

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:54.200
I thought that her
personal journey

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:57.370
about her inner city school
teaching and what she learned

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:59.500
about herself and about the
world was so interesting,

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.100
and I wonder if you could
comment on her character.

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:04.400
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Oh, thank you.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.130
Yeah. I mean, I guess the
problem when you write a novel

00:40:07.130 --> 00:40:09.320
that has multiple
characters and different--

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.520
multiple perspectives,
it's hard to, you know,

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.330
for reviews to get everyone in.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:17.200
It could feel a little
bit like a big--

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.300
a lot of people at the table.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.840
This is-- I love writing
about female friendship

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.040
or about friendship
really which happens

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.870
to often be female
friendship but not always.

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:28.140
In "The Interestings", the
friendship between Jules

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.130
and Ethan was a big
thing for me.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:34.240
I think friendship is enormously
powerful and shifting, and it--

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.180
when I was a kid,
I thought that you

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.990
and your friends would
be together forever.

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:41.230
Like that it would be like that
it would be like an episode

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:44.840
of Sex and the City where
you're always at the same table.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.160
It isn't like that.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.300
I mean, I have friends,
you don't see for decades

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:53.500
but the minute you see them,
you continue that thing.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:56.370
That's what life is more like.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:41:01.990
So Greer and his best friend,
Zee is sort of a young activist.

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.290
She's queer.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:07.290
She's full of heart in someway.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:10.210
But I think their
friendship reaches a point

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.370
where Greer does
something that's not great.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.200
And again, here is that moment
of threading the needle,

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.500
not wanting to give things away.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.500
People go, I would've read
"The Female Persuasion"

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:18.800
but she told me what happened,

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.370
so I don't I don't
need to read it now.

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:24.840
I like writing about the
tensions between them

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.480
but the love that
you have for friends

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.850
over a long period of time.

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.150
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:32.410
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Thank you.

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:33.800
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.740
On page 45 of your
book, which I--

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.040
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Oh, yes.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.600
Oh, yes, I know.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:42.720
I know what you're
going to bring up.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.520
&gt;&gt; Yes. You wrote that you
believe a paraphrase by the way,

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.570
that the most effective
people on the earth are people

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:56.170
who are introverts who taught
themselves to be extroverts.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:59.210
And that really resonated
with me many, many ways

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:02.360
and I'm wondering to what
extent did you see yourself

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.620
as the introvert who
became the extrovert?

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.920
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Oh, completely.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.220
Completely.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:13.100
I remember like last week my
face going so hot and feeling

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.100
like you can't speak but force--
but really, but forcing yourself

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:21.200
to do it and seeing what the
bounty you reap doing it.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.980
No, I mean, it's very,
very hard to speak up

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:27.900
and you have this one moment to
get anyone's attention, right?

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.350
And if you miss it-- I remember
like being a kid and being

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:33.660
at one of those horrible
parties in someone's basement

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.020
with the hang in there
baby poster, right,

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:40.080
you remember that, the
cat hanging onto a bar?

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
very inspiring.

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:43.100
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Yes,
right, it-- that's right.

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.400
It's really inspiring.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We're
still here.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.000
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: That's
right, just hanging in there.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.150
And the one that said, keep
on trucking and just being

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:53.800
at a party and working
myself up to say a joke.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.770
And as I went to
go for the joke,

00:42:56.770 --> 00:42:58.610
someone else said something
funny, and that was it.

00:42:58.610 --> 00:42:59.910
I missed it.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.210
It was like jump rope.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.040
And the idea that if you
can be more comfortable,

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.730
because no one is
thinking about you as much

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.490
as you're thinking
about yourself.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:10.370
Once I realized that,
I think it was easier

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:11.800
to talk a little more freely.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.370
But yeah, I absolutely
think that's me.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:14.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.630
I loved, truly loved your book.

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:17.930
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Thank you.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.530
&gt;&gt; And I want everybody
in the room to read it.

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:22.830
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Thank you.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:24.130
Thank you.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:25.430
&gt;&gt; I just-- Can I?

00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:28.790
I just saw "The Wife" yesterday
and just incredibly loved it.

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:30.090
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Thank you.

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:31.390
&gt;&gt; And I haven't read
the book but based

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.110
on the different endings I'm
going to go get the book now.

00:43:34.110 --> 00:43:37.940
I would really like to know,
where did that story come from

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.520
or how did you come up
with that story or what--

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.590
were there-- did
something happen?

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.940
Did you run into somebody?

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.640
Did you start with an idea?

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.940
I mean--

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.240
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: OK, first
of all, see the ending,

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.540
it's not that different.

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:51.840
The book is pretty
faithful really.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.380
The movie is-- The
book is faithful

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.740
to the movie [laughter].

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:59.740
God, the movie is faithful to
the book in very important ways.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:03.480
I grew-- because I grew up
with a mother who is a writer,

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.190
I was sort of looking
around at writers.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.790
And my mother, when
she-- I know that she--

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:13.950
when she first published her
first novel, the headline of one

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:15.360
of the reviews said something

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.170
like housewife turns
into novelist.

00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:21.240
She said it was as if she
went into a phone booth

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.670
and came out as Superman.

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:27.550
You would think it was such
a, you know, huge thing to do

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:30.470
for a housewife to
turn into a novelist,

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:32.590
a certain kind of condescension.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:35.850
And I thought, what if I wrote
a book from the point of view

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:40.810
of this woman who was-- wives
are-- the idea of the wife,

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.420
people who would sort of maybe
want to get to the big man

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:46.840
and go to the wife to sort
of as a sneaky way in,

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.630
what secrets does the wife of
this big man from this era have?

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:52.560
And I started-- And I went

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.690
to Smith College before
I transferred to Brown

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:55.990
and I was a big, as I said,

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.110
a reader of "The Bell
Jar" and Sylvia Plath.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:03.030
And Plath, Plathiana is all
over that place, Northampton,

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:05.640
Massachusetts and Smith College.

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.090
And I wrote about a character--

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.880
my character Joan when
she's young has an affair

00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.360
with her professor and
falls in love with him.

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:18.180
He leaves his wife and she goes
off and becomes this big writer.

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.650
And it's a book full of rage
and humor and I didn't have

00:45:21.650 --> 00:45:22.950
to keep them separate.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:27.110
And I just thought about--
I just thought about writers

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.730
and what it's been like,
the mid-century male writers

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:32.230
and the notion of
male importance

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.990
and how we've looked
at that over time.

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:37.720
But what if I did that
but it wasn't a polemic.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.300
It was funny and
angry all at once.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:44.540
So it was a great relief
and a pleasure to write.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:45.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: One more.

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.140
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: OK.

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:51.650
&gt;&gt; So I wanted to let you know
I have a male voice and that I,

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.660
as a male, really
enjoyed your work.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.010
And I actually wanted
to ask a question

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:59.700
of Ron if you don't mind.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We
could talk afterwards.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.980
&gt;&gt; Do you think Meg's work ought

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:10.710
to be required reading
for modern males?

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:14.560
[Laughter] Typically
in this day and age?

00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Definitely.

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.160
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:19.760
&gt;&gt; OK. So we agree on that.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:22.360
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Good
answer as they say

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.660
on Family Feud [laughter].

00:46:23.660 --> 00:46:24.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We
became friends years ago.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.260
So I haven't been able to
review her work in the paper

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.510
but I certainly read it
and enjoy it definitely

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:29.960
and learn a lot from it.

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:33.010
&gt;&gt; I know I had a conversation
with you earlier, Meg,

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:40.450
about how you've helped to start
many conversations in my family

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:41.940
with my daughter and my wife.

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:44.750
So thank you very much for that.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.050
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: My pleasure.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:50.410
&gt;&gt; And I wished you-- you
should start a conversation

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:53.740
in our society as a whole
about some of these issues.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:55.040
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Thank you.

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.640
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
I appreciate that.

00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:58.940
Great. [Applause] Wait, she--

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:00.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We
can take one more.

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.540
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
Yeah, we can take it.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:02.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.140
&gt;&gt; Meg, I want to ask you
something very self-absorb,

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.530
is it possible I could speak
to you after the presentation?

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:07.830
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Sure.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:09.130
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:10.430
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
Everyone come speak to me.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:14.610
One at a time, I will give
you each a real moment

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:16.660
of bonding, but yes.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.490
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Well, thank
you for this moment of bonding.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:19.790
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer: Thank
you very much for coming.

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:21.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's been a
real pleasure to talk to you.

00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:22.390
&gt;&gt; Meg Wolitzer:
I appreciate it.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.190
Thank you.

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:29.190
