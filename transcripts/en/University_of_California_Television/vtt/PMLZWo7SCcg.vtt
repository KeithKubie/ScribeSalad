00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:03.790
- [Narrator] This program is presented by

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.240
University of California Television.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.600

00:00:20.563 --> 00:00:23.146
(upbeat music)

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:47.710
- Well, good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.590
and welcome to this lecture.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.280
This is the third lecture in the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.309
HarvEst Distinguished
Women Lecture Series.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.330
For those who don't know you,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.300
my name is Fiona Doyle.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.330
In addition to being a
Professor in Material Science

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.105
and Engineering, I'm the
Dean of the Graduate Division

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:11.043
at Berkeley.

00:01:11.043 --> 00:01:13.993
The Graduate Division
has a proud tradition

00:01:13.993 --> 00:01:17.045
of managing the Berkeley
graduate lectures.

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:20.940
We cover eight lectureships in all.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.920
Each has a distinctive endowment history

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.438
and a distinctive theme for the lectures

00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:30.743
that are delivered under their auspices.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.750
The different programs
have brought a variety of

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.250
incredibly distinguished
visitors to Berkeley since 1904.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.103
So this goes back well over 100 years,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.070
really building on the principle
that a great university

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.640
is the repository and
the center of knowledge

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.773
that should be made available
to the general public.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.570
What's I find very interesting about the

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.725
HarvEst Distinguished
Women Lecture Series,

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:13.660
which is the newest
edition to our collection,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.230
is that rather than
choosing a particular theme

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.780
for the lecture, the common
theme for the three lectures

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.290
has been distinguished women who, in fact,

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.440
have been very, very different

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.520
in their contributions to the world

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.810
and their overall impact.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.526
The HarvEst lecture name

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:42.188
comes from the first names
of our lecture benefactors,

00:02:42.188 --> 00:02:47.188
UC Berkeley alumni,
Harvey Lee and Esther Ma,

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:50.959
both of whom earned their
undergraduate degrees

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.279
in economics at Berkeley
before pursuing MBA degrees

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.093
at Harvard and Columbia, respectively.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.090
Both Harvey and Esther have gone onto

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.447
accomplished international
business careers.

00:03:04.447 --> 00:03:06.840
Esther is the founder

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.673
of the public relations firm, Prestique

00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:13.086
and is author of four books.

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:18.086
She was featured in the
2011 book Ladies Who Launch.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.940
Harvey is the Vice Chairman
of Golden Real Estate

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.410
Financial Holdings, Limited.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.300
Although the couple
are based in Hong Kong,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.520
I'm delighted that they
are here with us today

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.670
and along with their beautiful daughters.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.670
And on your behalf, I wish
the family happy new year.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.710
So we're very lucky that they've joined us

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.643
during Chinese New Year.

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.680
So, with that, it's my pleasure to

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.680
invite Esther up to lectern
to provide a few words

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.047
on her perspective on

00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:00.620
distinguished women.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.453
Esther.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.910
- Thank you, Dean Doyle.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.065
Wow, it's great to be
back at Cal, go bears!

00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:10.130
(laughs)
(audience applauding)

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.913
So good afternoon and happy
Chinese New Year of the Monkey.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.090
Dean Doyle, Miss Frances Dinkelspiel,

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.280
Miss Deirdre English, and alumni,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.670
faculty, students and
distinguished guests.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.940
It is my and Harvey's
honor to be here again

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.730
for the third time to present the third

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.853
HarvEst Distinguished
Women Leader Lecture.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.755
Well, I always like to
start with this poem

00:04:38.755 --> 00:04:43.525
that was actually unveiled
during our wedding back in 1994.

00:04:43.525 --> 00:04:45.034
So here it goes.

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:48.843
On a bright sunny day
under the Sather Gate,

00:04:48.843 --> 00:04:52.680
two Berkeley freshmen met by fate.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.930
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.253
Nine years of sharing,
nine years of caring,

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:59.879
love has come of age

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.211
and true love and mutual trust

00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:06.660
will allow the 1985 vintage

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.163
to yield a fruitful harvest.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.020
So, indeed, HarvEst got married
nine years after they met

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.690
under the Sather Gate.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.500
But it took them a little while

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.455
to HarvEst the two little
ones, Quisha and Tiqa.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:25.031
Took us 11 years.

00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:30.031
And Quisha was born in 2005,
while Tiqa was born in 2007,

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.969
because I actually had a
couple of multiple miscarriages

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.660
within four years before that.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.329
But, anyway, you know, ever
since I became a parent,

00:05:40.329 --> 00:05:44.550
Harvey and I both realized
the importance of education,

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.190
philanthropy, giving back to the community

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.020
and really nurturing a young
generation of future leaders.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.100
And so that's why when Dean Andrew Szeri

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.955
approached us five years ago

00:05:56.955 --> 00:06:00.100
to offer us this opportunity to endow

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.780
lecture series, we immediately accepted

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.550
the invitation without hesitation,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.280
because this distinguished lecture series

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.070
resonates with our
philanthropic philosophies,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.730
being in education,
leadership, philanthropy

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.023
and also in the arts and the athletics.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.877
So if you look in Instagram
under my name, Esther Ma Lee,

00:06:21.877 --> 00:06:26.846
you will notice that label
myself hyper-momtrepreneur.

00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:29.280
Well, I always call myself a full-time mom

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.349
and a full time entrepreneur,

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.387
having been running my
own business for 20 years

00:06:35.387 --> 00:06:38.740
and also now being a mom for 10 years.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.530
I think I kind of take pride

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.377
in being able to achieve
that work-life balance,

00:06:44.377 --> 00:06:49.377
which gives me a sense,
great sense of gratification.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.620
So my typical day would be

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.267
sending Quisha and Tiqa to school at 7:15,

00:06:55.267 --> 00:06:57.790
have a quick breakfast
and then workout for

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.060
one-and-a-half hours to two hours,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.150
go into the office, have a business lunch,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.240
and then run some errands,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.920
and then pick up the girls at 3:30.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.580
And then I always request
my clients to do events

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.680
after 4:45, because that's when the kids

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.120
are in their after-school activities.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.565
And then after the event, we'll
either go home for dinner,

00:07:16.565 --> 00:07:18.840
look after their homework,
or study with them,

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.010
or once in awhile, go out with Harvey

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.140
on wine dinners, so on and so forth.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.250
Weekends are always spent
on family gatherings

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.848
or some kind of a sports competitions.

00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:31.770
But why distinguished women?

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.073
Because I'm, myself, I'm a great fan,

00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:36.437
great supporter of women courses.

00:07:36.437 --> 00:07:41.232
Back home, I'm on the
Zonta Club, which is a NGO,

00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:43.600
consisting of women executives.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.131
We all joined force to
help underprivileged women.

00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:48.750
I'm also one of the founding members

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:52.018
of the Golden Bauhinia Women
Entrepreneurs Association

00:07:52.018 --> 00:07:54.940
and we established scholarship and

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.490
a lot of mentoring programs

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.635
for aspiring women entrepreneurs.

00:07:58.635 --> 00:08:01.690
And I'm also very actively involved

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.410
with a women's foundation which
focuses on a lot of research

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:09.480
on issues such as gender
equality and work-life balance.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.177
And they've been getting a lot
of government support lately.

00:08:12.177 --> 00:08:14.490
And also I'm volunteering for

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.996
Women Helping Women Foundation,

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:19.550
which focuses on helping
marginalized women,

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.030
especially those who
experience domestic violence

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.540
and domestic abuse.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.490
And on the lighter side of life,

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:30.270
I'm co-founder of Femme du Vin Society,

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.015
a women wine society.

00:08:32.015 --> 00:08:34.960
Every month we organize wine tasting

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.930
for wine education and
networking opportunities.

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.640
So when Dean Doyle told me that this year

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.130
our speaker's gonna be
a little bit different,

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.710
half-different, because the first year,

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.580
as Dean Doyle mentioned,
Mrs. Harriet Fulbright

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.157
gave a inspiring speech on
international education.

00:08:52.157 --> 00:08:55.430
And last year, Professor Laura Tyson,

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.110
who happened to be Harvey's first

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.610
economics professor,
gave an inspiring speech

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.990
on women and the world economy.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.310
And this year, we are so excited

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.970
because Harvey also happens
to be in the wine business.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.560
In fact, his boss is the owner
of a Napa Valley vineyard

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.132
by the name of Sloan Estates.

00:09:14.132 --> 00:09:16.430
And Jenny, I believe, the GM

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.362
is making her way down.

00:09:18.362 --> 00:09:22.650
So we are really excited that today

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.650
our guest lecturer, in fact, is a renowned

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.206
author of a best-selling book
called Tangled Vineyards,

00:09:29.206 --> 00:09:32.070
so all you need to know
about what happened

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.211
in Napa Valley vineyards.

00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:36.470
So, without further
ado, I'll let Dean Doyle

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.130
make an introduction of
our guest lecturer to you.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.220
And stay tuned for the interesting lecture

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.670
as well as some wine
tasting after the lecture.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.187
Thank you.

00:09:46.187 --> 00:09:49.354
(audience applauding)

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:52.840
- Thank you so much, Esther,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.566
and to you and Harvey for your generosity.

00:09:56.566 --> 00:09:59.655
So without further ado, we'll
move onto the main event.

00:09:59.655 --> 00:10:04.655
I'm very pleased to
introduce Frances Dinkelspiel

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.940
who is an award-winning
author and journalist.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.687
She's based in Berkeley,
which is wonderful,

00:10:10.687 --> 00:10:13.810
since we'll learn in a second or two

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.855
that she's a Stanford graduate.

00:10:15.855 --> 00:10:17.160
(laughs)
(audience laughing)

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.253
I promised her I'd make a dig about that.

00:10:21.678 --> 00:10:23.510
And we thought that

00:10:24.392 --> 00:10:28.250
a very engaging way to

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.427
organize this afternoon
was as a conversation,

00:10:31.427 --> 00:10:34.463
rather than a lecture, as such.

00:10:35.763 --> 00:10:39.370
So Frances will be in
conversation with Deirdre English,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:44.250
a lecturer in our graduate
school of journalism here.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.760
And they're going to discuss
how power, money, gold

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.539
and wine all contributed to
the making of California,

00:10:51.539 --> 00:10:53.120
then and even today.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.660
And that covers I think at least one

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.530
of the favorite themes of
many people in this room.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.990
So I'm certainly looking forward

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.872
to the conversation immensely.

00:11:01.872 --> 00:11:05.600
Frances has delivered
more than 200 lectures

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.062
on the history of California,

00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:09.250
including the role the Jews made

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.067
to the development of the state.

00:11:11.067 --> 00:11:14.500
In 2009, she co-founded Berkeleyside,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.116
with which many of you,
I'm sure are very familiar,

00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:20.530
an online news site that has since

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.050
twice won the Best
Community News Site Award

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.280
from the Northern California Society

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.950
of Professional Journalists.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.396
In 2013, Dinkelspiel helped created Nosh,

00:11:31.396 --> 00:11:34.769
another of my favorite themes, (chuckles)

00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:38.606
a website about the food
scene in the East Bay.

00:11:38.606 --> 00:11:41.840
As I mentioned, Frances is a graduate

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.869
of Stanford University and
The Columbia University

00:11:44.869 --> 00:11:46.854
School of Journalism.

00:11:46.854 --> 00:11:49.530
She began her reporting career

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.691
at the Syracuse newspapers
in upstate New York

00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:57.512
and then moved to the
San Jose Mercury News.

00:11:57.512 --> 00:11:59.430
She's written for the New York Times,

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.130
the Wall Street Journal,
the Los Angeles Times,

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.513
People Magazine, San Francisco Chronicle,

00:12:04.513 --> 00:12:07.718
San Francisco Magazine, and more.

00:12:07.718 --> 00:12:11.730
Her first book, Towers of Gold:

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.840
How One Jewish Immigrant
Named Isaias Hellman

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.160
Created California, was
a San Francisco Chronicle

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.140
best seller, a finalist
for the Northern California

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.580
Book Awards, and was the
Best Book of the Year

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.730
named by both the San Francisco Chronicle

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.830
and the Northern California

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.317
Independent Book Sellers Association.

00:12:30.317 --> 00:12:32.155
Her most recent book

00:12:32.155 --> 00:12:35.162
appears to be getting similar acclaim,

00:12:35.162 --> 00:12:38.290
Tangled Vines, as Esther mentioned,

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.362
but the subtitle is truly intriguing,

00:12:41.362 --> 00:12:44.610
Greed, Murder, Obsession and an Arsonist

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.810
in the Vineyards of California.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.090
And this is a New York Times

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.323
and San Francisco Chronicle Best Seller.

00:12:52.176 --> 00:12:55.890
Deirdre English is a
former editor-in-chief

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.570
of the award-winning and
influential Mother Jones Magazine.

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.200
She was a founder of one of the first

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.564
women's studies programs in the US

00:13:03.564 --> 00:13:06.398
and it's taught at several
colleges and universities.

00:13:06.398 --> 00:13:11.398
She has written and edited work
on a wide array of subjects

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.330
related to investigative reporting,

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.000
cultural politics, gender studies,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.751
and public policy.

00:13:18.751 --> 00:13:21.900
She's been with Berkeley's
Graduate School of Journalism

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.170
since 1997.

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:27.210
So please join me in
welcoming Frances Dinkelspiel

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:29.723
and Deirdre English to the stage.

00:13:29.723 --> 00:13:32.890
(audience applauding)

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:41.343
Great and welcome.

00:13:41.343 --> 00:13:42.755
- Thank you.
- I'm so looking forward

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.588
to hearing (drowned by distance).

00:13:43.588 --> 00:13:44.588
- Thank you.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:53.220
- Well, (chuckles) gold leads to money,

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.433
leads to power, leads to wine.

00:13:56.433 --> 00:13:59.170
(audience laughing)
So it won't be hard

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.810
for us to hit on all those topics.

00:14:00.810 --> 00:14:02.430
And obviously we fit very comfortably

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.335
under the rubric of the HarvEst moniker.

00:14:07.335 --> 00:14:10.270
And in celebration of you as a

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:15.270
outstanding woman leader and author.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.737
So let's just plunge right in.

00:14:17.737 --> 00:14:20.350
I've really enjoyed reading
both of these books.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.290
I think they're extraordinary,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.520
Towers of Gold, the story
of Frances Dinkelspiel's

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.244
great-great grandfather, Isaias Hellman,

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:34.843
and the bold sub-head in the

00:14:36.264 --> 00:14:39.240
creating of California is something

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.014
we'll ask you to defend.

00:14:41.014 --> 00:14:45.000
And that's a wonderful book that is

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.750
a business history of California

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:50.980
and an interesting way into

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.540
those of you who haven't
studied California history

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.840
in great depth, it's an
actually quite an interesting

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.513
way to look at it,

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.370
because it goes from the Gold Rush

00:15:04.171 --> 00:15:07.030
up unto almost contemporary times.

00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:08.500
It's very recognizable

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.760
and it covers everything
from land development

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.330
to the development of banking and finance.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.990
And then Frances, in her second book,

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:22.230
kind of takes something that
began in the first book,

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.170
Towers of Gold, but
that she really explores

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:27.101
in Tangled Vines, her second book,

00:15:27.101 --> 00:15:31.420
which is that her
great-great-grandfather, Isaias Hellman,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.681
invested in a vineyard,

00:15:34.681 --> 00:15:39.040
in Cucamonga Vineyard
in Southern California

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:40.570
when he was there.

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:43.860
And, eventually, Isaias Hellman moved

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.610
from Souther California
to Northern California

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:49.640
and the wine industry also moves

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.951
from Souther California
to Northern California,

00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:54.940
for different reasons,

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:56.737
but they remain tangled.

00:15:56.737 --> 00:16:01.737
So we will be talking
more about win industry

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.280
and the dark side of the wine industry,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:06.480
which Frances gets into in great depth,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.489
the labor exploitation,
the fraud, the greed,

00:16:10.489 --> 00:16:12.940
the arson, the criminal behavior

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.120
and the threats that continue to this day,

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:20.248
the fraudulent marketing of some wines.

00:16:20.248 --> 00:16:24.497
So it's a interconnected history.

00:16:24.497 --> 00:16:26.633
I think you've masterfully

00:16:26.633 --> 00:16:28.720
woven all of these threads together.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.210
And we agreed that
instead of just focusing

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.020
on Tangled Vines today, we'll try to do

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.430
a little bit of a timeline
through both of the books

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.080
so that we'll start with
talking about Isaias Hellman

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.920
right from the very beginning

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.920
and then weave it into the current book.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.900
So let's just start with talking about

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.100
Isaias Hellman himself and as we were,

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.450
just a few minutes ago.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.013
He was very young when
he came to this country.

00:16:55.890 --> 00:16:57.520
Who was he?

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.400
- So Isaias Hellman was
born in Reckendorf, Germany,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.856
which at the time was part of

00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:07.880
Franconia, one of the states of Germany.

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.700
It later became part of Bavaria.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.660
And he was a Jewish boy who was born

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.110
to a family where his father was a weaver

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.070
and his uncle was a cattle trader.

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:22.758
And Jews in Germany were not
accorded full citizenship.

00:17:22.758 --> 00:17:26.650
And although the town
that Hellman lived in

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.489
had the Catholics and the
Jews had good relations,

00:17:30.489 --> 00:17:33.910
it became very clear by the
middle of the 19th Century

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.526
that the future for
Jews was not in Germany.

00:17:36.526 --> 00:17:40.595
And there had already been a
migration of a number of Jews

00:17:40.595 --> 00:17:43.590
leaving central Europe to
come to the United States.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:44.864
But when the Gold Rush hit,

00:17:44.864 --> 00:17:48.570
it completely accelerated that emigration.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.170
And so Hellman came to
the United States in 1859.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.410
And even though that was 10
years after the Gold Rush,

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.530
it's still considered sort of part of

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.827
the Gold Rush emigration.
- And he was 17-years-old?

00:17:59.827 --> 00:18:01.391
- He was 16-years-old

00:18:01.391 --> 00:18:03.880
when he came.
- 16 and had had

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:07.460
a little bit of secondary education, but--

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.293
- Not not much.

00:18:08.293 --> 00:18:10.330
- Not a college education
or anything like that.

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.180
But he was a European, he was a German.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.360
And he came from if
not a bourgeois family,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.270
certainly he had seen bourgeois life,

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.365
he'd seen city life, he
knew what banking was.

00:18:19.365 --> 00:18:21.050
- Well, yes, he had...

00:18:22.418 --> 00:18:23.870
You know, the town that he lived in

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:25.650
only had 900 people living there.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:30.400
But his father was a
weaver and also a peddler.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.030
And I don't know for a
fact, but I imagine that

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:36.380
Isaias accompanied him
to towns in Germany.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.676
He was also sent to secondary school

00:18:38.676 --> 00:18:41.280
in a town about 50 miles away Reckendorf.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.794
And so although he

00:18:44.794 --> 00:18:47.523
grew up in sort of a
more rural environment,

00:18:47.523 --> 00:18:52.020
this was a very intellectual
time in central Europe.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.100
I mean, this was, you know,
Napoleon had been there.

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.040
There were all these revolutions going on.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.040
I mean, there was a certain
level of sophistication

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.337
that he would've been exposed to.

00:19:01.337 --> 00:19:03.420
- So coming to California then,

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.550
to frontier California.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.790
That time, Los Angeles had
maybe 4,000, 5,000 residents.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.160
And I love one fact that you said

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.171
of 30 to 40 murders a day.

00:19:12.171 --> 00:19:13.670
- No, no, not a day.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:15.160
- Oh, month, a month.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.840
- (laughs) Yeah, yeah.
(audience laughing)

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.630
- A month.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.700
And so it's the wild west.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.370
And it's a little bit,
must've been for him,

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.482
a little bit like going backwards in time

00:19:24.482 --> 00:19:26.142
to a rougher time,

00:19:26.142 --> 00:19:29.160
but he saw a great deal of opportunity,

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.621
as did so many other people.

00:19:30.621 --> 00:19:33.190
So it has often said that the people

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.780
who really made the great
fortunes out of the Gold Rush

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:38.657
were the people who sold
things to the miners.

00:19:38.657 --> 00:19:39.610
- [Frances] Right, right.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.700
- And, indeed, he went into
the dry goods business, right?

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.790
- Right, exactly.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.489
So for Hellman and for many
other Jews who arrived,

00:19:46.489 --> 00:19:49.022
California was different from any place

00:19:49.022 --> 00:19:50.459
they'd ever been before.

00:19:50.459 --> 00:19:53.036
And their experiences were
different than the Jews

00:19:53.036 --> 00:19:55.890
in New York, because in California,

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:57.754
people were so focused on getting rich

00:19:57.754 --> 00:20:00.300
that they hadn't created
social hierarchies

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.760
that oppressed a lot of classes.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.300
I mean, there was discrimination against

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.711
African Americans and Chinese,

00:20:07.711 --> 00:20:10.350
but against Jews, they
were regarded as white.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.810
And it was a frontier, and nothing,

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:17.800
there was no telegraph service
between San Francisco and LA.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.407
There was no train between the two cities,

00:20:20.407 --> 00:20:22.040
there were barely any roads.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:24.969
So essentially it was a
completely undeveloped landscape.

00:20:24.969 --> 00:20:26.890
- [Deirdre] And there
was no banking industry.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.510
- No banking industry, right.

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:30.160
- In fact, one thing I
learned from your book

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:32.730
is that California had
actually outlawed banking?

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.660
- Yes, so what happened
was there was so much gold

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.073
in California, when they wrote
the California Constitution,

00:20:38.073 --> 00:20:42.590
they decided not to let
banks operate in the state.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.389
And this is for complicated reasons.

00:20:44.389 --> 00:20:47.071
It had to do with something
called the Free Banking Era,

00:20:47.071 --> 00:20:49.810
when banks would just print
up their own bank notes

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.098
and there was a lot of
people lost a lot of money.

00:20:52.098 --> 00:20:54.136
So banks were outlawed.

00:20:54.136 --> 00:20:57.110
But that didn't mean
people didn't set up banks.

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:58.950
It just meant they were not regulated,

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:02.082
there was no minimum
financial requirements.

00:21:02.082 --> 00:21:04.590
And, in fact, outlawing them probably

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.620
made things more volatile in the economy.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:09.790
- [Deirdre] And more
higher interest rates,

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.080
because people had to get
their loans from individuals

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:13.913
typically.
- Exactly.

00:21:13.913 --> 00:21:16.268
- So your great-great-grandfather

00:21:16.268 --> 00:21:18.508
founded a bank in LA.

00:21:18.508 --> 00:21:21.750
And he called it the
Farmers and Mechanics Bank.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:22.583
- [Frances] Farmers and Merchants Bank.

00:21:22.583 --> 00:21:24.370
- Farmers and Merchants Bank.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.150
And he began to loan money to people in LA

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:29.270
at more reasonable rates.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:30.280
- [Frances] Right, right.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.440
- And he did very well.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.340
- He did very well.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.025
So the bank opened in 1871.

00:21:34.025 --> 00:21:36.250
And his business partner was the former

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.710
Governor of California,

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.970
which was I think a pretty good pick.

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.820
And, yeah, so what they did

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.390
was that they were able
to normalize the economy

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:46.820
on some level by offering

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.930
a lower interest rate.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:52.470
Interest rates in those
days could be 5% a month.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.810
And so I'm sure many of you've heard

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.520
of the huge transfer of land

00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.483
from the Californios, the
Mexican-born Californians,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:03.849
to the Americans.

00:22:03.849 --> 00:22:06.115
And a lot of that was
because the Californios

00:22:06.115 --> 00:22:09.460
borrowed money and put up
their land as collateral,

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.630
not really understanding
that compound and interest

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:15.250
was gonna increase their
debts phenomenally.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.697
So Hellman came in, was
able to offer good rates.

00:22:19.697 --> 00:22:22.910
And brought capital to the city.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.700
People needed to borrow
money to buy houses

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.860
and do businesses.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.500
- And Isaias Hellman
arrived with his brother.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.333
- Yes.

00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:32.166
- Herman.

00:22:32.166 --> 00:22:33.074
- Yes.

00:22:33.074 --> 00:22:33.970
- And that's maybe worth mentioning,

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:36.210
because later they were at odds.

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:39.160
And the stormy personal history being

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.340
there are many ups and downs
in business, over time,

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.930
and Hellman experienced them,

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:46.350
and sometimes they take a
toll on personal relations.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:47.966
And it certainly happened
between these two brothers.

00:22:47.966 --> 00:22:50.550
But at that time they were
still in business together.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.686
And who else did he go into business with?

00:22:52.686 --> 00:22:56.130
- So this is one of the interesting

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.292
things about Los Angeles.

00:22:57.292 --> 00:23:00.950
It was a society that
really all the groups

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.840
sort of mixed together, the Californios,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.677
the Americans, the Europeans.

00:23:05.677 --> 00:23:09.741
It was a time, to some
degree, of business harmony.

00:23:09.741 --> 00:23:14.020
There were other tensions
around other things.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.960
So his business partners were
Basques, they were Irishmen,

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.821
they were Germans, they
were other Americans.

00:23:19.821 --> 00:23:21.430
So what had happened,

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.667
Los Angeles was a city
that was never meant to be,

00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:27.130
because there's no natural port,

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.317
there's no navigable river,

00:23:28.317 --> 00:23:29.900
there are no minerals.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:32.360
There's no reason a city
should've grown up there.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.150
But a group of people
sort of banded together

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.550
and almost willed Los
Angeles into existence,

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:38.899
including Isaias Hellman,

00:23:38.899 --> 00:23:43.550
by really focusing on business
development in Los Angeles.

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:45.220
And that's why the city took off.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.970
I mean, it always--
- So water.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.803
- Water.

00:23:47.803 --> 00:23:48.710
- Energy.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:50.330
- Water and trains.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.403
Those were the two most important
things in the beginning.

00:23:52.403 --> 00:23:54.848
Agriculture was a very important product.

00:23:54.848 --> 00:23:59.280
And, eventually, of course,

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.794
water, power and oil
were really important.

00:24:02.794 --> 00:24:04.569
- But first the trolleys, right?

00:24:04.569 --> 00:24:07.135
Building a trolley cart
system in Los Angeles.

00:24:07.135 --> 00:24:10.399
And then he brought a great deal of land.

00:24:10.399 --> 00:24:12.830
And he donated some of that to found

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.774
The University of Southern California,

00:24:14.774 --> 00:24:17.820
which increased the value
of the land around it.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.653
- [Frances] Right. (chuckles)

00:24:18.653 --> 00:24:23.580
- And his mastery of
horizontal integration,

00:24:24.756 --> 00:24:27.520
his control of the
trolleys also allowed him

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.340
to run a trolley to the campus,

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.470
which also helped to increase the value

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.860
of the surrounding land.
- That's right, right.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.260
- So he was able to exploit
many different industries,

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.480
many different businesses
as well as banking

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.333
and have so many different partners.

00:24:44.776 --> 00:24:47.413
When did he buy Rancho Cucamonga?

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.700
- So Rancho Cucamonga
is the place where...

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:57.073
My book Tangled Vines
talks about this fire

00:24:57.073 --> 00:25:01.400
and that destroyed four-and-a-half
million bottles of wine.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.980
And among the wine that was destroyed,

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.861
were 175 bottles made by
Isaias Hellman in 1875

00:25:06.861 --> 00:25:10.313
from a vineyard in Rancho Cucamonga.

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.920
So he bought Rancho Cucamonga in 1870, 71.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.870
So he was very young at that point.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:23.373
It was before he started
Farmers And Merchants Bank.

00:25:23.373 --> 00:25:26.360
But he got together a
syndicate of businessmen

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.490
in San Francisco.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.104
And they bought this land
that was being foreclosed upon

00:25:31.104 --> 00:25:35.421
because the widow who owned
it couldn't pay her debts.

00:25:35.421 --> 00:25:40.193
And, yeah, it was a business deal for him.

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:45.421
- So what was the state
of grape cultivation

00:25:45.421 --> 00:25:48.185
and wine-making in
California at that time?

00:25:48.185 --> 00:25:51.340
What was the history before Isaias Hellman

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.470
ever came to this country?

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.410
- So I think a lot of people don't realize

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:56.560
that the California wine industry

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.070
got its start not in Napa or Sonoma,

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.800
but in Southern California.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.717
And that was primarily because

00:26:02.717 --> 00:26:07.240
Father Junipero Serra who
started the mission system,

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.975
he brought up grapes from Baja California

00:26:09.975 --> 00:26:12.164
and planted them to make sacramental wine.

00:26:12.164 --> 00:26:15.664
And he brought up a grape
variety called Mission Grapes,

00:26:15.664 --> 00:26:17.860
which were really, really hearty grapes

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.040
that did well in the hot
suns of Southern California.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.520
- [Deirdre] Were they already
called Mission Grapes?

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.842
- No, no, no.

00:26:23.842 --> 00:26:25.990
- [Deirdre] They were named
after the California missions.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.420
- They were named after
the California missions.

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.687
That's not their Latin name.

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:30.917
- Well. (laughs)
- Of course, really.

00:26:30.917 --> 00:26:35.030
So Los Angeles was known
as The City of Vines

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.840
because grapes growing
did really, really well.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:42.840
And probably by the 1850s
there were 100 vineyards

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.100
in the city of Los Angeles,

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.380
people making wine for local consumption

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.180
and a little bit for export.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.209
The export really hadn't
taken off by then.

00:26:52.209 --> 00:26:54.260
But it was a growing business.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.290
So after everyone rushed to California

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:58.166
to make money in the gold mines,

00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:00.560
when that sort of ran out,

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.830
or it became part of large corporations

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.060
started taking over the
gold mining industry,

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.580
people looked for other
businesses to go in.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.200
And agriculture was, of course,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.740
one of the most important things.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.670
And a lot of people thought growing grapes

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:16.910
and making wine was a growing industry.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.440
And, in fact, they got tax
breaks for planting vineyards

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.610
and things like that.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:26.610
So when Hellman bought
the Cucamonga vineyard

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:29.764
in 1871, California had a pretty vibrant

00:27:29.764 --> 00:27:32.570
wine business going on.
- All this one

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:33.403
type of grape.

00:27:33.403 --> 00:27:37.521
- Mostly, it was
predominantly Mission Grapes

00:27:37.521 --> 00:27:39.790
until 1890 in California.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.460
And one thing it's important to know

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.400
is Mission Grape made really crummy wine.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.483
I mean it was...

00:27:46.092 --> 00:27:49.145
And there wine making methods
were not very sophisticated

00:27:49.145 --> 00:27:52.150
so even if they had better grapes,

00:27:52.150 --> 00:27:53.634
the wine wasn't always so good.

00:27:53.634 --> 00:27:57.317
It made sort of dry, it made flat wine

00:27:57.317 --> 00:27:58.928
that didn't have a lot of acidity.

00:27:58.928 --> 00:28:02.207
There was a push to
bring in other kinds of

00:28:02.207 --> 00:28:04.160
grape vines to California,

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.100
starting around 1860 there
was a really big push.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.610
And slowly there was a transition from

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.870
having Mission Grapes
be the number one grape

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:14.250
to having other varieties.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.668
But that--

00:28:15.668 --> 00:28:16.766
- Is that a red varietal or--

00:28:16.766 --> 00:28:20.610
- Mission, well, you can
make white wine, too,

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:21.655
from red grapes.

00:28:21.655 --> 00:28:22.488
- From the red.
- But, yeah, Mission

00:28:22.488 --> 00:28:24.800
is a red grape.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:28.760
I mean, most of the wine
was port was made from it

00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.523
and red wine and stuff like that.

00:28:32.261 --> 00:28:34.460
- So it all depends on whether
you process the skin or not.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.000
- Yeah, exactly.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.017
- But they did win an award,

00:28:39.017 --> 00:28:43.155
such as it may have been,
for the quality of their wine

00:28:43.155 --> 00:28:44.470
at the time.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:48.210
- Yeah, so Rancho Cucamonga
actually became very well known

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.293
for the wine it made.

00:28:50.659 --> 00:28:53.850
A lot of ways wine makers
made wine taste better

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.720
was to fortify it.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.379
They would just turn a ton
brandy into the white wine.

00:28:58.379 --> 00:28:59.212
(audience laughing)

00:28:59.212 --> 00:29:00.769
And the red wine.

00:29:00.769 --> 00:29:03.790
So I found some great scenes in my book

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.345
of 49ers trying to make
it over the mountains.

00:29:06.345 --> 00:29:08.860
And they were trudging through the deserts

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.430
and they were really
tired and cold and hungry.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:14.501
And one of the first settled
places they came upon

00:29:14.501 --> 00:29:16.039
was Rancho Cucamonga.

00:29:16.039 --> 00:29:19.500
And they ran into the people making wine

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:21.624
and they sort of just
guzzled this wine down.

00:29:21.624 --> 00:29:23.479
And they were very happy after that.

00:29:23.479 --> 00:29:25.211
(audience laughing)

00:29:25.211 --> 00:29:27.379
But, you know, in the beginning,

00:29:27.379 --> 00:29:31.340
the methods that they made
wine were very primitive.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.990
They didn't have a lot of barrels here.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:38.620
So Native Americans, they
used to string up cow hides

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.275
on poles, and Native Americans
would stomp their grapes

00:29:42.275 --> 00:29:46.365
and squish the grapes in the cow hides.

00:29:46.365 --> 00:29:50.570
And then they would sometimes
have high kind of containers

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.775
to ferment the wine.

00:29:51.775 --> 00:29:52.670
And eventually--

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:55.130
- [Deirdre] And this
was almost slave labor.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.203
- It definitely was slave labor.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.920
So eventually

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:07.810
they learned how to make better wine.

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.350
But for a long time, people
were just cutting corners

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.270
to make money.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.620
It was just seen as a product,

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.480
not really something that
was particularly special.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.160
- Now, at some point is
it that Isaias Hellman

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.490
saved some barrels of wine

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:21.883
that eventually became the 175 bottles

00:30:21.883 --> 00:30:26.405
that you finally lost in the arson episode

00:30:26.405 --> 00:30:28.033
many decades later?

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:31.219
- I don't 100% know.

00:30:31.219 --> 00:30:34.670
So here I am writing
this book about this wine

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.148
that was made in 1875.

00:30:36.148 --> 00:30:39.077
And I kept asking myself,
"Why does the family

00:30:39.077 --> 00:30:40.610
"have this old wine?"

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:44.360
We don't have 1873 wine or
1881 wine, we just have all

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.143
this wine from 1875.

00:30:47.289 --> 00:30:48.963
- [Deirdre] Or had, right?

00:30:48.963 --> 00:30:49.960
- Or had, right, right.
(Deirdre chuckles)

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:53.280
And I think, I figured it
out, which I go to in the book

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.220
that it had been a particularly good year

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.980
and they must have like
put a few barrels aside

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.680
and people forgot about it.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.280
And so when they were
discovered around 1920

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.030
after Hellman died, they were then bottled

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:08.010
at that point.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:09.964
- And they were bottled
because during prohibition,

00:31:09.964 --> 00:31:14.964
your family wanted to be able
to take those bottles of wine,

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.850
barrels of wine, put them into bottles,

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:17.990
and give them to the family.

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.823
- Yes, right, right.
- Right?

00:31:18.823 --> 00:31:21.170
So that you could enjoy
yourselves at home.

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:22.003
- Right.

00:31:23.243 --> 00:31:24.770
- [Deirdre] Not you, personally.

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:26.050
- Right, no.
(Deirdre laughs)

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.444
People don't know that during prohibition,

00:31:28.444 --> 00:31:32.410
individuals were allowed
to make up to 200 gallons

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:33.543
of wine a year.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.660
- [Deirdre] That would
be quite an incentive.

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:37.980
- It is quite an incentive.
- For people to go out

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.050
and grow their own vineyards

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.330
- Well, you know what happened was,

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:42.610
so prohibition came and
you think immediately

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.950
that all the vineyards
in California went broke.

00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:46.920
But, in fact, they made
more money the next year

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.680
because they just shipped their grapes

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.260
across the country to New York.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.347
And people were lining up,

00:31:52.347 --> 00:31:54.620
the boxcars would come in,

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:56.353
and people were lining
up to buy the grapes

00:31:56.353 --> 00:31:58.150
in order to make their own wine.

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.890
And so that was a good
business for a couple years.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.570
And then finally it fizzled.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.909
So, actually, what did
lead to the downfall

00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:09.909
of the LA-based vineyard
agricultural economy?

00:32:11.713 --> 00:32:14.278
- So Los Angeles and Southern California

00:32:14.278 --> 00:32:19.198
were the biggest wine growing
areas until the late 1880s.

00:32:19.198 --> 00:32:21.980
And what happened was

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.310
a blight hit, something
called Pierce's Disease.

00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:30.290
And within two years it
had completely decimated

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.390
most of the vineyards
in Southern California.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.029
And by that point, there
was rapid industrialization

00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:38.652
around Los Angeles.

00:32:38.652 --> 00:32:40.551
Land was much more at a premium

00:32:40.551 --> 00:32:42.450
than it had been previously.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.110
There was a boom that went on.

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:47.831
And so lots of those
parcels were not planted

00:32:47.831 --> 00:32:49.660
back into wine.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:50.510
And of course it was--

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.021
- [Deirdre] The land became
more valuable for housing

00:32:52.021 --> 00:32:53.990
than for vineyards.
- For housing, or for oranges.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:57.077
Oranges became, of course,
the huge crop of Los Angeles.

00:32:57.077 --> 00:33:00.680
And so the other thing was the realization

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.240
that Southern California was actually

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.060
not the best climate for wine,

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.530
that Northern California
was a much better climate

00:33:06.530 --> 00:33:10.130
to grow grapes, because
it's hot all the time in LA

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:11.760
and Southern California.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.040
In Napa and Sonoma
Counties, one of the reasons

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.444
they make such good wine is

00:33:15.444 --> 00:33:17.533
they're very warm during the day,

00:33:17.533 --> 00:33:19.640
but the temperature drops

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:21.680
pretty significantly at night.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.352
And that sort of combination

00:33:23.352 --> 00:33:27.834
is the ideal circumstances
in which grapes grow.

00:33:27.834 --> 00:33:32.300
- Big decline in fog now in
Northern California that may

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.430
affect the vineyards.
- Oh, sure, climate change

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.369
is a huge issue for--

00:33:36.369 --> 00:33:38.439
- We're not up to the present yet.

00:33:38.439 --> 00:33:43.439
So the wine industry basically collapsed,

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.870
or the vineyards collapsed in LA,

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.830
not entirely, but to a great extent.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:50.770
And what is it that
made Isaias Hellman move

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.053
to Northern California?

00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:59.020
- Well, so Isaias was very
prominent in Southern California.

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:03.294
And he was probably the
biggest banker in Los Angeles.

00:34:03.294 --> 00:34:05.460
He just had one little problem,

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:07.450
which was he had a brother-in-law

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.793
whose name was Mayer
Lehman of Lehman Brothers.

00:34:09.793 --> 00:34:13.030
And I think Isaias felt

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:15.570
that he wasn't as important
as his brother-in-law.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.250
And this is a little
conjecture on my part.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.310
And so I think he wanted
to go to a bigger arena.

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:26.310
So in 1890, he took over
something called the Nevada Bank,

00:34:26.945 --> 00:34:31.760
which had been founded by
four Silver Kings in 1875.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.540
It had been once the most largest

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.468
capitalized bank in the United States.

00:34:37.468 --> 00:34:40.520
But it had fallen on hard times.

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:42.110
And so Hellman bought it

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.440
and moved up to Northern
California to take it over.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:49.450
San Francisco was the center
of California at the time.

00:34:49.450 --> 00:34:52.510
There were more millionaires
per capita in San Francisco

00:34:52.510 --> 00:34:54.149
than in New York at that time.

00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:55.917
It was a very vibrant economy

00:34:55.917 --> 00:34:57.858
and he wanted to--

00:34:57.858 --> 00:34:59.550
- [Deirdre] What would you
say the size of San Francisco

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:00.830
was compared to LA?

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.270
- Oh, LA was very tiny.

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:04.970
It was fewer than 25,000 people in 1890.

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:08.550
And I'm not sure about San Francisco,

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:11.280
but it was probably
more than 100,000, yeah.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.927
LA didn't really surpass San Francisco

00:35:14.927 --> 00:35:18.480
in population until after
the turn of the century.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.261
- So the Hellman was, by
this point, a rich man.

00:35:21.261 --> 00:35:24.750
And he saw the opportunity
to become much richer.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.810
And he wanted to play
in, move to the big city

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:28.820
and play in the big time.

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.796
And he built himself
an incredible mansion.

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:33.891
Tell us about his mansion.

00:35:33.891 --> 00:35:38.891
- Well, it was on Sacramento
and Franklin Streets.

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.870
It had been built by a
man named Nathaniel Cole

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:45.520
who was a ship's captain.

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:50.490
And it was in an area that at that point

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:51.900
was called the Western Addition,

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:54.470
but they eventually renamed
it sort of Pacific Heights

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:55.775
to make it sound better.

00:35:55.775 --> 00:35:59.013
And, yeah, he lived...

00:35:59.013 --> 00:36:02.330
And very funny thing is he
lived in this very fancy house

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:07.181
but he lived just like
two doors down from his

00:36:07.181 --> 00:36:10.252
childhood friend, a
guy named Isaac Walter,

00:36:10.252 --> 00:36:12.114
with whom he'd grown up in Germany.

00:36:12.114 --> 00:36:15.076
And just a couple other houses down

00:36:15.076 --> 00:36:18.690
was another childhood
friend from the same town,

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.350
Reckendorf, the Haases.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:21.860
Many of you, of course, being at Cal,

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.180
you know the Haas family.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:26.010
So this was really a
fun thing to think about

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.260
that here are these men

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.799
who'd all come to California,
who'd all struck in rich.

00:36:30.799 --> 00:36:33.530
They'd all been playmates back in Germany

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:37.330
and they continued their
friendship in California.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:38.970
And they used to walk to work together

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.368
like a couple times a week,

00:36:40.368 --> 00:36:42.340
you know, to Downtown.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:45.450
- And there were other Jewish
immigrants from Germany

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:48.850
who did very well in America, who invested

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.280
in each other's
businesses, became partners

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.930
and continued to expand their network.

00:36:53.930 --> 00:36:55.210
- That's right.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.560
That's very important sort of...

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:03.446
That's how the Jews
did well in California.

00:37:03.446 --> 00:37:06.320
One brother would come
over, raise some money,

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.780
bring over another
brother or another cousin.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.770
Some of them would be in San Francisco

00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.130
or Los Angeles or Portland or Seattle.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.530
And they would all do
business with one another.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.640
Hellman, when he had his dry goods store,

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.227
he would buy dry goods
from the Haas family here.

00:37:21.227 --> 00:37:26.227
When Abe Haas started a canning factory,

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.615
he would ask his Jewish
friends to be investors.

00:37:29.615 --> 00:37:32.920
When Isaias Hellmans came
and bought Nevada Bank,

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.420
he asked his Jewish friends
to invest in Nevada Bank.

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.194
He asked non-Jews as well.

00:37:38.194 --> 00:37:40.810
But what happened was it was like,

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:42.293
you know, what's the term?

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.499
Rising tide lifts all boats.

00:37:44.499 --> 00:37:48.010
And so a lot of the German
Jews and French Jews

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:51.090
who came to California in
the 1850s grew very affluent

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:52.540
together at the same time

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.400
because they cooperated with one another

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.023
and they helped one
another out business-wise.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.222
- So at the same time,

00:38:01.222 --> 00:38:04.400
Hellman had a nephew who he had brought

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.790
into his home for seven years,

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:09.670
and who he hired to be the
chief cashier at his bank.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:10.984
- [Frances] Right.

00:38:10.984 --> 00:38:13.757
- But this is where his business interest

00:38:13.757 --> 00:38:16.870
and his family interest came
into a tremendous clash.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:18.030
- Yes.

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.748
So this was really fun to find out.

00:38:20.748 --> 00:38:24.090
Hellman had a cousin, a
guy named Henry Fleischman,

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:25.589
who he regarded as a son.

00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:27.850
And he lived in his house

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.823
and he had installed him in the bank.

00:38:30.823 --> 00:38:35.122
And one day Henry Fleischman,

00:38:35.122 --> 00:38:39.460
Henry Fleischman was a
big, had a high position

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.450
in the bank in Los Angeles,
the Farmers and Merchants Bank.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.433
But one day he did not show up to work.

00:38:44.433 --> 00:38:49.433
And a sort of scouring
of the books showed that

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:54.660
Fleischman had left with
about $100,000 from the bank.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.825
And he had fled Los Angeles
and no one knew where he was.

00:38:58.825 --> 00:39:02.770
And this was apparently at the time

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:06.000
the largest embezzlement of
a bank in California history.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.651
It made all the headlines
all over the state.

00:39:09.651 --> 00:39:12.970
There were Pinkerton
guards looking for him.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.181
There were cops at all the train stations

00:39:15.181 --> 00:39:17.233
throughout California.

00:39:17.233 --> 00:39:19.001
Then he was spotted in Mexico.

00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:22.288
And emissaries were
sent to try to find him.

00:39:22.288 --> 00:39:26.710
But he managed to escape
with all that money

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.830
and he wasn't caught.

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.290
- And this caused a
tremendous breach between

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.610
Isaias and his brother Herman.

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:32.443
- That's correct.

00:39:32.443 --> 00:39:36.410
So Isaias Hellman was very
pig-headed in a lot of ways.

00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:39.770
He liked what he liked an
he was very loyal to family.

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.751
And he really admired this cousin Henry,

00:39:42.751 --> 00:39:44.610
whereas his brother Herman,

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:49.610
who actually was heading
up this bank in LA,

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:53.000
thought Henry, there were
some things about Henry

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.833
he didn't like.

00:39:53.833 --> 00:39:57.120
And he tried to get Isaias to fire Henry

00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.463
and Isaias refused.

00:39:58.463 --> 00:40:01.960
And it caused a big rift
between the brothers

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.471
that would later sort of force them apart.

00:40:04.471 --> 00:40:07.140
So he was kind of myopic, Isaias,

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.822
he didn't wanna see
what he should've seen.

00:40:09.822 --> 00:40:12.610
- Well, we would be surprised

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.840
if such a powerful and
successful businessman

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.710
as Isaias Hellman did not
have a big ego to match.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.020
- Yes, of course, of course, yes.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:22.764
- So his brother calls
him something of a tyrant

00:40:22.764 --> 00:40:26.600
and doesn't wanna do business
with him anymore after that.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.570
- So one of the things
I found very interesting

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.093
in doing the research was that I think

00:40:31.093 --> 00:40:36.093
during that era, men who
became very successful

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.520
believed that they were successful

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.748
not because of their luck.

00:40:39.748 --> 00:40:42.110
But they believed that
they were successful

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:44.740
because they were inherently
better than a lot of people

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.366
in their world.

00:40:46.366 --> 00:40:48.810
And I think this contributed

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:50.974
to this arrogant attitude of Hellman.

00:40:50.974 --> 00:40:55.974
I think people like him
thought if someone was poor

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.070
it was poor because it was their fault,

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.440
it was their mistake.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:03.267
And it's not that he wouldn't

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.040
have sympathy for people
who were down on their luck.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.310
And he did help people
who's down on their luck.

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:14.600
But I think he believed in
a natural order of things.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.401
And since he had risen to the top,

00:41:16.401 --> 00:41:19.718
it must mean that he had more brains

00:41:19.718 --> 00:41:21.118
than anyone else.
- He felt he deserved it.

00:41:21.118 --> 00:41:22.419
(chuckles)
- Exactly, yeah.

00:41:22.419 --> 00:41:26.900
- So he then became a very active investor

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.179
in the Souther Pacific Railroad.

00:41:28.179 --> 00:41:29.305
- Mm-Hm.

00:41:29.305 --> 00:41:34.305
So just like about a couple years ago,

00:41:34.753 --> 00:41:37.653
I mean, I can't say it's
true for this moment.

00:41:39.241 --> 00:41:40.970
People who wanted to get rich

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:42.810
would start Internet companies, right?

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:45.240
Like let's make an app, let's get rich.

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.060
Well, back in Isaias Hellman's time,

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.910
the way to sort of get rich

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:52.700
was to start a trolley line or to,

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:54.620
yeah, get in the transportation field.

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.415
So Hellman built trolleys at a very early

00:41:57.415 --> 00:41:59.230
era in Los Angeles.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.830
When he moved up to San Francisco,

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.010
he also was involved in trolleys

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.283
and he became a financier for
the Southern Pacific Railroad,

00:42:07.283 --> 00:42:10.766
both in their local lines in San Francisco

00:42:10.766 --> 00:42:14.640
and helping to raise capital
to expand Southern Pacific.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.672
- And then how did become...

00:42:17.672 --> 00:42:20.991
How did he get involved
with Wells Fargo Bank?

00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:23.250
- So what happened was...

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.290
So Collis Huntington
was one of the Big Four

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:31.770
and after he died, his
nephew, Henry Huntington,

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:36.640
hoped that he would be
put in as the head of the

00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.481
Southern Pacific at that
time, but he was not.

00:42:39.481 --> 00:42:43.610
And a couple years later,
a man named Edward Harriman

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.657
purchased the Southern Pacific Railroad.

00:42:45.657 --> 00:42:48.110
It was a huge business coup.

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:50.710
And at that time Southern Pacific Railroad

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:54.170
actually owned a majority
interest in Wells Fargo Express.

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:55.970
Wells Fargo was known as a company

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.020
that delivered gold, delivered passengers.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.820
Its banking functions
were kind of a small part

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.200
of its operation.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.210
And when Harriman bought Southern Pacific

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:06.990
he wanted to get rid of the bank.

00:43:06.990 --> 00:43:09.650
He was sort of like a dragging asset.

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:11.250
So he was friends with Hellman

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:13.440
and he asked Hellman
if he wanted to buy it.

00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.367
- [Deirdre] And what year was that?

00:43:14.367 --> 00:43:16.124
- It was 1905.

00:43:16.124 --> 00:43:17.240
1904.
- 1905.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.580
So the earthquake is coming.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.006
- The earthquake is coming,

00:43:20.006 --> 00:43:20.839
yes, yes, yes.
(Deirdre laughs)

00:43:20.839 --> 00:43:22.240
- And so he's living

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:26.339
in this neighborhood with his Reckendorf--

00:43:26.339 --> 00:43:27.720
- [Frances] Buddies.

00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:29.600
- Friends, boyhood friends.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:31.646
And he's living in this
magnificent mansion

00:43:31.646 --> 00:43:36.646
that's has had all kinds of
frescos and beautiful furniture.

00:43:38.331 --> 00:43:40.330
And the earthquake comes.

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:41.410
- Right.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:44.900
So, yes, the earthquake
comes and, you know,

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.300
the earthquake itself was devastating.

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.440
But it was not as devastating as the fires

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.791
that ripped through the city afterwards.

00:43:53.791 --> 00:43:55.710
- [Deirdre] The city
didn't have any water.

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:56.543
- Right, right.

00:43:56.543 --> 00:43:58.920
- Because the water mains
had been routed through filth

00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:01.070
so they ruptured and the city was helpless

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.510
and couldn't fight the fire.

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:04.300
So the fire burned for three or four days.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.133
- Right.

00:44:05.133 --> 00:44:08.690
And so Hellman had a,

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:11.980
the bank was in something
called the Nevada Block,

00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:13.560
it was on Montgomery and Pine Street.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.360
It was a beautiful building.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:19.120
The fire and earthquake
completely damaged the bank

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.430
and, in fact, damaged most of
the banks in San Francisco.

00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.440
And what this meant was that
there was really no cash

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.918
to go around, because
you couldn't open a bank,

00:44:29.918 --> 00:44:32.870
a bank vault, after a fire.

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:36.550
You had to let the contents inside cool,

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.110
because if you opened the door,

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:41.377
the rush of oxygen would make
all those contents explode.

00:44:41.377 --> 00:44:44.540
And so that process took about three weeks

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.090
to cool down the vaults.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:49.121
And a lot of the money was in the vaults.

00:44:49.121 --> 00:44:52.557
So San Francisco was this city in ruins.

00:44:52.557 --> 00:44:56.550
Nobody had any money to
sort of buy anything,

00:44:56.550 --> 00:44:57.870
to do anything.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.490
And so Hellman was one
of a group of bankers

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:04.522
who got together who
decided to sort of take over

00:45:04.522 --> 00:45:09.390
the banking system by getting
some money from the mints,

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.540
which did survive the earthquake,

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.522
and doling it out in small
increments to their customers.

00:45:14.522 --> 00:45:18.860
And they didn't even know
who their customers were

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:22.110
and they gave out a lot of money on faith.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.590
And it was sort of helped
ease the transition

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:25.997
from this devastated city.

00:45:25.997 --> 00:45:28.770
- And this is also the era of AP Giannini

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:29.603
and the founding

00:45:29.603 --> 00:45:31.320
of the Bank of America.
- That's right.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.670
So there's a famous story.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:35.650
Giannini had only like $80,000.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:37.500
He didn't even have a ton of money.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:39.710
But before the fire happened,

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:41.110
He took all his money out.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:44.130
He put it in a wagon and he
took it down to San Mateo.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:45.959
And after the fire was over,

00:45:45.959 --> 00:45:48.220
while all these others
banks didn't have access

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:52.910
to their money, Giannini
went up to North Beach.

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:55.224
And he was able to give
money out very quickly

00:45:55.224 --> 00:45:57.988
to a lot of his Italian customers.

00:45:57.988 --> 00:46:01.920
And it earned him a
tremendous amount of...

00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:04.397
You know, people were very
happy that they got the money.

00:46:04.397 --> 00:46:08.700
And it sort of really catapulted
Giannini's reputation.

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.507
And certainly the Bank of
America marketed that story

00:46:11.507 --> 00:46:13.060
(Deirdre laughs)
for all it's worth

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.480
for many, many decades, yeah.
(audience laughing)

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:20.190
- So obviously now with
California's most significant city

00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:22.730
in ruins, it needed to rebuild.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:25.120
And to rebuild you need
money and you need credit

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:25.953
and you need loans.

00:46:25.953 --> 00:46:29.180
So suddenly the banks
that were so new, I mean,

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.750
your great-grandfather had only been...

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.580
Was he the president,
nominally, the president

00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:36.413
of the Wells Fargo Bank?

00:46:36.413 --> 00:46:38.280
- [Frances] Yeah, he was
president of Wells Fargo Bank.

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:40.810
- He had only been in
that role for one year

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:41.920
before the earthquake.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:44.650
Suddenly they're in the
role of needing to loan

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:46.060
tremendous amounts of money

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.060
and handle enormous amount of debt

00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:48.893
in order to rebuild

00:46:48.893 --> 00:46:50.410
San Francisco.
- Right, right.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:54.040
So this is was one area where the

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.121
Jewish networks came in handy.

00:46:56.121 --> 00:46:59.880
I know that Hellman had
a lot of relationships

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.444
with banks in New York, banks
run by the Lehman family

00:47:03.444 --> 00:47:07.160
and other banks that they
could access capital.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:12.160
And he actually, they had
relationships with other banks.

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:14.800
So there really wasn't
a tremendous difficulty

00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.190
getting capital in San
Francisco to rebuild.

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:21.453
It was just sort of mostly a
short term kind of dilemma.

00:47:22.881 --> 00:47:24.343
- And then there was a
lot more money to be made

00:47:24.343 --> 00:47:27.005
in the rebuilding of the ruined city.

00:47:27.005 --> 00:47:30.060
And in the meantime, what's
going on in the vineyards

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.340
in Napa?

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.440
- In the vineyards in Napa.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.740
So the story of wine in California

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:37.670
is very interesting

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:40.308
because it is a story of boom and bust.

00:47:40.308 --> 00:47:42.758
I mean, I talked a little
bit about what happened

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:46.372
in Southern California.

00:47:46.372 --> 00:47:50.090
At the same time, all
the vines that were dying

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:51.433
in Southern California,

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:55.230
vines in France were dying as well

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:57.440
of this disease called Phylloxera.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.980
And California has always
struggled to sort of prove itself

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:04.031
as a good wine making state.

00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:07.700
On the East Coast,
starting from the 1860s,

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:10.164
when the first bottle of wine
was imported from California

00:48:10.164 --> 00:48:14.840
to New York, East Coast
people prefer French wine

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.880
or Italian wine.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.840
So the story of California is always,

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.390
it's always trying to prove itself.

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:21.320
- [Deirdre] In terms of quality.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.520
- In terms of quality.

00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.878
So when France was hit by this Phylloxera,

00:48:24.878 --> 00:48:27.017
all the California wine makers said,

00:48:27.017 --> 00:48:28.207
"This is our opportunity.

00:48:28.207 --> 00:48:29.818
"We're gonna plant a lot more grapes

00:48:29.818 --> 00:48:31.927
"and we're gonna make
the wine for the world,

00:48:31.927 --> 00:48:33.957
"because France is dead, it's gone.

00:48:33.957 --> 00:48:35.620
"It can't make wine anymore."

00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:38.420
So there was a huge amount of planting

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:40.746
that went on in the 1880s.

00:48:40.746 --> 00:48:42.300
But, as it turned out,

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.823
France figured out how to
resolve its Phylloxera problem.

00:48:44.823 --> 00:48:49.119
And as a consequence, in the 1890s,

00:48:49.119 --> 00:48:52.706
there was an enormous glut
of grapes on the market.

00:48:52.706 --> 00:48:56.860
And the way the wine business
was run in those days

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:57.693
was different.

00:48:57.693 --> 00:49:00.500
It wasn't like individual
proprietors did things.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:01.960
There were wine houses.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:03.536
There were about 100 wine houses

00:49:03.536 --> 00:49:05.498
centered in San Francisco.

00:49:05.498 --> 00:49:08.340
And these were like large organizations

00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:12.210
that bought wine and
made wine and sold wine

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:14.196
and shipped it in
barrels around the world.

00:49:14.196 --> 00:49:17.175
But in the late 1890s,

00:49:17.175 --> 00:49:21.150
there was such a glut
of wine on the market

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:24.692
that grapes that once fetched $25 a ton

00:49:24.692 --> 00:49:26.790
fetched only $8 a ton.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.866
And so the whole business
sort of collapsed.

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:34.866
And to address that issue,
a group of seven wine houses

00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:37.140
got together and formed something called

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:39.140
the California Wine Association,

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:40.865
which grew into a monopoly

00:49:40.865 --> 00:49:45.160
that controlled 80% of the
production of wine in California.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:49.119
It was the muscle behind
the wine making business

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:52.460
in California.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.320
And it fought very hard to do that.

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:59.770
It did a wine war with small producers.

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:01.920
It's squeezed out, you know,

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.620
it lowered its price for grapes,

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.407
it forced a lot of people out of business.

00:50:05.407 --> 00:50:08.070
And in the earthquake,
very interestingly enough,

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:11.213
it lost about 10 million gallons of wine.

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.780
And not all of it was completely lost.

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:17.023
There's one great story of

00:50:17.023 --> 00:50:20.805
one of the wine houses,
the sewer drain got blocked

00:50:20.805 --> 00:50:22.209
during the earthquake.

00:50:22.209 --> 00:50:25.784
And the basement filled up with wine.

00:50:25.784 --> 00:50:27.519
And after the earthquake,

00:50:27.519 --> 00:50:30.970
the CWA convinced the San
Francisco Fire Department

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:32.796
to lay a series of hoses

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:36.290
from that cellar all the
way through the streets

00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:41.290
to the port where they off-pumped
all of this cooked wine

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.420
into barges that were
then taken to Stockton

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:45.677
and converted into Brandy.

00:50:45.677 --> 00:50:47.390
(Deirdre chuckles)
(audience laughing)

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:48.910
They did some fun things.

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:51.843
But the California wine business,

00:50:52.874 --> 00:50:55.980
it still had a problem
with its reputation.

00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:58.870
California wine was not
considered really good wine.

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:03.110
The CWA did try to create a brand

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:06.042
that was sort of uniform,
it was called Calwa,

00:51:06.042 --> 00:51:07.460
they would blend.

00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:09.224
They tried to make like
a Coca-Cola of wine

00:51:09.224 --> 00:51:10.810
for California wine.

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:14.707
And it did help California's
reputation a little bit.

00:51:14.707 --> 00:51:18.180
But, still, in general,

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.900
California suffered in comparison

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:22.560
to European wines.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:25.140
- And wasn't there really
a lot of adulteration

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:26.510
of that wine, too?

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:28.470
The wine that was sold in
those days, in those barrels,

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:29.690
well, what were you really getting?

00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:30.523
- Exactly.

00:51:30.523 --> 00:51:33.870
Yeah, wine makers, the ones
who planted all those grapes

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:36.010
to take advantage of the Phylloxera,

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:37.462
when the time came to make wine,

00:51:37.462 --> 00:51:39.680
a lot of them didn't know how to do it.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:42.210
And so they would just
add like red food coloring

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:45.461
and chemicals to mask the moldy flavor.

00:51:45.461 --> 00:51:47.870
And so all of this contributed

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:50.150
to California's terrible reputation.

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.983
- In the meantime,

00:51:50.983 --> 00:51:52.580
who's doing the labor in the fields?

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.970
- Okay, yeah, this was one
of the most interesting thing

00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:56.803
to find out.

00:51:56.803 --> 00:52:01.382
So Deirdre talked about that I mention the

00:52:01.382 --> 00:52:03.089
dark side of the wine industry.

00:52:03.089 --> 00:52:05.930
And, you know, I love wine,

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:06.870
I love to drink wine.

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:09.940
And most of my exposure to
wine before I wrote this book

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.380
was going up to Napa,

00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:13.250
which is such a spectacular place,

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:15.587
with all those undulating
hills with grapevines

00:52:15.587 --> 00:52:19.630
and the blue skies and the fantastic food

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:21.334
and really, really good wine.

00:52:21.334 --> 00:52:25.372
But when you look back at
how California wine was made,

00:52:25.372 --> 00:52:27.710
it really was...

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:30.482
The history of wine is really
a history of exploitation.

00:52:30.482 --> 00:52:34.470
Father Junipero Serra, when
they started to make wine

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:38.220
at the missions, they
used the Native Americans

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:40.532
who'd converted to
Christianity as their labor.

00:52:40.532 --> 00:52:44.090
And once those Native Americans
converted Christianity,

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:46.140
they were chattel for the missions.

00:52:46.140 --> 00:52:47.610
They weren't allowed to leave.

00:52:47.610 --> 00:52:49.610
They weren't allowed to
work on their own schedule.

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.900
They were really sort of put to work.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:54.360
But interestingly enough,

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:57.571
the Americans treated the
Native Americans worse

00:52:57.571 --> 00:53:00.450
than the Franciscan missionaries.

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:02.880
The very first law passed in California,

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:04.537
before it even became a state,

00:53:04.537 --> 00:53:07.510
was something called the
Indian Indenture Act.

00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:10.720
And there was a big labor
shortage in California in 1850

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:12.210
because of the Gold Rush.

00:53:12.210 --> 00:53:14.113
So the legislature passed this law

00:53:14.113 --> 00:53:16.560
which enabled any white person

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:20.611
to identify a Native American
as either drunk or indolent.

00:53:20.611 --> 00:53:23.670
And that would mean that
that Native American

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:25.151
was subject to arrest by

00:53:25.151 --> 00:53:29.370
the Sheriff or a marshal, and fined,

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:31.599
and most of those Indians
could not pay their fines.

00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:35.310
So the marshal would then
sell off that Indian's labor

00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:38.680
to the highest bidder for
a week period at a time.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.590
And the marshals would pocket
a percentage of that money.

00:53:41.590 --> 00:53:45.940
And the municipalities
would pocket a percentage

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:46.810
of that money.

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:51.170
So really in the starting from the 1850s

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:54.285
through the 1870s, the
California wine business

00:53:54.285 --> 00:53:58.930
was developed on the
backs of this slave labor

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:00.490
of Native Americans.

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:01.620
And they eventually died out

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:05.810
because they were so brutally mistreated.

00:54:05.810 --> 00:54:10.810
- So after the Native American
workers tragically died out,

00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:13.610
then what did the vineyard owners do?

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:15.410
- Well, they turned to the next group,

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:16.507
which was the Chinese workers.

00:54:16.507 --> 00:54:19.870
So the Chinese had come
over in huge numbers

00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:21.000
to work on the railroads.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
And the Transcontinental
Railroad was completed in 1869

00:54:26.445 --> 00:54:29.777
And all of a sudden, there
was this huge pool of labor.

00:54:29.777 --> 00:54:33.840
And a lot of vineyard
owners did not like using

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:36.850
the Native Americans because
they were very susceptible

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:39.913
to alcohol and needed
a lot of supervision.

00:54:39.913 --> 00:54:43.930
And the Chinese, in
contrast, were self-governing

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:45.344
and they were very, very hardworking.

00:54:45.344 --> 00:54:48.930
And I think what is not very well-known

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:50.867
is that the Chinese really started

00:54:50.867 --> 00:54:55.395
agriculture in California,
including in the vineyards.

00:54:55.395 --> 00:54:57.711
They were the people who

00:54:57.711 --> 00:55:01.340
planted the grapes, who
cultivated the grapes,

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:02.173
who made the wine.

00:55:02.173 --> 00:55:04.600
And the same is true
for lots of other crops

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.433
in California.
- But they didn't have

00:55:05.433 --> 00:55:06.951
the opportunity to have ownership.

00:55:06.951 --> 00:55:10.080
- No, no, no.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.910
They were workers for hire.

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:14.880
I mean, the amount of
prejudice against the Chinese,

00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:17.950
I mean, there were no laws saying that

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:20.307
Chinese people could not own the land,

00:55:20.307 --> 00:55:22.610
but they were very mistreated.

00:55:22.610 --> 00:55:25.604
And the amount of bias and
prejudice against the Chinese

00:55:25.604 --> 00:55:26.830
was extraordinary.

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:28.610
And, of course, I think it was 1884

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:30.710
the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed.

00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:33.773
Which prohibited Chinese
immigration into California.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:40.543
Yeah, so the Chinese
was the next, you know,

00:55:41.549 --> 00:55:42.720
wave of worker.

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:45.640
And that eventually gave away to

00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:47.385
Mexican and Central American--
- Mexican farm workers and--

00:55:47.385 --> 00:55:48.610
- Workers, yeah.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:49.820
- [Deirdre] Yeah, migrant workers.

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:51.120
- Right.

00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.780
- Well, so in the meantime,

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:57.850
what is happening with
the quality of the wine

00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:00.870
and how did wine come to
be stored in this warehouse

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:02.260
that you talk about?

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:03.800
- So we have to sort of fast forward.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.979
So prohibition came,

00:56:05.979 --> 00:56:09.513
completely devastated the
California wine economy.

00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.559
Certain vineyards and wineries did okay

00:56:13.559 --> 00:56:16.490
because they could sell sacramental wine

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:18.037
to synagogues an churches.

00:56:18.037 --> 00:56:21.870
For awhile a lot of wineries sold grapes,

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:22.947
they shipped them east.

00:56:22.947 --> 00:56:25.730
But, eventually, most of the wineries

00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:26.730
had to shut down.

00:56:26.730 --> 00:56:30.064
And prohibition was lifted in 1933.

00:56:30.064 --> 00:56:33.528
And, really, even by the late 1960s,

00:56:33.528 --> 00:56:37.460
California had fewer vineyards operating

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:39.940
than they had prior to prohibition.

00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:41.980
And Americans were drinking sweet wine.

00:56:41.980 --> 00:56:43.890
They didn't really like table wine.

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:46.320
And all that changed when Julia Child

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:49.011
came on the scene and Jackie
Onassis came on the scene.

00:56:49.011 --> 00:56:53.510
And vets who'd fought in World War II

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.080
started to think about drinking wine

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.073
like they'd seen in France.

00:56:58.073 --> 00:57:01.006
And so starting in 1967,

00:57:01.006 --> 00:57:04.490
California wine industry really took off.

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:07.240
And it's been sort of an upward trajectory

00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:09.471
most of the time since then.

00:57:09.471 --> 00:57:14.420
And so my modern day story sort of starts

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.020
probably around then.

00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:18.080
There was a man named Mark Anderson

00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:21.290
who was born in Berkeley in 1948.

00:57:21.290 --> 00:57:24.645
He came from a family who lived
in the Claremont District.

00:57:24.645 --> 00:57:26.540
He went to John Muir School.

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:30.871
He was a nice, average kid.

00:57:30.871 --> 00:57:35.191
And he moved to Sausalito
to work on the house boats

00:57:35.191 --> 00:57:36.680
in the early 70s.

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:39.000
And then he eventually
made his way to Hong Kong

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.380
and then to Japan where he
lived for a number of years

00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:43.620
and he fell in with a group

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:45.953
of very rich Japanese businessmen

00:57:45.953 --> 00:57:49.467
who liked to travel around the
world having wine adventures.

00:57:49.467 --> 00:57:52.390
And Mark learned a lot
about wine from them.

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:54.090
And then he came back to the US

00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:58.210
and he did a lot of things,
none of them successfully.

00:57:58.210 --> 00:58:02.553
But in 1999, he started
a wine storage business,

00:58:02.553 --> 00:58:07.553
where he set up a facility where he was

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.660
storing people's wine,

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:12.290
because wine needs to be kept
at a certain temperature.

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:14.746
Most people don't have that
facility in their house.

00:58:14.746 --> 00:58:17.380
And so Mark did that business for awhile.

00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:19.047
And then he realized that he--

00:58:20.070 --> 00:58:22.300
- [Deirdre] And this is
where the greed and arson

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:24.270
in your subtitle come in.

00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:25.103
- That's right.

00:58:25.103 --> 00:58:26.700
He was not a stupid guy.

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.610
He figured out he could
make a lot more money

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.057
by selling his client's wine

00:58:30.057 --> 00:58:32.240
than just renting them space.

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.457
So for a period of a couple years,

00:58:34.457 --> 00:58:36.944
he would just take his client's wine

00:58:36.944 --> 00:58:40.753
and take it around to
various stores and sell it.

00:58:40.753 --> 00:58:43.470
And one of these stores was

00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:44.700
Premier Cru which--

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.220
- So he's in a fix.

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:47.053
- Yeah.
(audience laughing)

00:58:47.053 --> 00:58:47.886
- He's stealing his clients' wine.

00:58:47.886 --> 00:58:49.020
- He's stealing his clients' wine.

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.200
And I don't know if you've been reading

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:52.090
about the recent problem with Premier Cru,

00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:57.090
well, back in 2000, John
Fox, who owns Premier Cru,

00:58:57.924 --> 00:59:00.330
he would just take Mark's wine.

00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:03.475
He didn't ask for any proof
that Mark owned the wine.

00:59:03.475 --> 00:59:06.300
Mark was eventually
charged with embezzlement.

00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.709
At which point there were these charges

00:59:09.709 --> 00:59:12.044
levied against him and
he was in the newspaper.

00:59:12.044 --> 00:59:14.114
The owner of Premier Cru then said,

00:59:14.114 --> 00:59:15.890
"I don't want your wine, Mark Anderson."

00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:18.270
But all Mark did was change the name

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:20.540
under which he sold the wine.

00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:21.939
And he continued to sell the wine.

00:59:21.939 --> 00:59:24.980
So this is part of what
I get into the book,

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.605
just how poorly regulated
the wine business is.

00:59:27.605 --> 00:59:32.605
Anyway, Mark was charged with
many counts of embezzlement.

00:59:33.108 --> 00:59:37.820
And in a desperate attempt
to cover his tracks

00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:39.952
he set fire to the wines'

00:59:39.952 --> 00:59:43.430
central warehouse in Vallejo, 2005.

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:45.987
And it destroyed a quarter
of a billion dollars

00:59:45.987 --> 00:59:46.930
worth of wine--

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:48.926
- Hoping that he would
get the insurance payoff

00:59:48.926 --> 00:59:50.840
and be able to cover his tracks,

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:52.734
that he'd actually sold
so much of the wine.

00:59:52.734 --> 00:59:55.617
- And the police wouldn't be able to say,

00:59:55.617 --> 00:59:56.970
"You sold your clients' wine."

00:59:56.970 --> 00:59:58.451
He would say, "No, it just burnt up

00:59:58.451 --> 00:59:59.900
"in that fire."
- It burned up, yeah, right.

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.460
- It didn't really work out
so well for him, though.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:02.293
- It didn't work out for him.

01:00:02.293 --> 01:00:04.710
He's now in a place that
doesn't sound so good,

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:08.453
Terminal Island, serving
a 27-year sentence.

01:00:08.453 --> 01:00:10.000
- Right.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.530
- But you say that today the wine industry

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.000
is still not well regulated

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.731
and that there's still fraud in

01:00:16.731 --> 01:00:19.272
the wine business.
- Yes, there's a lot of fraud

01:00:19.272 --> 01:00:24.272
in the wine business.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:27.570
So just here in Berkeley,
I've been writing a lot about

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:29.410
this incredible wine retailer

01:00:29.410 --> 01:00:33.020
named Premier Cru, which
has been around since 1980.

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.130
They did a lot of online wine sales.

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:38.430
They would offer really great
French Bordeaux and Burgundy

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:40.971
at prices that were much
lower than their competitors.

01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:43.803
And people would buy the wine.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.550
But then they were often
buying wine futures,

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:50.232
which meant they would buy
wine that was still in barrels,

01:00:50.232 --> 01:00:52.210
'cause you can get it for less money

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:53.540
when it's still in barrels,

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.167
than when it's bottled.

01:00:56.167 --> 01:00:58.721
But a lot of these clients
had been complaining that

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:01.123
wine they paid for was never delivered.

01:01:01.123 --> 01:01:04.600
And so there was sort
of this low-level rumble

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.369
on a lot of wine boards
about what was going on.

01:01:07.369 --> 01:01:11.390
But then just in December, oh, sorry,

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:15.246
in December Premier Cru
shut down unexpectedly.

01:01:15.246 --> 01:01:18.230
And then in January, it
filed for bankruptcy.

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:20.750
And just this week, The
FBI announced that it's

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:23.420
investigating it for a Ponzi scheme.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.170
So when they filed for bankruptcy,

01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:29.102
they listed $70 million in debts

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:31.525
and seven million dollars in assets.

01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:36.340
So there's some $63 million
out there floating around.

01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:37.950
Nobody knows where.

01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:38.870
So this is just,

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:40.850
I mean, this is just
the most recent example,

01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:45.070
but there are lots of
other examples of people

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:47.880
making fraudulent wine
and selling it to some of

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.094
the world's most renowned collectors,

01:01:50.094 --> 01:01:51.505
and things like that.

01:01:51.505 --> 01:01:54.106
There is a lot of dirt

01:01:54.106 --> 01:01:55.200
and dark stuff.
- (laughs) Well, it'll

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.720
keep you busy.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.890
Well, I want to turn to
questions in the audience

01:01:58.890 --> 01:01:59.750
in a minute.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.260
But I just want to comment
that this all began

01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:05.128
in some ways with a
personal history for you.

01:02:05.128 --> 01:02:08.600
But it turned into California
history and business history

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.302
and so many other things.

01:02:11.302 --> 01:02:13.704
How do you feel that doing these two books

01:02:13.704 --> 01:02:17.070
has changed you or affected you?

01:02:17.070 --> 01:02:18.460
Or what has it made you appreciate

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.160
that perhaps you didn't before you

01:02:21.112 --> 01:02:23.430
embarked on this research?

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:25.280
- Well, you mentioned California history.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.130
I mean, I did study history in college

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:28.210
and I've always loved it.

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:32.369
But it's been really
interesting approaching

01:02:32.369 --> 01:02:35.600
California from a
journalistic point of view

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.800
in the sense that there's
a lot of great history

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.370
that's unknown out there.

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:41.760
I mean, there are,

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.370
I mean, I found in the
history of Isaias Hellman

01:02:44.370 --> 01:02:45.350
that was a relative.

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:47.210
But that was a great unknown history.

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:49.628
This whole other side of the wine world,

01:02:49.628 --> 01:02:53.160
it has been told in academic tomes

01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.830
but it hadn't really been told so much

01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:58.086
in sorta popular books.

01:02:58.086 --> 01:03:01.920
And so I just think

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.380
there's such a rich history in California.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:08.320
So much of it has not been explored.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.210
And so that's sort of what gets me going.

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:13.070
And that's been what I've learned the most

01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:15.660
that I can combine these
two skills that I have

01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:16.850
in a fun way.

01:03:16.850 --> 01:03:18.940
- I agree, I think that
the history of our country

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:22.132
has been told very much
through an East Coast filter.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:25.083
And most of the historians
are on the East Coast.

01:03:25.083 --> 01:03:27.634
So there's still a lot of material left

01:03:27.634 --> 01:03:29.530
here on the West Coast.

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:30.363
- [Frances] Yeah.

01:03:30.363 --> 01:03:33.110
- Well, with that, let's
turn to the audience

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:35.260
and see what questions
we may have for you.

01:03:37.756 --> 01:03:39.753
- Well, before we get questions.

01:03:39.753 --> 01:03:43.710
I'd invite everybody to
thank France and Deirdre

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.286
for an absolutely fascinating

01:03:45.286 --> 01:03:50.286
discussion.
(audience applauding)

01:03:52.838 --> 01:03:55.420
I thought I knew a fair
amount about the topic,

01:03:55.420 --> 01:03:57.551
but I realized that I knew almost nothing.

01:03:57.551 --> 01:03:58.730
(chuckles)

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:02.440
We'll take questions for
about 10 minutes or so

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.376
if we have that many questions.

01:04:05.376 --> 01:04:08.300
And then we, as was mentioned before,

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:12.342
we have a reception at the
back of the auditorium.

01:04:12.342 --> 01:04:15.454
And that, of course, will
afford everybody the opportunity

01:04:15.454 --> 01:04:18.101
to ask more informal questions.

01:04:18.101 --> 01:04:21.050
So, with that, I invite
anyone who has questions

01:04:21.050 --> 01:04:22.730
to please come forward.

01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:24.340
- [Audience Member] Please
talk about climate change

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:25.775
on the vineyards.

01:04:25.775 --> 01:04:30.310
- Sure, the question is will
we talk about climate change

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:31.143
on the vineyards.

01:04:31.143 --> 01:04:34.740
I think nobody knows
exactly what's gonna happen.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.857
But as the climate warms up,

01:04:38.857 --> 01:04:43.580
that diurnal difference between
hot days and cool nights

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.116
is certainly gonna diminish
in Napa and Sonoma.

01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:48.726
That will affect the
quality of the grapes.

01:04:48.726 --> 01:04:53.726
And so presumably the wine
industry might move north.

01:04:54.684 --> 01:04:56.900
Though, of course, there
a lot of scientists

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.160
who are experimenting and
trying to create grapes

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.010
that will be able to still do well

01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:04.890
even if the climate is hotter.

01:05:04.890 --> 01:05:09.890
But I think the drought has
had an affect on California.

01:05:10.183 --> 01:05:13.880
Certainly last year, the
yields were much lower

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.770
because the plants were more stressed out.

01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:18.620
And I think they're probably
gonna do okay this year.

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:21.820
But definitely climate
change is a very major worry

01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:25.363
for grape growers and wine makers.

01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.620
- [Audience Member] I
wanted to ask if you could

01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:31.450
share some of the history about

01:05:34.012 --> 01:05:36.121
University of California at Berkeley being

01:05:36.121 --> 01:05:39.964
the university farm and
later one Davis becoming our

01:05:39.964 --> 01:05:41.847
university farm.

01:05:41.847 --> 01:05:46.493
Just how viticulture came to be a part of

01:05:46.493 --> 01:05:50.661
the body of knowledge of the
University of California.

01:05:50.661 --> 01:05:52.250
- So the question is sort of

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:57.170
how did viticulture evolve in the halls

01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:58.637
of academia in California.

01:05:58.637 --> 01:06:01.841
So of course the original
and only university,

01:06:01.841 --> 01:06:05.620
public university, in
California was here at Berkeley

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:06.669
for a very long time.

01:06:06.669 --> 01:06:08.750
And we--
- And Isaias Hellman

01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:10.400
was a regent for--
- Yes, he was a regent

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.233
for--
- A long period.

01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:13.398
- 38 years he was a regent, I believe.

01:06:13.398 --> 01:06:17.810
So there was a man, I think
his name was Mr. Bioletti

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:19.800
who headed up a very important

01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:24.752
department at UC Berkeley
that studied wine.

01:06:24.752 --> 01:06:27.950
And that, in itself, is a
very interesting history,

01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:31.637
because he brought an academic
perspective to making wine.

01:06:31.637 --> 01:06:34.720
And he had his supporters.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.340
But there were a lot of businessmen

01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:38.900
who fought, like his approach towards wine

01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:41.200
was ridiculous and unnecessary.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:43.872
And those supporters eventually convinced

01:06:43.872 --> 01:06:47.612
the legislature to unfund
him in a lot of ways.

01:06:47.612 --> 01:06:52.349
And so once Davis was founded,

01:06:52.349 --> 01:06:53.913
the whole wine-making,

01:06:53.913 --> 01:06:57.520
the study of wine and stuff
was moved up to UC Davis.

01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.824
So really from the very start,

01:07:00.824 --> 01:07:03.090
Berkeley has been very involved

01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:04.890
in trying to create better grapes,

01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:07.730
studying the conditions under
which grapes flourished,

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:11.380
sort of measuring the
temperatures of different areas

01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:13.540
in California to determine climates

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:14.773
and all sorts of things.

01:07:14.773 --> 01:07:16.610
So it's been very, very critical

01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:18.770
but politics have also played a role

01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:21.743
in how those kind of
departments have done.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:24.480
- [Audience Member] I seem to remember

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.390
that there's a connection
with the Hellman name

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:28.870
to the Ehrman Mansion in West Lake Tahoe.

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:31.070
Is it the same Hellman family?

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:33.450
- Yes, so the question
is there's a connection

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:36.530
between the Hellmans and
the Ehrmans in Tahoe.

01:07:36.530 --> 01:07:40.090
So Isaias Hellman, who I
write about in Towers of Gold,

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:43.090
he built a beautiful
house on the western shore

01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:45.340
of California, of Lake Tahoe,

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:47.350
called Sugar Pine Point, he named it.

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:51.360
And after he died, his
daughter inherited it.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:53.690
And her name was Florence Hellman-Ehrman.

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:55.730
She was married to Sidney Ehrman.

01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:59.200
So the place has something
called the Ehrman Mansion on it.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.140
So that's the answer.

01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:02.260
- [Deirdre] It's a state park now?

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:03.198
- It's a state park, yes.

01:08:03.198 --> 01:08:06.948
So, yeah, it was taken by
eminent domain by California

01:08:06.948 --> 01:08:09.540
in 1968 and people were
very upset about it.

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:11.940
But I think in retrospect
it was a good thing,

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:14.700
because now there's two
miles of open shoreline

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.020
for everyone to enjoy.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.890
- [Deirdre] Yeah, great.

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:19.800
- [Audience Member] You've described

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.981
the cross-section of the
Jewish history of California.

01:08:22.981 --> 01:08:25.120
Is that really the California history?

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.690
It seems like such a large part of it,

01:08:27.690 --> 01:08:30.036
and yet Jews were such a small
part of the population here.

01:08:30.036 --> 01:08:33.850
So I'm wondering whether
we're simply seeing

01:08:33.850 --> 01:08:36.720
a focus on that from your discussion.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.230
Obviously, you've researched it.

01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:40.222
Or whether it was as big as it sounds.

01:08:40.222 --> 01:08:42.415
And if it was as big as it sounds,

01:08:42.415 --> 01:08:44.630
how did it get so big?

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:45.598
- That's a very good question.

01:08:45.598 --> 01:08:46.890
Yeah, I don't know
(Deirdre chuckles)

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:47.960
how to answer that.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:50.720
Maybe, yeah, Jews are
a very small percentage

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.603
of the population in California.

01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:56.530
But perhaps they had an outside influence

01:08:56.530 --> 01:08:58.450
certainly in the early days of California,

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:01.970
just because of the tremendous
financial success they had

01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:03.500
and how they spent their money

01:09:03.500 --> 01:09:05.603
and their philanthropic endeavors.

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:10.270
I mean, we could be talking about

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:11.700
Irish history up here, too,

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.050
and there would be a lot
to say about Irish history

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.171
or Chinese history.

01:09:15.171 --> 01:09:18.177
It's just that I happened
to have written about it,

01:09:18.177 --> 01:09:22.000
that's why it's the focus
of this conversation.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.150
- [Audience Member]
And a related question.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:29.770
One block in San Francisco,
with multiple residents

01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:33.380
from Reckendorf, Germany, all born

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.550
at the same period of time,

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:37.120
all raised in the same town of 900,

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.660
all find their way here eventually,

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:42.831
all are monumental names in
the history of California.

01:09:42.831 --> 01:09:44.781
They're wonderfully successful.

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:46.730
They have families that were

01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:48.655
wonderfully successful for generations.

01:09:48.655 --> 01:09:52.281
But the starting point is this
little spot in Reckendorf.

01:09:52.281 --> 01:09:55.312
What in the water there--

01:09:55.312 --> 01:09:57.274
(audience and speakers laughing)

01:09:57.274 --> 01:10:00.680
I'm wondering whether
it's just the fact that

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:05.550
Europeans in 1850 knew what
the future of the United States

01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:07.700
in 1851 was gonna look like

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:10.069
because we were still living in 1820.

01:10:10.069 --> 01:10:11.100
- Yes.

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.566
- I didn't get the last part.

01:10:13.566 --> 01:10:15.380
- [Audience Member]
Well, the United States

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:17.660
was behind Europe in terms of its cultural

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:19.650
and economic and political and

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.260
artistic development.
- You know, I think

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:23.460
this touches, if I may
throw something in here,

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:26.200
on the advantages of being
discriminated against

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.535
in some situations,

01:10:27.535 --> 01:10:31.440
that when Frances discussed the fact that

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.147
Jews could not own property
in Germany, were not citizens.

01:10:35.147 --> 01:10:39.607
And in other central and eastern
European countries as well.

01:10:39.607 --> 01:10:41.814
So they were motivated to emigrate,

01:10:41.814 --> 01:10:46.300
whereas other young men who
would have good prospects

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:48.953
in Europe perhaps wouldn't
have been as motivated.

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:51.960
After all, it's mainly
the poor who emigrate.

01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:52.910
- [Deirdre] Right.

01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:54.516
- But in this case it was

01:10:54.516 --> 01:10:59.516
well educated middle-class Jews who--

01:11:00.137 --> 01:11:02.080
- [Audience Member]
Except Isais was what, 16.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.470
How well educated can he be?

01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:04.380
Or was he?

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.100
Was he high school European educated?

01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:06.933
- Yeah.

01:11:06.933 --> 01:11:08.910
- I mean, they weren't exactly middle cla,

01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:13.123
I mean, they had the money to
send their children overseas.

01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:17.213
Yeah, but actually the middle-class Jews,

01:11:17.213 --> 01:11:20.170
when restrictions were
loosened in Germany,

01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:22.891
starting in 1860s, many of
them went to the cities.

01:11:22.891 --> 01:11:25.253
And they didn't come to America.

01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:28.160
But the question about
the water in Reckendorf

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:28.993
is a really good one.

01:11:28.993 --> 01:11:31.031
I did find out in my research that

01:11:31.031 --> 01:11:34.890
at least eight men who
came from Reckendorf

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:37.896
became multi-millionaires
in the 19th Century.

01:11:37.896 --> 01:11:40.050
- [Deirdre] Did they all
go to the same school?

01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:42.435
- They probably all went to
the same little Jewish school.

01:11:42.435 --> 01:11:45.635
(chuckles) That teacher might've
been the glue, who knows?

01:11:45.635 --> 01:11:46.973
(audience laughing)

01:11:46.973 --> 01:11:48.170
- Yeah, that would be interesting.

01:11:48.170 --> 01:11:49.612
- [Audience Member] Eight
Jews from Reckendorf.

01:11:49.612 --> 01:11:50.445
- Right.

01:11:50.445 --> 01:11:51.445
- Eight.
- Probably went

01:11:51.445 --> 01:11:52.739
to the same synagogue, too.

01:11:52.739 --> 01:11:53.572
- The same synagogue.
- Yes, there's only

01:11:53.572 --> 01:11:54.405
one synagogue.
- I mean, there's probably

01:11:54.405 --> 01:11:56.540
somewhere back there,
there's probably some figure

01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:57.970
that would be interesting to discover.

01:11:57.970 --> 01:12:00.350
You know, one might guess that
there would be some educator

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:05.020
or rabbi who played a role
in their formative times.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.040
I just would comment one thing about your

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.960
saying how do you get into proportion,

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.009
how much is the Jewish
history of California

01:12:12.009 --> 01:12:13.825
the history of California,

01:12:13.825 --> 01:12:15.717
or how much did Jews create California,

01:12:15.717 --> 01:12:19.410
that I don't think we can give
a definitive answer to that.

01:12:19.410 --> 01:12:21.500
But what I would add to this is that

01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:23.950
I think the story of the Jewish role

01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:26.110
in the creation of California

01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:29.080
actually was a little-known story.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.910
And so I think Frances',
one of the importance

01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:36.430
of Frances' work, has been
in surfacing that story.

01:12:36.430 --> 01:12:38.940
And then perhaps it's for
other people to try to

01:12:38.940 --> 01:12:41.140
get it into proportion,

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:45.460
or say the importance of that
story relative to others.

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:49.070
But it's a story that
really had not been told.

01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:50.910
There's a wonderful documentary movie.

01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:53.791
And I know you played a
role and you're in it,

01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:57.260
by a woman named Jackie Krentzman

01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:00.480
that's called American Jerusalem.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:03.560
And American Jerusalem is San Francisco.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:06.880
And it is another attempt,
and a very recent one,

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.152
just within the past two years,

01:13:08.152 --> 01:13:10.052
a few years, but it was on PBS,

01:13:10.052 --> 01:13:13.549
to tell that untold story

01:13:13.549 --> 01:13:18.480
that the Jews of San Francisco

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.430
did play an important role,

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:22.020
maybe not the all-important role,

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.670
but an important role in the development

01:13:24.670 --> 01:13:26.700
of the economy and the culture

01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:28.600
that we are still living in today.

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:32.170
It's very, very much the
heirs of the institutions

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:33.223
that they created.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:35.737
So, yes?

01:13:35.737 --> 01:13:37.780
- [Audience Member] Hi, thank you.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.186
Just moving up to the modern day.

01:13:39.186 --> 01:13:40.884
I wanted to ask you, Frances,

01:13:40.884 --> 01:13:45.320
about given the focus on
the HarvEst lecture series

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.010
and its focus on women,

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:49.776
if you might speak to your own experience

01:13:49.776 --> 01:13:51.940
as a prominent woman author

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.690
and as co-founder of Berkeleyside,

01:13:53.690 --> 01:13:55.350
and then also perhaps to touch on,

01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:56.770
because I'm curious about it,

01:13:56.770 --> 01:13:58.334
women in the wine industry today.

01:13:58.334 --> 01:14:02.150
- Yes, so I do.

01:14:02.150 --> 01:14:05.210
One of my main characters
in my book is a woman.

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:06.615
Her name is Delia Viader.

01:14:06.615 --> 01:14:09.650
She had grown up in Argentina.

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:14.650
Her family had Spanish
roots and French roots.

01:14:14.868 --> 01:14:18.940
She is one of the first really prominent

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.855
female wine makers in Napa.

01:14:21.855 --> 01:14:26.630
She lost about four-and-a-half
million dollars worth of wine

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:28.908
in that fire, she was uninsured.

01:14:28.908 --> 01:14:31.160
This woman has an incredible spirit

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.637
and an incredible drive.

01:14:32.637 --> 01:14:34.440
And she was able to recover

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:36.621
from that devastating financial loss.

01:14:36.621 --> 01:14:41.621
And so there are a number of
female wine makers in Napa.

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:44.394
I mean, it's been a place where

01:14:44.394 --> 01:14:47.313
women have thrived as much as men.

01:14:47.313 --> 01:14:50.213
And there are a lot of iconic names.

01:14:51.670 --> 01:14:53.380
So, anyway.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.151
- You know, I'm glad that
you mentioned Berkeleyside,

01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:56.880
because we didn't get to that.

01:14:56.880 --> 01:14:58.570
But Frances is one of the founders

01:14:58.570 --> 01:15:00.350
and she's a reporter and editor

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:05.350
for Berkeleyside, an online
local, hyper-local newspaper,

01:15:06.459 --> 01:15:09.760
or news site that I think we can all

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.770
be very grateful for.

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:13.669
And it plays a really important role.

01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:15.939
And I hope if any of you have not,

01:15:15.939 --> 01:15:20.008
don't look at it, you'll
Google it and go look at it.

01:15:20.008 --> 01:15:23.674
So, thank you very much.
- Thank you.

01:15:23.674 --> 01:15:26.841
(audience applauding)

01:15:27.959 --> 01:15:30.542
(upbeat music)
