00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.780
During the Apollo Program, the Moon was the
end goal.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.840
Today, it’s just part of the goal.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.020
If everything goes right, the Moon will be
the gateway to deep space.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.700
NASA hasn’t returned to the lunar surface
since the final Apollo mission.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.740
But in the next decade, the space agency will
try for a triumphant return to the Moon and beyond.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.400
Landing on the Moon was one of the most defining
events in the history of humanity.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.760
The Apollo Program reshaped our understanding
of the world beyond our own.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.360
Nearly 100,000 photographs from the program documented the lunar landscape

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.680
and deep space phenomena.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.210
The Apollo hardware helped build America’s
first space station and its software inspired

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.170
the development of new technology like the
integrated circuit.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.469
The lunar samples brought back revealed that
the Moon is much older than we previously

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.920
thought which has redirected theories about
the formation of our planet.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.600
And still today, scientists are studying the
Apollo findings

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.580
to help plan for future deep space travel.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.440
Despite all we learned from the program, scientists
say that it was really just

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.040
a taste of the lunar geological record.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.860
There’s still so much more to explore.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.630
And that’s one of the reasons why, after
five decades, NASA is finally planning to

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.420
send humans back to the Moon.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.740
This isn’t the first time a return to the
lunar surface has been attempted.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.660
In 2004, President George W. Bush announced
that the U.S. would revive crewed Moon missions

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.930
with the Constellation Program, which was
sometimes referred as “Apollo on steroids”.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.530
Constellation required the development of
new Apollo inspired spacecraft.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.930
The Orion spacecraft would take the place
of the Command Service Module and the Altair

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.329
spacecraft would be similar to
the original Lunar Module.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:08.899
But by 2010, NASA’s revamped lunar project
was behind schedule and way over budget.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.660
So like the final Apollo missions, Constellation
was cancelled.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.090
But not all the work went to waste.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.010
NASA decided to continue building some of
the hardware to prepare for future missions.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.790
The Orion spacecraft design was repurposed
and evolved to enable more diverse usage,

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.730
and it became known as the Orion Multi-Purpose
Crew Vehicle.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.129
The craft’s upgraded crew cabin can house
four astronauts for up to 21 days and its

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:43.240
Service Module is equipped with 33 engines fueled by mixed oxides of nitrogen and monomethyl hydrazine.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.460
Orion’s engines are said to be powerful
enough to propel the spacecraft to a distance

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.600
more than a 1,000 times farther than where the
International Space Station flies in low-Earth orbit.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.060
NASA also began developing an advanced launch
vehicle called the Space Launch System.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.120
Propelled by liquid hydrogen and oxygen, the
evolved rocket configuration is expected to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.320
generate 20 percent more thrust than Apollo’s
Saturn V

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.520
making it capable of lifting the equivalent of 22 elephants.

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:17.940
In 2017, NASA announced the National Space
Exploration Campaign, which is geared at getting

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.340
astronauts back to deep space.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.360
The campaign
calls for a series of complex missions that

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.180
will launch as early as 2020.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.490
Kicking things off will be Exploration Mission-1,
an uncrewed flight in which Orion will travel

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.860
hundreds of thousand kilometers past the Moon.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.220
Then, Exploration Mission-2 will send a crewed
spacecraft to flyby the Moon, something that

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.800
hasn’t happened since 1972.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.099
The following missions will include a lunar
landing and the cosmic construction of a new

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.360
space station that will orbit the Moon.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.739
NASA says the Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway
will support four astronauts for up to 60

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.580
days and will act as a scientific hub to test
new technology, study the effects of the deep

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.480
space environment on living organisms, and
prepare for a future mission to Mars.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.080
On the surface, it seems like the Exploration
Campaign will accomplish a lot of what NASA

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.539
originally wanted with the Apollo Program, and then some.

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:23.819
The space agency is already building out parts
of Exploration with help from contractors

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.249
and other international space agencies.

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:31.090
But how do we know this program won’t meet
the same fate as NASA’s other attempts to

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.550
return to the Moon?

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:39.280
Well, we don’t and the SLS and Orion spacecraft
may not be the vehicles to pull off a return.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.449
But technology is just one part of the complicated
and exhilarating world of space exploration.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:51.800
Pulling off a feat like a lunar landing requires
a mix of innovation, competition and courage.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.940
And as the Apollo Program showed us, when
those three elements meet,

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.800
the impossible can happen.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.460
[JFK] No man can fully grasp how far and how fast
we have come.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.640
For the eyes of the world now look into space,
to the moon and to the planets beyond.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.380
Seeker’s 12 part Apollo series takes you
back in time,

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.100
diving into the details of each Apollo mission.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.280
You can start from the beginning with this
playlist.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.680

in the comments and tell us what science series

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.780
