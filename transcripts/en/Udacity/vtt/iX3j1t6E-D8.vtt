00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.100
We've talked a lot about operations so
far, so

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.266
we should start talking about how
to use these operations together.

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:14.149
Let's start with an example,
given the problem, 1200-6*10,

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:19.270
Vanessa and
Pablo came up with different answers.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.110
Pablo worked from left to right,
and got the answer 11940.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.090
So, he started with 1200 and

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.896
subtracted 6 to get 1194, and
then he multiplied that by 10.

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:37.409
Vanessa got 1140.

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:41.768
Vanessa got this by first
multiplying 6 by 10 to get 60, and

00:00:41.768 --> 00:00:45.010
then subtracting that product from 1200.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.450
Who has the correct answer?

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.980
Please select Pablo or Vanessa.
