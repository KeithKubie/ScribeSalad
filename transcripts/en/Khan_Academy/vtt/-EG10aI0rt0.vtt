00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.870
Let's say we have
the relationship

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.460
y is equal to cosine
of 5x minus 3y.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.760
And what I want to find
is the rate at which y

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.080
is changing with respect to x.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.390
And we'll assume that
y is a function of x.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.930
So let's do what we've
always been doing.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.970
Let's apply the
derivative operator

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.460
to both sides of this equation.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.150
On the left-hand
side, right over here,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.350
we get dy/dx is equal to-- now
here on the right hand side,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.970
we're going to apply
the chain rule.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.659
The derivative of the
cosine of something,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.580
with respect to
that something, is

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.390
going to be equal to negative
sine of that something.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.925
So negative sine of 5x minus 3y.

00:00:45.925 --> 00:00:47.300
And then we have
to multiply that

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.590
by the derivative of that
something with respect to x.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.180
So what's the derivative of the
something with respect to x?

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.340
Well the derivative of
5x with respect to x

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.990
is just equal to 5.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.600
And the derivative of
negative 3y with respect to x

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.120
is just negative 3 times dy/dx.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.150
Negative 3 times the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.376
And now we just need
to solve for dy/dx.

00:01:14.376 --> 00:01:17.000
And as you can see, with some of
these implicit differentiation

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.080
problems, this is the hard part.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.160
And actually, let me make
that dy/dx the same color.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.210
So that we can keep
track of it easier.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.290
So this is going to be dy/dx.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.710
And then I can close
the parentheses.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.870
So how can we do it?

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.350
It's just going to be a little
bit of algebra to work through.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.252
Well, we can distribute
the sine of 5x minus 3y.

00:01:39.252 --> 00:01:40.460
So let me rewrite everything.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.210
We get dy-- whoops, I'm going
to do that in the yellow color--

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.180
we get dy/dx is equal
to-- you distribute

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.710
the negative sine
of 5x minus 3y.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.002
You get-- so let me make sure
we know what we're doing.

00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:56.043
It's going to be, we're
going to distribute that,

00:01:56.043 --> 00:01:57.620
and we're going to
distribute that.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.500
So you're going to have
5 times all of this.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.330
So you're going to have
negative this 5 times

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.380
the sine of 5x minus 3y.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.880
And then you're going to have
the negative times a negative,

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.338
those are going to, you're
going to end up with a positive.

00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:19.940
And so you're going to
end up with plus 3 times

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.990
the sine of 5x minus 3y dy/dx.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.070
Now what we can do
is subtract 3 sine

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.160
of 5x minus 3y from both sides.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.930
So just to be clear, this
is essentially a 1 dy/dx.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.980
So if we subtract this from
both sides, we are left with--

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.740
So on the left-hand side,
we're going to have a 1 dy/dx,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.460
and we're going to subtract
from that 3 sine of 5x minus 3y

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.910
dy/dx's.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.850
So you're going to
have 1 minus 3--

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.140
I'll keep the color
for the 3 for fun--

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:14.910
3 sine of 5x minus 3y dy/dx's
on the left-hand side,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.170
is going to be
equal to, well, we

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.864
subtracted this from both sides.

00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:23.030
So on the right-hand side,
this is going to go away.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.290
So we're just going to be
left with a negative 5 sine

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.324
of 5x minus 3y.

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:33.740
And we're in the
home stretch now.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:36.290
To solve for dy/dx,
we just have to divide

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.390
both sides of the
equation by this.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.340
And we are left with dy/dx is
equal to this thing, negative

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.870
5 times the sine of 5x minus 3y.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:05.520
All of that over 1 minus
3 sine of 5x minus 3y.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.650
And we are done.
