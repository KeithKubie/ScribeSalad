00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.459
For this video I’m going to show you how
to convert a few fistfuls of empty bullet

00:00:03.459 --> 00:00:08.170
casings, into a decorative set of multi-purpose
paperweights. Using a bit of styrofoam, a

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.070
little ingenuity, and a whole lot of fire
power.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.780
To start this project, you might want to check
the legalities of making these “artfully

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.990
disguised” paperweights, where you are.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.480
Brass Knuckles are banned in quite a few places.
And if that’s the case where you live, then

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.470
don’t make your knuckles, out of brass.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.850
Alright, let’s kick things off, with few
handfuls of bullet shells.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.250
I salvaged these brass casings from a local
shooting range, so there aren’t any bullets

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.210
in them, and you can tell the primer’s been
fired as well, which is important.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.609
Now let’s fire up the “Mini Metal Foundry”
I showed you how to make in a previous project,

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:41.920
and toss the empty shells inside, to get them
warming up.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.159
Now a lot of people have asked whether this
improvised backyard foundry can actually get

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:48.850
hot enough to melt brass, and the answer,
is yeah, it’ll melt brass no problem.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.929
In-fact you can melt copper, silver, and even
gold without any trouble at all. And the best

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.469
part is, you can do it on propane.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.589
Propane burns clean, costs less, and melts
metal way faster than charcoal does. But you

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.489
do need a specially designed jet-torch, to
balance the fuel-to-air ratios, and make it work properly.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.520
This is the design I came up with, and I’ll
show you how to make this “Gas Blaster”

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.020
torch, in another project video.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.260
Now it’s only been about 8 minutes, but
peeking inside the foundry, you can see that

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.440
amazingly, the brass casings have already
melted down, and liquified completely.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.780
That’s really impressive, considering the
melting point of brass is around 1,700ºF,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.530
and the foundry was cold, when we started
less than 10 minutes ago.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.570
The liquid metal is bubbling because brass
is a mixture of copper and zinc. And at these

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.229
temperatures, the zinc is starting to boil,
and vaporize right out of the mix.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.950
We don’t really want that to happen, but
luckily, there’s an easy way to stop it.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.939
I went to the dollar store and picked up a
bottle of cockroach killer, which you can

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.259
see is actually just 100% boric acid.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.299
If we sprinkle a generous amount of the white
powder into the soup of molten metal, we can

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.539
sit back, and watch it do the dirty work for
us.

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.429
Boric acid helps clean the metals by absorbing
impurities, and helping prevent new oxide

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.219
layers from forming on the surface.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.899
And if you put it in before you fire up the
foundry, it’ll melt your metal even faster,

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.369
and help keep the zinc from boiling off as
well.

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.340
Ok the crucible’s full and everything’s
completely liquified, but before we pour the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.940
metal, it’s a good idea to scrape any gunk
off the top, and clean it up a bit.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.400
I typically use a pair of old steel tongs,
for skimming the slag, but you can use anything

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.960
you want as long as it’s made of steel,
and you don’t ever plan on using it, for anything else.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.720
I went ahead and poured these liquified bullet
shells, into a beat up old muffin tray, then

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.280
knocked the ingots out and let them cool,
into a stack, of mini brass biscuits.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.920
Now to transform these heavy metal muffins,
into fistfuls of defensive jewelry, we’ll

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.440
need a styrofoam cutting template, like this
one I made in photoshop.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.409
If you want a copy, just check the description,
and download it for free.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.769
Glue the paper template to two layers of dollar
store foam-board, then carefully, cut it all out.

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.860
A cool trick to cutting the finger holes,
is to simply heat one of the leftover casings

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.700
and push it straight into the foam.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.680
With just a touch, you’ll see it melts perfect
circles, all by itself.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.180
An even better way to slice foam, is with
a hot-wire foam cutter. Like this one, I made

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.950
from cheap and commonly available materials.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.640
This “Styro-Slicer” uses electricity to
quickly and accurately trace the edges of

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.440
paper templates, without cutting the paper
itself.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.660
That means you can use styrofoam to make just
about anything you can think of, so watch

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.299
for how to build the “Styro-Slicer” in
another project video.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.000
Ok now that we’ve got our foam knuckles
carved out, the next step is to glue two styrofoam

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.480
risers to either side of the base, and bury
it in a bucket of sand.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.880
I filled a small trash bin half full of common
play sand, then gently nestled the foam knuckles,

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.980
down into the loose layer on the top.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.769
From here, all we need to do is add a bit
more sand, to fill the bucket the rest of

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.660
the way, then give it a little shake, so the
sand levels itself out, exposing the foam risers at the top.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.460
Now we’re going to need a way to funnel
the streams of molten metal into the foam

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.629
risers, so try packing a little wet sand on
top, then shaping it into little craters, a couple inches deep.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:47.529
Do one for each side, and with that finished,
it’s time to transform our styrofoam investment, into solid brass.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.390
Remelt the brass, then carefully pour the
glowing hot liquid into one of the craters,

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.870
where you can see, the extreme heat vaporizes
the foam in an instant.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.890
This allows liquid metal to flow down and
fill all the empty spaces. And if you quickly,

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.939
and carefully pour the other side as well,
you’ll have a much better chance of success, on the first try.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.590
The metal only needs around 5-10 minutes to
cool down, so feel free to pull it out and

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.159
take a look. Just be careful not to touch
it, because it’s still extremely hot.

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.049
I cooled mine in a bucket of water, then chopped
the risers off with a hacksaw, and just like

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.070
that, we’ve got ourselves a crude, but very
cool looking, brass casting.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.020
Now just for fun, I wondered how this thing
would look cleaned up a bit, so I clamped

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.860
it in my bench vice and worked it over a few
times with metal files, and some fine grained

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.860
sand paper … And BAM, there it is.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.650
Just like that we’ve got ourselves a smooth
and shiny brass paw, which for some reason

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.780
feels really comfortable, and strangely empowering.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.330
This piece of defensive jewelry has a really
nice weight to it, and because it was designed

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.880
to fit my hand, it really does feel amazing.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.090
But it’s important to note these aren’t
intended to be used as weapons.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.330
Instead, I like to think of them more as multi-functional
paperweights, buffed to a mirror finish, and

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.770
designed to occupy my workspace, as “dangerously
elegant decor”.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.199
Now just to push the boundaries a little further,
I stopped by an alternative clothing store,

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.779
and picked up a spike studded choker collar.
So I guess you could say things are getting pretty serious.

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:07.280
Let’s unscrew six of the aluminum spikes,
and screw them into the brass workpiece instead,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.030
just to make the whole thing, look absolutely
mental.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.979
The six holes were drilled using a 5/32”
bit, then tapped with a #10-32 thread so I

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.039
could secure each of the metal spikes tightly
to the brass.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.380
It’s beautiful, it’s dangerous, and it’s
incredibly durable. And to go one step further,

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.809
I went ahead and made another one, the exact
same way.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.699
Well now you know how to transform a few handfuls
of scrap bullet casings into a custom pair

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:33.819
of fancy, and dangerously decorative, solid
brass paperweights.

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:38.539
They are a lot of work to make, but the feeling
of creation and accomplishment, is all worth it.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.920
By the way if you’re up for another challenge,
try making my “Mini Master Sword”.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.729
I cast this “Golden Sword” from styrofoam
as well, and you can find the template for

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.449
how to make it, it in another project video.

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.849
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some 
of my others.
