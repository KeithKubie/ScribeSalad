00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.100
- What else you got in here?

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.800
I'm full on creeping
through this shop.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.230
I mean, it's not like a lot
of people walk through here.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.770
And we've got access.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.400
So I'm looking at his workbench.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.830
I'm looking up in the rafters.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.530
- Here's a Deets carbide.
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.370
- I'd buy it, sure.
- Oh, there we go.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.200
Can I make you an offer on this?

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200
He's got a Cycle Ray
headlight bucket.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.730
I mean, this will fit pretty
much any older Harley.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.200
They reproduce these,
but the purists

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.470
like myself want the real deal.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.070
I mean the reflector is decent.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.930
The bucket doesn't
have much paint on it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.270
but it's got the
reflector, the bezel.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.300
Obviously there's no lens.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.800
I mean, they re-pop
that stuff but--

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.900
Well, what are
we talking here?

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.130
- For this, $500.
- $500?

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.730
- Yeah.
- Serious?

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.970
Yeah.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.030
Well, look again.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.070
He's got a lens.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.570
He's go brand new lenses.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.470
Is that the real deal?

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.500
Sure looks like it.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
So it looks genuine to me.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.670
It's the original lens
in the original box.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.770
How about, with the lens, $700?

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.500
We doing it?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.270
You got it.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.100
All right, let's do it.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.130
You got it.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.630
I was kind of blown
away when he told

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.800
me he'd give me $700 for that.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.930
It was like--

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.230
I couldn't pass it up.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.470
You got it.
- Take care of it.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.430
I'll put that right on.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.970
Believe me, I've
got a bike for that.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.870
I'll step up to the plate
because I have a bike

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.230
that I can put this light on.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.730
I don't want a reproduction.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.770
I want the real deal.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.570
It's what I'm looking at
when I'm going down the road.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.600
I'm looking at the dash.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.630
I'm looking at the handlebars.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.530
And I'm looking at
that headlight, man.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.530
And occasionally I'll
glance at the road.
