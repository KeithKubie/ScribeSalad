JESS PEARSON: It's nice to
see some familiar faces,

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.600
for those of you-- hi, hi Paul.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.056
How was lunch?

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:27.139
FEMALE SPEAKER: Shout out.

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:29.920
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
it's so good, Trish.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.560
JESS PEARSON: Trish
is very hungry.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.170
For those that don't know me,
my name is Jess [? Pearson. ?]

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.170
I'm on the sales side.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.270
I work on the
automotive account.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.650
Jeffrey and I actually
met at a volunteer

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.500
at Westminster Avenue
elementary school.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.010
We were both on a
career day panel.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.400
And he and I have been in
touch the last couple months.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.090
And obviously he
is a fan of Google.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.530
And the second he walked
in, I gave him a tour.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.860
He saw the screening room
and said, oh my gosh.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.480
Can I bring my film in?

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.265
And so he gave me the short.

00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.200
It was very humble.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.459
It's actually an Oscar-nominated
short from this past Oscar

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.350
award season.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.590
So we're pretty excited
to have you here, Jeffrey.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.260
And Nora is his
wife, next to him.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.850
Nora's very involved
in the Community Garden

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.180
Project at Westminster
Avenue School.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.250
So thank you both for having
us-- or bring-- or coming here.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.820
Having you.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.150
JEFFREY KAROFF: Hi.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.047
They want to put you on camera.

00:01:27.047 --> 00:01:29.130
AUDIENCE: I guess for
posterity, my first question

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.390
is where did you find this guy?

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.140
I also really liked the
shot at the end, where

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.690
you have him start digging
his second magnum opus,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.930
and you just zoom out.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.150
And how far was the
camera from that,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.724
and did you have to do a
couple tries to get that right?

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:48.140
JEFFREY KAROFF:
The first question

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.910
about where did I find him,
we have a house in New Mexico.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.330
And I met in a small
town called Dixon.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.380
And I met Ra when we first
started going to this house.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.130
And I met him.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.910
I met Shel and Liz first.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.720
Nora and I were at
the pancake breakfast,

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.740
which was a fundraiser
for the volunteer fire

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.539
department, that kind of town.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.400
And met Shel and
Liz, and they said

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.340
we're having a cave
dug on our property.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.690
Are you interested in seeing it?

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.200
So that's an invitation
you don't turn down.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.680
And it took me, after
seeing that cave--

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.220
that shot in the movie where
they come around the corner

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.960
is the experience that we had
first seeing that cave, which

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.300
was that, oh my
God, what is this?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.200
Never seen anything like it.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.520
I knew it was something
that was film-worthy,

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.140
but it took me many
years to figure out

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.140
a way into the story of it.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.850
So I actually didn't start
the film till almost 10 years

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.180
after I met him.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.660
So all of the creation
of Liz and Shel's caves

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.130
that you see in this is actually
he's working on another cave,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.510
but we used the footage for it.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.970
As for the last shot,
I had had that shot

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.719
in mind for a very
long time, not knowing

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.260
that I was going in
the film with it.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.970
But I liked the idea
of man in landscape,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.830
and it really worked well
for the theme of the film.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.180
And I tried to shoot it with a
balloon, a GoPro on a balloon.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.500
That was a total disaster.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.053
I tried to shoot it with a
mini helicopter from a crew

00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:18.200
that I found locally.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.960
And the crew members
were all stoned,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.240
and we did a day of shooting
and we got not a single shot

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.870
in the entire day.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.319
So I had the one
shot of him starting.

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.985
I was so thrilled to
be there on the day

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:34.540
that he was actually
starting a cave,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.060
because all those
years had passed,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.790
and I was never in New Mexico
when he started a project.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.790
And I was there on the day.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:42.970
And I have a shot.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.110
It was on a tripod.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.720
And he started the cave.

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.010
And originally, my first cut, I
ended the film with that shot.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.510
And then I was
looking at it one day

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.650
and I thought,
oh, wait a second.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.240
Everything around
him is not moving.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.990
And I sent a cameraman
back to that spot.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.570
It was exactly two years
later to the month.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.210
And I said, at 3:30, can I have
the metadata from the shot?

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.280
So I said at 3:30
in the afternoon,

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.510
stand on the hill
opposite where we were.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.380
Point the camera, your still
camera, at the cave opening.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.120
And do 10 shots of
different sizes,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.320
zooming backwards without
changing the pan or the tilt.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.160
And a compositor put
the motion frame inside

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.080
of the still frames
and pulled back.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.702
So it's all done in post.

00:04:36.702 --> 00:04:37.410
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:44.284
JESS PEARSON: Can
I use your mic?

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:45.250
JEFFREY KAROFF: OK.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.750
JESS PEARSON: So I
know when we met,

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.800
you and I were on the panel.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.040
And you had mentioned that
you direct commercials.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.290
And I think you work with a
lot of automotive clients.

00:04:55.872 --> 00:04:59.335
Is this your first
film that you directed?

00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:01.710
And it almost seems like this
became your passion project

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.480
as well.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.675
So not a question, but
just more of a comment.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.051
JEFFREY KAROFF: Yes.

00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:11.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.682
This is my first film, yes.

00:05:12.682 --> 00:05:14.390
Although I've done a
lot of documentaries

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.150
in the context of
fundraising films

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.960
for philanthropic
organizations and nonprofits,

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.480
so I was pretty familiar
with the form of it.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.720
No more questions?

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.460
Oh.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.700
AUDIENCE: What are
you working on now?

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.430
JEFFREY KAROFF: I'm
actually gone back

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.940
to my day job of
making money, the one

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.677
that-- so I'm
shooting commercials.

00:05:41.677 --> 00:05:43.260
The one thing though
that I discovered

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.840
about making
documentaries is that it

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.590
is the opposite of
income producing.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.944
So especially for
something like this.

00:05:51.944 --> 00:05:53.860
I mean, I didn't have
any backers or anything.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.640
I just financed the
whole thing myself.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.490
And that was really
one of the reasons

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.334
that it took me so long to get
started on it, because I knew

00:06:00.334 --> 00:06:02.250
that it was something I
was going to just have

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.833
to do on my own,
because I didn't even

00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:06.160
know what film I was making
while I was making it.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.070
And when the digital
revolution caught up to a place

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.350
where I was actually the
owner of the Canon 5D

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.240
that this film was shot
with, then it was like, OK.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.120
The bar to entry is so low
that I can do this thing.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.887
And even if it
comes to nothing, I

00:06:21.887 --> 00:06:23.720
was, oh, let's spend a
few thousand dollars.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.040
It won't be that bad.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.380
But now I'm back to
making a little money,

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.183
and entertaining a couple
of documentary projects.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.835
Julie?

00:06:35.835 --> 00:06:36.760
Yes.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.980
JULIE: Do the people
that own the caves spend

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.750
a lot of time
staying in the caves,

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.271
or do they rent them out on
Airbnb or anything like that?

00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:51.160
JEFFREY KAROFF: You know, I
feel like any of them could.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.280
And I think they'd
do really well.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.510
But part of what drew me
to the subject matter,

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.470
besides Ra and his art,
was the peculiar nature

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.180
of the people in this
part of the world.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.340
I think it's like-- you know
"Treme," that HBO series?

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.630
You could only find those
people in New Orleans.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.810
Well, I think you could
only find these people here

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.910
in northern New Mexico.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.010
They're all a peculiar
kind of oddity.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.440
The only difference being
that they're all transplants.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.770
None of them were born there.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:26.340
So the people were
drawn to this place.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.560
But it does draw a
certain like mind.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:37.080
And that like mind has a kind
of disdain for-- not disdain,

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:41.180
but they're private.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.590
So none of them really
want to invite the public

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.746
through any means at all.

00:07:46.746 --> 00:07:48.245
It's actually really
hard to see any

00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:50.340
of his caves because of that.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.840
Shel and Liz use their
cave as a guest house.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.580
And they're very generous about
it, so like friends of friends

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.127
stay there.

00:07:57.127 --> 00:07:58.960
The last time I was
there two weeks ago-- we

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.450
were there two or
three weeks ago--

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:01.991
and we walked into
the cave and there

00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:05.850
was like a family there
and a Buddhist monk

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:09.347
in full robes sitting on
one of the stoops there.

00:08:09.347 --> 00:08:10.180
And I was like, wow.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.940
That looks perfect.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.265
This is a made for you.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.030
And the other people use
them as places to meditate.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:24.148
And some people have like
music parties in them.

00:08:24.148 --> 00:08:28.094
So nobody lives in any
of them as far as I know.

00:08:28.094 --> 00:08:29.552
Shel and Liz's
cave, by the way, it

00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:30.760
has plumbing and electricity.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:36.470
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.261
JEFFREY KAROFF: Hi.

00:08:37.261 --> 00:08:40.490
AUDIENCE: It seems from the
documentary that for the people

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.850
closest to Ra that it was
really difficult over the course

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:46.310
of the years to like emotionally
support him, especially

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.640
his wife.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.010
In the time that you worked
with Ra to make this film,

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:55.040
what was your overall
impression of him as a person?

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.610
JEFFREY KAROFF: He's very open.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.120
And that was really helpful,
of course, as a filmmaker

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.140
that he was so willing
to talk about himself

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.820
and not necessarily
in positive--

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.250
paint himself in a positive
light all the time.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.010
Definitely what you
see is what you get.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.640
There is no subterfuge there.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.950
He is that guy.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:22.770
And he's incredibly kind,
incredibly generous person

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.200
and was really generous to us.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.030
I mean, down to
the smallest thing

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.120
where we had to haul
lots of equipment

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.910
up mountainsides many times.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.320
And he's the strongest
guy amongst us by

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.060
far even though
he was the oldest.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.190
And he would just pick
up the heaviest thing

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.820
and haul it up the
hill every time.

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.185
The business with his
wife, it's complicated.

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:47.910
It was complicated, I thought.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.115
Somebody else's relationship,
it's like-- eh, you know?

00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:53.310
You know that what.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:54.302
You kind of wonder.

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.260
Sometimes when I watch
the film, I think, well,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.290
why did you get involved
with this guy at all?

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.710
But because there's more
to it, there's more to it.

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.120
And actually right
after the film

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.880
was finished and was showing
and was getting popular,

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.800
they separated and
they were talking

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.570
about getting a divorce.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.280
And Ra called me and said
this is not your fault.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.410
This really was
coming before this.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.310
And she's gotten a lawyer
and we're getting divorced.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:22.850
And then two weeks later,
they were back together.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.005
So that's how that's going.

00:10:26.005 --> 00:10:26.504
Right.

00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:33.880
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned the
plumbing and the electricity.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.560
And I noticed other things like
nice wood floors and windows

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.530
in some of those caves.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.750
Does Ra do all that, or does
that get contracted out?

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.010
Or how does that happen?

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.420
JEFFREY KAROFF: He
prepared the walls

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.860
for the plumbing
and the electricity

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:52.690
to be put in by grooving
out the pathway.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:58.390
And there were natural
grains in the sandstone

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.400
that he could follow.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.600
But other people did
all of the woodwork

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.590
and the electrical
and the plumbing.

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.370
And there's a beautiful
door on that cave,

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.850
which is just stunning.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:11.250
But somebody else created that.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.160
And so a lot of really
talented artisans

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.150
in that part of
the world, there's

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.770
a concentration of
them around Dixon.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.512
Nora?

00:11:23.512 --> 00:11:28.332
NORA DVOSIN: I just think it's
worth mentioning the Jeff Bezos

00:11:28.332 --> 00:11:31.224
connection because
that one had something

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:33.634
to do with the authorities.

00:11:33.634 --> 00:11:36.070
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.510
JEFFREY KAROFF: Yeah,
what Nora's talking about

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:43.350
is that Jeff Bezos runs
this conference every year

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.870
called Campfire.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.210
And it is so under the
radar that you can hardly

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.515
find it on the
internet at all, which

00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:52.890
I didn't think
there was anything

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:58.020
that you couldn't
find through Google.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.810
But it's that kind of a
Ted conference for culture.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:08.810
And they invite painters,
writers, artists, filmmakers.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:13.510
And the organizer saw
this film and contacted Ra

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:14.940
and invited him.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.884
And he was really
well-received there.

00:12:19.884 --> 00:12:20.800
He did a presentation.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.800
They showed 15 minutes of film.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:25.040
And Jeff Bezos was
there, and he kind of

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:28.070
made a personal connection
with Bezos, so--

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:33.560
and with a lot of other powerful
people, so at some point,

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.120
who knows?

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.370
That may be a
force that he draws

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:40.950
upon when he is making his case.

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:42.120
Is that what you meant?

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.620
OK.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.312
Thank you guys for coming.

00:12:49.312 --> 00:12:50.270
Do you have a question?

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.060
Oh, wow.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:54.420
AUDIENCE: We saw about
the visual images

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.750
you talked about, various
helicopter tries or whatever.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:13:00.290
But could you describe
your audio process

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.640
throughout and what
you had in your mind

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:06.340
for the overall audio
feeling of the project, or--?

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.530
JEFFREY KAROFF:
Absolutely haphazard.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.380
I mean, I had-- I
was running sound.

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.290
And I've never run sound,
so that should give you

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:17.130
an idea of how well
that was planned.

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.560
But I had-- there are
these little audio,

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.060
digital audio
recorders now that I

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.710
borrowed from my brother-in-law.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.840
And then I borrowed microphones
from friends and stuff

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.300
because I don't actually
own any audio gear.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.290
And then sometimes we used a
shotgun on the camera itself.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.776
Sometimes we would do both.

00:13:36.776 --> 00:13:38.400
Sometimes we would
end up with no sound

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.280
because I forgot to
turn the microphone on.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:43.100
I have a couple of
scene like that.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.545
Actually, the very
first interview

00:13:44.545 --> 00:13:45.920
that I did on the
very first day,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.020
I forgot to start
the audio recorder.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:52.030
So we had to start over.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:54.430
I was shocked that the
sound came out so well.

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:56.034
I couldn't figure out why.

00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:57.450
AUDIENCE: It all
sounds very good.

00:13:57.450 --> 00:13:59.283
JEFFREY KAROFF: Yeah,
it sounds really good.

00:13:59.283 --> 00:14:01.600
And I violated
every single rule.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.950
I didn't know how to set levels
or anything, so I don't know.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.600
It scares me to think
like that's probably--

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.810
I shouldn't get any
confidence from that at all,

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.600
because it'll never
happen that way again.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.280
So yeah, but the guy who
did the music I thought

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.350
did a really nice job.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.840
And I was very much hoping that
he would create a soundtrack

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.039
that you could
listen to in your car

00:14:24.039 --> 00:14:25.330
if you were watching the movie.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.010
And I think he did something
very close to that, so.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:32.860
All right.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:34.200
I think we're done.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.440
Thanks, thanks a lot, guys.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.340
Thanks for coming in.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.090
[APPLAUSE]
