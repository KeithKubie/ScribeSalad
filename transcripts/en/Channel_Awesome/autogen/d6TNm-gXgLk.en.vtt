00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 align:start position:0%
I think would have made it just even
 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.270 align:start position:0%
I think would have made it just even
better<00:04:12.239><c> for</c><00:04:12.600><c> me</c><00:04:12.720><c> is</c><00:04:12.900><c> there's</c><00:04:13.560><c> one</c><00:04:13.830><c> character</c>

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
better for me is there's one character
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.300 align:start position:0%
better for me is there's one character
where<00:04:14.910><c> everything</c><00:04:15.420><c> they</c><00:04:15.570><c> do</c><00:04:15.630><c> comes</c>

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 align:start position:0%
where everything they do comes
 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.819 align:start position:0%
where everything they do comes
