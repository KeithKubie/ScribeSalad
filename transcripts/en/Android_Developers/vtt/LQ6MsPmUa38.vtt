00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.030
Hi there.

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.430
My name is Tamzin Taylor.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.910
I work in the Google Play Apps
and Games Partnerships team.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.550
I've been working to monetize
mobile content with partners

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.400
since 2001.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.150
And I can tell you that Play is
a global marketplace platform

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.780
for distributing software.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.110
Transactions are vital
to any marketplace,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.390
so we take our platforms
incredibly seriously.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.030
Our whole job is to
enable developers

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.420
like you to build and
run global businesses.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.850
And we're extremely proud
of what we've achieved.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.630
But we're still
working incredibly hard

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.290
to continue delivering
business and spend to you.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.150
Now, monetization is driven
by a number of best practices,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.910
including quality,
design, and investment

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.970
in using the great features that
the Android platform offers,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.900
such as alpha beta testing,
staged rollouts, and Cloud Test

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.032
Lab.

00:00:48.032 --> 00:00:49.490
You should also
consider strategies

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.330
to drive engagement,
increase retention, and grow

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.300
user lifetime value.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.440
And of course, consider
using analytics

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.060
to really know
who your users are

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.860
and be able to create
optimal experiences for them.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.470
But in the next 20
minutes, I'm going

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.330
to talk to you about how you
can increase monetization using

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.930
pricing best practices
and some of the tools

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.970
that we have at your
disposal so you can succeed.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.200
There's big money to
be made on Google Play.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.370
In fact, we paid out $7 billion
to our developers last year.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.280
When you operate on
Play, you have access

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.050
to over a billion users and
hundreds of millions of buyers.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.840
We've had huge teams spend
years building gigantic reach

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.210
into our commerce platform
in more countries with more

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.340
ways for users to pay.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.410
And in fact, we see a
lift in incremental sales

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.450
and new customers
whenever we introduce

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.890
a new form of payment.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.260
So the faster we unlock new
forms of payment, the larger

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.410
the pool of users who
can purchase your app.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.540
We now support over 100 forms
of payment across 152 countries,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.540
and we're constantly working
on new payment partnerships,

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.006
building more ways for
your users to pay you,

00:01:54.006 --> 00:01:55.880
and offering locally
relevant payment methods

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.070
to convert more users.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.500
For example, we recently
unlocked direct carrier billing

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.420
in India.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.690
We're committed to make
it easier and easier

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.100
for your users to pay you.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.490
And we're seeing it pay off.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.479
So in Germany, for
example, we saw

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.829
a 70% increase on
year-on-year buy growth,

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:15.120
and more and more developers
selling outside their home

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.950
market.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.490
We saw a 38% annual
growth in developers

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.560
with primarily
international sales.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.440
So given its increasingly
global market,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.710
how should you price your
top-quality application?

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.830
There are five key points
to setting and managing

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.800
your process effectively--
matching the model to market,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.050
considering purchasing power,
considering price format

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.940
preferences, taking into
account audience segmentation,

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.400
and regularly
checking your prices.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.420
Top developers consider
the pricing model

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.830
for key markets and
cultural expectations.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.490
For example, some
prepaid markets

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.660
have low credit card penetration
and are less predictable,

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.730
in which cases, models like
free, premium, or in-app

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.520
purchase might be more
relevant for them.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.294
And if considering a
subscription model,

00:03:00.294 --> 00:03:01.960
your value proposition
should give users

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:07.400
a regular, fresh, ongoing
contental functionality.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.750
Consider what people can afford.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.580
Last year in November, we
lowered the minimum price

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.390
in India from 50 to 10 rupees.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.280
Now, consider a can of Coke cost
10 rupees in India, roughly,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.920
whereas in the US, it's $1.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.950
And the exchange rate today
is 66 rupees to the $1.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.700
So you can see there's a
big difference in how much

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.170
people are charged and their
purchasing power parity.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.710
So it's important to give the
right consumer the right price.

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.820
Now, four weeks after
we launched this change

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.590
in the pricing, we saw
take-up from 560 totals

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.430
across 220 developers.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.110
After this four-week period,
we saw an 800% increase

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.000
in revenue.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.610
And interestingly 3/4
of the developers from

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.024
were from outside India.

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:54.440
This really highlights the
growth and internationalization

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.270
of our ecosystem.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.260
One of our partners,
Nova, dropped their prices

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.500
from 325 rupees to 15
rupees, and saw a big impact.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.850
They saw 136% increase in orders
and 27% increase in revenue.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.747
Now, the best way to find
out what purchasing parity

00:04:11.747 --> 00:04:13.330
differences there
are across countries

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.460
is to look at the Big
Mac index, which you can

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.420
find on the economist website.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.829
Many top partners are testing
prices in overseas markets.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.450
Learning language app
Busuu tested ABCD prices

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.480
across Russia and the US
to find the optimal price

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.850
for those different consumers.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.600
In the USA, it ended up
being a 23% reduction, which

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.480
resulted in 95% increase
conversion and 50% increase

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.140
in ARPU.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.880
In Russia, it was different.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.700
The optimal process
was 12% lower,

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.780
which resulted in 15% increase
in conversion and 17% increase

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.140
in ARPU.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.670
So the caveat here is,
don't take our word for it.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.280
Test yourselves.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.740
Test your different prices
to find the optimal point

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.130
for increased conversion
and incremental revenue

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.860
in your different markets.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.780
Consider local price preferences
and optimize your price format

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.200
for different markets.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.770
For example, in
Korea and Japan, they

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.740
prefer prices which ends
in whole, rounded numbers,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.840
such as 1,000 2,000, et cetera,
whereas in Australia, we

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.080
prefer 199, 299.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.110
Now, you can do this in
the developer console.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.964
In fact, you can customize a
price for every single market,

00:05:21.964 --> 00:05:23.630
and we'll take care
of billing the users

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.030
in their local currency.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.410
We think if users see an
optimized price and a value

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.010
offering that works
for them, they're

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.150
more likely to agree to purchase
or subscribe to your offer.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.860
Now, users are not homogeneous.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.429
And it's best practice to know
who they are, their appetite

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:40.720
to pay, and carve out different
strategies to help them

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.520
on their purchase journey.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.970
And we provide the
tools to help you.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.640
There's great reporting
in the developer console.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.410
And Google Analytics
gives you the ability

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.410
to identify and target
entirely different offers

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.350
to different segments, all to
help you increase conversion

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.264
and ARPU.

00:05:56.264 --> 00:05:58.430
You really should use
analytics to better understand

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.670
your audience engagement, using
KPIs like last visit, loyalty,

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.370
and average tenure.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.300
To really help you
improve purchase flows,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.360
develop user segments based
on predictive lifetime value,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.860
and start targeting different
segments with optimal offers.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.100
WYSH did this, and
saw a 10% uplift

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.220
from presenting different
offers to highly-engaged

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.120
versus less-engaged
user segments.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.680
Finally, developers
should regularly

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.800
review and adjust prices,
primarily for two reasons.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.360
Number one, to
ensure you're still

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.370
competitive with similar
apps, and secondly,

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.410
in response to changes
in foreign exchange.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.670
For example, a developer who
set their price in February 2014

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.010
and didn't change it for a year
would have seen in February '15

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.780
that their gross revenue from
Russia had dropped nearly 50%,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.360
severely impacting margin, just
from an exchange rate movement.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.710
So to recap the
five best practices

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.970
I've mentioned so far,
they were matching

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.410
the model to the market,
considering purchasing power,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.740
consider user price
format preferences,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.390
use audience segmentation, and
regularly check your prices.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.020
Now, a running theme here
is that not all users

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.580
are the same.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.480
They have different
price sensitivities.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.836
So how can you do with this
and increase monetization?

00:07:11.836 --> 00:07:13.210
I'll now touch on
how you can use

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.669
AdMob to monetize across
different types of users.

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.710
And then, I'll talk to
the power of subscriptions

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.830
before wrapping up.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.090
AdMob is our industry-leading
ads and mediation platform

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.400
that's earned over 650,000
developers over $1 billion

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:29.410
in the last two years.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.330
The growth statistics
are impressive.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.790
This tells us that not
only does AdMob work well,

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.330
but it tells us something
about the ecosystem.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.230
Advertising is a significant
part of app monetization,

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.210
and is growing every year.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.210
In fact, Gartner predicts
that by 2017, there'll

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.580
be nearly 270 billion apps
downloaded, the majority being

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.240
free of freemium.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.370
Now, with this growth in
free and freemium apps

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.016
comes growth in
mobile advertising.

00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:55.640
Now, I mentioned
earlier that consumers

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.415
differ between markets
because of income

00:07:57.415 --> 00:07:59.180
or cultural preferences.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.960
And a monetization strategy
might work in one market,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.799
but not in another.

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:05.340
We believe that a
developer shouldn't

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.960
be forced to choose between
advertising or in-app purchase

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.610
only.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.850
In fact, the best apps
focus on users first.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.054
And you should be able to build
monetization around the user.

00:08:16.054 --> 00:08:18.470
AdMob can help you find the
right monetization opportunity

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:21.470
because it has a smart
monetization engine.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.790
And this is a feature
called In-App Purchase Ads.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.690
It helps promote in-app
purchase items to users

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.430
so you can grow
your in-app purchase

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.539
revenue by automatically
knowing which users are buyers

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.370
and which are less
likely to spend.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:37.380
It looks at spend
behavior in your app,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.510
and only shows ads to
those less likely to buy,

00:08:40.510 --> 00:08:42.580
freeing up valuable
impressions for you.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.720
Plus, it's integrated
with Google Analytics.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.650
In-app purchase and ads are
two great ways to make money.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.450
And with AdMob, you can automate
the presentation of the offers

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.319
to match the users
likely spend behavior.

00:08:54.319 --> 00:08:56.610
Another model which works
well for generating recurring

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:58.910
revenue is subscriptions.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.330
Users and developers
love subscriptions.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.460
They have become widely
accepted and adopted

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.940
across the music, movie,
and TV industries.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.860
And this adoption is
being seen in apps.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.190
For users, subscriptions mean
no unforeseen chargeable events.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.740
They remove the fear
and increase trust.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.310
The app is always there
for you when you need it.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.150
For developers subscriptions
mean recurring revenue,

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.242
which is great for cash flow.

00:09:22.242 --> 00:09:23.700
And did you know
that subscriptions

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:26.260
are the fastest growing
business model on Play?

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.950
Last year, they showed 2 and
1/2 times growth year-on-year.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.441
But why is this?

00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.940
First of all, users
are getting used

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.730
to paying for digital content.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.620
And secondly, the
overall standard

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:38.910
of quality in Android
apps is increasingly

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.280
leaps and bounds, led by
industry-leading developers

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.180
like yourselves.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:46.580
And many developers
are seeing success.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.520
Busuu recently redesign
their onboarding flows

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.103
and app designed to
better communicate

00:09:50.103 --> 00:09:52.790
their new subscription
value propositions.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.740
After optimizing their
subscription offers,

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.370
they found their
Android retention beat

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.850
all other platforms, and
their subscription revenue

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:04.685
increased 125% and the
ARPU increased 86%.

00:10:04.685 --> 00:10:06.810
The New York Times implemented
Google Play Billing,

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.800
replacing the traditional
news publisher paywall.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.240
This resulted in
user' sign-up flow

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.810
shortening from two
minutes to three seconds,

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:18.230
and a 125% increase in
subscription conversion

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:23.500
after the first month and
254% increase year-on-year.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.270
Pandora also saw a
397% revenue increase

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.770
through optimizing
their conversions

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.010
by offering a trial period.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.130
It's really important
with subscription model

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.330
to allow users to
try before they buy.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.820
You can decide the
length yourself,

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.330
but show them the
value to increase

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.120
their likelihood of converting.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.620
Google offers heaps
of functionality

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.120
to build a successful
subscriptions business.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.930
There are upgrades
and downgrades

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.430
to help ease the
barrier for entry

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:50.660
by offering multiple
plans to users.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.600
There are grace periods
for helping people

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.150
when their payment's declined.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.750
And there are goodwill
credits, which

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.086
can be used for
promotion or complaints.

00:10:58.086 --> 00:10:59.460
And of course,
it's all supported

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.050
by deep financial metrics
available in the developer

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.780
console.

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:06.280
And last year, we even added
additional time periods,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.830
which now allow you to really
create interesting, compelling

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.260
offers based on weekly,
monthly, quarterly, six-monthly,

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.320
and annual recurring
billing periods.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.550
Google Play is a
huge, growing market.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.800
And pricing is one lever
for better monetization.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.580
But it must be
executed in combination

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:26.070
with improvements in quality
and by having a deep knowledge

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.980
about your users.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.480
You can achieve
success by following

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.830
the five processing best
practices I mentioned today.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.860
Be flexible about your
monetization model,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.670
consider using AdMob to
reach nonpaying users,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.970
and utilize the new range
of subscription models

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.140
to grow your revenue annuity.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.060
Thanks for watching.
