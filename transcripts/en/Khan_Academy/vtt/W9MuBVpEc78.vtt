00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.230
- [Instructor] We've already discussed

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.890
the notion of unemployment
at length in other videos.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.360
And what we're going to do in this video

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.450
is dig a little bit deeper

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.710
and think about what makes
up the unemployment rate?

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.780
And just as a review,
the unemployment rate,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.780
it's the percentage of
people in the labor force

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.820
who are actively looking for a job.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.280
And on this chart that you
see here, or this graph,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.300
from the St. Louis Federal Reserve,

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.640
this brown color is the unemployment rate.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.450
And you can see how it jumps around,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.390
along with the economic cycles.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.340
These gray areas, right over here,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.590
these show recessions,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.460
and then the white areas are expansion.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.050
You can see how the unemployment rate

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.710
jumps during most of these recessions,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010
or really all of these recessions here.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.860
But then we have other things graphed.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.950
We have this thing in blue,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.670
known as the natural rate of unemployment.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.750
What is that?

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.800
Well, it is what the word describes.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.020
You could view this blue line,

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.340
and it's really an approximation,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.040
of what would the unemployment rate be

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.990
if you did not have these economic cycles.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.520
These periods of expansion
and then recession.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.080
In some ways, you can view it as

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.690
the smoothed out unemployment rate.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.000
And so if this in brown,
is the unemployment rate,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.410
and then in blue, right over here,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.240
you have your natural
rate of unemployment.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.900
People will sometimes use NRU for that.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.900
The difference between the two,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.320
that's the unemployment
caused by the business cycle.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.790
So this is, so let's say
if we go right over here,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.720
where we had a high unemployment rate,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.030
this difference right over here,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.690
so you could view this as

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.610
the unemployment rate minus

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.900
the natural rate of unemployment,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.200
minus the natural rate of unemployment,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.400
that's the unemployment that's
caused by the business cycle.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.900
and so that's why it is called cyclical.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.310
Cyclical unemployment.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.220
And so you could see at,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.700
during recessions or shortly
after recession ends,

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.950
when the unemployment rate,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.320
when the regular unemployment
rate is very high,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.760
your cyclical unemployment,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.370
the unemployment caused
due to the business cycle,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.890
is going to be positive.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.910
But when the economy is really humming,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.040
there, you can even have
negative cyclical unemployment.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.310
Right over here.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.320
Where the true unemployment rate

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.000
is lower than the natural
rate of unemployment,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.330
maybe people who are hiring,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.320
maybe business just have to hire people

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.440
that aren't fully qualified
for the jobs, or whatever else,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.190
just because things are so
hot at that moment in time.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.430
But then we can break
down things even further.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.290
We can break down this notion of

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.780
natural rate of unemployment
into two components.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.410
You can break it down into structural,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.640
I will do that in this blue color,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.570
so structural.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.310
Structural unemployment and
frictional unemployment.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.640
Not fictional, frictional. (laughs)

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.490
Frictional unemployment.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.620
And we don't have the
exact data that here,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.310
but let's, I'll just draw
something just to imagine.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.150
Let's just imagine,

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.700
this isn't the exact,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.630
this isn't the exact information.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.880
But let's imagine that the
frictional unemployment rate

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.910
would be this much right over here.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.150
And then the structural would be the rest

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.440
to make it add up to the
natural rate of unemployment.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.350
And so one thing that
you might immediately say

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.300
is okay, the natural rate is made up of

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.280
structural plus frictional unemployment

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.310
or if you add frictional plus structural,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.850
you get your natural rate.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.100
But what are these things?

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.210
Well, structural unemployment,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.280
this is a situation

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.090
where people are being counted
in the unemployment rate,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.580
but there's something about,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.310
a disconnect between their skills

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.060
and what employers are looking for,

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.990
that is making it difficult
for them to find a job.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.823
You could imagine

00:03:47.823 --> 00:03:49.970
when the car was replacing
the horse and buggy,

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.900
if you are a horse and buggy driver,

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.840
or you were good caring for horses,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.770
but now people were
looking for auto mechanics,

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.140
or people who knew about cars,

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.330
or people who could help
build roads for cars.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.410
Well then that would be a situation

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.510
with structural unemployment.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.760
Where the skills did not match the jobs.

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.890
And so over time, and there's,

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:07.730
you might say, well over time

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.790
those people would learn
to do things for cars.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.000
But there's always change in the economy.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.870
If you think about it right now,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.610
technology is constantly evolving.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.660
There's constantly new
needs in the economy,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.890
and so there will always
be some lack of fit

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.410
between the skills that
people have right now

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.750
and the skills that employers need.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.120
It might also relate to where people are.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.310
Where the people might not be

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.210
in the place where the
jobs are, or vice versa.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.060
Now, frictional unemployment.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.610
Well, that comes out of the ideas

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.520
that there are some frictions
when you look for a job.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.120
You've got to submit your resume,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.170
you have to interview around,

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.490
everyone doesn't go directly
from one job to the next.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.680
It's a good situation to be in,

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.330
but many times you might
have graduated from college,

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.360
you are looking for a job.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.860
Employers are looking to fill a position.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.680
And so this is just a
natural state of affairs.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.920
Over time, if technology gets better,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.910
if there's better ways to match jobs,

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.090
the frictional unemployment
could decrease.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.240
But it's unlikely it will ever go to zero.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.210
That there will always be some
people in the labor market

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.740
who are actively looking for a job,

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.700
who have the skills that
the labor market needs,

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.870
so they wouldn't be counted in
the structural unemployment,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.780
but they haven't found that job yet.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.240
So I will leave you there.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.870
And hopefully this gives
you an appreciation

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.210
that you often see the unemployment rate,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.740
but you can think about
it as being made up of

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.550
the natural rate of unemployment

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.560
and the cyclical unemployment.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.560
And then the natural rate
of unemployment itself,

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.690
can be broken down further

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.920
into structural and
frictional unemployment.
