00:00:06.046 --> 00:00:08.206
These techniques are wonderful

00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:12.286
for raising the students'
energy level, for relaxing them.

00:00:12.286 --> 00:00:15.706
They can be done with the entire
class at the beginning of class

00:00:15.706 --> 00:00:19.966
which is the best time to do
it or if kids are losing focus

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.866
or they're tired, you can, if
you give the kids permission,

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:25.636
they can go off to the side of
the room, take a few minutes

00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:30.456
to do any one or a series of
these techniques to get refocused

00:00:30.456 --> 00:00:32.626
and re-energized and then
go back to their work.

00:00:34.406 --> 00:00:36.706
You take what's called
the athletic ready stance,

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:38.326
where your feet are
comfortably apart,

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:41.916
little wider than shoulders
width, the knees are slightly bent

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:43.546
and the back is straight.

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:47.396
And this technique, you
simply rotated the hips

00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:49.646
with the arms flopping
out from the body,

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:53.136
your head turns with your shoulders.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.256
You don't force it though.

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:55.356
But the hips lead.

00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:59.346
It isn't the arms leading first
and then the body following.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:04.986
The hips lead first and then
the arms follow after that.

00:01:05.136 --> 00:01:06.746
You allow your head to turn.

00:01:07.546 --> 00:01:08.796
Keep the knees bent.

00:01:09.396 --> 00:01:13.956
And if you keep this up for-- and
it's easy to do, don't force, two,

00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:16.826
three minutes, you really
feel good afterwards.

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:19.466
You feel relaxed and
you feel energized.

00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:24.396
This technique works all the muscles
in the body and neurologically,

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:27.446
it programs the kids
to be ready to learn

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:30.096
and then you just allow the
motion to come to a gradual halt.

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:34.706
So the idea is, put the
hands together over the head,

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:40.146
come up on one leg, bend the
knee and you focus on your belly,

00:01:40.146 --> 00:01:44.486
actually a spot in the middle of your
abdominal cavity, between your belly

00:01:44.486 --> 00:01:46.196
and back and left hip and right hip.

00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:49.856
It's just to get balanced
and focused.

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:53.696
Come down after doing
that for about 30 seconds.

00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:55.536
Shake it out with your feet.

00:01:56.156 --> 00:01:58.536
Go back up on the other leg.

00:01:58.736 --> 00:02:00.896
Try not to look at
anyone or anything.

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:04.006
Be in what we call soft
eyes, where everything comes

00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:05.406
into your field of vision.

00:02:05.866 --> 00:02:09.326
You don't look out on the world.

00:02:09.326 --> 00:02:12.766
Okay, you come down and
again shake that out.

00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:18.746
The palms pushed together here
in a nice symmetric fashion

00:02:19.356 --> 00:02:20.956
and the knees are slightly bent.

00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:22.366
The back stays straight.

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:26.326
Push the palms together and inhale
through the nose as you go up.

00:02:27.466 --> 00:02:29.556
Once at the top, turn the palms out,

00:02:29.936 --> 00:02:33.796
exhale through the mouth
[breathing], arms extended but uh..

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:35.126
not uh.. tense.

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:38.946
And once they're parallel, bend
the knees again, come together,

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:41.836
inhale [breathing],
exhale [breathing].

00:02:41.886 --> 00:02:49.736
And if doing this in a class
setting, you want everybody

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:56.876
in sync doing it together.

00:02:57.776 --> 00:03:05.506
One more [breathing], the blades
of the hand are going forward,

00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:07.276
the thumbs are going back.

00:03:07.276 --> 00:03:09.806
Not the palms forward like
you're waiving goodbye.

00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:15.386
Blades go forward, thumbs
go back, biceps, triceps,

00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:17.716
trapezious, nice and relaxed.

00:03:17.716 --> 00:03:22.286
So you're generating energy, shaking
the hands good but staying relaxed.

00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:25.996
And so you do this wrist shake and
a great thing to do with the kids

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:29.256
in class is, you do this
for about ten seconds

00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:33.206
and then you call off a
student's name say, Barbara.

00:03:33.576 --> 00:03:36.866
And then Barbara waits about ten
seconds after you call her name.

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:38.346
And she says down.

00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:44.036
And the whole class then goes [claps]
once, twice, and then come back up.

00:03:44.306 --> 00:03:45.216
Do it again.

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:49.696
And you do this with two
other students and finally,

00:03:50.236 --> 00:03:53.776
after the third student has done
this, the technique is done.

00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:57.686
So we'll just replicate that
again and assume we're calling

00:03:57.686 --> 00:03:59.716
on the third student, say Juan.

00:04:00.476 --> 00:04:06.576
And we wait about ten seconds and
then Juan will say, down [claps].

00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:10.976
And those are the techniques.
