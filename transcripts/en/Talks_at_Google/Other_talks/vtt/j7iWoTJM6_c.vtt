SANDRA LEUNG LI: Thanks
for joining us

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.800
today for this talk.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.620
I am very excited to extend a
warm welcome to chef Joanne

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.411
Chang today.

00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:10.872
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:12.122
JOANNE CHANG: Thank you.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.270
SANDRA LEUNG LI: So Joanne is an
honors graduate of Harvard

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.700
College with a degree
in applied

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.430
mathematics and economics.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.810
She left a career as a
management consultant to enter

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.050
the world of professional
cooking.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.700
Before opening Flour, she
honed her skills working

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.470
various restaurants, including
the department at Payard in

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.630
New York City, and was
previously pastry chef at

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.210
Rialto and Mistral
here in Boston.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.940
In 2000, she opened Flour
Bakery and Cafe

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.280
in the South End.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.180
Since then, she's opened three
other locations, including

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.350
Fort Point Channel, Central
Square, and Back Bay.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.740
In 2007, Joanne opened a Chinese
restaurant in the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.470
South End, called Myers and
Chang, with her husband,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.410
Christopher Myers.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.890
Flour has been featured in
"Gourmet," "Food and Wine,"

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.770
"Bon Appetit," and "Boston
Magazine," among other

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.069
publications, and has
received numerous

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.110
Best of Boston awards.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.570
Also, you may have seen Joanne
prevail versus Bobby Flay in

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.850
the sticky bun "Throwdown,"
featured on the Food Network.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.195
And most recently, Joanne was
awarded the 2013 Share Our

00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:23.090
Strength Chef of the Year award
for her involvement with

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.620
the No Kid Hungry campaign.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.180
So congratulations, Joanne, and
thank you very much for

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.220
joining us today.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.348
JOANNE CHANG: Thank
you for having me.

00:01:29.348 --> 00:01:33.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.500
SANDRA LEUNG LI: You just
released your new cookbook

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.750
yesterday, actually, right?

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.290
JOANNE CHANG: Mm hmm.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.860
SANDRA LEUNG LI: So you must be
ramping up for a very busy

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.590
month of book touring.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.160
JOANNE CHANG: Yes.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.070
When the first book came out,
I actually did come here to

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.990
Google and you guys welcomed me
just as warmly last time,

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.190
so thank you.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.170
When the first book came out, I
said to my publisher, so is

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.310
there a book tour?

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.980
And they said, no, we don't
really do that anymore.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.080
I think with bloggers and Food
Network and all of that, they

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.900
really were putting all of their
energies and monies in

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.760
people who they knew would
get a big audience.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.139
So they didn't book me anything,
which is fine.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.250
And then I did a lot of stuff
locally, and then I went to

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.650
New York once.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.860
This time around, I don't
know what has changed.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.310
I've never really asked
them what happened.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.250
I think the success of the
first book helped.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.330
I'm not really sure, actually.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.970
So this time, the book came out
yesterday, and I'm going

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.230
to the West Coast, Toronto, the
Midwest, and Texas, all in

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.330
the next couple of months, day
trips here and there, and then

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.550
three and four-day trips and
taking advantage of being out

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.740
on the West Coast.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:41.540
I'm pretty excited.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.930
I've never really travelled for
the book, so I'm curious

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.010
to see what it will be like.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.320
When I come to Boston, most
people know Flour, and it's

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.530
easy for me to talk about it,
and people have questions that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.370
are all relevant to what
I do every day.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.030
So I'm very curious to see what
happens when I go to a

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.870
place where nobody's ever
heard of Flour or me.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.500
And I'm hoping it's not three
people and me, but we'll see.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.860
We'll see.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.210
SANDRA LEUNG LI: I think
it'll be more.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.130
JOANNE CHANG: I hope so.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.380
SANDRA LEUNG LI: What's your
favorite city that

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.170
you'll be going to?

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.110
JOANNE CHANG: Oh, that's
a good question.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.830
Well, we're going to San
Francisco, which I'm really

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.390
excited about.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.570
I don't get there very often,
so I am excited to go there.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.570
And then I'm going to Dallas,
which is where my parents are,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.520
so I'm excited to be
able to do that.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.420
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Cool.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.470
So I imagine you have a lot of
fans that come out to see you.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.120
Clearly, we have quite
a few here at Google.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.860
What is the oddest encounter you
have had from a fan at one

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.670
of these events?

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.030
JOANNE CHANG: Oh, boy.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.310
SANDRA LEUNG LI: There
might be a weird

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.100
encounter after this.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.170
I don't know.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.520
JOANNE CHANG: Exactly.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.890
If I'm describing you
right now, I still

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.230
think you're wonderful.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.550
So last night, I was actually
Wellesley books.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.130
And when I came home, my husband
said, so how was it?

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.100
And I said, this was the first
book signing that I've done

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.130
where there wasn't some crazy
person who came up to me.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.250
Every now and then, there will
be somebody who is extremely

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.980
enthusiastic about either me
or sticky buns or pastry.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.440
It could be anything.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.960
And I don't think it's
personal to me.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.790
I think they just latched onto
whatever it is about me or the

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.530
book that has resonated
with them.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.260
And usually, at book signings
that are kind of out in the

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.800
world, versus here, where I feel
like there's probably,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.490
hopefully, nobody that crazy,
there's always somebody who

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.130
will stay at the very end and
stay at the table and want to

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.075
talk for about three hours.

00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:31.665
Of course, I love talking to
people who love Flour, I love

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:34.260
talking about baking, and I
could talk for three hours

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.780
about the book.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.450
So it's not that talkative
people are weird.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.210
It's just sometimes there are
fans who get a little bit too

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.040
intimate and want to
know details and--

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.290
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Take
note, guys.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.500
JOANNE CHANG: I'm just not ever
sure how to graciously

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.610
back away from that.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.345
I had one woman who basically
followed me from book signing

00:04:56.345 --> 00:04:58.320
to book signing the
first time around.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.370
And every time, at the very
end, she waited until

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.370
everybody left, and she spent a
lot of time stroking my arm

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.080
and telling me how much
she loved me.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.550
She was very, very sweet, and
it was one of those things

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.490
where I just felt bad, because
I didn't know how to--

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.350
It would be better if she were
really rude, because then I

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.020
could say, I don't want
to deal with you.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.170
But she was so nice,
so what do you do?

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.850
You're too nice?

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.100
I didn't know what to say.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.320
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Try
that next time.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.950
So why did you decide to come
out with your second cookbook?

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.320
JOANNE CHANG: After writing the
first one, I definitely

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.500
knew I wanted to
write a second.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.890
I really loved the whole
book-writing process.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.040
But I thought that the second
cookbook would be "Myers and

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.350
Chang," which is the Asian
restaurant I own with my

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.600
husband in the South End.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.490
And in fact, I had already
started testing recipes and

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.900
was ready to write a proposal
to send off to Chronicle.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.390
And when the first book came
out, immediately readers were

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.120
sending me emails or tweets and
Facebook posts or whatever

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.630
saying, I really
love the book.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.700
I'm making such and such.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.340
What happened to this recipe?

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.590
What happened to that recipe?

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.140
I thought the first book was
relatively complete, until I

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.990
started getting all of these
inquiries, and people were

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.510
asking about the egg sandwich or
the brown sugar oat muffin

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.540
or the lemon ginger mousse or
other things that we do at the

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.830
bakery that just, for whatever
reason, had slipped my mind.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.340
So I started to get a number of
these inquiries, and about

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:21.010
the same time, my publisher,
Chronicle, reached out and

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.020
said, we would like to do
a second book with you.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.890
I know you want to do "Myers
and Chang," but we actually

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.330
think there's an opportunity
with the second part of Flour,

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.950
basically the savory end.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.170
We originally had a savory
chapter in the first Flour

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.610
book, but it got cut because
the book was too big.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.260
And so we took out that
whole chapter.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.260
So I was already one up on
chapters for this potential

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.970
second book, and then I had
this list of emails with

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.760
literally probably 20 inquiries
of different things

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.470
that people wanted from Flour.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.180
So it became a natural next
book, even though it wasn't

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.005
what immediately came to my
mind, to do "Flour, Too."

00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:02.560
SANDRA LEUNG LI: And it sounds
like there could be a third

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.390
book coming out too.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.490
JOANNE CHANG: Well, again, I
think the third book should be

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.690
"Myers and Chang,"
but my publisher

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.560
has a different idea.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.260
So I am signing a deal with them
some time this week to do

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.340
a low-sugar baking book,
which is interesting.

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.070
I know that everyone's
kind of like, wow,

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.730
where'd that come from?

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.720
I don't know where
it came from.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.340
Again, they reached out to me.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.590
This is how it works.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.850
At Chronicle Books, the
food/cookbook publisher, she

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.880
is married to a doctor who is
colleagues with the guy who

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.590
wrote the sugar is toxic
article that was in the

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:42.890
"Times" about six months ago.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.970
I don't know if you guys saw
it, but it was a really

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.670
interesting article.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.770
And for me, as somebody who
lives in plying sugar to

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.430
others, it was a little bit
nerve-wracking to read that

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:53.220
and think, oh, gosh,
what's going to

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.030
happen now to my business?

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.630
It was the same fear I had when
we first opened Flour and

00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:00.190
Atkins diet was a big thing
and no gluten and all that

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.930
sort of stuff.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.870
Anyway, the editor, she called
me and said, you know, we are

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.390
really interested in thinking
about what the future of

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.670
baking might be.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.370
Because they spend a lot of
time looking forward to

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.980
trends, and so in order for
them to come out with a

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.130
gluten-free baking book today or
a Paleo baking book today,

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.320
they have to know that it's
something that's going to be

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.940
popular like three or
four years ago.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.690
She's anticipating that
low-sugar will be something

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:32.710
that will be interesting in two
or three years, and so she

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:34.970
asked me if I would be
interested in considering it.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.750
And honestly, for me, I read
that article, the sugar is

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.179
toxic, and I do know for myself
I eat a lot of sugar

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.204
every day, and I know how
it makes me feel.

00:08:43.204 --> 00:08:45.280
I get that sugar rush,
I get really

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.510
energized, and then I crash.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.180
And I've just gotten
used to it.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:50.560
It's just kind of what I do.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.650
But if I were trying to eat more
healthily, or if I were

00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:56.480
raising a family, and if I was
just trying to be more

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.940
thoughtful about how I eat,
then I would want

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.570
to reduce my sugar.

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.090
And so I tested a bunch of
recipes, because I didn't want

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.980
to say, yes, I'll do this book,
without knowing if it

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.410
was even possible.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:10.180
And I tested two really popular
recipes from the first

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.040
baking book, the banana bread
and the oatmeal raisin cookie.

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.000
And I was able to successfully
make both of them with either

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.560
a third or half the amount
of sugar that's

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.550
listed in the book.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.620
In fact, I made them for the
bakers at the Flour South End

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.350
location, and most of them
preferred the new low-sugar

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.260
version to the current
version.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:32.210
So to me, that was a really good
sign that, one, it can be

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.020
done and then, two, that
it would be fun.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.650
I really enjoyed the
whole process.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.310
Baking, it's fun and creative
when you get to

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.060
do things like this.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.880
When you're doing things every
day, it starts to get a little

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:44.750
bit monotonous, and then you
get thrown a challenge like

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.720
this, and you're reminded of
why you got into it in the

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.660
first place.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.770
So that's the next book.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.920
I did ask my publisher if I was
allowed to talk about it,

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.530
because at first we weren't
going to talk about it.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.200
And he said, yes, as long
as we don't tell

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.280
the publishing world.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.620
So I don't know if there's
anybody in here--

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.950
SANDRA LEUNG LI: It will
be on YouTube.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.695
JOANNE CHANG: Oh, I think they
don't want it in "Publishers

00:10:07.695 --> 00:10:09.300
Weekly." That's what
I'm assuming.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:09.500
SANDRA LEUNG LI: All right.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.480
Well, we'll make sure it'll
stay in this room.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.180
JOANNE CHANG: In the bubble.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.060
SANDRA LEUNG LI: So what is
your favorite recipe from

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.500
"Flour, Too"?

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.870
JOANNE CHANG: That's
a good question.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.500
Gosh, favorite recipe.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.390
That's so hard.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.900
My favorite thing to eat from
the "Flour, Too" book would be

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.680
the Kouign Amann, which is the
butter Breton cake, which is

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.600
in the "Party Time" section
of the book.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.800
I first had butter Breton
cake 15 or 20 years ago

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.000
when I was in Paris.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.550
It was before we opened Flour,
and I remember biting into it.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.335
It is basically a croissant that
is made with extra butter

00:10:46.335 --> 00:10:51.050
and extra sugar so that it
becomes really, really crispy

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.580
and caramelized on the edge,
and it's still flaky.

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.540
You know what?

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.850
You know this whole thing
with the cronut?

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.400
I'm sure you guys all
know about it.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.780
It's sort of like that.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.660
It's got the same thing that the
cronut has going for it.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.980
It's got the crunchy on
the outside and the

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.000
flaky on the inside.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.260
So when I first had it 15,
20 years ago, I remember

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:09.500
thinking, if I ever open my own
place, we're going to make

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.190
Kouign Amann.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.500
We opened Flour, and I
developed a recipe.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.220
But it was really difficult to
make on a day-to-day basis.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.250
And so we offered only at the
holidays for 11 years.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:21.430
Then I started writing this
book, and I wanted to put the

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.450
recipe in the book.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.500
And I told my executive pastry
chef, if it's in the book,

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.780
we're going to have to
offer it every day.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:30.950
So about a year ago, we figured
out the production,

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.040
and now we're offering
it every day.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.020
So I would say that's probably
one of my favorites.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.460
SANDRA LEUNG LI: That
sounds delicious.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.732
And I am a big fan
of the cronut.

00:11:38.732 --> 00:11:40.630
JOANNE CHANG: I haven't
had it yet.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.680
SANDRA LEUNG LI: I want to go
back in time a bit and have

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.330
you think back to the first
time you ever baked.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.420
When was that?

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.410
And what did you bake?

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:55.620
JOANNE CHANG: The first time I
ever baked, I was probably 10.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.960
Let me think about this.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.760
No, actually, the first time,
I think I was about 7.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.640
I remember this now.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.820
And it wasn't even baking.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:05.610
But for some reason, I thought,
I'm going to make

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.790
something with my friend.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:08.390
I can't remember his
name, like Tim.

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:10.960
We were little seven-year-olds,
right?

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.730
My parents both worked.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.290
And I remember, because my mom
got really mad afterwards, I

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.880
crossed the freeway so that I
could get to the 7-Eleven to

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.680
buy ingredients, and then we
crossed the freeway back.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.430
And we made--

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.290
This isn't really baking, but I
assume this is kind of what

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.240
you're going for--

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.840
little fruit kebabs.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.440
We bought whatever fruit you can
buy over at 7-Eleven, and

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.650
we cut it all up, and we
put it on toothpicks.

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.305
We put it in little baggies,
and then we forgot about it

00:12:41.305 --> 00:12:44.190
for a day and brought it the
next day to our teachers, at

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:48.410
which point the bananas were all
mushy and the apples were

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:49.470
all yellowed.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:50.680
But we were so proud.

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.620
And I do remember giving it to
my teacher and just being

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.900
really excited that I had made
something and given it to her

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.890
because I loved her.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.430
So it wasn't really baking,
but that was like my first

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:02.680
time in the kitchen.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.830
SANDRA LEUNG LI: And was
that the beginning of

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:05.940
what got you hooked?

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.890
Or when was the first moment?

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.730
JOANNE CHANG: I've always
loved to be in the--

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.850
After that, I definitely spent
time in the kitchen.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.300
My mom was a working mom.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.600
And so I would come home from
school, and she would often

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.690
need help, basically, just
putting together dinner.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.570
I got to be pretty adept in
helping her just prep stuff,

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.120
so by the time she got
home, she could

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.810
just do a quick stir-fry.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.300
Or I would put stuff in the oven
and get the rice ready,

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.530
or whatever.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:36.030
So I'd always very comfortable
in the kitchen.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:38.370
I think that the first
time that I ever

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.350
thought about it truly--

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:40.880
I thought about it

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.330
professionally very, very late.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:44.190
It wasn't until after college.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.020
But when I was in college,
I did make chocolate chip

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:53.290
cookies in the dormitory
kitchen, and I sold them to

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.480
the dormitory Grill.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.460
And I sold them to the guys who
ran the Grill for $0.25

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.700
each, and they sold
them three for $1.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.540
I did it for two years, junior
and senior year.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.740
And I remember I guess every
semester they would write me a

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:12.680
check for the proceeds, and
it was like $60 or $70.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.850
And I would use the money to go
buy running shoes, because

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:16.550
I was a runner.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.610
So that was kind of my first
foray into making food that

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:22.430
then people paid you for.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.350
But I certainly didn't think
at that point, oh, great.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.090
Now I'm going to go
and open a bakery.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.190
At that point, it was a
way to kill some time.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.930
SANDRA LEUNG LI: So you
mentioned running shoes.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:34.530
And I did read how you ran every
single Boston Marathon

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.790
from '91 to 2006.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:39.805
Was that your strategy, run a
marathon, eat, [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:42.930
JOANNE CHANG: No.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.310
I don't run as much anymore,
which is unfortunate, because

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:48.430
I really do miss it.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:53.320
But I definitely think that when
you're working all day in

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.290
a kitchen and you're surrounded
by food and you're

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.180
eating food all day long,
there's something that's just

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:00.210
very relaxing.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.250
And for me, it's good for
my mind to go out and

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.160
go for a long run.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.290
And so for years it
was my thing.

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.630
I calmed myself down, and it
was my little zen thing.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:12.020
I'm not a speed runner.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.250
It took me like five or
six hours each time,

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.640
just plodding along.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.570
But it's just something that
definitely helps balance the

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:24.175
amount of eating that
you do all day long.

00:15:24.175 --> 00:15:26.010
SANDRA LEUNG LI: You're a
Harvard graduate and former

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.210
management consultant turned
chef restaurant owner.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:33.450
I come from your stereotypical
Asian household, so the first

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.690
thing that I would like to know
is, what did your parents

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.346
think when you quit your
management consultant job to

00:15:38.346 --> 00:15:40.260
become a pastry chef?

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.760
JOANNE CHANG: That's
a great question.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.860
When it happened, it wasn't
quite as black

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.630
and white as that.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.970
I didn't say, I'm quitting and
dropping everything and going

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:51.510
to do this.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.850
I was at the end of my second
year as a management

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.060
consultant.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:58.140
And at that time, that's when
people either went on to

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.940
business school, or some people
were staying within the

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:02.605
company, and they were going to
just kind of keep going up

00:16:02.605 --> 00:16:04.530
and up within in company.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:05.660
And I didn't want
either of those.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.635
I didn't want to stay, and I
definitely didn't want to go

00:16:07.635 --> 00:16:09.270
to business school So I was kind
of stuck, and I didn't

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.990
know what to do next.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:14.520
And I'd always loved to cook and
to bake, and so I thought,

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:14.740
you know what?

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.040
I'll take a year off, and I'll
try cooking professionally and

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.770
see if I can support myself
for at least a year.

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.160
And then I'll figure out
what I want to do.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.540
So that's kind of how I
sold it to my parents.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.320
I didn't have this plan
that it was going

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.520
to be a career change.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.450
It was just taking care
a year off to do

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.630
something that I enjoyed.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.280
I think that for them was a
little bit easier to swallow

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.710
than if I had said, I'm chucking
the whole thing, and

00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.000
I'm going to go become a chef.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.170
They were cautiously
supportive.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.090
I think they were definitely
very nervous.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:45.920
I was 24.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.770
And if you're 24, you think
you know everything.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.690
But if you're 50, like my
parents were, you think that

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:53.900
the 24-year-old knows nothing.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:55.510
And so they were just really,
really nervous.

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:56.810
How are you going to
support yourself?

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:58.960
You're leaving this
really stable job.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.070
It's got a lot of benefits.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.370
You're not going to have
health insurance.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:01.990
What are you going to do?

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:04.540
So I think they were more
concerned about logistically

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:07.250
how was I going to
survive for year.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.930
And then when it became clear
that it was more than just a

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.230
passing fancy, at that
point I think they

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.014
saw how happy I was.

00:17:15.014 --> 00:17:19.910
And I was able to make it
work financially, so

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:21.550
they were more accepting.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:24.420
Then as I got pastry chef jobs,
it seemed even a little

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.030
bit more legitimate
in their eyes.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.190
And then when we opened the
bakery, then it was a real

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.590
thing, and so they
were OK with it.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:30.400
And now they love it.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.480
Now they come all the
time, and they

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.990
go to all the bakeries.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:38.330
In fact, they will always do
Kayak or whatever to find out

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.750
what hotel they should
stay in.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.940
And they'll send me an email and
say, OK, this hotel, how

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.365
far is it away from
the bakeries?

00:17:44.365 --> 00:17:46.975
And I'm always like, mom, what
about how far is it from me,

00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:48.870
the one you're coming
to visit?

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.360
They will come for a week, and
I might see them three times,

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.820
but all the staff will see
them dozens of times.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:56.590
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Do you
have any siblings?

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:56.980
JOANNE CHANG: I do.

00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:02.090
I have a younger brother, who
went to MIT and studied--

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:03.030
mechanical engineering?

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:03.750
Some sort of engineering.

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:04.110
Chemical?

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:04.890
No--

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:06.740
engineering of some sort.

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:11.080
He's brilliant, and he worked
for years for Harrah's out in

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.640
Las Vegas doing some of their
something, something

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.340
computer-related.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.570
And then he just recently took a
job with Darden Corporation,

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:23.130
which owns Olive Garden, Red
Lobster, Capital Grille.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.020
So he's technically in the food
business now, but he's

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:27.110
still on the computer end.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.220
He's assistant to the
CFO, or something.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:30.892
I don't really know.

00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:31.650
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Sounds
really smart.

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.650
JOANNE CHANG: He's very smart.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:32.990
And he just--

00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.330
SANDRA LEUNG LI: I was
going to say--

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:33.860
JOANNE CHANG: --got
his first patent.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.650
I was very proud.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.740
SANDRA LEUNG LI: --if you have
siblings, maybe you could

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.760
deflect some of the attention in
those early stages when you

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.120
were trying to switch over, if
your younger brother was doing

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:43.984
something else.

00:18:43.984 --> 00:18:44.848
JOANNE CHANG: Oh, no.

00:18:44.848 --> 00:18:48.870
Because at that point, he was
here at MIT getting his

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.430
mechanical engineering
degree, I think.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.340
They were very proud of him,
as they should have been.

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:57.060
SANDRA LEUNG LI: You opened
Flour back in 2000.

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.500
What were your greatest
challenges

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.570
in those early days?

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.380
JOANNE CHANG: Oh, man.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.330
Something that I think I forget
about-- and I don't

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.270
know if it's just one of those
survival things that do-- is

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.990
the entire first year of opening
the bakery, I wanted

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.280
to close it.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.780
In fact, I have a diary that I
kept at the time, and there's

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.530
an entry about the 10th month
where I said, can't wait to

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:22.930
sell this place.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.300
Mom says I should keep
it at least a year.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.150
At that point, I'd told my mom
this isn't really working out.

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:30.550
I don't really think this
was a good idea.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:33.140
And my mom was just like, just
keep it for a year, just to

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.600
save face, to say that you at
least did it for a year.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.000
And then you can sell it.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.940
And the biggest challenges, for
me, were that I have this

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.480
vision of what I wanted
the bakery to be.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:46.700
I had recipes.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.500
I had, in my head, all these
wonderful scenarios of

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.620
customers coming in and getting

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.050
great, friendly service.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:56.570
And the milk pitcher was
full, so you could put

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.670
milk in your coffee.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.950
Then you get your beautifully
packaged pastry, and go home

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:00.850
and enjoy it.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:04.250
You think about that when you're
planning a bakery.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.660
Then the reality is the customer
comes in, and the

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.820
staff member is busy talking to
their co-staff member, and

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.770
the milk picture isn't full, and
they pack all the pastries

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:14.750
smushed in a bag.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.060
And you get the email from the
customer saying, I ordered all

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.110
these pastries, I spent this
much money, and here's the

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.006
picture of how my pastries
looked when I got home.

00:20:23.006 --> 00:20:28.740
I really struggled with taking
the vision that I had and then

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.190
trying to disseminate that
amongst the staff and trying

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:36.930
to impart upon them the goal
that I was trying to do with

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.510
Flour and the missions that
we were trying to do.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.500
That was the hardest part for
that whole first year is that

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.700
I was only one person.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:50.020
And I had a hard time and a
really steep learning curve on

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:51.975
learning how to delegate,
learning how to manage.

00:20:51.975 --> 00:20:55.140
I'd been a manager at the
various pastry chef jobs I'd

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.500
had, but that was
very different.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.550
And all of a sudden, at the
time, it was 12 employees, all

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:01.900
of whom were great people--

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.360
I still keep in touch with many
of them-- but just had a

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.170
different idea of what
Flour should be on

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.970
a day-to-day basis.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:13.810
And so that constant struggle
of walking in and seeing the

00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:17.230
place be so different from what
I had intended and what I

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:22.120
had worked so hard to create,
and then going home and coming

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.050
back and having the same
thing happen every day.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:26.430
I kept trying to
right the ship.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.520
And I would go away for 15
minutes, and the ship would go

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.340
off that way.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.080
Then I'd come back and right it,
and it would go off again.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.980
And on top of that, in the whole
first year, I didn't

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.920
take a day off until
about 10 months in.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.850
And then I was doing
all of the baking.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.240
So that was coming in at 3:00
in the morning and doing the

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:48.060
bake off and then staying
there all day long.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.810
Also, again because I was a
small business, I was doing

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:54.620
all of the accounting, all of
the payroll, all of that back

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:55.370
office stuff.

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:57.780
So that was happening late at
night, and then I'd go to bed

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.540
and wake up again and
do the whole thing

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:00.420
over starting at 3:00.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.850
So a couple months in, or
however long, you just start

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.290
to get really exhausted.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:07.240
And when the milk pitcher isn't
filled, it just seems

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.430
like, OK, this isn't worth it.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:10.940
I should sell the place.

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:14.030
SANDRA LEUNG LI: When did it
start to turn and pick up?

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.420
JOANNE CHANG: Definitely between
that 10th month and

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.126
that first year where I
had vowed to sell it.

00:22:20.126 --> 00:22:25.140
The key where it started to turn
was I finally had staff

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.730
that I trusted.

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.830
Not that previously
I didn't trust.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:29.730
They were all very
trustworthy.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:35.140
But I finally had staff that
could do what I did in the way

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.820
that I wanted them.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.610
For me, the big thing
was opening.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.470
It is being the first person to
turn on the ovens, to take

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.200
all the pastries that are ready
to go, to put them in

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:48.840
the ovens, mix the batters and
get everything ready so that

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:51.840
by 7:00 AM you can have the
pastry display ready for

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.710
guests when they come in.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.060
Around the 10th month,
I trained somebody

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:57.870
who's still with me.

00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:59.190
She's my executive
pastry chef.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:00.800
She's been made partner.

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.470
And Nicole learned
how to open, and

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:04.950
that gave me a breather.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:08.090
It gave me one day that I could
actually sleep in till

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:09.810
probably 5:00 in the morning.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.750
It was just something that
gave me a little bit of

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:13.360
perspective.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.240
It's just so hard when you're
just doing it day in, day, in,

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.310
day in, day out.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:20.290
And so having that person who
could share a little bit of

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:23.370
the responsibility was key.

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:27.830
And then from that came a front
of the house manager.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.210
When we opened, we had a front
of the house manager, but he

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:31.910
didn't end up working out.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.490
So then we didn't have
one for a long time.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.950
And by about in the end of the
first year, we hired somebody

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:39.040
who is really terrific, so then
she could do all of the

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.140
hiring and training of
the counter staff.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.390
The key was just getting a team
around me that understood

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:47.570
what we were trying to do.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:50.000
And once I felt that they
understood, then the mistakes

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.520
became, not irrelevant, but they
didn't bother me as much.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.760
It's like, OK, we all make
mistakes, right?

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.100
So they would make a mistake,
and it's like, that's OK,

00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.120
because I knew they wanted
to do the right thing.

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.490
It was in the beginning when
nobody knew what I was trying

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:06.360
to do that when mistakes were
made they didn't understand,

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.810
which was this constant
struggle.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:12.730
SANDRA LEUNG LI: I think a lot
of folks in this room have

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.250
similar entrepreneurial spirit
and may strive to launch their

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:17.900
own business some day.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.660
What advice would you give
to budding entrepreneurs?

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.890
JOANNE CHANG: For me, definitely
it's about creating

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.050
and developing a team of people
that surround you and

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.490
who believe in what you do.

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:32.880
I remember in that first year
just thinking, man, did I do

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:33.420
this wrong.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.880
I should have gotten a little
kiosk that was just manned by

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.810
me with a little commissary
kitchen, where I would be the

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.570
only one baking and then the
only one selling and then the

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:44.560
only one washing dishes.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.760
Because I was feeling like
I'm the only one

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.710
who can do this right.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.930
So for people who want to start
their own businesses,

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.710
unless you're one-man
show, you need to

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.200
rely on other people.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.850
And so the biggest advice that I
tell anybody, usually people

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.590
come up to me and they say,
I want to open a bakery.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:01.190
What do I do?

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:06.310
And it is creating those
relationships around you and

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.400
developing people around you
who understand what you're

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.770
trying to do and who believe in
it and who can help you get

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.750
to where you're trying to go,
because you really can't do

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:15.700
anything by yourself.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.840
When I was planning for the
bakery, I was in New York City

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.570
working at Payard, and at the
end of my stint at Payard, I

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:25.070
spent about three or four weeks
with Amy Scherber of

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.260
Amy's Breads.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.710
She was very generous and said,
yep, you can come and

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.380
hang out with us for a month
and learn what you want to

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.210
learn about brand.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.260
And I asked her, in exchange
for my working for a month,

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:37.310
can I pick your brain
for an hour or so?

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.510
So at the end of my month
there, I asked

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.270
her the same question.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:42.440
I'm like, I want to go
open my business.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.310
What do I need to know?

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.070
And she said, human resources.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.080
You need to find people.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.020
You need to find people.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:50.010
You need to find people.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.490
So I had ended my internship.

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:53.127
My mom came to New York
to pick me up.

00:25:53.127 --> 00:25:55.280
I had two days in New
York with my mom.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.640
And the very next day, after my
goodbye interview with Amy,

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.090
she called me the next morning
and said, is there any way you

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.540
can do the whatever, whatever
shift, because so-and-so just

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:05.020
walked out.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:07.770
And I couldn't, because my mom
was there with me, and we were

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:08.570
getting ready to leave.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.920
But it just really hammered home
that, man, without people

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.630
you can't do that much.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:14.950
You can have a great idea.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:16.700
You can personally
be a great baker.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.030
You can be a great salesman.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.330
But unless you're willing to do
every single thing on your

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.110
own, you're not going
to succeed.

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.565
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Yeah.

00:26:23.565 --> 00:26:25.400
Great advice.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.160
So here at Google, we are always
trying to innovate and

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.340
stay ahead of the curve.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.250
As a chef, how do
you innovate?

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:33.840
JOANNE CHANG: That's
a great question.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:39.930
Because we have challenges in
that area, in that, for us,

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:41.800
people who come to
the bakery--

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.740
I think at a certain point you
have to just decide what is

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.660
your audience and what are you
trying to do and to be true to

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:49.350
what you want to do.

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:50.910
So we try to innovate.

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.520
We try to add new sandwiches.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.870
We try to change things up.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:58.200
We are physically limited by
what we can produce to a set

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.610
number, a rough number of
things, so we can't just

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:02.910
constantly add things.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.490
If we add something, we have
to take something away.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:08.440
And what we have found over
the years, especially as

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:11.230
Flour's gotten bigger and
people associate us with

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.190
certain things, it's really
difficult for us to innovate

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.130
without pissing off
a lot of people.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.970
We tried last summer to change
the turkey sandwich.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:20.910
I don't know if any of you
guys are turkey sandwich

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.540
aficionados, but my gosh, you
would've thought I stole

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.430
people's first child.

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:28.180
I got so many emails like,
what did you do?

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:29.270
Why did you do this?

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.520
What is wrong?

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:36.340
For every person who was upset,
we probably get 10

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.620
"what's wrong with you?" to
1 "we really like the new

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.630
sandwich." So we stuck it out
for, I think, six or eight

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:44.330
months, and then I was
continuing to get the emails.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.210
And finally, we just said, OK,
let's just switch back.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:50.220
So it's hard for us to try to
come up with new products.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.660
But in terms of innovating in
terms of how we run our

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:55.680
business, we are constantly
trying to think of ways.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.450
You guys are an inspiration,
what you guys do within the

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:03.210
company to try to create good
working environments and to

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.360
foster creativity.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.570
I read all the articles about
Google, and I think, oh, what

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:11.650
can we do from that to help
inspire the staff

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.090
who work for me?

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.810
We have a very different
group of employees.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.000
A lot of them, it's their
part-time job

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.060
because they're in school.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:23.400
Or they've taken a year off
from something, and then

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.060
they're moving on.

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.850
So there's definitely a
different environment, but

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:31.310
there's still the same capacity
to inspire people to

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.990
take that moment that they're
working for us at Flour and be

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.760
the best Flour person
they can.

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:39.910
So for us, we try to innovate in
terms of how do we energize

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:43.230
them and get them excited and
make them understand that even

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:45.250
though this is only your
part-time job and you're only

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:47.850
here for three months, it's
still really important for us

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.830
that you view this as if this
is your life goal, to be the

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:53.440
best counter person
or baker you can.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.720
We brainstorm a lot, and we just
think about what we can

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.380
do, what we can offer to the
staff to give them that

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.846
environment.

00:29:04.846 --> 00:29:06.800
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Very cool.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.870
How did you decide on the
name Flour Bakery?

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.240
JOANNE CHANG: Flour came
from my husband.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.910
I was in New York,
and I called him.

00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:15.940
We weren't dating at the time.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:16.460
He was just a friend.

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.410
And I called him, and I
said, I'm thinking of

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:19.570
coming back to Boston.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:20.965
I want to open my own bakery.

00:29:20.965 --> 00:29:22.370
Do you have any ideas?

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.710
And he came up with a list of
names, none of which I can

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:27.760
really remember.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:31.980
Flour was one of them, and
I remember thinking, that

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:32.680
doesn't work.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.660
There's a list of them, and I
thought, that doesn't work,

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.850
that doesn't work, that
doesn't work.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:38.640
None of them worked,
basically.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.310
And then I think a week or so
later, I was just looking at

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:43.270
the list again, and I
was playing around

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:44.080
with the word Flour.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.280
It just seemed weird.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:46.720
Why would you name
a bakery Flour?

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.700
It just sounded so plain
and uninspired.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:51.860
And then it kind
of grew on me.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.130
And then I thought, it's like
anybody's first name.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.440
If you have an unusual first
name, it sounds weird to

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.740
people until they
get to know you.

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.510
And after the fifth time, it
just becomes your name.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.790
So for me, Flour was the same.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:06.552
Flour sounded weird, and then
after thinking about it, I

00:30:06.552 --> 00:30:07.780
thought, OK, this could work.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.230
And now it just seems like a
no-brainer, and I'm very

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.025
grateful for him for
coming up with it.

00:30:13.025 --> 00:30:14.710
SANDRA LEUNG LI: It sounds like
he inceptioned you or

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:17.846
hypnotized you in some way.

00:30:17.846 --> 00:30:20.000
JOANNE CHANG: That might
have happened.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.160
SANDRA LEUNG LI: You mentioned
in the early days you were

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.540
waking up at 3:00 AM.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.900
What is a typical day
like for you today?

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.150
JOANNE CHANG: Totally
different.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:34.840
If it weren't for the book,
typically I try to go to two

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.190
Flour locations a day,
morning at one,

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.390
afternoon at the other.

00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.650
And then three or four times
a week, I try to go to the

00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:44.550
restaurant in the evening.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:49.180
What I'm doing now is a little
bit of what I was talking

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:49.730
about earlier.

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:53.520
The innovation with the staff,
which for me really is getting

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.840
to know the staff, and so I come
in and I taste products

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.655
and I talk to everybody.

00:30:57.655 --> 00:30:59.810
And I just try to
get a sense of--

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:00.920
They're in the middle
of their day.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.720
They're either serving coffee,
or they're baking off cookies,

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.730
or they're making soup
or something.

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.510
So I try not to interrupt their
day, but I do try to

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:10.470
find good times within the
morning that I'm there to

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:14.330
stand next to certain staff
people and just talk to them

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:17.330
and find out what they're doing
and how's this working

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.880
and, hey, we just got this
new piece of equipment.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.870
What do you think?

00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:21.210
Or in the front of the house,
wow, we just got

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.070
this new iced tea.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.390
How's it selling?

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:26.250
So I spend a fair amount of time
just trying to actually

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:27.550
just connect with the staff.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:30.710
Because we have so many people,
and I feel like if I

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:34.010
don't stay connected with them
not that I'll forget what

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:36.970
Flour's all about but I will
forget that connection of the

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:38.350
staff to the customer.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:41.930
So it's really important for
me to stay close to them.

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:47.020
And then I spend a lot of time
in the office doing either

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:47.970
managerial stuff.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.350
We have a lot of manager
meetings.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:51.745
Each location has its own
manager meeting that I attend.

00:31:51.745 --> 00:31:53.860
And then I have a manager
meeting with my director of

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.060
operations, and with my
executive pastry chef, and

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:56.990
with my human resource
director.

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.980
So there's a lot of meetings.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.850
And then from the meetings, I
spend a lot of time in front

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:02.850
of the computer summarizing
the meetings and doing

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:04.410
followups to the meetings.

00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:06.540
So it's just a lot
of office work.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.020
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Sounds
a lot like Google.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:08.600
You could be here.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.850
JOANNE CHANG: Oh, really?

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.420
SANDRA LEUNG LI: From the sound
of it, it seems like you

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.655
probably don't get a chance
to cook at home very much.

00:32:15.655 --> 00:32:16.260
JOANNE CHANG: I don't.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:17.260
I miss that a lot.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:17.760
In fact--

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.560
Where was I?

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.130
Oh, I was just driving down, I
don't know the name of the

00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.280
street, but in downtown where
there's a grocery store where

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.380
used to go all the time.

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.635
And I was just driving down
there last week, and I

00:32:26.635 --> 00:32:28.880
thought, man, I haven't been to
that grocery store in-- and

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.920
then I start counting, and I
said-- six years since we

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.180
opened Myers and Chang.

00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:35.030
There's really no reason
for me to cook.

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:37.970
I enjoy it, but it's so easy
just to go to the restaurant

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:39.670
to get take out and
bring it home.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.815
So we do a lot of that.

00:32:41.815 --> 00:32:44.220
SANDRA LEUNG LI: And so you must
be an expert, obviously,

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:46.030
on all the dishes at
Myers and Chang--

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:46.530
JOANNE CHANG: Oh, yeah.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:47.150
SANDRA LEUNG LI: --with
the take out.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.780
What do you usually take out?

00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:50.320
JOANNE CHANG: Let's see.

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.650
We get the salmon.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.380
It's a pan-roasted,
soy-glazed salmon.

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:57.930
It's very, very simple.

00:32:57.930 --> 00:32:59.760
It's definitely not the dish
that I recommend when I'm

00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:02.260
trying to show off about what
Myers and Chang is all about,

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.740
but it's my favorite dish.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.670
It's really simple
and delicious.

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.850
We get the lamb belly.

00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:10.370
It's a lamb belly stir-fry with
slippery glass noodles

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:14.270
and leeks and sesame seeds.

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:18.880
The spicy salmon and apple
tartare with sesame crisps is

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.140
one of my favorites.

00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:21.350
We always get a vegetable.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:22.320
Yeah.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.510
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Sounds good.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:26.840
I want to leave a little time
for audience questions, but

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.220
just a few last fun questions
before we finish up.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.830
What would be your last meal?

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.145
JOANNE CHANG: My last
meal, I would have--

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.233
I love--

00:33:41.233 --> 00:33:42.120
Wow.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:42.920
OK.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:45.270
I would do lots of things.

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:45.820
SANDRA LEUNG LI: That's
cheating.

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:46.430
JOANNE CHANG: Oh, really?

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:47.764
Is that really cheating?

00:33:47.764 --> 00:33:48.690
It's your last meal--

00:33:48.690 --> 00:33:48.850
SANDRA LEUNG LI: OK.

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:48.970
Go for it.

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:49.970
JOANNE CHANG: --so you
could eat everything.

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.790
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Go
big or go home.

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.950
JOANNE CHANG: Yeah, I can't
think of a composed last meal.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:59.170
I would probably go to Oishii
and have omakase.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.130
And then I would save a little
room, and I would go to Picco

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.320
and have a pizza.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.920
And then I would go to the
7-Eleven and buy Haagen-Dazs

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.834
coffee ice cream and eat
the whole thing.

00:34:12.834 --> 00:34:16.310
SANDRA LEUNG LI: That
is a healthy meal.

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:19.750
What is on your music
playlist?

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:20.500
JOANNE CHANG: This is sad.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.980
I don't listen to music.

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.100
In fact, last night driving out
to Wellesley, I thought, I

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.040
should turn on the radio just
to see, what are people

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.590
listening to these days?

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:30.739
I don't even know what
playlist means.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:31.570
I don't listen at all.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:36.880
I used to listen to a hip hop
station, pop station, KISS

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.810
108, because I used to
run to headphones.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.340
And then my headphones got
stolen three years ago, and I

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:44.030
just stopped listening.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:47.510
When I'm listening, if I were to
ever listen, I actually, at

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:49.940
this point now, I feel like I've
gotten old, but I really

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:51.020
do like classical music.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.699
Because my dad loves classical,
so there's a lot of

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:56.670
fond memories when I listen
to certain things.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:59.710
I have a couple CDs that
I'll stick in the

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:01.135
thing, whatever it is.

00:35:01.135 --> 00:35:02.800
But I'm not really
a music person.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:03.920
SANDRA LEUNG LI: It sounds
like we need to work on

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.170
getting you headphones.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.320
What do you do for fun?

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.230
JOANNE CHANG: I love going
out to eat with

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.010
Christopher and friends.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:16.995
That's definitely something that
I enjoy a lot and look

00:35:16.995 --> 00:35:19.290
forward to when we can
schedule it in.

00:35:19.290 --> 00:35:21.400
I still run and exercise
every day, which

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.460
might sound not fun.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.530
But for me, it's very fun.

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:26.645
I love to read.

00:35:26.645 --> 00:35:28.510
I don't have enough time
to just sit and relax.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:32.180
So my ideal is on Sunday
mornings to wake up and have

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.170
breakfast with Christopher and
then just read the paper

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:38.890
slowly over the course
of the day.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:39.390
Yeah.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:41.240
Those are the three things
that I like to do.

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.542
I like to shop, but I don't
spend a lot of time shopping.

00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:45.820
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Oh.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:49.670
And the last question, I noticed
the Flour motto to

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:50.800
"Make Life Sweeter.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:54.920
Eat Dessert First." So do you
really eat dessert first?

00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.615
JOANNE CHANG: Well, I'm
kind of eating a

00:35:56.615 --> 00:35:57.470
dessert all day long.

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.040
So by the time I get to dinner,
I actually feel like I

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.410
need to eat some food.

00:36:02.410 --> 00:36:04.760
I'm very conscious of the fact
that I don't eat real food

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:07.030
usually until dinner time.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:12.320
But on days that I'm not at
the bakery, I think it's

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:14.960
important to eat dessert
first, because you

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.690
might not have room.

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.670
I've had plenty of dinners where
I've run out of room by

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.340
the end of the dinner.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:21.620
So if I can, I try
to sneak it in.

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:22.250
It's a little odd.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:23.230
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Love
that strategy.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.985
JOANNE CHANG: Sometimes
the servers are

00:36:23.985 --> 00:36:25.450
like, are you sure?

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.460
But we've seen customers at
Myers and Chang do that.

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:33.130
They'll order the nasi goreng
and the arctic char roll and

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:34.040
coconut cream pie.

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.400
And I'm always like,
are you sure?

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:39.560
And they're like, yeah, we want
to eat dessert as well.

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:39.784
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Cool.

00:36:39.784 --> 00:36:41.660
Now I want to open it up
to audience question.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.640
So if anybody has any questions,
you guys can line

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:46.210
up here so we can get
you on the mic.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:47.473
Don't be shy.

00:36:47.473 --> 00:36:48.922
AUDIENCE: I'll come up.

00:36:48.922 --> 00:36:49.890
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Yeah.

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:51.250
AUDIENCE: Do I really
have to go?

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.580
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Yes, you do.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:54.980
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.230
All right.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:01.490
Just curious, so now you're in
four locations around Boston.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:03.720
How connected are you to the
communities and the other

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.190
restaurant owners and
bakery owners?

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:10.340
Do you guys help each other
out and stay in touch?

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:13.230
JOANNE CHANG: The restaurant and
bakery community in Boston

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.870
and Cambridge is extremely
tight-knit.

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.280
Everybody knows everybody.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.790
Everybody sees everybody at
events and goes to everybody's

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:21.110
restaurants.

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:22.670
So yes, we're very connected.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:23.850
I feel very connected.

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.710
In fact, we're looking for
a sous-chef position

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:27.610
at Myers and Chang.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.490
And I just this morning sent an
email out to all of my chef

00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:32.750
friends just saying, if you know
of anybody, or if there's

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:35.370
anybody on your team that is
ready to move on and you don't

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.390
need them, send them our way.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:38.850
So we all feel very connected.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:43.260
I will reach out to Maura at
Sofra on a periodic basis, or

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.820
vice versa, if she needs
something or if I need

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.160
something, her advice.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:52.540
The woman who runs Tatte Bakery,
her pastry chef used

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:54.900
to work for me as my pastry
chef, and so Kristin and I

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:56.480
stay in touch.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.970
And then, all the chefs, they
just all know each other.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.390
We work really well together.

00:38:04.156 --> 00:38:06.300
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering,
I like to test

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.880
around the kitchen as well
quite a bit, but I never

00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.110
actually remember the recipes.

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:12.680
So I didn't know, when you go
into testing a new recipe, do

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.860
you take down the
measurements?

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.248
Or what's your process
for doing that so you

00:38:16.248 --> 00:38:17.215
can remember it again?

00:38:17.215 --> 00:38:19.260
JOANNE CHANG: I definitely
write it down first.

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.800
One of the things I tell people
what I'm doing a demo,

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:25.590
for example, is you know when
you're watching on Food TV,

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.510
and they have all the little
cups with everything all

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:28.810
measured out, and they
go, boom, boom,

00:38:28.810 --> 00:38:29.880
boom and it's done?

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.800
That's actually how I bake.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.650
If I'm testing a recipe-- like
right now I'm in the middle of

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.720
this low-sugar thing--

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:40.010
I write down a recipe that in
my head I think will work.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.980
And then I go and I measure
everything out, and then I

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.800
have my piece of paper with
a pen next to me.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.270
And as I'm baking, if I
see an adjustment--

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.290
I'll add a cup of milk and
realize ooh, it needs more

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:52.290
liquid-- then I'll add it and
I'll measure another quarter,

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:54.060
and then I'll change
the recipe.

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:59.400
For me, it's not like cooking.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.770
If I'm just cooking at home,
I wouldn't think

00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:01.430
so much about it.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.670
But because I need to replicate
it, I have to be

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:08.420
really careful about taking
really detailed notes.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.100
It can be a little bit less fun,
because you're trying to

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.830
just make something delicious,
and then, aw, shoot, I got to

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.170
remember to write this down.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.170
But I've gotten used to it over
testing these two books

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.140
these past couple years.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:21.680
So it's definitely the best
way in order to be able to

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.930
replicate it going forward.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.520
AUDIENCE: You have a few
successful businesses that

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.150
you've started.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.700
You've written a couple
of books.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.610
At this point, you said you
make it into some of your

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:39.993
businesses some of the time,
depending on what you can fit

00:39:39.993 --> 00:39:41.190
in the schedule.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.490
So they're obviously sustaining
themselves in ways

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.180
that was not possible
at the beginning.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.235
How self-sustaining are
your businesses?

00:39:48.235 --> 00:39:51.620
And what's next for you, given
that you've been able to free

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.760
up some of the time
in your schedule?

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.430
JOANNE CHANG: Sure.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:57.260
The businesses, at this point,
if I were to just drop off the

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:01.360
face of the Earth, there's a
couple things that I do that

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:04.850
I'm still the only
one who does.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:06.180
But it wouldn't be hard
to teach somebody.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.060
So for example payroll, which
happens every other week, I

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:09.910
have an HR person.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:11.960
She runs payroll.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.580
She talks to all the managers to
make sure everybody's time

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.230
clocks are correct.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:18.840
But I physically enter it into
our accounting system, because

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.950
I want to see how much we're
paying everybody.

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:23.260
That's easy enough.

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:26.430
If I were to move to Tahiti, I
could just teach her how to do

00:40:26.430 --> 00:40:29.840
that part, and she
could do it.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.590
Honestly, I think that's
the only thing

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.590
that I do that I have--

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.550
And I field a lot
of the email.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:43.460
We get a lot of emails, either
complaints or requests for

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:47.150
information or charity
requests.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:51.580
And I tend to answer most of
them, especially the complaint

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.100
ones, just because they are
important to me, and I want to

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.610
stay on top of them all.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:00.200
But that, again, I could also
easily give that to my

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.770
director of operations,
who would gladly do

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:03.680
all of that for me.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.620
I think what would be missing,
and it's one of the reasons

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.370
why I don't want to not be at
the bakeries as much as I can,

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:12.810
is the connection that I have
with the staff, trying to make

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:15.210
them understand the
story of Flour.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:20.610
And we're at this point where
some people call us a chain.

00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:24.370
And I don't want it ever
to feel like that.

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:25.720
We were talking earlier
about how Google's

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.610
gotten really big.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:29.750
And I'm sure that whoever the
big people are wish it were

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:30.400
still small.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.230
And so trying to maintain that
small company atmosphere, even

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:38.020
though it's gotten bigger, is
something that I think I'm

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:40.230
uniquely positioned to
do, simply because I

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.300
don't have a job title.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.830
My executive pastry chef, she's
in charge of pastry, so

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.510
she spends all her time actually
working on pastries.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:49.520
And the HR person,
she does HR.

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:50.880
But for me, I'm just owner.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.180
So what do I do?

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.590
I try to make sure that the
place that they are working at

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.310
is what I intended it to be.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:01.580
Because I think it's very easy,
without guidance, for it

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.980
to, like I was saying earlier,
just veer off, and not

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.410
necessarily in a bad way, but
just in a way that's not what

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:09.630
I intended.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:12.660
And so it's not that my way is
the right way, but I think

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:14.895
there's something to be said
for running a business that

00:42:14.895 --> 00:42:16.520
has a clear vision.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:19.970
And if there's not one person or
one group of people that's

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:23.270
kind of setting the vision on a
daily basis and having that

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:25.750
be their focus, I think it's
easy for companies

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:28.802
to lose their way.

00:42:28.802 --> 00:42:30.660
I don't know if that really
answers your question.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:35.260
It's not like a specific job
thing that I do conscious--

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:38.290
I do it consciously, but there's
not a list of things I

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:38.960
do to do that.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.080
It's just kind of how I
try to stay connected

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.440
to the various bakeries.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.150
AUDIENCE: And what's next?

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.115
JOANNE CHANG: Oh,
and what's next?

00:42:46.115 --> 00:42:50.635
Writing the third book, and then
after that the "Myers and

00:42:50.635 --> 00:42:51.635
Chang" book, definitely.

00:42:51.635 --> 00:42:52.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:53.330
JOANNE CHANG: No.

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:57.290
This time I made Bill, my
publisher, commit to this.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.800
I said, OK, so I'll do
this one, and then--

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.170
He actually had a good point.

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:04.045
He said that with the timing of
it, if I do the "Myers and

00:43:04.045 --> 00:43:05.970
Chang" book, it will come out
at Myers and Chang's 10th

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:09.310
anniversary, which seems to make
sense and works and feels

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:11.380
good and all that.

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.790
And after that, I honestly
don't know.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:18.820
Even though I'm talking about
how you have to have a clear

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.190
vision, I haven't had a
clear path about what

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:22.590
I want to do next.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:27.530
I don't want to open more
bakeries, but I feel like I

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:28.910
have to be careful
when I say that.

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.670
Because I'm pretty sure when I
came here last time, when we

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:34.660
only had the three bakeries, I
probably said the same thing.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.250
And yet, we opened a fourth.

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:39.110
But what's stopping us this time
from opening a fifth is

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.660
that physically we are limited
with how we're doing our

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:42.230
production.

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:44.560
If we were to open a fifth,
we would have to build a

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:47.180
commissary kitchen, which
we don't have now.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.180
And so, for me, if we were to go
that route, that's a huge,

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.040
big next step.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.240
That just changes the
business model.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.790
Because right now, I can still,
in my head, convince

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.760
myself that I just have
four little bakeries.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.010
But once you go commissary, then
you become commissary.

00:44:04.896 --> 00:44:07.782
You're welcome.

00:44:07.782 --> 00:44:11.149
AUDIENCE: Very interesting
connection with [INAUDIBLE]--

00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:13.710
excuse me-- is how do you
define yourself--

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:15.260
I didn't come for the beginning,
so I might have

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:17.730
missed something you said--

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.810
compared to the other bakeries
in the area?

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:21.510
Iggy's obviously has a different
business model.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.923
JOANNE CHANG: Sure.

00:44:21.923 --> 00:44:25.125
AUDIENCE: But the product has
a lot of similarities.

00:44:25.125 --> 00:44:29.837
Hi-Rise seems to be focused on
high price, which applies to

00:44:29.837 --> 00:44:32.505
all of you.

00:44:32.505 --> 00:44:33.710
How do you define yourself,
compared

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:36.810
to the other bakeries?

00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:42.390
JOANNE CHANG: One thing that
we try to do is we try to

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:45.870
spend a lot of time just staying
focused on what we do

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:49.490
and not spend a lot of time
looking at what the others do

00:44:49.490 --> 00:44:52.720
and how we relate
vis-a-vis them.

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:57.380
When I started Flour
13 years ago, it

00:44:57.380 --> 00:44:58.240
was a couple of things.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:02.170
It was, from a point of view,
making sure that that was

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:03.310
always a priority.

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:05.640
Which it sounds obvious,
you're opening a food

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.260
business, so of course food
should be obvious.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:12.630
But it's very easy for a food
business, after a certain

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.560
number of years, to just kind
of go on automatic.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:19.170
And so we spend a lot of time
really working on-- even

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.370
though the menu doesn't
change much--

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.980
constantly trying to tweak the
recipes and make them a little

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:25.440
bit better or figure out how
to do it a little bit

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:28.570
differently so that we're
interested but the customers

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:32.500
don't get upset that we've
changed something.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:35.760
Then, again, part of my mission
statement 13 years ago

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.980
was trying to create an
environment that, as a

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:42.120
customer when you walk
in, you feel like--

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.220
it's cheesy, but I always say
it's like "Cheers"-- it's a

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.200
home away from home.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.880
And that's what I want
Flour to be.

00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:49.480
I want Flour to be a place
where people in the

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.540
neighborhood come to the bakery
and feel like it's

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.320
their place.

00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.210
And in the South End,
for example--

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:57.730
that's the first one--

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:01.290
we have a ton of regulars
who we know on a

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:02.670
very personal level.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.760
And they come in, and
it is their bakery.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.300
They tell us what to change.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.535
They clean up for us.

00:46:07.535 --> 00:46:09.840
And it's become a really
nice community.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:12.710
Obviously, people flit in and
flit out, but, for me, that's

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:13.770
something that--

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:16.140
I don't even know if it sets us
apart, because I don't know

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.820
what the other bakeries
are trying to do.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.730
But I think all of the
bakeries around us--

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:22.810
I love Iggy's.

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:24.160
But to me, they're wholesale.

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.530
And I know they have the little

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:26.950
outpost I think on Fawcett--

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:27.920
AUDIENCE: Every Sunday.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.403
JOANNE CHANG: Oh, really?

00:46:28.403 --> 00:46:28.886
OK.

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:30.820
AUDIENCE: That's where
I go every Sunday.

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:31.210
JOANNE CHANG: Oh, OK.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:31.440
Yeah.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.120
I think they're great.

00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.270
But they're focusing on
wholesale, which is different.

00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:35.336
AUDIENCE: That's why I said
about the business model.

00:46:35.336 --> 00:46:35.470
Yeah.

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:41.080
JOANNE CHANG: I think the
closest to us, at this point--

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:45.176
Hi-Rise is very similar
to us, to what we do.

00:46:45.176 --> 00:46:48.400
But he doesn't do the
fancy cakes, and so

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.290
we have that focus.

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:52.530
And then, Tatte Bakery I feel
like recently has become

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.150
similar to what we do.

00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:57.045
Bread and Butter, which just
opened up in the North End, I

00:46:57.045 --> 00:46:59.300
haven't been yet, but I think
it's similar to what we do.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:05.130
I think there's enough people
out there to kind of be able

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:08.610
to have numerous bakeries and
just each place be a little

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.120
bit different, just based on
their own personalities.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.090
Again, I'm not trying to define
myself vis-a-vis them.

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:15.360
I just try to define myself
vis-a-vis what

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.755
I'm trying to do.

00:47:16.755 --> 00:47:19.910
And to the earlier question
about what would happen if I

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:23.500
were to move or stop being
involved every day, I feel

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.860
like that's what I'm always
doing is just trying to set

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:31.540
the tone of the place and the
spirit, so that when you walk

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:35.010
in it is clear that it's Flour
and not just one of the

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:37.270
various bakeries that
you can walk into.

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:38.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.850
SANDRA LEUNG LI: I think
we have time

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:40.100
for one more question.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:45.320
AUDIENCE: So from the new
cookbook, what one recipe

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.341
would you say, oh, you've
got to try this one?

00:47:48.341 --> 00:47:50.289
JOANNE CHANG: Uhh--

00:47:50.289 --> 00:47:51.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:53.000
AUDIENCE: All of them.

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:00.490
JOANNE CHANG: Well, the book
is divided into breakfast,

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:03.930
lunch, dinner, party, drinks.

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:07.050
Give me a category, and
then I'll tell you.

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.050
AUDIENCE: Party.

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:08.300
JOANNE CHANG: OK.

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.910
Party time, I would say--

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:12.100
OK.

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.350
This isn't my answer, but I'm
just going to throw it out

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:15.650
there, because we
have samples.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:19.870
The Spectacular Spice Pecans,
which don't look like much and

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.760
aren't like a sexy treat to
bring to an event like this,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.570
the reason why we brought them
is that we did a book launch

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:29.150
party with this a couple weeks
ago and had this open house

00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:33.370
with snacks from the book, and
the spiced pecans are the one

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:35.970
thing that everyone wrote about
and said to me, oh my

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:37.240
god, I love this.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.920
But if you were to make
one thing from

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:45.740
that, I would say either--

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.610
I know I'm hedging here-- either
the Pithivier or the

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:52.360
Croquembouche, simply because
I think they're both really

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:55.620
dramatic and really beautiful.

00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:56.890
They're both delicious.

00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:00.700
And I think they're the type of
dessert that if you want a

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.690
project and you want to do
something that's going to

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:06.400
impress, I think those two
would do the trick.

00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.280
They're both desserts that we
only offer at Christmastime,

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:14.130
and I spent a lot of time
working on the recipe to make

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:15.180
it accessible to people.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:16.430
So they are a little bit long.

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:20.240
But if you follow the recipe
step by step, you'll get this

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:22.670
glorious dessert that you can
present of friends, and it's

00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:24.745
pretty impressive.

00:49:24.745 --> 00:49:25.220
You're welcome.

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.380
SANDRA LEUNG LI: Thank
you very much,

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.580
Joanne, for coming today.

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.180
JOANNE CHANG: Thank
you so much.

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:31.317
[APPLAUSE]
