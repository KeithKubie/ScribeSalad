00:00:23.894 --> 00:00:27.320
PROFESSOR: Today I'm starting a
new topic and that's always

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.980
the occasion for putting things
into perspective.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.700
Keep in mind what we were trying
to do in the subject.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.480
We were trying to introduce
several intellectual themes.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.560
The first, and absolutely the
most important, is how do you

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.210
design a complex system?

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.350
We think that's very important
because there's absolutely no

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.960
way this department could exist
the way it does, making

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.730
things like that, hooking up
internets and so forth.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.700
Those are truly complex
systems.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.780
And if you didn't have an
organized way of thinking

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.030
about complexity, they're
hopeless.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.140
So the kinds of things we're
interested to teach you about

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.330
are just hopeless if you can't
get a handle on complexity.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.390
So that's by far the most
important thing that we've

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.210
been thinking about.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.880
We've been interested in
modeling, and controlling

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.140
physical systems.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.110
I hope you remember the way we
chased the robot around the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.980
lab, and that was
the point there.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.570
We've thought about augmenting
physical systems by adding

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.570
computation, I hope you've
got a feel for that.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.810
And we're going to start today
thinking about how do you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.720
build systems that are robust.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.130
So just in review, so far--

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.800
you've already seen
most of this--

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.340
so far we've taught you about
abstraction, hierarchy, and

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.300
controlling complexity starting
primarily by thinking

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.480
about software engineering.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.730
Because that's such a good
pedagogical place to start.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.230
We introduced the idea of PCAP,
and that has continued

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.180
throughout the rest of the
subject, then we worried about

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.930
how do you control things.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.770
We developed ways of modeling so
that you could predict the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.350
outcome before you actually
built the system.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.310
That's crucial.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.710
You can't afford to build
prototypes for everything,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.520
it's just not economical.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.949
And so this was an exercise in
making models, figuring out

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.490
how behaviors relate to the
models, and trying to get the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.240
design done in the modeling
stage rather than in the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.800
prototyping stage, and
you built circuits.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.920
This had to do with how you
augment a system with new

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.240
capabilities, either hardware
or software.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.370
Today what I want to start to
think about is, how do you

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.370
with uncertainty?

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.470
And how do you deal with things
that are much more

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.370
complicated to plan?

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.170
So the things that we will do
in this segment are things

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.360
like mapping.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.820
What if we gave you a maze--

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.280
you, the robot.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.270
What if we gave the robot a maze
and didn't tell them the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.160
structure of the maze?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.800
How would it discover
the structure?

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.970
How would it make a map?

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.100
How would it localize?

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.820
What if you had a maze--

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.440
to make it simple, let's
say that I tell you

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.330
what the maze is.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.020
But you wake up-- you're the
robot, you wake up, you have

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.130
no idea where you are.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.500
What do you do?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.720
How do you figure out
where you are?

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.245
That's a problem we
call localization.

00:03:19.245 --> 00:03:22.080
And then planning.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.210
What if you have a really
complicated objective?

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.080
What's the step-by-step
things that you

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.860
could do to get there?

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.830
Those are the kinds of things
we're going to do, and here's

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.490
a typical kind of problem.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.520
Let's say that the robot starts
someplace, and say that

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.560
it has something in it
that lets it know

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.320
where it is, like GPS.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.570
And it knows where
it wants to go.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.100
Making a plan is not very
difficult, right?

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.950
I'm here and I want to
go there, connect

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:49.730
with a straight line.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.530
And that's what I've
done here.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.420
The problem is that unbeknownst
to the robot, that

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.430
path doesn't really work.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.620
So on the first step, he thinks
he's going to go from

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.110
here to here in a
straight line.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.660
The blue represents the path
that the robot would like to

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.490
take, but then on the first step
the sonars report that

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.839
they hit walls.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.110
And those show up as the
black marks over here.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.990
So already it can see that it's
not going to be able to

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.840
do what it wants to do.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.990
So it starts to turn and it
finds even more places that

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.780
don't work.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.390
Try again.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.060
Try again.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.240
Notice that the plan now is,
well I don't know what's going

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.320
on here, but I certainly can't
go through there, so I'm going

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.570
to have to go around it.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.070
Keep trying.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.320
Keep trying.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.570
Notice the plan.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.035
So he's always making a plan
that sort of make sense.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.820
He's using for each plan the
information about the walls

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.640
that he's already figured out.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.750
And now he's figured out,
well that didn't work.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.820
So now back track, try
to get out of here.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.990
AUDIENCE: Is he backtracking
right now?

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.440
Or is he--

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.820
PROFESSOR: Well, he's
going forward.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.160
He's making a forward plan.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.070
He's saying, OK now I know all
these walls are here, and I'm

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.910
way down in this corner, how
do I get on the other

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.890
side of that wall.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.110
Well given the information that
I know, I'm going to have

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.650
to go around the known walls.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.250
So my point of showing you
this is several fold.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.340
First off it's uncertain.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.860
You didn't know at the outset
just how bad the problem was.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.920
So there's no way to kind of
pre-plan for all of this.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.840
Secondly, it's a really
hard problem.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.990
If you were to think about
structuring a program to solve

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.270
that problem, in a kind of
High School programming

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.480
sense-- if this happens
then do this, if this

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.710
happens then do this--

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.810
you would have a lot of
if statements, right?

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.260
That's just not the
way to do this.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.400
So what we're going to learn to
do in this module is think

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.700
through much more complicated
plans.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.670
We're going to be looking at the
kind of plans like shown

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:22.990
here that just are not practical
for, do this until

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.180
this happens, and then do this
until this happens, and then

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.900
while that's going
on, do this.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.480
It's just not going to be
practical, that's the idea.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.150
So the very first element, the
thing that we have to get on

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:39.980
top of first, is how to think
about uncertainty.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.460
And there's a theory for that
and the theory is actually

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.780
trivial, the theory is actually
simple, except that

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.510
it's mind-boggling weird that
nobody can get their head

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.480
around it the first
time they see it.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.090
It's called Probability
Theory.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.370
As you'll see in a minute, the
rules are completely trivial.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.430
You'll have no trouble
with the basic rules.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.050
What you will have
trouble with--

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.830
unless you're a lot different
from most people--

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.500
the first time you see this
theory it's very hard to

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.270
imagine exactly what's
going on.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.770
And it's extremely difficult
to have an intuition for

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.360
what's going on.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.940
So the theory is going to give
us a framework then for

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.000
thinking about uncertainty.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.180
In particular, uncertainty
sounds uncertain.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.150
What we would like to do is make
precise statements about

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.580
uncertain situations.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.780
Sounds contradictory, but we'll
do several examples in

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:33.310
lecture and then you'll
do a lot more

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.080
examples in the next week.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.570
So that you learn exactly
what that means.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.320
We would like to draw reliable
inferences from unreliable

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.490
observations.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.660
OK, you have a lot of experience
with unreliable

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:48.760
observations, right?

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.610
The seminars don't tell you
the same thing each time.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.300
That's what we'd like
to deal with.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.600
We would like to be able to
take a bunch of different

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.010
individually, not all that
reliable observations, and

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:04.740
come up with a conclusion that's
a lot more reliable

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.800
than any particular
observation.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.740
And when we're all done with
that what we'd like to do is

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.630
use this theory to help us
design robust systems.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:15.420
Systems that are not fragile.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:20.610
Systems that are not thrown off
track by having a small

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.990
feature that was not part of
the original formulation of

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.940
the problem.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.640
So that's the goal.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.120
And what I'd like to do is start
by motivating it with

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.090
the kind of practical thing
to get you thinking.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.880
So here's the game,
Let's Make a Deal.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.380
I'm going to put 4 LEGO
bricks in a bag.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.460
OK.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.881
LEGO bricks, you've seen
those probably.

00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:46.131
Bag.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:52.340
The LEGO bricks are
white or red.

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:54.510
There's only going to be 4, and
you're not going to know

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.480
how many of each there is.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:05.620
Then you get to pull one LEGO
brick out, and if you pull a

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.125
red one out, I'll
give you 20$.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.790
The hitch is you have to pay
me to play this game.

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:19.940
So the question is, how much are
you willing to pay me to

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.570
play the game?

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.740
So, I need a volunteer.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.100
I need somebody to take 4 LEGOs
and not let me see, OK,

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.050
please, please.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.710
I want you to put 4
LEGOs, only four.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:32.160
They can be white or red.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.110
If you have LEGOs in your
pockets that are a different

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.600
color, don't use them.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.760
You're allowed to know what the
answer is but you're not

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.170
allowed to tell me, or them.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.410
So OK well come over here.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:50.930
So bag, LEGOs, hide,
put some number in.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.630
Oh, no no no.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:56.540
Wait, wait, wait.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.400
Put them back, put them back.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.630
I'm not supposed
to see either.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.880
OK, I'll go way.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.560
OK, 4.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.920
OK, so we'll close
the bag, right?

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.740
And I'll call you back later,
but it'll be nearer

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.480
the end of the hour.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.700
So here's 4 LEGOs, sort of
sounds like 4 LEGOs,

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.840
it's more than one.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.600
OK, so how much would you
be willing to pay

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.080
me to play the game?

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.900
AUDIENCE: 5$.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.360
PROFESSOR: 5$ --

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.928
Can I get more?

00:10:39.928 --> 00:10:41.920
I want to make money.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.414
Can I get a higher bid?

00:10:43.414 --> 00:10:44.410
More than 5$..

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.904
AUDIENCE: $9.90.

00:10:45.904 --> 00:10:47.398
PROFESSOR: How much?

00:10:47.398 --> 00:10:48.394
AUDIENCE: $9.90.

00:10:48.394 --> 00:10:49.888
PROFESSOR: $9.90, very
interesting.

00:10:49.888 --> 00:10:56.860
Can I get more than $9.90?

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.354
AUDIENCE: $9.99 and a half.

00:10:58.354 --> 00:11:00.346
PROFESSOR: $9.99 and a half?

00:11:00.346 --> 00:11:01.342
Magic number.

00:11:01.342 --> 00:11:02.245
AUDIENCE: 10$.

00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:05.440
PROFESSOR: 10$.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:08.392
Can I hear even a penny more?

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.260
A penny more?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:14.220
AUDIENCE: I'll offer
a penny more.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.160
You just have to
go to the bag.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.500
PROFESSOR: I thought we were
being very careful and letting

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.400
them not know.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.190
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.184
Aren't you going to put 4 white
blocks in all the time?

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:26.182
PROFESSOR: I didn't do it.

00:11:26.182 --> 00:11:28.178
That person did it.

00:11:28.178 --> 00:11:29.675
It wasn't me.

00:11:29.675 --> 00:11:30.673
I'm innocent.

00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:32.170
I'm completely fair.

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:37.160
Yeah?

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.152
AUDIENCE: Are we imagining that
you are equally as likely

00:11:41.152 --> 00:11:42.160
to put any number
of blocks in?

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.620
So, are we able to say that
she's more likely

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.099
to put it all white?

00:11:46.099 --> 00:11:49.057
Because that just changes
how you calculate it.

00:11:49.057 --> 00:11:51.530
PROFESSOR: OK, that's an
interesting question.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.100
We need a model of a person.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.080
That's tricky.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.470
OK, I have another idea.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.710
Two more volunteers.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:04.960
OK, volunteer, volunteer.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:14.650
Here's the experiment one person
will hold the bag up

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:19.120
high, so that the other
person can't see it,

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.180
and the other person--

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:23.110
I didn't look in, notice I'm
being very careful, I'm very

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.330
honest, right?

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:27.920
Except for the X-ray vision,
which you don't know about.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.540
Everything is completely fair.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.177
And the little window in
the back you don't

00:12:31.177 --> 00:12:32.720
know about that either.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.890
So, one person holds it up so
the other person can't see in,

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:39.270
the other person grabs a LEGO
and pulls it out and lets

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.935
everybody see that LEGO.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:54.290
It was intended to make
it hard to see in.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.540
OK, red one.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.010
OK, that's fine,
so we're done.

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:02.480
AUDIENCE: We each should
get $20, right?

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.530
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.600
This was a different
part of the bet.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.180
No, no, no, no, no.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.660
Thank you, thank you.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.746
Now how much would you pay
me to play the game?

00:13:13.746 --> 00:13:15.674
AUDIENCE: With that one out?

00:13:15.674 --> 00:13:17.906
PROFESSOR: No, we'll
put that one back.

00:13:17.906 --> 00:13:21.510
OK, so this one came
out, it was red.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.090
Now without looking, I'm going
to stick it back in.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:27.870
OK, so we pulled it out.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.256
So what do we know?

00:13:29.256 --> 00:13:31.686
We know there's at
least 1 red.

00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.602
OK, now what are you willing
to pay to play the game?

00:13:34.602 --> 00:13:35.574
AUDIENCE: 5$..

00:13:35.574 --> 00:13:37.518
PROFESSOR: 5$..

00:13:37.518 --> 00:13:39.948
Yes?

00:13:39.948 --> 00:13:40.920
5$..

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.892
AUDIENCE: $4.99.

00:13:41.892 --> 00:13:42.864
PROFESSOR: $4.99?

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:43.836
Wait a minute.

00:13:43.836 --> 00:13:47.400
Should you be willing
to pay more or less?

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.650
I got it up to 10$.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.570
Should you be willing to
pay more or less now?

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:54.170
AUDIENCE: More.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.650
PROFESSOR: More, why?

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:58.634
The same.

00:13:58.634 --> 00:13:59.626
More.

00:13:59.626 --> 00:14:00.122
The same.

00:14:00.122 --> 00:14:03.098
AUDIENCE: You're insured that
there's at least 1 red block.

00:14:03.098 --> 00:14:06.180
PROFESSOR: I know that there's
at least 1, but didn't I know

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.650
that before?

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.140
No.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:12.060
The person could have been e
that first person could have

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.980
loaded it, because I was
giving her a cut.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.920
I didn't talk about
this before.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:20.170
This is not a set-up.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.270
So I want to vote.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:30.799
How many people would give
me less than 10$?

00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:34.290
I'm going to give you
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] first.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.130
10 to 12.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:43.288
Let's see, 13 to 15, 16
to 18, more than 18.

00:14:43.288 --> 00:14:45.390
So how many people would
give me-- you're only

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.600
allowed to vote once.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.420
Keep in mind that I'm more
likely to choose

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.980
you if you vote high.

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.580
Right?

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.720
Vote high.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.270
So how many people would
give me less than

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.870
$10 to play the game?

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.716
A lot, I would say 20%.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.070
How many people would give
me between $10 and $12?

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.590
A lot smaller, 5%.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:13.355
How many people would give
me between $13 and $15?

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.980
Even smaller, 2%.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.590
How many people would give
me between $16 and $18?

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.320
Wait, these numbers are not
going to add up to 100%.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.680
OK, we'll learn the
theory for how to

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.120
normalize things in a minute.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.770
OK, so we're down to about 1%.

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:40.170
How many people would give
me more than $18?

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.110
One person.

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.440
Thank you, thank you.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:47.680
So that's 1 in 200 or 0.05%.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.140
OK, so what I'd like to do now
is go through the theory

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.980
that's going to let us make a
precise calculation for how

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:59.150
much a rational person--
not to say

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.530
that you're not rational--

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.600
but how much a rational person
might be willing to pay.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.500
So that was the set up, then
we'll do the theory, then

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.760
we'll come back at the end of
the hour and see how many

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.750
people I would have gypped--

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:14.320
made money, or whatever.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.870
OK, so we're going to think
about probability.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:22.170
And the first idea that
we need is set theory.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:24.740
Because we're going to think
about experiments having

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.840
outcomes, and we're going
to talk about the

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.230
outcomes being an event.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:34.390
An event is any describable
outcome from an experiment.

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:36.630
So for example, what if the
experiment were to flip 3

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:38.150
coins in sequence.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:43.120
An event could be head,
head, head.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.540
And you could talk about was the
outcome head, head, head.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.460
The event could be head,
tail, ahead.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.100
The event could be 1
head and 2 tails.

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.940
The event could be the first
toss was a head.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:05.910
So the idea is there's sets that
we're rethinking about.

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:08.950
And we're going to think about
events as possible outcomes

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.160
being members of sets.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.720
There's going to be a special
kind of event that we're

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.829
especially interested in, and
that is an atomic event.

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.874
By which we mean finest grain.

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:28.470
Finest grain is kind
of amorphous idea.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:34.930
What it really means is for
the experiment at hand, it

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:40.150
doesn't seem to make sense to
try to slice the outcome into

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:41.800
two smaller units.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.830
You keep slicing them down
until slicing them into a

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:48.770
smaller unit won't affect
the outcome.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:52.490
So for example, in the coin toss
experiment, I might think

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.350
that there are 8
atomic events.

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.300
Head, head, head, head, head
tail, head, tail, head, head,

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.990
tail, tail, blah, blah, blah.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:06.130
So I've ignored some things
like, it took 3 minutes to do

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.290
the first flip, and it took 2
minutes to do the second one.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:09.670
Right?

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:14.990
That's the art of figuring out
what atomic units are.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:18.490
So for the class of problems
that I'm thinking about, those

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.390
things can be ignored so
I'm not counting them.

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.800
But that's an art, that's
not really a science.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.220
So you sort of have to use good
judgment when you try to

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:31.360
figure out what are the atomic
events for a particular

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.070
experiment.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.030
Atomic events always have
several properties, they are

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.940
always mutually exclusive.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.960
If I know the outcome was atomic
event 3, then I know

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:48.680
for sure that it was
not atomic event 4.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.070
And you can see that these
events up here don't have

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.050
those properties, right?

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.560
So the first toss--

00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.590
here's an event head, head,
head, which is not mutually

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:03.730
exclusive with the first
toss was a head.

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:07.800
So atomic that events have
to be mutually exclusive.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.920
Furthermore, if you list all of
the atomic events, that set

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.930
has to be collectively
exhaustive.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:14.930
Collectively exhaustive?

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.300
What buzz words?

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.620
OK, that means that you've
exhausted all possibilities

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.970
when you've accounted for the
collective behaviors of all

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:25.760
the atomic events.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.670
And we have a very special name
for that because it comes

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:29.200
up over, and over,
and over again.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.050
The set of atomic events, the
maximum set of atomic events,

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.660
is called the sample space.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.850
So the first thing we need to
know when we're thinking about

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:43.990
probability theory, is
how to chunk outcomes

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.520
into a sample space.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:51.030
Second thing we need to know are
the rules of probability.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:55.810
These are the things that are
so absurdly simple, that

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.860
everybody who sees these
immediately comes to the

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:01.660
conclusion that probability
theory is trivial, they then

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.070
don't do anything until the next
exam, and then they don't

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.050
have a clue what we're asking.

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.630
Because it's subtle, it's more
subtle than you might think.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.960
Here's the rules, probabilities
are real numbers

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.210
that are not negative.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:20.360
Pretty easy.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.100
Probabilities have the feature
that the probability of the

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.260
sample space is 1.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.810
That's really just scaling.

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:31.190
That's really just telling me
how big all the numbers are.

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:36.140
So if I enumerate all the
possible atomic events, the

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:40.190
probability of having one of
those as the outcome of an

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.660
experiment, that probability
is 1.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.240
Doesn't seem like I said much,
and I'm already 2/3 of the way

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.010
through the list.

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.876
Yes?

00:20:48.876 --> 00:20:50.214
AUDIENCE: Doesn't that just mean
that something happened?

00:20:50.214 --> 00:20:52.690
PROFESSOR: Something
happened, yes.

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.165
And we are going to say that
this certain event has

00:20:56.165 --> 00:20:58.840
probability 1.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.020
All probabilities are real, all
probabilities are bigger

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.150
than 0, and the probability
of the certain event--

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:09.810
written here as the universe,
the sample space--

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.540
the probability of some
element in the

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.140
sample space is 1.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.610
The only one that's terribly
interesting is additivity.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:22.890
If the intersection between
A and B is empty, the

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:33.390
probability of the union is the
sum of the probabilities

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.240
of the individual events.

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:40.290
Astonishingly, I'm done.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.280
And this doesn't alter the fact
that people are still, to

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.990
this day, doing fundamental
research

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.570
in probability theory.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:53.120
There are many subjects in
probability theory, including

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:58.000
many highly advanced graduate
subjects, all of which derive

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
from these three rules.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.100
It's absurd how un-intuitive
things can be given such

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.910
simple beginnings.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.130
Just as an idea.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.470
So you can prove all of the
interesting results from

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:14.260
probability theory--

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:18.350
you can prove all results from
probability theory with these

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:22.560
three rules, and here's
just one example.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:29.120
If the intersection of A and B
were not empty, you can still

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.740
compute the probability of
the union, it's just more

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.550
complicated than if they were
empty, if the intersection

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:36.510
were empty.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.820
Generally speaking, the
probability of the union of A

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.920
and B, is the probability of A
plus the probability of B,

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.560
minus the probability
of the intersection.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.890
And you can sort of see why that
ought to be true, if you

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.540
think about a Venn diagram.

00:22:49.540 --> 00:22:54.110
If you think about the odds of
having A in the universe--

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:56.160
the universe is the
sample space--

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.620
probability of having sum event
A, the probability of

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.980
having sum event B, the
probability of their

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.530
intersection.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.270
If you were to just add the
probability of A and B, you

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.600
doubly count the intersection.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.890
You don't want to double count
it, you want to count it once.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.150
So you have to subtract
one off.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.940
So that's sort of
what's going on.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.910
OK, as I said the theory
is very simple.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.140
But let's make sure that you've
got the basics first.

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:27.670
So experiment, I'm going to
roll a fair, 6-sided die.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:32.010
And I'm going to count as the
outcome the number of dots on

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.930
the top surface, not
surprisingly.

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.990
Find the probability that the
roll is odd, and greater than

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.020
3 You have 10 seconds.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.050
OK, 10 seconds are up.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.650
What's the answer? (1),
(2), (3), (4) or (5)?

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:00.530
Raise your hands.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:01.510
Excellent, wonderful.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.840
The answer is (1).

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.830
The way I want you to think
about that is in terms of the

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.500
theory that we just generated
because it's useful for

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.170
developing the answers to more
complicated questions.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.620
In terms of the theory, what we
will always do, the process

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:21.060
that always works, is enumerate
the sample space.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.680
What's that mean?

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:26.790
That means identify all
of the atomic events.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:30.440
The atomic events here are
the faces that show are

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.970
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:36.140
Enumerate the sample space.

00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.950
And then find the
event interest.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:44.220
So here the event was
a compound event.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.330
The result is odd and
greater than 3.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:50.950
Odd, well that's 1, 3, 5, shown
by the check marks.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.920
Bigger than 3, that's the
bottom 3 check marks.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.830
If it's going to be both, then
you have to look where there's

00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.605
overlap and that only happens
for the outcome 5.

00:25:01.605 --> 00:25:05.440
Since there's only 1, and
so fair meant that these

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.710
probabilities were the same.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.810
If you think through the
fundamental axioms of

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:15.270
probability, if they're equal,
they're all non-negative real

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:20.320
numbers, and they sum to 1,
then they are all 1/6.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.180
So the answer is 1/6, right?

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.430
OK, that was easy.

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:32.880
The rule that is most
interesting for us, happens

00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.930
not surprisingly to also be the
one that people have the

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.560
most trouble with.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.980
Not excluding the people
who originally

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.640
invented the theory.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.600
The theory goes back
to Laplace.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.900
A bunch of people back then who
were absolutely brilliant

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.150
mathematicians, and still
it took a while to

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.480
formulate this rule.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.060
It was formulated a
guy named Bayes.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.390
Bayes' theorem gives us a way
to think about conditional

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:01.490
probability.

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:06.825
What if I tell you, in some
sample space, B happened?

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.270
How should you relabel the
probabilities to take that

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.770
into account?

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.650
Bayes' rule is trivial, it says
it if I know B happened,

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:24.080
what is the probability
that A occurs, given

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.330
that I know B happens?

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.630
And the rule is, you find
the probability of the

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:31.020
intersection.

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.736
AUDIENCE: How do you do that?

00:26:32.736 --> 00:26:35.720
PROFESSOR: We'll do
some examples.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.900
So we need to find the
probability of the

00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:40.200
intersection, and then we have
to find the probability of B

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.200
occurring, and then
we normalize--

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.680
a word I used before, and that's
exactly what we need to

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.220
do to that distribution--

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:54.110
we normalize the intersection
by the probability of B.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.330
That's an interesting rule.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.310
It's the kind of thing we're
going to want to know about.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.450
We're going to want to know--

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.780
OK, I'm a robot.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.360
I'm in a space.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.890
I don't know where I am.

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.910
I have some a priori probability
idea about where I

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:14.810
am, so I think I'm 1/20 likely
to be here, I'm 1/20 likely to

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:17.100
be there, et cetera,
et cetera.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:22.775
And then I find out the sonars
told me that I'm 0.03 meters

00:27:22.775 --> 00:27:26.760
-- no it can't be that small,
0.72 meters from a wall.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:32.960
Well, how do I take into account
this new information

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.640
to update my probabilities
for where I might be?

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.120
That's what this rule
is good for.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.600
So here's a picture.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.060
The way to think about the rule
is if I condition on B,

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:51.510
if I tell you B happened, that's
equivalent to shrinking

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.510
the universe --

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.630
the universe U, the square.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:28:00.420
That's everything
that can happen.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.640
Inside the universe, there's
this event A and it does not

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.890
occupy the entire universe.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.420
There is a fraction of outcomes
that belong logically

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.240
in not A. OK?

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.750
That's the part that's in U but
not in A. Similarly with

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:24.840
B. Similarly there's some
region, there's some part of

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.790
the universe where both A and
B occur, the intersection of

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.570
the two occurred.

00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:37.600
So what Bayes' theorem says is,
if I tell you B occurred,

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.870
all this part of the universe
outside of B is irrelevant.

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.410
As far as you're concerned,
B's the new universe.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.340
Notice that if B is the
new universe, then the

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.320
intersection--

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.055
which is the part where
A occurred--

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:06.070
is bigger after the conditioning
then it was

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.360
before the conditioning.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.060
Before the conditioning the
universe was this big, now the

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.250
universe is this big.

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:18.410
The universe is smaller, so
this region of overlap

00:29:18.410 --> 00:29:23.160
occupies a greater part
of the new universe.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.460
Is that clear?

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.820
So when you condition, you're
really making the universe

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.890
smaller, And the relative
likelihood of things that are

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.315
still in the universe,
seem bigger.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:40.040
So what's the conditional
probability of getting a die

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:45.970
roll greater than 3, given
that it was odd?

00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.040
Calculate, you have
30 seconds.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.290
This is three times harder.

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:28.340
OK, what's the probability of
getting a die roll greater

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.910
than 3, given that the
die role was odd?

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:32.540
Everybody raise your hands.

00:30:32.540 --> 00:30:36.980
And it's a landslide,
the answer is (2).

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:40.790
You roughly do the same thing we
did before, except now the

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.140
math is incrementally
harder because you

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.120
have to do a divide.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.850
So we think about the same two
events, the event that it is

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.480
odd and the event that it's
bigger than 3, and now we ask

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.190
the question.

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:56.590
If it were odd, what's the
likelihood that it's

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:57.780
greater than 3?

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.840
Before I did the conditioning,
what was the likelihood that

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.090
it was bigger than 3?

00:31:03.905 --> 00:31:05.300
AUDIENCE: 1/6

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.160
PROFESSOR: Nope.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.356
1/2.

00:31:09.356 --> 00:31:12.000
So bigger than 3 is
4, 5, or 6 --

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.810
right?

00:31:12.810 --> 00:31:16.190
There are 3 atomic
units there.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.300
There are 6 atomic units
to start with.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.620
They are equally likely.

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.870
So before I did the
conditioning, the event of

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.960
interest had a probability
of a 1/2.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:28.920
After I do the conditioning, I
know that half of the possible

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.090
samples didn't happen.

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:33.240
The universe shrank.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:36.310
Instead of having a sample space
with 6, I now have a

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.600
sample space with 3.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.550
Similarly the probability
law changed.

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:47.480
So now the event of interest is
bigger than 3, but bigger

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.080
than 3 now only happens once.

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:55.830
So what I need to do is rescale
my probabilities.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.070
Remember the scaling rule, one
of the fundamental properties

00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.790
of probability.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:01.230
The scaling rule said
the sum of the

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.420
probabilities must be 1.

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.660
After I've conditioned,
the sum of the

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.020
probabilities is a 1/2.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.510
That's not good.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.170
I've got to fix it.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:18.140
So the way to think about Bayes'
rule is, if all I know

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:22.040
is it the universe
got smaller, how

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.260
should I redo the scaling?

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:31.560
Well if all I've told you is
that the answer is odd, then

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.980
there are three possibilities.

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:38.750
Before I told you that the
answer was odd, they were

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.250
equally likely.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.730
After I tell you that they're
odd, has it changed the fact

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:45.750
that they're equally likely?

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:46.570
No.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:51.810
They're still equally likely
even under that new condition.

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.470
I haven't changed their
individual probabilities.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:59.750
So they started out equally
likely, they're still equally

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.310
likely, they just don't
sum to 1 anymore.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:07.950
Bayes' rule says, make
them sum to 1.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.300
OK, so the way I make this
sum, sum to one is

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.330
to divide by 1/2.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:16.840
If you divide six by
1/2, you get 1/3.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:21.180
Notice that the probability that
it's bigger than 3 went

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.890
from 1/2 to a 1/3.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.140
It got smaller.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:33.640
It could have gone either way.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:40.760
So, think about what happens
when the world shrinks, when

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.140
the universe gets
smaller, when I

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.940
tell you that B happened.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:49.510
Well when I tell you that B
happened, then I ask you

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.890
whether A happened, here I'm
showing a picture that in the

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:55.780
original universe A and
B sort of covered the

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.720
same amount of area.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.000
By which I mean, they're
about equally likely.

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.003
Before I did the conditioning,
the probability of A was about

00:34:06.003 --> 00:34:10.480
the same size as the probability
of B. What happens

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.070
when I condition?

00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:19.280
Well, when I condition now the
universe is B. But notice the

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.320
way I've drawn them, there's
very little overlap.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:27.370
So now when I condition on B,
the odds that I'm in A seems

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:28.620
to have got smaller.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:36.330
Rather than being of equal
probability, as I show here,

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:40.370
after the conditioning the
relative likelihood of being

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.719
event A is smaller than
it used to be.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:48.260
But that's entirely because of
the way I rigged the circles.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.300
I could have rigged the circles
to have a large amount

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:51.550
of overlap.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.400
Then when I condition, it
seems as though it's

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:04.420
relatively more likely that
I'm in the event A. That's

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.390
what we mean by the
conditioning.

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:11.760
The conditioning can give you
un-intuitive insight.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.550
Because when you condition,
probabilities can get bigger

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:17.400
or littler.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.890
And that's something that sort
of at a gut level, we all have

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:21.140
trouble dealing with.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:27.210
OK, so that's the fundamental
ideas, right?

00:35:27.210 --> 00:35:30.630
We've talked about events.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:34.910
Three axioms of probability that
are completely trivial.

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:43.470
One, not quite so trivial rule,
which is Bayes' rule.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.280
In order to apply it, there's
two more things we need to

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:46.760
talk about.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.736
The first is, notation.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:54.190
We could do the entire rest of
the course using the notation

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:57.700
that I showed so far, drawing
circles on the blackboard, it

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.090
would work.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.150
It would not be very
convenient.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:06.010
So to better take advantage of
math, which is a very concise

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:10.630
way to write things down, we
will define a new notion which

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.370
is a random variable.

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:18.390
Random variable is just like a
variable, except shockingly,

00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:21.200
it's random.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.350
So where we would normally
think about a variable

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:29.480
represents a number, a random
variable represents a

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.730
distribution.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:38.300
So we could, for example in the
die rolling case, we could

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:46.660
say the sample space has 6
atomic events, and I could

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.450
think about it as 6 circles.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:51.770
Circles wouldn't pack
all that well.

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:55.150
6 squares inside the
universe, right?

00:36:55.150 --> 00:36:57.980
Because they are mutually
exclusive, and collectively

00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:00.130
exhaustive, so if I started with
a universal that looked

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:03.920
like that, I would have this one
would be the probability

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:09.730
that the number of dots was 1,
2, 3, it has to fill up by the

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.760
time I've put 6 of
them in there.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:14.810
And they have to not overlap.

00:37:14.810 --> 00:37:18.660
A more convenient notation is
to say, OK, let's let X

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.910
represent that outcome.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.150
So I can label the
events with math.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:33.900
I can say, there's the event X
equals 1, the event X equals

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:38.950
2, the event X equals 3, and it
just makes it much easier

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:41.770
to write down the possibilities,
then to try to

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.380
draw pictures with Venn
diagrams all the time.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:48.370
So all we're doing here is
introducing a mathematical

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:52.080
representation for the same
thing we talked about before.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:38:00.750
But among the things that
you can do, after you've

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.450
formalized this, so you can have
a random variable then

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:06.070
it's a very small jump
to say you can have a

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:09.260
multi-dimensional
random variable.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.620
Let's just for example
have a 2-space.

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.730
X and Y, for example.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:20.400
So now we can talk very
conveniently about situations

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.990
that factor.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:30.450
So, for example when I think
about flipping 3 coins, I can

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:35.500
think about that as a
multivariate random variable

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.960
in three dimensions.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:40.120
One dimension represents the
outcome of the first die--

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:44.160
the first coin toss.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.830
Another dimension is the
second, the third

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:47.630
dimension is the third.

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.870
So there is a very convenient
way of talking about it, and

00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:51.870
we have a more concise
notation.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:57.180
We say, OK let V be the outcome
of the first die roll,

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.400
or whatever.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.480
Let W be the second one, and
then we can think about the

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:05.350
joint probability distribution,
in terms of the

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.920
multi-dimensional
random variable.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:12.680
So we have the random variable
defined by V and W. We will

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:16.072
generally to try to make things
easy for you to know

00:39:16.072 --> 00:39:18.120
what we're trying to talk about,
we'll try to remember

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.430
to capitalize things when we're
talking about random

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:23.390
variables, and then we'll use
the small numbers to talk

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:26.230
about events.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.330
So this notation would represent
the probability that

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:32.510
V took on the value little
v, and W took on the

00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.300
value little w.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.110
We'll see examples of
this in a minute.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:39.290
So the idea is-- you don't need
to do this, it's just a

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:41.210
convenient notation
to write more

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:44.085
complicated things concisely.

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:52.830
Now a concept that's very easy
to talk about, now we have

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:55.950
random variables, is reducing
dimensionality.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:58.750
And in fact, we will
constantly reduce

00:39:58.750 --> 00:40:01.850
dimensionality of complicated
problems that are represented

00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:06.670
by multiple dimensions, to
smaller dimensional problems.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.650
And we'll talk about two
ways of doing that.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.570
The first is what we will
call marginalizing.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:15.650
Marginalizing means, I don't
care what happened in the

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.560
other dimensions.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.240
So if I have a probability
rule that told me, for

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.850
example, about the outcome of
one toss a fair die, and a

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:32.720
second toss of a fair die, and
if I tell you the joint

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.600
probability space
for that, right?

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.690
So I would have 6 outcomes on
one dimension, 6 outcomes on

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.330
another dimension, let's say
they're all equally likely.

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:46.710
I have 36 points altogether, if
they're all equally likely,

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:50.640
then my probability law is
a joint distribution.

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:54.220
The joint distribution has 32
non-zero points and each point

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.700
has height of.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:57.580
I said the right thing, right.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.090
36 is what I meant to say.

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:02.160
My brain is telling me that I
might not have said that.

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.920
I meant 36.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:10.900
So if I have 36 equally likely
events, how high is each one?

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.470
1/36.

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:19.440
OK, so the joint probability
space for two tosses of a fair

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.040
6-sided die, is this
6-by-6 space.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.440
And I may be interested
in marginalizing.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.270
Marginalizing would mean,
I don't care what

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.590
the second one was.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:33.520
OK well, how do you infer the
rule for the first one from

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:38.140
the joint, if I don't care what
the second one was, well

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.390
you sum out the second.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.790
So if I have this 2-space
that represented the

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:47.040
first and the second.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.730
So, say its X and
Y, for example.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:59.520
So, I've got 6 points that
represent 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.260
And then 6 this way, that sort
of thing, except now I have to

00:42:04.260 --> 00:42:06.830
draw in tediously all of
the others, right?

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:10.290
So you get the idea.

00:42:10.290 --> 00:42:18.150
Each one of the X's represents a
point with probability 1/36,

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:21.890
and imagine direction that
they're all in straight lines.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:25.400
Now if I didn't care what is
the second one, how would I

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:28.340
find the rule for the first one,
well I just sum over the

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:28.760
second one.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.210
So, say I'm only interested in
what happened in the first

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:35.310
one, well I would describe all
of the probabilities here to

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.610
that point.

00:42:36.610 --> 00:42:41.700
I would sum out the one that
I don't care about.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.510
That's obvious, right?

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:47.530
Because if I marginalized these
X's that all represent

00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:50.500
the number 1/36 have to turn
into a single dimension axis,

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:54.780
which is just X, and they have
to be 6 numbers that

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.770
are each how high?

00:42:57.770 --> 00:42:59.620
1/6, right?

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:03.310
So the way I get 6 numbers
that are each 1/6, when I

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:08.160
started with 36 numbers that
were each 1/36 is use sum.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.440
OK, so that's called
marginalization.

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.500
The other thing that I
can do is condition.

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:21.090
I can tell you something about
the sample space and ask you

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:24.700
to figure out a conditional
probability.

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:31.690
So I might tell you what's the
probability rule for Y

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:35.630
conditioned on the first
one being 3?

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:36.960
OK.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.700
Mathematically that's a
different problem, that's a

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:44.580
re-scale problem, because
that's Bayes' rule.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:48.190
So generally if I carved out by
conditioning some fraction

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:51.500
of the sample space, the way
you would compute the new

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.840
probabilities would
be to re-scale.

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.360
So there's two operations
that we will do.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.890
We will marginalize, which
means summing out.

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:03.690
And we will condition,
which means re-scale.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:04.860
OK.

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.540
So give some practice
at that, let's think

00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:12.130
about a tangible problem.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:14.590
Example, prevalence and
testing for AIDS.

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:19.690
Consider the effectiveness
of a test for AIDS.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:22.490
This is real data.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:24.390
Data from the United States.

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:28.060
So imagine that we take a
population, representative of

00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:31.070
the population in the United
States, and classify every

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:36.600
individual as having AIDS or
not, and being diagnosed

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.660
according to some test as
positive or negative.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.090
OK, two dimensional.

00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:48.630
The two dimensions are
what was the value of

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.880
AIDS, true or false?

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:57.312
And what's the value of the
test, positive or negative?

00:44:57.312 --> 00:45:01.750
So we've divided the population
into four pieces.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:04.770
And by using the idea of
relative frequency, I've

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:07.450
written probabilities here.

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:12.300
So what's the probability of
choosing by random choice an

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:17.290
individual that has AIDS
and tested positive.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:21.090
OK, so that's 0,003648,
et cetera.

00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:25.140
So I've divided the population
into four groups.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.440
Multidimensional,

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:30.590
multidimensional random variable.

00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:31.220
OK.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.310
The question is, what's the
probability that the test is

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:39.020
positive given that the
subject has AIDS?

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.990
I want to know how
good the test is.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:44.920
So the first question I'm going
to ask is, given that

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.930
the person has AIDS what's the
probability that the test

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:52.230
gives a true answer?

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:53.970
You've got 60 seconds.

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.220
This is harder.

00:45:57.590 --> 00:45:58.840
Some people don't think
it's harder.

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:27.730
So what's the probability that
the test is positive, given

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:29.460
that the subject has AIDS?

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:30.730
Is it bigger than 90%?

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:32.070
Between 50% and 90%?

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:32.460
Less than 50%?

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.830
Or you can't tell
from the data?

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:37.350
Everybody vote, and the answer
is 100% correct.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:38.170
Wonderful.

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:40.540
So let me make it harder.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:43.420
Is it between 90% and 95%?

00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:45.886
Or between 95% and a 100%?

00:46:45.886 --> 00:46:46.862
AUDIENCE: 95% and a 100%

00:46:46.862 --> 00:46:48.080
PROFESSOR: 95%.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:53.810
Is it between 95% and 97%,
or 97% and 100%?

00:46:57.826 --> 00:46:59.940
OK, sorry.

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.190
This is called marginalization.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.470
I told you something about the
population that lets you

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:09.660
eliminate some of the numbers.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:13.390
So if I told you that the person
has AIDS, then I know

00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:16.460
I'm in the first column.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:17.790
That's marginalization.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:20.880
I gave you new information.

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.720
I'm saying the other cases
didn't happen.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.800
I've shrunk the universe, it
used to have 4 groups of

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:32.090
people, now it has 2 groups of
people, I used Bayes' rule.

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:38.330
I need to re-scale the numbers
so that they add to 1.

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:42.150
So these 2 numbers, the only 2
possibilities that can occur--

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:43.870
after I've done the
conditioning, no

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:45.990
longer add to 1.

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:48.410
I've got to make
them add to 1.

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:52.160
I do that by dividing by the
probability of the event that

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:54.620
I'm using to normalize.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:58.240
So the sum of these two
probabilities is something,

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:03.350
whatever it is 0.003700.

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:06.450
So I divide each of those
probabilities by that sum,

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:07.930
that's just Bayes' rule.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:11.070
And I find out that the answer
is the probability that the

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:14.190
test is positive--

00:48:14.190 --> 00:48:16.780
given that person has AIDS, the
probability that the test

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:20.240
is positive is 0.986.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:21.490
Good test?

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.376
Good test?

00:48:26.376 --> 00:48:28.380
98%.

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:30.060
I won't say that.

00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.160
98%. is a good test right?

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:36.040
Not that today is an appropriate
day to talk about

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.230
the outcomes of tests and 98%.

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:39.380
But, I won't mention that.

00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:43.810
OK, so good test.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.530
The accuracy of the test
is greater than 98%.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:48.780
Quite good.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.010
New question.

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.310
What's the probability that
the subject has AIDS given

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:00.560
that the test is positive?

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.270
Everybody vote. (1),
(2), (3), (4).

00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:23.020
Looks 100%.

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.970
OK, the answer is
less than 50%.

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:25.610
Why is that?

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.970
Well that's another
marginalization problem, but

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:31.490
now we're marginalizing on
a different population.

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:34.840
This is how you can go awry
thinking about probability.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.670
The 2 numbers seem kind
of contradictory.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:40.550
Here I'm saying that the test
came out positive and I'm

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:44.570
asking does the subject
have AIDS.

00:49:44.570 --> 00:49:45.970
It's still marginalization.

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:50.140
I'm still throwing away 2 of the
conditions, two fractions

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.610
of the population, I'm only
thinking about 2.

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:58.240
I still have to normalize so
that the sums come out 1, but

00:49:58.240 --> 00:49:59.490
the numbers are different.

00:49:59.490 --> 00:50:01.772
Yes?

00:50:01.772 --> 00:50:03.022
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:50:08.534 --> 00:50:09.980
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.890
Because my brain's
not working.

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:16.150
OK, I've been saying
marginalization and I meant

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:19.130
uniformly, over the last five
minutes, to be saying

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:21.490
conditioning.

00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:24.450
OK, so I skipped breakfast this
morning, my blood sugar

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:27.450
is low, sorry.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:28.850
Thank you very much.

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:33.620
I should have been saying
conditioning.

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.580
Sorry.

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.290
OK, so backing up.

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:46.200
OK I conditioned on the fact
that the person had AIDS, and

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:49.100
then I conditioned on
the fact that the

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:50.750
test came up positive.

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:54.850
In both cases I was
conditioning.

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:58.050
In both cases I was
doing Bayes' rule.

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:00.200
Please ignore the person
who can't connect his

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.740
brain to his mouth.

00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:07.340
So, here because the
conditioning event has a very

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:11.950
different set of numbers from
these numbers, the relative

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:18.450
likelihood that the subject
has AIDS is small.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:25.460
So even though the test is very
effective in identifying

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:30.990
cases that are known to be true,
it is not very effective

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:35.840
in taking a random person from
the population and saying the

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.060
test was positive,
you have it.

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:42.430
OK, those are very different
things and the probability

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:45.700
theory gives us a way
to say exactly how

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.950
different those are.

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:52.710
Why are they so different?

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:54.785
The reason they're different
is that other word.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.370
Because the marginal

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.530
probabilities are so different.

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:05.320
And that is because the
population is skewed.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:09.650
So the fact that the test came
out positive, is offset at

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:14.000
least somewhat by the skew
in the population.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.210
So the point here is actually
marginalizing.

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.470
If I think about how many people
in the population have

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:27.120
AIDS, that means I'm summing
on the columns, rather than

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.220
conditioning.

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.200
And what you see is a very
skewed population.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:38.310
And that's the reason you can't
conclude from the test,

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:42.440
whether or not this particular
subject has the disease or not

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:44.980
because the population
is so skewed.

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:49.850
So this was intended to be an
example of conditioning versus

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:52.140
marginalization and how you
think about that in a

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.400
multi-dimensional
random variable.

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.976
Yes?

00:52:55.976 --> 00:52:59.148
AUDIENCE: Don't you sum
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] in order to

00:52:59.148 --> 00:53:00.398
do Bayes' rule?

00:53:02.808 --> 00:53:08.880
PROFESSOR: In order to condition
on has AIDS, you

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.140
need to sum has AIDS.

00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:13.950
And then you use that number.

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:14.680
Yes?

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.732
That's right.

00:53:15.732 --> 00:53:16.968
AUDIENCE: So how are
they different?

00:53:16.968 --> 00:53:20.740
PROFESSOR: One of them has a
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] and the other

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:21.400
one doesn't.

00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:26.570
So when we did Bayes' rule, we
did the marginalization here,

00:53:26.570 --> 00:53:32.850
but then we use that summed
number to normalize the

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:36.400
individual probabilities by
scaling, by dividing.

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:40.600
So that the new sum, over
the new smaller sample

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:45.280
space is still one.

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.320
So your point 's right.

00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:50.600
So regardless of whether we're
conditioning or marginalizing,

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.080
we still end up computing
the marginals.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.010
it's just that in one case were
done, and in the other

00:53:56.010 --> 00:54:02.567
case we use that marginal
to re-scale OK?

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:12.421
So I said, we could just use
set theory and we're done.

00:54:12.421 --> 00:54:14.420
We'll in fact use
random variables

00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:15.230
because it's simpler.

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:17.740
That's one of the two other
things we need to do which are

00:54:17.740 --> 00:54:20.170
non-essential, it just makes
our life easier.

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:23.160
And the other non-essential
thing that we will do is

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.430
represent it in some sort
of a Python structure.

00:54:26.430 --> 00:54:29.200
So we would like to be able
to conveniently represent

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.590
probabilities in Python.

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:36.690
The way we'll do that, is a
little obscure the first time

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:37.500
you look at it.

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.160
But again, once you've done
it a few times it's a very

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:41.920
natural way of doing
it, otherwise we

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:43.200
wouldn't do it this way.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:47.170
How are we going to represent
probability laws in Python?

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:54.470
The way we'll do it, since the
labels for random variables

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:57.040
can be lots of different
things-- so for example, the

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:01.270
label in the previous one was
in the case of the subject

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:05.900
having AIDS or not, the label
was true or false.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:10.190
The label for the test was
positive or negative.

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:14.710
So in order to allow you to
give symbolic and human

00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:21.500
meaningful names to events we
will use a dictionary as the

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:27.300
fundamental way of associating
probabilities with events.

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.450
So, we'll represent
a probability

00:55:29.450 --> 00:55:31.270
distribution by a class--

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:34.760
what a surprise, by
a Python class--

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.460
that we will call DDist which
means discrete distribution.

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:47.110
DDists want to associate the
name of an atomic event which

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:53.280
we will let you use any string,
or in fact any--

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:55.580
I should generalize that.

00:55:55.580 --> 00:56:02.230
You can use any Python data
structure to identify an

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:04.190
atomic event.

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:06.870
And then we will associate
that using a Python

00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:10.970
dictionary, with the
probability.

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:16.310
So what we will do when you
instantiate a new discrete

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:21.380
distribution, you will-- the
instantiation rule, you must

00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:22.670
call it with a dictionary.

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:26.550
A dictionary is a thing in
Python that associates one

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:31.130
thing with another thing, I'll
give an example in a minute.

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:37.430
And the utility of this is that
you'll be able to use as

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:43.320
your atomic event a string, like
true or false, a string

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:46.840
like positive or negative, or
something more complicated

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.740
like a tuple.

00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:49.810
And I'll show you an example of
where you would want to do

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.470
that in just a second.

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:55.120
So the idea is going to be
you establish a discrete

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.690
distribution by the unique
method called the dictionary.

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:08.080
The dictionary is just a list
of keys which tell you which

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:11.130
event that you're trying to
name the probability of.

00:57:11.130 --> 00:57:13.390
Associated with a number,
and that number is the

00:57:13.390 --> 00:57:15.380
probability.

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:18.210
And this shows you that
there's one extremely

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:22.450
interesting method, which
is the Prob method.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.790
The idea is that Prob will
tell you what is the

00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:28.640
probability associated
with that key.

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.020
If it doesn't find the key in
the dictionary, I'll tell you

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:32.370
the answer is 0.

00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:35.550
We do that for a specific reason
too, because a lot of

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:38.900
the probability spaces that we
will talk about, have lots of

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:40.560
0's in them.

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:44.110
So instead of having to
enumerate all of the cases

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:48.020
that are 0 we will assume that
if you didn't tell us a

00:57:48.020 --> 00:57:53.480
probability, the answer was 0.

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.900
OK so this is the idea.

00:57:55.900 --> 00:58:02.850
I could say use the disk module
in lib 601 to create

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:05.770
the outcome of a coin
toss experiment.

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:08.130
And I have a syntax error.

00:58:08.130 --> 00:58:10.650
This should have had
a squiggle brace.

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:15.330
A dictionary is something
that in Python--

00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:18.420
So I should have said something
like this--

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.670
dist.DDist of squiggle.

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:25.450
Sorry about that, that should've
said squiggle, I'll

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:27.770
fix it and put the answer
on the website.

00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:40.090
Head should be associated with
the probability 0.5 and tail

00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:43.200
should be associated with
the probability 0.5.

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:46.840
End of dictionary,
end of call.

00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.700
Sorry, I missed the squiggle.

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:51.140
Actually what happened was,
I put the squiggle in

00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:52.260
and LaTeX ate it.

00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:56.790
Because that's the
LaTeX, anyway.

00:58:56.790 --> 00:59:00.930
It's sort of my fault.

00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:02.790
The dog ate my homework.

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:05.140
LaTeX ate my squiggle, it's
sort of the same thing.

00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:11.480
So having defined a
distribution, then I can ask

00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:14.560
what's the probability
of the event head?

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.880
The answer is a half.

00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:17.460
The probability of event tail?

00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:19.360
The answer is a half.

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.640
The probability of event H?

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.860
There is no H. The answer 0.

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.920
That's what I meant
by sparsity.

00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:29.400
If I didn't tell you what the
probability is, we assume the

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:30.650
answer is 0.

00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:37.830
Conditional probabilities are
a little more obscure.

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:40.830
What's the conditional
probability that the test

00:59:40.830 --> 00:59:44.060
gives me some outcome given that
I tell you the status of

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.840
whether the patient has,
or doesn't have AIDS?

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.930
OK, well conditionals--

00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:54.900
you're going to have to tell
me which case I want to

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.680
condition on.

00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:59.620
So in order for me to tell you
the right probability law you

00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:04.270
have to tell me does the person
have AIDS or not.

01:00:04.270 --> 01:00:06.430
So that becomes an argument.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:09.620
So we're going to represent
conditional probabilities as

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:11.450
procedures.

01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:12.160
That's a little weird.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.920
So the input to the procedure,
specifies the condition.

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:22.420
So if I want to call the
procedure and find out what's

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:26.410
the distribution for the
tests, given that

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:29.070
the person has AIDS?

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:32.085
Then I would call, test
given AIDS of true.

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:42.040
So if AIDS is true, return this
DDist, otherwise return

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:43.140
this DDist.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.460
So it's a little bizarre but
think about what it has to do.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:50.720
If I want to specify a
conditional probability, I

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.640
have to tell you an answer.

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:56.990
And that's what the
parameter is for.

01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:00.260
So the way that would work is
illustrated here having

01:01:00.260 --> 01:01:03.910
defined this as the conditional
distribution I

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:07.980
could call it by saying what is
the distribution on tests

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:11.210
given that AIDS was true?

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.775
And the answer to that
is the DDist.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:20.140
Or if I had that DDist, which
would be this phrase, I could

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.650
say what's then the probability
in that new

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:26.980
distribution that the
answer is negative?

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.720
Then I would look up the dot
prob method within the

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:36.160
resulting conditional
distribution, and look up the

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:37.410
condition negative.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:42.930
And finally the way that I
would think about a joint

01:01:42.930 --> 01:01:48.850
probability distribution,
is to use a tuple.

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:50.700
Joint probability distributions
are

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:54.600
multi-dimensional, tuples
are multi-dimensional.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.500
So for example, if I wanted
to represent this

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:03.990
multi-dimensional data,
I might have the joint

01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:11.300
distribution of AIDS
and tests.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.870
OK that's a 2-by-2.

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:16.900
AIDS can take on 2 different
values, true or false.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.380
And tests can take
on 2 different

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:19.820
values, positive or negative.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.940
So there's 4 cases.

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:25.310
The way I would specify a joint
distribution would be

01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:29.950
create a joint distribution
starting with the marginal

01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:39.900
distribution for AIDS and then
using Bayes' rule tell me the

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:44.860
two different conditional
probabilities given AIDS.

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:50.130
And that then will create a new
joint distribution that

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:53.980
whose DDist is a tuple.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:58.900
So in this new joint
distribution, AIDS and tests,

01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:02.860
if AIDS is false, and
test is negative--

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:06.830
so false negative
is this number--

01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:12.830
the probability associated with
tuple is that number.

01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:14.710
Is that clear?

01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:17.920
So I'm going to construct
joint distributions by

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.870
thinking about conditional
probabilities.

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:25.290
So I have a simple distributions
which are

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:26.850
defined with dictionaries.

01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:30.040
I have conditional probabilities
which are

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.790
defined by procedures.

01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:34.970
And I have joint probabilities
which are defined by tuples.

01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:43.990
OK, so that's the Python magic
that we will use and a lot of

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:48.010
the exercises for Week 10 have
to do with getting that

01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:50.170
nomenclature straight.

01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:52.530
It's a little confusing at
first, I assure you that by

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.130
the time you've practiced
with it, it is

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.910
a reasonable notation.

01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:59.970
It just takes a little bit of
practice to get onto it, much

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:01.380
like other notations.

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:03.650
OK where are we going
with this?

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:06.000
What we would like to do is
solve that problem that I

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.120
showed at the beginning
of the hour.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:12.620
So we would like to know things
like, where am I?

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.670
So the kind of thing that we're
going to do is think

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:19.720
about where am I based on my
current velocity and where I

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.280
think I am, odometry--

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.200
which is uncertain,
it's unreliable--

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.750
versus for example where
I think I am

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:31.670
based on noisy sensors.

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:36.860
OK so that's like two
independent noisy things.

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:37.070
Right?

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:39.410
The odometry you can't
completely rely on it.

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:42.300
You've probably run
into that by now.

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.750
The sonars are not completely
reliable.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.960
So there are two kinds
of noisy things.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.470
How do you optimally
combine them?

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:51.830
That's where we're heading.

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:54.350
So the idea is going to be
here I am, I think I'm a

01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:56.510
robot, I think I'm heading
toward a wall, I'd like to

01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:58.790
know where am I.

01:04:58.790 --> 01:05:01.430
So the kinds of data that we're
going to look at are

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:08.370
things like, I think I know
where I started out.

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:10.360
Now my thinking could
be pretty vague.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:13.340
It could be, I have no clue so
I'm going to assume that I'm

01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:17.030
equally likely anywhere
in space.

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:19.600
So I have a small probability
of being many places.

01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.850
That just means that my initial

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.100
distribution is very broad.

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:29.510
But then I will define where
I think I am by taking into

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:34.300
account where I think I will
be after my next step.

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:38.320
So I think I'm moving
at some speed.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.120
If I were here, and if
I'm going at some

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.790
speed I'll be there.

01:05:43.790 --> 01:05:48.650
So we will formalize that by
thinking about a transition.

01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:52.920
I think that if I am here at
time T, I will be there at

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.860
time T plus 1.

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.680
And I'll also think about, what
do I think the sonars

01:05:58.680 --> 01:05:59.720
should've told me.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.090
If I think I'm here, what would
the sonars have said?

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:05.060
If I think I'm here, what would
the sonars have said?

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:09.160
And we'll use those as a way
to work backwards in

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.890
probability, use Bayes' rule.

01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:16.970
To say, I have a noisy idea
about where I will be if I

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:19.230
started there.

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:22.180
I have a noisy idea of what the
sonars would have said, if

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.190
I started there.

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:25.930
But I don't know where
I started.

01:06:25.930 --> 01:06:28.240
Where did I start?

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.780
That's the way we're going to
use the probability theory.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.650
So for example, if I thought I
was here and if I thought I

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:41.770
was going ahead 2 units in
space per unit in time, I

01:06:41.770 --> 01:06:46.290
would think that the
next time I'm here.

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:49.350
But since I'm not quite sure
where I was maybe I'll be

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:51.370
there, and maybe I'll be there,
but there's very little

01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:52.760
chance that I'll be there.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.230
That's what I mean by
a transition model.

01:06:57.230 --> 01:07:01.760
It's a probabilistic way of
describing the difference

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.900
between where I start and where
I finish in one step.

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:11.060
Similarly, we'll think about
an observation model.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.310
If I think I'm here,
what do I think the

01:07:13.310 --> 01:07:14.900
sonars would have said.

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:18.910
Well I think I've got some
distribution that it's very

01:07:18.910 --> 01:07:21.870
likely that they'll give me the
right answer, but it might

01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:23.850
be a little short it
might be a long.

01:07:23.850 --> 01:07:25.760
Maybe it'll make
a bigger error.

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:30.760
So I'll think about
two things.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:34.220
Where do I think I will be
based on how I'm going?

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:37.200
And where do I think I'll be
based on my observations?

01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:39.640
And then we'll try to formalize
that into a

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:42.790
structure that gives me a better
idea of where I am.

01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:49.130
That's the point of the
exercises next week when we

01:07:49.130 --> 01:07:51.420
won't have a lecture.

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.810
So this week we're going to
learn how to do some very

01:07:53.810 --> 01:07:57.660
simple ideas with modelling
probabilities.

01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.950
With thinking about these
kinds of distributions.

01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:02.380
And the idea next week then is
going to be incorporating it

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:06.310
into a structure that will let
us figure out where the robot

01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:10.700
is in some sort of
an optimal sense.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.220
So thinking about optimal --

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:14.720
let's come back to the
original question.

01:08:17.229 --> 01:08:23.130
How much would you pay
me to play the game?

01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:24.740
OK, we had some votes.

01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.470
They didn't add up to 1.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.160
What should I do to make
them add up to 1?

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.330
Divide by the sum.

01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:35.960
Right?

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:37.359
Look at all of you know
already, right?

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:41.149
So you now know all this great
probability theory.

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:44.630
So the question is can we use
probability theory to come up

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:50.010
with a rational way of thinking
how much it's worth?

01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:55.210
Most of you thought that it's
worth less than 10$.

01:08:55.210 --> 01:08:56.979
OK, so how do we think
about this?

01:08:56.979 --> 01:09:01.069
How do we use the theory that
we just generated to come up

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:05.560
with a rational decision about
how much that's worth?

01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:10.210
OK, thinking about the bet
quantitatively, what we're

01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:11.439
going to try to do
is think about it

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:13.710
with probability theory.

01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:18.200
There are 5 possibilities
inside the bag.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:22.040
Originally there could have been
4 white, or 3 white and 1

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.790
red, or 2 and 2, or 1
and 3, or 0 and 4.

01:09:26.790 --> 01:09:28.290
That was the original case.

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:29.040
You didn't know.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.260
I didn't know.

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:31.970
They were thrown into
the bag over here.

01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:33.160
We didn't know.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:36.250
How much would that game--

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:43.590
how much should you be willing
to pay to play that game?

01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:48.189
Someone asked how many white
ones and how many red ones did

01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:49.810
the person put in the bag?

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:51.609
I don't have a clue, right?

01:09:51.609 --> 01:09:54.970
We need a model for
the person.

01:09:54.970 --> 01:10:01.940
Since I don't have a clue, one
very common strategy is to say

01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:03.770
all these things I know nothing
about let's just

01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:06.880
assume they're all
equally likely.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.570
So that's called maximum
likelihood, when you do that.

01:10:10.570 --> 01:10:12.670
There's other possible
strategies.

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:14.990
I'll use the maximum likelihood
idea just

01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:16.290
because it's easy.

01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:18.080
So I have no idea.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.790
Let's just assume that here's
all of the conditions that

01:10:21.790 --> 01:10:22.450
could have happened.

01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:24.602
The number of red that are in
the bag could have been 0, 1,

01:10:24.602 --> 01:10:25.852
2, 3, or 4.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.270
I have no idea how the
person chose the

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:33.700
number of LEGO parts.

01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:38.580
So I'll assume that each of
those cases is 1/5 likely,

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:41.730
since there's 5 cases.

01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:45.970
OK now I'll think about what's
my expected value of the

01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:50.350
amount of money that I'll make
if the random variable S,

01:10:50.350 --> 01:10:54.910
which is the number of red
things that are in the bag was

01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:56.430
s which is either 0,
1, 2, 3, or 4.

01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:04.410
OK, if there are 0, how much
money do you expect to make?

01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:06.410
None.

01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:08.610
If there are 4 reds, how
much money would

01:11:08.610 --> 01:11:11.680
you expect to make?

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:19.870
$20 If there are 2 reds, you
would expect to make 10 $.

01:11:19.870 --> 01:11:21.860
Everybody see that.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:24.960
I'm trying to think through a
logical sequence of steps for

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:28.450
thinking about how much is it
worth to play the game.

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:33.110
So this is the amount of money
that you would expect given

01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:37.460
that the number of red in the
bag, which you don't know,

01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:39.750
were 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:41.560
That's this row.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.360
What's the probability, what's
the expected value of the

01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:49.410
amount of money you would
get., and that happens?

01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:51.390
Well I have to use
Bayes' rule.

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:57.810
What I need to do is I have to
take this probability times

01:11:57.810 --> 01:12:00.670
that amount to get that
dollar value.

01:12:00.670 --> 01:12:08.530
So over here, in the event that
there are 4 reds in the

01:12:08.530 --> 01:12:13.435
bag, I'm expecting to get $20
but that's only 1/5 likely.

01:12:16.330 --> 01:12:16.590
Right?

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:20.440
Because there don't have to
be 4 reds in the bag.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.920
So I multiply the 1/5 times
the $20, and I get 4$.

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.200
So my expected outcome
for this trial is 4$.

01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:33.490
Here, I'm expecting to make 10$
if I knew that there was 2

01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:34.390
reds in the bag.

01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:36.070
But I don't know that there's
2 reds in the bag, there's a

01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:40.340
1/5 probability there's
2 reds in the bag.

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:44.465
So 1/5 of my expected amount of
money which is 10$ is 2$.

01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:49.970
So then in order to figure out
my expected amount money I

01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:53.630
just add these all up,
marginalizing.

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:55.110
And I get the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:58.470
4 plus 3 is 7 plus 2
is 9 plus 1 is 10.

01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:02.470
So this theory says it if I can
regard the person who put

01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:07.260
the LEGOs in the bag as being
completely random, I should

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:12.110
expect to make 10$ on
the experiment.

01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:14.180
So that means you should
be willing to pay 10$.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.400
Because on average, you'll
get back 10$.

01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.330
If you wanted to make a
profit you ought to be

01:13:22.330 --> 01:13:25.040
willing to pay 9$.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:25.350
Right?

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:28.240
Because then you would pay
9$ expecting to get 10$.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.630
If you really would like
to make a loss, right?

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:33.760
Then you should pay $11.

01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:34.499
Yeah?

01:13:34.499 --> 01:13:36.594
AUDIENCE: Why do we
assume that these

01:13:36.594 --> 01:13:37.493
events are equally likely?

01:13:37.493 --> 01:13:39.990
PROFESSOR: Completely
arbitrary.

01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:44.210
So there's theories, more
advanced theories, for how you

01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:46.200
would make that choice.

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:49.910
So for example if in your head
you thought that the person

01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:55.770
just took a large collection of
LEGO parts and reached in,

01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:59.390
then you would think that the
number of red and white might

01:13:59.390 --> 01:14:03.820
depend on the number that
started out in the bin.

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.680
But I don't think that's
probably true, right.

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:08.010
The person was probably looking
at them and saying, oh

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:10.800
throw in one red, through
in one white.

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:14.540
So you need a theory for doing
that, and I'm saying that in

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:18.940
the absence of any other
information let me assume that

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:22.210
those are equally likely and
see what the consequence of

01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:23.050
that would be.

01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:26.640
The consequence of assuming that
is that I should expect

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.800
to get 10 $ back.

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:34.770
What happens if you
pull out a red?

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.960
As we did.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:39.330
How does that affect things?

01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:43.430
Well it increases
the bottom line.

01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:47.320
I start out again with the
assumption that all 5 cases

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:49.810
are equally likely.

01:14:49.810 --> 01:14:54.440
Now I have to ask the case, how
likely is it that the one

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.540
that we pulled out was red?

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:01.520
Well it's not very likely that
the one that I pulled out was

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:05.340
red, if they were all white.

01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.180
The probability of that
happening is 0.

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:12.690
What's the probability if there
were 2 that the person

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:13.740
pulled out a red?

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:16.880
Well 2 of them were red, 2 of
them were white, 2 out of 4

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:24.550
cases would have showed this
case of pulling out a red.

01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:27.290
So this line then tells
me how likely is it

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:30.670
that the red was pulled.

01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:31.260
OK.

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:34.020
Then what I want to do is
think about what's the

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:38.110
probability that I pulled
out a red, and there was

01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:39.530
0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:45.350
So I multiply 1/5 times 0/40,
0/20, 1/5 times 1/4 to get

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:50.120
1/20, 1/5 times 2/4
you get 2/20.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.220
So those are probabilities
of each

01:15:52.220 --> 01:15:54.300
individual event happening.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.220
But they don't sum to 1.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:59.670
So then the next step I have
to make them sum to 1.

01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:01.380
So the sum of these is a 1/2.

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:05.270
So I make them sum
to one this way.

01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:10.170
So now what's happened is it's
relatively more likely 4 out

01:16:10.170 --> 01:16:14.200
of 10, that this case happened,
than that case.

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.890
I know for sure, for example,
that there's not 4 whites.

01:16:19.890 --> 01:16:22.360
The probability of
4 whites is 0--

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:25.400
0 out of 10

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:29.730
So what I've done is I've skewed
the distribution toward

01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:34.770
more red by learning that
there's at least 1, I now know

01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:36.650
that I know additional
information.

01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:39.570
These were not equally likely.

01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:41.670
In fact, the ones with
more red were

01:16:41.670 --> 01:16:43.520
relatively more likely.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.480
So if I compute this probability
times that

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.580
expected amount, I now get a
much bigger answer for the

01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:54.100
high number of reds.

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:57.350
So I still get 0 just like I
did before for this case,

01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:59.540
because there's no
reds in the bag.

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:02.930
But now it's much more likely
that they're all red, because

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:05.600
I know there was
at least 1 red.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.740
And then the answer
comes out $15.

01:17:08.740 --> 01:17:15.620
So my overall assessment,
don't go to Vegas.

01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:25.710
You could have made a lot more
money by offering $13.

01:17:25.710 --> 01:17:27.380
Because on average,
you should've

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:30.420
expected to make $15.

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:34.490
OK, so what I wanted to do by
this example is go through a

01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:39.130
specific example of how you can
speak quantitatively about

01:17:39.130 --> 01:17:40.540
things that are uncertain.

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:43.170
And that's the theme for
the rest of the course.
