00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.232
- [Voiceover] Measure
the angle in degrees.

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:05.180
So here we have this blue angle

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.557
that we want to measure in degrees,

00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:10.765
and it's sitting on top of this circle.

00:00:10.765 --> 00:00:13.829
That circle is actually a protractor.

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.146
Sometimes we see, and maybe
what you're used to seeing,

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:18.976
is protractors that are
more semicircle shaped,

00:00:18.976 --> 00:00:21.262
something like this.

00:00:21.262 --> 00:00:23.480
And those semicircle protractors measure

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.563
from zero to 180 degrees.

00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:30.483
Which is good, but a
circle is even better.

00:00:30.483 --> 00:00:31.805
A full circle is better because

00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:35.729
an angle can measure up to 360 degrees.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:39.778
So a full circle allows us to
measure and angle of any size,

00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:43.361
instead of only an
angle up to 180 degrees.

00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:47.442
Now the way we're gonna measure this angle

00:00:47.442 --> 00:00:50.888
is the same way we would
on a semicircle protractor.

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:52.256
The first thing we wanna do is

00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:55.694
make sure one of our
rays lines up to zero.

00:00:55.694 --> 00:00:57.576
So here's one of our rays,

00:00:57.576 --> 00:00:59.893
and it's lining up to
zero on the protractor.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:03.258
So that's nice, it's
already lined up for us.

00:01:03.258 --> 00:01:04.881
And then we're gonna measure the opening

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:09.331
all the way to the other
ray, to right here.

00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:12.243
And so if our angle only
measured opened up this far,

00:01:12.243 --> 00:01:13.899
it would be a 10 degree angle.

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.512
If let's say it opened to here,

00:01:15.512 --> 00:01:17.627
it would be a 50 degree angle.

00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:20.771
But our angle measures
all the way to here,

00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:22.354
to the 160 degrees.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:27.050
So 160 degrees is the
measure of our angle.

00:01:29.986 --> 00:01:33.761
And again, when you measure
on a circle protractor,

00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:36.371
or any protractor for that matter,

00:01:36.371 --> 00:01:39.814
you're gonna line one ray up to the zero,

00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:43.986
and then measure the opening
'til you get to the other ray,

00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:47.653
which in this case
opened up to 160 degrees.
