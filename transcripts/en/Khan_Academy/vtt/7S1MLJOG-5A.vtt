00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.280
Find the area and
perimeter of the polygon.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.770
So let's start with
the area first.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.580
So the area of this
polygon-- there's

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.980
kind of two parts of this.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.580
First, you have this part
that's kind of rectangular,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.980
or it is rectangular,
this part right over here.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.710
And that area is
pretty straightforward.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.140
It's just going to
be base times height.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.490
So area's going to be 8 times
4 for the rectangular part.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.050
And then we have this
triangular part up here.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.410
So we have this area up here.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.065
And for a triangle, the area
is base times height times 1/2.

00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:36.690
And that actually
makes a lot of sense.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.890
Because if you just
multiplied base times height,

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.020
you would get this entire area.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.190
You would get the area
of that entire rectangle.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.399
And you see that the triangle
is exactly 1/2 of it.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:46.940
If you took this
part of the triangle

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.100
and you flipped it over,
you'd fill up that space.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.641
If you took this
part of the triangle

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:52.770
and you flipped it over,
you'd fill up that space.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.280
So the triangle's area is
1/2 of the triangle's base

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.940
times the triangle's height.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.400
So plus 1/2 times
the triangle's base,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.569
which is 8 inches, times
the triangle's height, which

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.620
is 4 inches.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.440
And so let's just calculate it.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.710
This gives us 32
plus-- oh, sorry.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.784
That's not 8 times 4.

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:15.950
I don't want to confuse you.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.260
The triangle's height is 3.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.160
8 times 3, right there.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.740
That's the triangle's height.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.270
So once again, let's go
back and calculate it.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.455
So this is going to be 32
plus-- 1/2 times 8 is 4.

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:33.900
4 times 3 is 12.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.030
And so our area for our
shape is going to be 44.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.380
Now let's do the perimeter.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.560
The perimeter-- we just
have to figure out what's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.125
the sum of the sides.

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:45.500
How long of a
fence would we have

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.000
to build if we wanted to make
it around this shape, right

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.280
along the sides of this shape?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.210
So the perimeter-- I'll
just write P for perimeter.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:05.260
It's going to be equal to 8 plus
4 plus 5 plus this 5, this edge

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.350
right over here, plus--
I didn't write that down.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.300
So I have two 5's plus
this 4 right over here.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.540
So you have 8 plus 4 is 12.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.630
12 plus 10-- well, I'll
just go one step at a time.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.956
12 plus 5 is 17.

00:02:21.956 --> 00:02:23.684
17 plus 5 is 22.

00:02:23.684 --> 00:02:26.740
22 plus 4 is 26.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.940
So the perimeter is 26 inches.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.670
And let me get the
units right, too.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.440
Because over here, I'm
multiplying 8 inches

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.530
by 4 inches.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.260
So you get square inches.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.240
8 inches by 3 inches, so
you get square inches again.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.980
So this is going to
be square inches.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.960
So area is 44 square inches.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.836
Perimeter is 26 inches.

00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:47.210
And that makes
sense because this

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.584
is a two-dimensional
measurement.

00:02:48.584 --> 00:02:50.900
It's measuring something
in two-dimensional space,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.490
so you get a
two-dimensional unit.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.120
This is a one-dimensional
measurement.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.710
It's only asking you,
essentially, how long would

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.520
a string have to be to
go around this thing.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.560
And so that's why you get
one-dimensional units.
