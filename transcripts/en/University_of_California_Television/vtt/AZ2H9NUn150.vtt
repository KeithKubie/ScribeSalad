- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape;
bipedal, naked large-brained. Lone the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:39.300
master of fire, tools and language. But
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.650
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.160
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.150
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:11.360

we got here. An exploration made possible

- [Brenna] Thank you so much for
having me. So, unlike most of your other

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.940
speakers, I actually work with
contemporary humans and not fossils, but I

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.370
will try to maintain your attention
anyway. I am mostly interested in human

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.860
evolution. And as you've noticed from
these diagrams that people have put up

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.650
regarding the phylogeny of Neanderthals
and Denisovans and modern humans, modern

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.210
humans often get represented as sort of
just a single branch, or maybe a few

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.360
genomes that come off this other branch.
And so what I want to do is really take a

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.530
little bit of time and conceptualize what
it means to refer to the Homo sapiens as a

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.690
single species. Did we have a single
origin. There's actually a lot of

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.050
complexity in this question which isn't
necessarily addressed by one of these

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.360
simple tri-part type phylogenies. So,
let's just break down kind of the known

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.580
working model we have for human evolution
which is mostly based on contemporary DNA.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.410
So, if we start out in Africa roughly
about 100,000 years ago. I'm an advocate

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.920
of a Southern African origin. I'm not
going to try to convince you of that

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.140
today, but we actually don't know where in
Africa. There was a single origin of the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.450
Homo sapiens species if indeed it was a
single origin model, all right? And then

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.070
from Southern Africa, putatively, there is
a migration and dispersal into the rest of

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.030
the African continent. And certainly by
60, maybe even slightly earlier, 70,000

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.820
years, there were these individuals living
in Northeastern Africa at which time there

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.060
was what we call a "founder event." So,
these populations moved out of Africa into

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.380
the near East. Now, this event is actually
a major event in human evolution, or at

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.720
least in the genomes of all non-Africans
living today. And that is because there

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.860
was a strong reduction in genetic
diversity during this founder event. And

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.890
that's indicated here by the fat arrow,
okay? So every time you see a fat arrow on

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.630
this map, that indicates a reduction in
genetic diversity. Once humans left

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.660
Africa, these individuals spread rapidly
across the Eurasian continent. There are

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.400
some hypotheses of what they call the
South Indian or South Asian migration

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.800
route which is along the coast of the
Indian subcontinent, and eventually into

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.980
Southeast Asia and Oceania, certainly by
45,000 years ago. As well as additional

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:46.110
migrations into Northern Asia and
eventually into the Americas where it was

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.940
accompanied by yet another strong founder
event or population bottle neck which

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.840
reduced the genetic diversity of those
populations. And we'll hear a little bit

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.030
more about that today from Maria. So
that's our basic model of human evolution

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.760
over the last 100,000 years. But you'll
notice that there's not a lot of detail in

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.030
Africa, actually. There's just a few
arrows and some general little dates.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.690
Geneticists love to put arrows on maps and
I am no exception. So, I'd like to instead

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.780
think about posing this question, "Where
in Africa did humans originate?" And there

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.380
are different types of genetic evidence or
other types of evidence one might use to

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.680
answer this question. And there's a sort
of presentation here. This is by Batini

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.360
and Jobling where they suggest different
types of evidence one could look at. So

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.410
you could look at for example, non-genetic
evidence, skulls that have been

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.560
dug up from the ground by
paleo-anthropologists. You could look at

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.455
evidence of what we call
"symbolic behaviors,"

00:05:48.455 --> 00:05:51.863
such as the making of art,
so shell beads

00:05:51.863 --> 00:05:56.170
or these little crosshatch ocher pieces
that have been discovered. You might even

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:00.960
look at language. So there's a really
fascinating paper from a few years ago

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.400
that looked at phonemic diversity, not
genetic diversity, but looking at the

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.750
number of phonemes in different languages
and can we learn anything about the

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.750
origins of language by the amount of
diversity that's present in phonemes? And

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.930
he argued, indeed, Africa has the highest
phonemic diversity. And in particular even

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.620
Southern African has the highest phonemic
diversity. So I'm a geneticist. I focus on

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.840
a different type of evidence and you can
break down genetic evidence also into

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.160
these little patches. So one might be the
mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA, as

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.810
we've heard from other speakers, is
something that's inherited through the

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.580
maternal lineage. So the mother passes it
on to her children and then it's passed on

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.520
from the daughter to her children.
Alternatively, you could look at the

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:53.960
Y-chromosome which has a different pattern
of inheritance from father to son, and so

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:02.010
on and so on, for many generations. And
then last are what we call the autosomes,

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.800
which are the remainder of the chromosomes
1 through 22 that compose the rest of your

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.920
genome. So when this was done, and this
slide is a little bit dated, but from

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.850
mitochondrial DNA and Y-chromosome DNA, it
was a little bit hard to pin-point

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.450
precisely where the deepest divergence was
within Africa, I'm going to address that

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.520
again later, but at least from the
autosomal information. Both if you look at

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.770
SNPs or a single-nucleotide polymorphism,
just your vanilla mutation. They actually

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:35.590
have the highest genetic diversity, or
heterozygosity, in Southern African

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:41.480
populations and even other types of
polymorphism like microsatellites also

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.710
look like they had the highest diversity
in Southern African populations. And so

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.200
we're getting a lot of conflicting pieces
of information maybe from non-genetic

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.250
evidence, from genetic evidence. So how
can we sort of conceptualize synthesizing

00:07:55.250 --> 00:08:00.530
all this information? So I'm actually an
anthropologist by training, despite the

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.350
fact that I do genetics, and so I like to
sort of begin with the paleo-anthropology

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:09.610
and that's what we're going to do right
now. So there's a fantastic amount of

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:14.580
information that's been excavated from the
fossil record. And some of this

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.380
information comes in the form of bones,
right? Like we've seen earlier on the

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.530
talk. And on the right here, you have a
fossil cranium from Hurso, Ethiopia that

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:28.730
was dug up. And it looks
like...morphologically, it's very similar

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:36.410
to modern humans. So the front part of the
skull is actually tucked in underneath the

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:42.370
brow ridge. The skull is actually pretty
short from front to back. The brain size

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:46.150
is of course equivalent to what you would
see in contemporary human populations

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:50.190
today. And if we put flesh on this
individual, they would probably look

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:56.540
relatively similar to other human sapiens
around the world. However, so we know that

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.970
there was morphologically individuals that
were probably similar to Homo sapiens

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:06.410
walking around Africa at least 150,000
years ago. But in fact there's a lot of

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:11.400
additional information that can be gleamed
from stone tools. So, there is a phrase

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.570
that's called the "middle stone age." And
the middle stone age refers, at least

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:21.390
roughly to 250,000 years ago to 50,000
years ago. And on this other map, what you

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:27.650
see are sites in Africa where middle stone
age artifacts have been recovered. So we

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:33.680
know that hominin populations were living
in these areas of Africa during this time

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.414
period.

00:09:34.414 --> 00:09:38.146
And what you'll notice, right, is that
there is maybe not that many examples of

00:09:38.146 --> 00:09:42.530
this beautifully reconstructed skull from
all over Africa, but there are many, many

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:47.930
geographic locations on this map that
actually date back to the middle stone

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:53.160
age. And so what does that mean? So that
means of course that there were lots of

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.160
hominins walking around the face of Africa
during this time period. And in fact there

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.910
is also good evidence from North Africa as
well, even though it's cut off in this

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:07.420
particular map. And so let's just kind of
make a little schematic and start to think

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:13.640
about this. So if I look back into Africa
150,000 years ago, 200,000 years ago, I

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:19.400
know that there are Homo sapien-like
populations, broadly speaking, that exist

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.560
in different parts of the landscape. And
so we can ask a relatively simple

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.370
question, "Were these populations
structured?" That means, are they

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:33.760
different from one another? So perhaps we
have populations in North Africa, East

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.110
Africa and Southern Africa. There is less
information from Central Africa for

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.780
various reasons. And these environments
may have been very different from one

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.500
another. So you might have had a cool,
Mediterranean climate up in North Africa

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.110
and then a very hot desert-like climate,
let's say, in Southern Africa. And the

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:56.250
question then is, are these populations
really separate from one another? Or are

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.940
individuals moving in between them? So
population geneticists like to refer to

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:06.520
this concept as population structure. So
let me just explain what that is briefly.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:13.350
In this little schematic, we have a SNP,
or a single nucleotide polymorphism up on

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.430
the top that either comes in red or
yellow. And we have two populations on

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.870
either side of this river and we can see
that they are very different from one

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.290
another. So individuals on one side of the
river carry only the red allele, and

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:30.490
individuals on the other side of the river
only carry the yellow allele. And this is

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.680
structured populations, or populations
where there are strong differences in

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:40.140
allele frequency. And this is in contrast,
down to the bottom, of populations which

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:44.600
are carrying both the purple and the
orange alleles because there is migration

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.910
between these two populations or gene
flow, if you refer to your little glossary

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:52.550
on the handout, and this is because I've
given them a nice little bridge so people

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:58.540
can walk across and migrate. So, we
can just sort of take that example and

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.150
apply it to the rest of Africa as well.
So, were these populations structured at

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:07.700
200,000 and 150,000 years ago? Or was
there actually what we call "panmixia" or

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:13.480
lots of migration among the different
sup-populations? And I think we have an

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.750
actual answer to this particular question,
but it's somewhat complicated to infer in

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:24.260
fact. And one thing to point out is that
in either of these scenarios, if you're

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.330
thinking back to what the landscape would
have looked like 200,000 years ago, means

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.640
that if I went and sampled individuals
from across the African landscape, their

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.690
common ancestor, in terms of their
genetics, would have been very old. It

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.820
would actually pre-date 150,000 years ago
or 200,000 years ago. In order to

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:50.890
understand why that is, you have to again
take a little mini-class in population

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.960
genetics here and think about the
difference between populations and genes.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:58.420
So this is what we call a "gene genealogy"
which is represented by these little

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.640
lineages right here. And these lineages
exist within these two different

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:08.530
populations, okay? So we can sort of trace
back the common ancestry of a given

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:15.260
genetic segment to where that individual
shares a common ancestor. And these common

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:19.870
ancestors exist in some ancestral
population which I'm going to then let

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:24.870
evolve through time. So now, we have this
common ancestral population and there's

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:29.270
been some sort of divergence and is
diverging to the blue and orange

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.140
populations. And you can see that these
gene genealogies, these genetic lineages

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:38.180
are sort of splitting nicely into the blue
and orange population. And then finally,

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.930
at the present day, or down here. You
know, I might go and sample individuals

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:47.190
from the orange population, and the blue
population and then ask when their common

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.820
ancestor was, okay? And that common
ancestor is indicated up here just like in

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:56.920
a normal phylogeny. The key thing to
remember actually when you're looking at

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:02.120
that is that the common ancestor pre-dates
the population divergence, okay? And this

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:07.500
is the case for most of the low side that
we would look at in the human genome. So,

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.830
the common ancestor must be older than the
population divergence. So then, we can

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:17.930
ask, "How old are the common genetic
lineages within human population?" So I'm

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:22.450
going to do this for a relatively simple
locus, the Y-chromosome, right? So the

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.930
Y-chromosome again is just passed on
between father and son. And one of the

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:30.500
nice things about the Y-chromosome is that
it's relatively small, so it's easy to go

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:35.760
in and sequence it from many individuals.
So, a few years ago, we captured about 10

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.630
megabases of the Y-chromosome from a
variety of individuals across human

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:45.010
populations and we actually had a strong
focus here on sampling African populations

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.080
because that's what I'm obsessed with, is
African populations. And what you'll see

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.350
is all the African individuals are sort of
on the bottom half of this segment and

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:58.300
you're just looking at a normal gene
genealogy or phylogeny that's been flipped

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.470
on it's side. So the common ancestor is
right here and then each one of these

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.930
lineages represents a single individual's
Y-chromosome that was sampled from a man.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:13.190
Now the first thing obviously to notice is
that individuals from outside of Africa

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.550
have very little genetic diversity on
their Y-chromosomes compared to

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.470
individuals from Africa. And you can
easily see that by their relatively short

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:26.040
branch lengths up here. So these are all
the out of African individuals, okay? So

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.070
people from Cambodia, people from the
Americas, people from Europe and so on.

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:35.570
And instead if I look within Africa, I see
individuals that carry really, really long

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:40.180
branches, okay? So for example,
individuals from West Africa and North

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.060
Africa diverge around here. And
individuals that are from these African

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.410
hunter-gatherer populations, which are
particularly special, carry

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:53.830
extraordinarily long branches all the way
back to the common ancestor. So that graph

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:57.280
can be a little bit hard to read for some
people who are not geneticists so I've

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.860
tried to make a schematic. If we look at
the time to the common ancestor and we try

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:07.400
to date in years how long ago that might
have been, we can kind of put an upper

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:13.180
bound on the population divergence among
all human populations. And so when we do

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:17.040
this with the Y-chromosome, what you
actually see is that the upper bound on

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.620
population divergence would have been
around 150,000 years ago plus or minus a

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.810
couple of tens of thousands of years,
okay? So we're actually seeing relatively

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:32.080
shallow divergence among contemporary
human populations. And with a little bit

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:36.170
of additional modeling we can actually
say, "Well, which population diverged

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:41.120
first from all other human populations and
when was that?" And at least looking at

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.310
the Y-chromosome sequence it's most likely
to have been these Khoisan populations

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:50.860
from Southern Africa and we date it to
approximately around 90,000 years ago.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.060
Now, you could say, "Well that's just the
Y-chromosome. It's just a single locus and

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.790
has this bizarre pattern of inheritance
from father to son." So independently,

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:05.320
there was additional papers published by
Renaut [SP] and also Veeramah

00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:08.770
approximately about a year before we
published our Y-chromosome work, and they

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:12.890
actually independently came up with a very
similar estimate on this time of

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:17.530
population divergence between these
Southern African hunter-gatherer groups

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:23.010
and the other humans within Africa. And
that time of population divergence is

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:27.550
approximately 100,000 to 120,000 years
ago. So again, what you're seeing is that

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:32.780
the gene genealogies certainly go back in
time, but the actual time depth of this

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:38.220
population divergence is quite shallow,
okay? And if we try to map that on to

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:43.730
these sort of schematics of Africa, what
would that mean? It means that neither of

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:49.800
those two maps that I showed you before
could really represent the actual true

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.690
ancestors to the human population. So
something must have happened to reduce the

00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:00.210
genetic diversity between 200,000 years
ago and 100,000 years ago. And so let's

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.080
just think for a moment what that might
have been or what that could have looked

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.570
like. So one hypothesis could be that
there was a strong population bottle-neck

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:13.380
during this time period, 200,000 to
100,000 years ago. And maybe that

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.310
bottle-neck was associated for example
with climate. So populations actually

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:22.700
could have moved from one region to
another because of climatic fluctuation.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:26.050
And in this case, I've had all the
individuals that are living in Eastern

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:30.760
Africa and Northern Africa just sort of
trickle down and move into Southern Africa

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:35.520
where things were nicer during that time
period. That doesn't have to necessarily

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:40.290
be the only location, it's just one
example. This movement into a refugium

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:45.050
would likely have been accompanied by a
population bottle-neck as you can imagine.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:50.270
If things are stressful in a given
environment then usually what we see is a

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:53.910
reduction in population size. Conversely,
you could also think about it in a

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:59.490
slightly different way, maybe there was
some stressful climatic experience and

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:03.770
that these other populations simply went
extinct, okay? So you have local

00:19:03.770 --> 00:19:08.640
extinction events for example here in
Eastern Africa, or Northern Africa, and

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:13.930
only a population persists in one
geographic region again indicated here by

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:19.280
these little Xs in Southern Africa. Then
what would have happened, right? So then

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:25.620
at a 100,000 years ago, we know humans
began expanding again. So if they did sort

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.960
of localize to one specific place on the
African continent, what would that then

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:31.621
look like?

00:19:31.621 --> 00:19:37.342
They would have expanded into these
other regions again but maybe they absorb

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:41.690
individuals that persisted there. So maybe
there wasn't complete extinction events in

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:46.990
these other geographic regions, or indeed
maybe all these individuals that were

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:51.630
living in Eastern and Northern Africa did
completely go extinct and we don't see

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:57.720
their signatures in the human genome. So
this I want to sort of end by emphasizing

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:03.560
that this is a single origin model for the
modern human species, but it fits the data

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:09.280
actually quite nicely because of this
shallow divergence we see in the genetic

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.130
lineages. And I will emphasize that there
is a lot of additional sequencing that

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.100
needs to be done particularly in African
populations were we probably have the

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:22.740
fewest samples of full human genomes that
have been sequenced. And we really need to

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:27.570
actually think explicitly about testing
these models in a context that connects

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.570
the genetic data with the
paleo-anthropological information. And I

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:35.507
will stop right there. Thank you very
much.

00:20:37.297 --> 00:20:40.297
♪ [music] ♪

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.320
- [Johannes ] So thanks for the
invitation. So I would like to talk today

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.700
about a more recent chapter in human
history. So we have heard a lot about the

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:57.270
early chapters of human history today
about the early evolution of modern humans

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:01.730
in Africa and also about the interaction
between archaic humans and early modern

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:07.880
humans. But I would like to talk today and
turn our focus from the ice age, the

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:13.100
Pleistocene, into the Holocene into the
last 10,000 years of human history and I

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:17.230
try to convince you that this is also an
extremely exciting time period where we

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:22.100
even see a lot of changes even in human
evolution into human phenotype in several

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:27.840
parts of the world. So as I mentioned,
we're actually living today in this time

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:33.140
period, the Holocene which is a time
period of relative climate stability, some

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:37.400
people might even say that we have
actually changed our environment so much

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.360
that we're now living in a time period
which we call the Anthropocene which might

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.870
have started in the last 2,000 years but
the main focus of this talk should really

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:51.760
be the Holocene, so the last 10,000 years
of human history. Most of this time period

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:56.150
actually we do not have historical
documents so we have no information that

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:01.170
people wrote down about human history in
this last 10,000 years where we usually

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.350
have to rely on archeological information
for example, or paleo-anthropological

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.580
findings, so human skeletons for example
that might tell us something about things

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:14.790
that changed in the past the same thing
for example like migration, genetic

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:20.680
admixture or the genetic turnover of the
human population. But we and others have

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:27.100
actually started in the last few years to
use genetic data to tell us something

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:33.550
about changes that happened recently in
our evolution or in human history and I

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:38.290
would like to focus my talk today about
one event that archeologists had already

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:43.330
identified many years ago and that is
probably the biggest change in human

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:48.420
history that happened in the last few
million years and it's actually the change

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:54.060
from the subsistence strategy of hunting
and gathering, to Neolithic farmers that

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:58.580
relied on agriculture and started to
domesticate animals. And this revolution,

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:03.540
this big change in human history is called
the Neolithic Revolution. So this

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:08.280
Neolithic Revolution stared in central
Europe about seven and half thousand years

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.620
ago and in other parts of the world a few
thousand years earlier and a few thousand

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:18.640
years later. But this big change is really
the cornerstone of our modern civilization

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:23.240
because it provided people then with
resources that actually allow us to

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:28.680
sustain millions and even billions of
people today and that basically came with

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:32.070
this big change from this foraging
lifestyle to this early farming lifestyle.

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:37.510
What archeologist have debated for more
than 100 years now is whether this

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:44.330
change of subsistence strategy from
foraging to farming was actually related

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:50.260
due to the spread of ideas and culture. So
was it just cultured ideas that were

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:55.000
passed on from village or from region to
region or was it actually people that were

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.770
bringing agriculture to different parts of
the world. For example, to central Europe

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:05.000
about 7,000 years ago. So this big
question, was it pots or people that

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.890
basically then spread agriculture and into
Europe other parts of the world. And

00:24:10.890 --> 00:24:15.600
this question is very hard to address just
based on archeological artifacts for

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.940
example or anthropological findings
because it is very difficult to really see

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:25.140
if biological identity of people changes
just based on archeological artifact. And

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.640
this is actually a question which is much
easier to address if we look at genetic

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.830
data. So if we look at the DNA, if we look
at the genetic make up of the people

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:38.740
because it makes very clear predictions
for this two different hypothesis, whether

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.520
it was ideas that were spreading during
that time or whether it was actually

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:47.960
people. So if we assume that ideas and
culture was for example spreading and

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.960
agriculture, we would expect that there
would be direct genetic continuity between

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:58.420
for example the first people that lived in
Europe, foragers 10,000 years ago, and

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.300
then the first Neolithic people and then
the people that live in Europe today. So

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:08.190
you would see genetic continuity if it was
just the spread of ideas. However if it

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:13.330
was actually people spreading agriculture,
for example, into Europe we would expect

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:19.610
the genetic discontinuity, something
that's called "demic diffusion," we would

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:24.270
actually see that people would then for
example come to Europe and change the

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:28.800
genetic structure so new genes would
arrive for example in Europe. And we and

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.690
many others have tried to address this
question based on mitochondria but as you

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.530
have seen in some of the previous talks,
mitochondrial DNA can be quite decisive.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.110
So therefore we have decided then in the
last few years to actually study whole

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:47.500
genomes of early farmers as well as late
hunter-gatherers, so ancient foragers, to

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.330
study this question whether there was
actually genetic change of people when

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:55.350
agriculture was introduced to Europe, or
whether there was direct genetic

00:25:55.350 --> 00:26:00.310
continuity. So we have sequenced genomes
of about 12 early hunter-gatherers some

00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:05.150
years ago and combined that with data sets
that had been provided by other people,

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:08.630
for example like the Iceman genome. This
famous

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:13.470
Tyrolean mummy that was discovered a few
years ago and was actually frozen for

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:18.640
about 5,000 years in the Alps. As well as
a genome from a hunter-gatherer that was

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.580
found here in Spain some years ago. And we
then compared those ancient human genomes

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:29.600
with the genome of about 2,000 people that
come from various populations, about 200

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.740
populations in the world today with the
data set that is called the "Human

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.700
Origins" data set that is based genome
wide data of now up to 5,000 people from

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:42.780
many different populations in the world.
If you then take genomic data from ancient

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.510
modern people and you want to compare
that, you can imagine you have heard those

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:51.040
genomes are really big, there's a lot of
data and one way to break down this data

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.450
into two dimensions that you can actually
look at is a so-called principal component

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:59.310
analysis, where you basically take this
genetic information from all those people

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.640
and break it down into two most
informative components, principal

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.770
component one and two. And if you do that
for modern people, you get those

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.910
beautiful, colorful clouds that you see
here. And actually if you look at the

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:17.370
right cloud here, this cloud is actually
people that live today in Northern Africa,

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:21.510
in the near East as well as in the
Caucasus. We actually see this climb that

00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:26.880
stretches from Northern Africa into the
Caucasus. Those populations here are

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.270
populations that live in Europe today. So
people that live for example in Iberia,

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:37.620
France, Central Europe as well as Great
Britain or Russia. What you actually see

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.040
here almost resembles geography. If you
imagine this as kind of the Northern

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:46.030
African coast, this is in near East, here
could be the Black Sea, this could be the

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:49.960
Mediterranean. So it could be an isolation
by distance, people moved into those

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:55.050
places and then basically genetically
slowly changed over time. However, if we

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:59.510
now look at our ancient individuals, our
ancient foragers as well as the early

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:04.620
farmers from 7,000 years ago, we first see
that our ancient foragers are genetically

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.130
actually quite distinct from the people
that live in Europe today. Now there seems

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.480
to have been not a strong continuity
between the ancient foragers and modern

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.000
Europeans. So basically no modern
Europeans that live today that looked

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.750
genetically like ancient foragers. This is
actually different for the ancient

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:25.400
farmers. So those 7,000 year old farmers
from Central Europe they actually do

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.710
cluster with populations that live in
Europe today. You could see this little

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:33.810
green cloud here. If you look at this
cloud, this is actually people that live

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:39.270
in Sardinia today. And this was already
discovered when the Iceman genome was

00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:43.010
sequenced some years ago. The colleagues
actually found that the Iceman looked

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:46.650
genetically very similar to people that
live in Sardinia today, and that actually

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.860
made them also to hypothesize that maybe
he was some sort of tourist from Sardinia

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:59.130
that had gotten lost in the Alps and just
died there and froze to death. Today we

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:02.730
actually know that this was not quite the
case because we now have genomic data from

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:07.090
many early farmers, from Scandinavia, from
Iberia, from Central Europe, from Southern

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:10.920
Europe and they all cluster together with
Sardinians. So it is not that they all

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.970
come from Sardinia, it is rather that
modern Sardinians look genetically like

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:19.790
early farmers. But what you then also see
is that people that live in Europe today

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:24.880
are not just a simple mixture between
those ancient populations, so the foragers

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.840
and the farmers, we actually stretch all
the way up here and if you can actually

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.320
see those little diamonds up there, that
some more ancient genomes which are on

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.960
this plot that are actually populations
which we call "Ancient North Eurasians"

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.740
which are best represented by people that
lived about 10,000 20,000 years ago in

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.890
Siberia. For example, one child that was
sequenced by the group in Copenhagen from

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:51.690
Lake Baykal which is called the Malta
child. So you see that modern Europeans

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:58.340
seem to be a mixture between those three
ancient genetic populations. But what is

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.970
also very clear is that if you look at
that, neither the ancient farmer nor the

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:08.260
ancient forager seem to have this North
Eurasian component. This North Eurasian

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:12.430
one is actually quite distinct and we
wanted to find out when did this ancient

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:17.080
North Eurasian component arrive in
Europe. To do that, we teamed up with

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.230
David Rice's team as well as Svante Pääbo
and collected also data from the team in

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:27.190
Copenhagen and now put together a data set
of about 230 ancient human genomes that

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:32.120
span 8,000 years of European history to
see when the kind of different genetic

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:37.620
components over the last 8,000 years
formed. So now we actually go forward in

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:42.970
time starting about 8,000 years ago and
look at the genetic structure of Europe.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:47.270
What you see here in the background, those
gray dots, are the modern populations and

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:51.480
those are the ancient individuals. So the
first thing you observe if you look at the

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:56.220
ancient foragers, so the indigenous
Europeans or Western Eurasians, you see

00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:00.650
that they form this little cloud here and
that there's a gradient from the west to

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:04.610
the east. So this was the genetic
structure of the hunter-gatherers that

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:10.560
lived in Europe about 8,000 years ago. If
you look at the same time into the region

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:15.640
here which is Turkey today, Anatolia, you
can see that the Anatolians at that time,

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.700
they already practiced agriculture, so
they are Neolithic, so they're early

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.130
farmers. They're genetically, actually,
quite distinct from those Europeans that

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:28.660
lived at the same time in Europe. If we
then move ahead in the next thousand

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:34.080
years, agriculture comes to Europe and
suddenly when you look at the people that

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:37.660
lived in Europe at the time, they look
exactly like those Anatolian Neolithic

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.609
farmers. So it seems very clear now that
those Neolithic patches actually spread

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.360
with those people because Europeans
suddenly looked like that and not look

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.090
like that anymore. So there is very strong
evidence now that there was this

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:54.850
discontinuity of the people, that
genetically there was this large change of

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.750
people at that time period about
seven and half thousand years ago in

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.640
Central Europe. If now move in the next
2,000 years of human history in Europe, we

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:07.780
can actually see that the population
structure doesn't really change so much.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.570
Genetically, people look again quite
similar to those early farmers from

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.480
Anatolia but you could actually see a
little bit of this movement in this

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.670
direction and this is indeed something
that we observe that there seems to be a

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:23.220
bit of genetic admixture with the
hunter-gatherers that lived in Europe at

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.460
the time, probably still in mountain
ranges and in regions where agriculture

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.750
was not favorable. So there was a bit of
genetic admixture between those early

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:36.250
farmers and the hunter-gatherers that were
living in Europe. However, again, this is

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:40.750
modern Europeans. They're not really
somewhere down here, so what's happening?

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:46.080
We should kind of look a bit more to the
East, and this is the same time period

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:50.370
that we just looked at in Central Europe
now looking at Eastern Europe so looking

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:54.250
at the populations which are found here,
this north of the Black Sea, or the

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:59.110
Caspian Sea. We can actually see that this
population which is Neolithic or Bronze

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:03.300
Age are steppe populations. So those are
also agriculturalists but they are not

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.100
sedentary but pastoralists, so they're
herding for example cows. And this

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:12.980
population is very homogenous stretching
all kind of this region here and again

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.820
they are kind of falling up here quite
distinct from the early farmers of Europe

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:20.820
also quite distinct from the
hunter-gatherers. And you can actually see

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:25.180
they are also pretty close to this
Eneolithic individuals here which are

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:28.270
actually late hunter-gatherers from this
region. But they are a bit more stretched

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:32.650
in this direction in fact and there seems
to be something hiding here and something

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:37.420
I don't really have the time to talk today
about but that would be a different

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:42.090
chapter in human history. But what's now
going on with the modern Europeans that

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:47.350
live today in Central Europe? When does
their genetic make up actually form? And

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:51.600
this is actually been happening about
4,800 years ago, 4,800 years ago and

00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:58.960
suddenly you have a major shift in the
genetic structure of Europe. So if we move

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:03.050
now to this time period 4,800 years ago to
about 3,000 years ago, suddenly you have

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:07.460
people in Central Europe that looked like
people that live in Central Europe today.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:11.440
So they are a genetic mixture of this
steppe component that we have in the

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:16.260
Bronze Age here in the steppe, as well as
this early and middle Neolithic people

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.110
that you had in Central Europe at that
time. So there seems to be a massive event

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.900
of migration. Suddenly you see this
massive shift and you don't only observe

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:28.290
that in Central Europe and in Southern
Europe but you even observe that in

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:32.640
Central Asia as well as in the Altai,
there seems to be a very strong evidence

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:37.440
now for a large migration. We can then
also quantify those genetic components in

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.520
the different populations that live in
Europe today. So those three ancestral

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:46.380
components the early foragers, the early
farmers, as well as this steppe

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.310
pastoralists. You can actually see there
is a climb, so populations that live in

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:54.270
Northern Europe today or Northeastern
Europe they have quite a high amount of

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:58.380
steppe ancestry and quite a low amount of
early farmer ancestry. Whereas the people

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:03.110
that live in Sardinia today have almost
exclusively early farmer ancestry as I've

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:08.820
shown you before and very, very little
ancestry here from the steppe. And if we

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:13.180
look at the ancient populations, you can
actually see that if you move from back in

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:17.430
time towards today, you can see that early
on we have this really strong component of

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:22.530
early farmer ancestry from Anatolia. Over
time you have a little bit of this forager

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:27.350
indigenous European admixture that seems
to happen over the next few thousand

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:31.820
years. But then 4,800 years ago we
suddenly have this green component coming

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:37.060
in, the steppe component. In Central
Europe we actually see about a 70%

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:42.590
replacement of the local agriculturalists
happening 4,800 years ago, an event that

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:46.320
actually no archeologists or
paleo-anthropologists had predicted so

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.980
far. So there seems to have really a mass
migration at the end of the Neolithic. So

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:56.990
in summary, what we can say is that
agriculture likely spread from the near

00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:01.850
East through Anatolia into Central Europe,
starting about 7,000 to 8,000 years ago.

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:07.250
So it was actually people coming to Europe
introducing agriculture. What we also have

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:10.970
then, when the agriculturalists are
spreading in different parts of Europe or

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:15.560
into Scandinavia in the next 2,000 years,
Great Britain as well as to Iberia, there

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.370
seem to have a bit of genetic admixture
with the local hunter-gatherers that are

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:24.020
still present in Europe that time. And
then in the late Neolithic, about four and

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:29.010
a half to 5,000 years ago, we have this
what seems to be massive migration coming

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:32.720
from this region here from a culture which
is called the Yamnaya, which is

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.540
genetically extremely close with people
that have a culture which is called the

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.790
Corded Ware that stretches all the way up
to the Baltic as well into Switzerland

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:45.770
here and into Western Europe. So there was
this massive migration which expanded into

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:50.550
the West here, into Central Europe as well
as into the other direction, into the

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:55.560
Altai Mountains. One of the big questions
we currently have is how was that

00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:01.490
possible? We can easily explain why there
was this first migration of agriculture to

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:05.540
Europe because you could imagine that
agriculture can sustain a much bigger

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:09.350
population so the first people that
brought agriculture to Europe probably had

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:14.280
a much bigger population size. But then
how was it possible that 5,000 years ago,

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:19.060
those early farmers were replaced by other
farmers? So what did those farmers have

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.350
when they came here that kind of made them
able to replace the people that lived in

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.620
Central Europe? And we don't really have a
good explanation currently but our

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:29.850
colleagues from Copenhagen recently
published a study where they could

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:34.040
actually find that in those people that
came to Europe, they actually found

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:39.730
Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of
plague, which is actually quite incredible

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:43.600
but it seems that during this time about
four and half thousand years ago, plague

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.200
was for the first time introduced to
Europe, potentially causing a pandemic and

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.670
you could imagine if we have a pandemic,
like for example during the Black Death

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:55.700
where 50% of the people in Europe died. If
something like that happened five and half

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.850
thousand years ago, it could open an
ecological niche so people could actually

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:03.980
move in and then replace the local
farmers. Just briefly what we could also

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.220
do is we could actually also look at the
genetic and phenotypic change through

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.540
time. We could actually look at different
phenotypes, how they change over the last

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.140
8,000 years, to look at evolution
basically and see, too. What

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:19.490
we saw was actually quite surprising that
the first Europeans or the Europeans that

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:23.660
lived about 8,000 years ago, the
hunter-gatherers, they actually had a very

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.800
distinct phenotype from people that live
in Europe today. They actually have dark

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:31.670
skin and blue eyes, all of them. You can
actually see that 100% frequency of those

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:36.020
foragers had blue eyes and dark skin. So
that actually goes down blue eyes

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:39.470
frequency then was the early
agriculturalists and then spreads again in

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:45.020
the last few thousand years. And actually
light skin that we have so typically in

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:50.470
Europe today is in low frequency even in
the early farmers but only starts to

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.240
spread in the Bronze Age. So this
phenotype which is so typical for

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:57.330
Europeans, this light skin, seems to be
only about 4,000 years old, so actually

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:02.290
quite a recent chapter in our evolution.
What we could also show which was quite

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:07.390
interesting is the ability to digest milk
during adulthood, so lactase-resistance.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:11.580
That's a phenotype that a lot of people
attributed to the early agriculturalists,

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:15.780
that basically those people that had cows
were for sure then also able to drink a

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.200
lot of milk. But actually the frequency in
those people of this gene is actually

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:23.530
zero. So they didn't have it. And it only
appears then during the Bronze Age and it

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.130
really spreads only in the last 3,000
years. And we're not even sure when it

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:30.690
happened during antiquity, during the
Medieval time or maybe in the last few

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:35.540
hundred years. I'd like to end and
summarize that the Neolithic revolution is

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.440
really a diffusion of people, it was
people coming to Europe. Those people

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.680
brought genes, potentially new phenotype,
but they also brought new diseases and

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.920
that's actually quite exciting, quite
interesting the first evidence we have of

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:51.380
that. What we also can say now is it was
not just one migration, it was not just

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.640
those people from the near East that
brought agriculture but there was a second

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:58.640
large migration about 5,000 years ago.
Again, we're not really sure why it was

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:03.250
triggered but the introduction of diseases
is one possibility. So with that, I'd like

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.870
to thank a lot of collaboration partners
for the first paper that I mentioned,

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:11.740
mostly of course David Rice and his team,
but also Svante Paabo and his group in

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:16.270
Leipzig. The second study I presented, it
was coordinated actually with Copenhagen

- [Maria] I was very ambitious
when I decided this title. And it's not

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:51.210
going to be covered all of it in 20
minutes for sure. But I'll try to cover as

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:55.180
much as possible and give you an idea of
what we know about the genetic history of

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.920
the Americas, mostly informed by ancient
DNA studies. So the last continent to

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.130
be...the Americas was the last continent
to be settled by humans and many questions

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:08.870
have been debated as to where did the
first people to enter the Americas came

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:14.370
from, when did they come to the
Americas, through what route, and if there

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.990
was one major or two major or three major
migrations into the Americas. So there has

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:23.370
been a lot of debate and attempts to
answer these questions. And many fields

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:28.550
have contributed to the discussion and
genetics has been very important but it

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:30.960
has received contributions as well from
linguistics, archeology,

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:36.950
paleo-anthropology, paleo-climate and
other disciplines. And it is now kind of

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:43.270
agreed that the first people to enter the
continent did so from Siberia, Northeast

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:49.570
Asia, through Beringia around 15,000 years
ago. And we set that date because the

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:54.440
oldest human occupation site in the
Americas is Monte Verde which is here in

00:41:54.440 --> 00:42:02.230
Chile. And this human occupation site is
dated to 14,000 to 14,500 years old. So

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:07.800
the people who first entered the continent
had to do so before then and like allowing

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:14.880
of time for people to get here. So ancient
DNA has contributed a lot to understanding

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.090
exactly how this happened, how people
moved through the continent and where did

00:42:19.090 --> 00:42:24.290
they come from. And we don't have
thousands or hundreds of ancient genomes,

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:30.730
we have only a handful from the Americas.
So I will try to give you some of the

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:36.250
insights that we've gained from studying
ancient Native American genomes. So the

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:42.280
first one is this genome from the Anzick
boy where some remains found here in

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:49.010
Montana and where they dated to around
12,600 years old. And they were found in

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:53.300
association with these fluted stone spear
points which were part of the Clovis

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:57.260
culture. And as far as I know, these are
the only remains that have been found in

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:01.350
association to these tools. So this
allowed the opportunity to investigate

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:07.900
like the genetic affinities of a Clovis
culture by studying the genome. When the

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:12.530
genome was sequenced and compared to human
populations around the globe, like

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:17.460
contemporary populations around the globe,
this heat map, flash map was generated

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:23.200
which basically shows in warmer colors the
population, each circle is a population.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:27.520
So in warmer colors, you have the
populations that have the highest genetic

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.320
history sharing. So, the first thing that
was observed by sequencing this 12,000

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:38.880
year old individual was that most Native
Americans, basically all Native Americans

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:44.480
are more similar to this individual than
any other population in the world. And

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:48.460
most interestingly, it was found that even
though it was found like in the northern

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:53.680
part of the Americas, it was more closely
related or have more genetic affinity to

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:59.250
Central and South American contemporary
individuals, Native Americans actually.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:04.150
And this already gave us an idea about
kind of the structure that was occurring

00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:10.740
in the Americas back then. And together
with these observations and other

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:15.960
statistical analyses, the authors of these
study which I should mention Morten

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:22.020
Rasmussen who did this between Copenhagen
and Stanford. Well, they came up with this

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:28.020
model in which there was a divergence
predating the 12,000 years old of this

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:35.530
ancient genome. A divergence between the
Northern Native Americans and the Southern

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:40.023
Native Americans. And that Anzick would be
sitting here.

00:44:40.023 --> 00:44:45.770
So, this genome was very
insightful in that it

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:51.450
gave us an idea of some
early population structure in the Americas

00:44:51.450 --> 00:45:00.560
predating the age of this genome. And it
also gave us the idea that most Native

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:05.920
Americans today are descendant of a
population related to this

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:12.720
Clovis-associated genome. A second genome
that was sequenced just recently and

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:19.060
published recently and the source of a lot
of debate was that of the Kennewick Man.

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:25.240
The remains of this individual were found
in the Kennewick area in Washington state.

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:29.560
And they were dated to 8,500 years. And
there was... Again, this is a study by

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:36.680
Morten Rasmussen. This was a source of a
lot of controversy because the first

00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:41.620
analysis on the skeletal remains and
particularly on the morphology of the

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:46.080
skull. So the scientists who did this
first analysis they said that the

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:51.230
morphology of the skull was more similar
to contemporary individuals of Southeast

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:59.400
Asia and Polynesians. So, what that led
to was the owners of the land, which was

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.190
actually the US Army, not giving the
remains to the Native American tribes who

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:09.440
were claiming these remains for reburial.
And that was just based on the scientist

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.350
who drew these conclusions on the
morphology of the skull alone. So of

00:46:14.350 --> 00:46:18.460
course, there was a lot of scientific
debate. And because the first attempts to

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:24.860
extract DNA were unsuccessful, there was a
lot of controversy and litigation for many

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:30.990
years, at least nine years. But finally
this group in Copenhagen, they're very

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:37.150
good at this, were given the opportunity
to try again to do some genetic analysis.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:42.240
And they were able to sequence an entire
genome of the Kennewick Man. So the very

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:47.030
first observation is that it actually
falls within Native American variation,

00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:52.800
just like that. And so this is a BCA plot
similar to what Johannes just showed. And

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.360
these are contemporary Native Americans,
these are populations from the rest of the

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.410
world, this is Europe. So, that was the
first result, this individual is Native

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:09.250
American. And when looking at the genetic
affinities within America, it was shown

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:14.540
something similar to what was shown for
the Anzick individual. It shares more

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:21.290
genetic history with Central, North and
South Americans than with other Native

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:24.910
Americans from the North, even though it
was found here. But it was also

00:47:24.910 --> 00:47:29.520
interesting to find that tribes for the
same area where the Kennewick Man was

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:40.060
found, also shared a high level of genetic
ancestry with the Kennewick Man. So this

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:43.440
was like another piece of evidence about
the past genetic structure in the

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.480
Americas. So again, with this observation
and more sophisticated statistical

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:53.830
methods, what this study proposed was
that, so this was the original branching

00:47:53.830 --> 00:47:59.110
between Northern Native Americans and
Southern Native Americans. The Anzick sits

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:04.720
here as an ancestor to modern South and
Central Native Americans. But there was

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:12.410
another branching here, and Kennewick is
here, that gave rise to Pacific Northwest

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:19.150
Native Americans. But there was a follow
by some gene flow from East Asia that

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:23.580
probably obscures a little bit the genetic
affinity of the Kennewick to the Pacific

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:28.060
Northwest Native Americans. So this was a
very important contribution and not only

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:32.990
gave us insights about the past genetic
structure of the Americas, but it also

00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:39.210
helped resolve this controversy about
whether Kennewick Man was Native American

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:43.831
or not. And now, just an additional report
supporting this was published

00:48:43.831 --> 00:48:45.446
three days ago probably.

00:48:45.446 --> 00:48:50.550
So we could hopefully put an end
to this litigation and these

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:54.510
remains...well, we don't know because many
tribes are claiming the remains so maybe

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:58.520
there will be yet another debate. But
anyway, this is what we learned from the

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:06.270
scientific standpoint. And the third
genome I will tell you about is this from

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:09.950
the Saqqaq Paleo-Eskimo, which is very
interesting because it was sequenced from

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:14.590
a tuft of hair and this hair was preserved
for around 4,000 years in the present

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:20.690
permafrost in Southwest Greenland. And
this is an artistic reconstruction of the

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:26.550
individual based on genotype, like
phenotypic information that was taken from

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:32.290
the genome that was sequenced. So this was
actually the first ancient human genome to

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:37.140
be sequenced and again, this was done in
Copenhagen by Morten Rasmussen and

00:49:37.140 --> 00:49:41.880
colleagues. So what we learned about this
genome was also very interesting. So the

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:47.670
Saqqaq individual was found here but the
genetic affinity surprisingly, or not to

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:53.670
some, are not to modern contemporary
Greenlanders. So this individual is

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:58.740
genetically more similar to individuals
from Siberia like Chukchi and Koryaks

00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:04.020
here. So what this indicated is that there
was probably a past migration like

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:08.940
predating 4,000 years ago, probably 5,000
to 6,000 years, a migration from Northeast

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:16.130
Asia to the Americas that was later
replaced by a population that gave rise to

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:22.030
modern day Inuits. So these are like three
single genome studies, but thanks to the

00:50:22.030 --> 00:50:26.300
development in next generation sequencing
we have been able to generate now multi-

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:33.020
or... Well, yes, complete or semi-complete
genomes from different individuals more

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:38.200
than just one at a time. So we generated
some genomic data from multiple

00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.660
individuals to test one particular
hypothesis. This was part of a larger

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:47.540
study but my contribution was testing
this Paleo-American relics hypothesis.

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:53.220
So, again, based on this morphology of the
skull, it was suggested that the very

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:57.980
first people to enter the Americas and for
which we have remains like for example,

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:01.940
Lucia from the Lagoa Santa and
the Penan] woman which are really,

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:05.700
really old, that the morphology of this
skull is more similar to present day

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:12.040
people from Melanesia. Some scientists
suggest that there was a first migration

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:17.430
of people with this Paleo-American skull
that was later replaced completely by

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:23.010
Siberia, like the first migration I
mentioned. And that there was a complete

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:30.200
wipeout and replacement. But that there
were some relic populations because based

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.560
on the morphology of the skull of some
individuals who are in isolated parts of

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:37.210
the continent like the Pericos in the tip
of Baja, California and the

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:42.260
Fuego-Patagonians here, these had a
particular skull morphology that resembles

00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:47.080
also Austra-Melanesians. So this was a
theory and we wanted to test it. So we

00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:53.260
sequenced partial genomes from 17
individuals from these supposedly a relict

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:58.430
populations. And what we found, we
were actually expecting this already, was

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:02.030
that they all fall within Native American
variations, so there was no evidence of

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:07.230
any connection to Austra-Melanesia
whatsoever. But more interestingly is that

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:13.140
we observe a genetic continuity with
modern populations in the same geographic

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:20.580
area. For example, the people from
Fuego-Patagonia in PCA space, they fall in

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:26.730
proximity to present day Fuego-Patagonians
from Chile, so they [inaudible 00:52:26]

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:32.560
from Chile. And similar in Mexico. The
Pericos from Mexico not only fell within

00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:39.110
the native variation in Mexico, but they
did so with Northern population from

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:43.630
Mexico. So we were able to pin down that
they were very closely similar to

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:49.750
Tarahumara and Purépecha which are
Northern Native groups in Mexico. Well,

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:54.470
first we just disprove this idea of relict
Paleo-Americans. And secondly we

00:52:54.470 --> 00:53:00.300
demonstrated that there is this genetic
continuity. And actually we observed this

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:05.210
in many samples now, in many genomes that
have been sequenced. And we observed so,

00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:08.540
as I showed a little bit with the
Kennewick Man that had genetic affinity to

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:14.600
populations from the same geographic area.
But we've observed through almost 8,000

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:19.150
years so we have different genomes from
different ages here. And what we've

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:24.230
observed continuously is that there seems
to be this genetic continuity in the

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:30.530
Americas, and that is in contrast with
what Johannes just showed of these massive

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:35.650
demographic shifts. So the Americas, at
least Central and South America, the

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:39.830
Northern part seems to be a bit more
complex, but at least Central and South

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:45.950
have been kind of very stable for many
thousands of years, so that's interesting.

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:49.330
A question that hasn't been resolved quite
yet is if there were three or two

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:54.790
migration waves into the Americas.
Different groups with different data sets

00:53:54.790 --> 00:54:01.620
from modern populations support one or the
other. So there is one model that...there

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:06.700
was one major migration that gave rise to
most Native Americans followed by a second

00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:12.670
and a third that were mostly just Northern
Native Americans. And there is another

00:54:12.670 --> 00:54:17.650
model that instead of suggesting a second
migration, suggests that there was

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:22.300
divergence within America of a Northern
and a Southern branch and that this

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:27.200
occurred within America approximately
13,000 years ago. And something that has

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.440
been a bit puzzling for us who study
genetic diversity in the Americas is the

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:38.830
observation by two independent studies of
something that looks like gene flow from

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:43.850
Austra-Melanesians or Papua New Guinians,
or population related to contemporary

00:54:43.850 --> 00:54:48.650
Papua New Guinians and Melanesians, into
populations in the Amazonian, like the

00:54:48.650 --> 00:54:54.830
Xavante, Suruí and Karitiana. And two
independent studies have identified this

00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:59.310
signal, although yet we don't have a good
explanation of how or when this happened.

00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:07.030
So it's very puzzling actually. And just
for the last part, I want to make the

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:10.330
point that so far I just talked about the
peopling of the Americas but there's

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:17.200
actually much more genetic history in the
recent 15,000 years of course. So I think

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.180
we can use ancient DNA to investigate, or
a combination of ancient and modern DNA,

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:27.960
to investigate other regional aspects of
the history of the Americas. An example

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:32.580
here, for example is the peopling of the
Caribbean. By it's location you can argue

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:36.920
it could have been people from Florida,
from the Yucatan peninsula or from South

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:42.640
America. And now combining data from
modern population, modern Caribbean

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:47.150
population and studying the Native
American fraction of this population and

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:53.190
comparing to reference panel of Native
Americans, it has been suggested that it

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:58.026
was people, actually, by South America
here, facilitated by the Orinoco River.

00:55:58.026 --> 00:56:00.059
And we have been able to

00:56:00.059 --> 00:56:06.750
kind of prove this with
ancient genomes from Taino genomes. And

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:11.370
I'm just showing here an example of one
sample from Cuba, from Chorro de Maita,

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:16.330
Cuba which also falls in the genetic
variation of Arawakan speakers, like

00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:20.700
Wahiro, Piapoco and Ticuna. So this is
another way we're complimenting

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:24.860
information from modern and ancient
population to resolve a question about the

00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:30.230
particular event in history. And I'm also
doing something on the same lines. I don't

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:34.240
have the time to tell you more about it
but we're doing something similar in the

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:40.070
peopling of the Patagonia, like the very
last part that was people in the Americas.

00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:45.200
And lastly, I want to make the point that
we can also use ancient DNA even in

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:49.970
historical times, but for events in
history where the historical record is

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:56.080
sparse. So, I'll just show you an example
where we used ancient DNA to learn about

00:56:56.080 --> 00:57:00.220
the past history of people brought to the
Americas as a result of the Trans-Atlantic

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:05.530
Slave Trade. You can argue that there is
historical records about this, but this

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:10.580
exact origins of people in Africa that
were brought to the Americas that was

00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:14.560
basically not recorded, it's kind of
absent in the historical record. So we can

00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:20.520
also use ancient DNA to reconstruct some
of this history. So in this, very quickly,

00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:24.570
it was a pilot study where we had three
individuals from the Caribbean and we

00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:28.710
wanted to know where in Africa were they
from. They were found in the same burial

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:34.630
site. And by comparing to a reference
panel in Africa, we sequenced fractions of

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:38.950
their genomes, we were able to find that
one of them was more closely related to

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:44.290
Bantu-speaking populations. And two of
them were more closely related to

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:47.620
non-Bantu-speaking populations and we had
evidence to argue that this three people

00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:52.970
were put in the same embarkation and
brought to the Americas together. But we

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:58.270
are really missing information about how
culturally diverse were the people who

00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:03.650
were brought from Africa to the Americas.
So, just to summarize, most Native

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:06.800
Americans...because I went through
something very general like the peopling

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:11.230
of the Americas to something super
specific about an episode in history. But

00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:16.240
I want you to take this messages home. So
most Native Americans trace their

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:22.300
ancestry to a single migration from East
Asia to Beringia between 15,000 and 20,000

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:27.880
years ago. If there was one, two or three
subsequent migration is still under

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:32.090
debate. There is evidence of ancient gene
flow from population related to

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:35.780
Austra-Melanesians into some Amazonian
populations, although we don't know

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:40.310
exactly how that happened. The sequencing
of ancient genomes from the Americas has

00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:43.550
complimented the knowledge generated from
studying genome-wide data from modern

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:50.070
populations. But we still have very few
compared to Europe, for example. And this

00:58:50.070 --> 00:58:53.770
last point, it's also something very
important for me, ancient DNA research can

00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:58.620
also be useful for investigating other
aspects apart from the initial peopling of

00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:02.160
the continent. I think we put too much
attention into that that we've forgotten

00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:10.560
about the more recent history or
pre-history, like the source populations

00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:14.490
in Africa of the people who were brought
during the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. And

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:16.677
with that I'll complete. And thank
you.
