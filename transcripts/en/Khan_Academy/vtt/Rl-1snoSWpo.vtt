00:00:00.227 --> 00:00:03.055
- [Instructor] When you
hear of ancient Rome,

00:00:03.055 --> 00:00:05.658
or the Roman Empire,
or the Roman republic,

00:00:05.658 --> 00:00:09.803
immediately images of the
Roman legions come to mind.

00:00:09.803 --> 00:00:12.276
To the conquering armies conquering

00:00:12.276 --> 00:00:13.716
much of the Mediterranean.

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:16.087
You might have images of the Roman Senate.

00:00:16.087 --> 00:00:19.676
Names like Julius Caesar and
Augustus might come to mind.

00:00:19.676 --> 00:00:22.577
You might think of some of
the famous architectures.

00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:25.625
Some of which you can still
see if you were to visit Rome,

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.744
and these are all real images of Rome,

00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:30.745
or they're appropriately
associated with it,

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:33.617
and we'll talk about most of
these things in some depth,

00:00:33.617 --> 00:00:36.157
but Rome did not start out that way,

00:00:36.157 --> 00:00:37.901
and the purpose of this
video is to give us

00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:41.447
a over arching arc of the history of Rome

00:00:41.447 --> 00:00:43.847
to be able to place it within history.

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:46.839
Both in terms of time and geography.

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.886
So just to make sure we
can read what I did here

00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:53.743
ahead of time, up here is I
have a high level timeline

00:00:53.743 --> 00:00:56.759
and then down here I have
a timeline that zooms in

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.977
a little bit, goes into
a few more details,

00:00:58.977 --> 00:01:01.428
and you can see this timeline on top,

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:04.440
it's going from the eighth century BCE

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.189
all the way to the fifth century CE,

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.940
so it's covering over
1,000 years of history,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.788
and I need it to cover
over 1,000 years of history

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:16.309
because the Roman Empire,

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:19.165
we can even say just
the western Roman Empire

00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:20.469
covers that much,

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.097
and that doesn't even
cover the entire legacy

00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:26.991
of the Roman Empire
because when we get into

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:28.824
the fourth century CE,

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:33.285
you have a split where
you have the eastern

00:01:33.285 --> 00:01:34.908
and the western Roman Empire

00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:37.741
and the eastern, often known
as the Byzantine Empire,

00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:39.991
that goes on until 1453 CE.

00:01:41.342 --> 00:01:45.015
So another 1,000 years
until they are conquered

00:01:45.015 --> 00:01:46.428
by the Ottomans.

00:01:46.428 --> 00:01:48.502
So the legacy of the Roman Empire,

00:01:48.502 --> 00:01:51.041
even formally as an
empire, is significant,

00:01:51.041 --> 00:01:52.966
and then it continues on.

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.947
Much of western civilization,

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:56.989
especially Europe and the Mediterranean

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:59.529
has its foundations in the Roman Empire

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:01.767
and then before that, Greek civilization,

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:03.792
and the Roman Empire is really up there

00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:05.923
alongside the Persian Empire

00:02:05.923 --> 00:02:10.104
as one of the really great
civilizations or empires,

00:02:10.104 --> 00:02:11.832
and when I say great, you should take that

00:02:11.832 --> 00:02:12.922
with a grain of salt.

00:02:12.922 --> 00:02:15.151
Great I'm saying it was
big, it was powerful,

00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:16.874
but not everything they did was great.

00:02:16.874 --> 00:02:18.839
They had a lot of slavery,
they were very cruel,

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.522
they were sometimes very violent.

00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:23.885
So take these terms great
with a grain of salt.

00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:25.973
So now that we get this timeline up here

00:02:25.973 --> 00:02:28.458
and then down here I'm gonna go, whoops.

00:02:28.458 --> 00:02:30.625
Down here I have some maps

00:02:31.777 --> 00:02:33.870
that are gonna show how
the Roman Empire grew

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.201
and then eventually splits and declines,

00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:39.546
but as we go to this top timeline,

00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:43.713
we see the founding of Rome
in the eighth century BCE,

00:02:44.702 --> 00:02:48.143
and this date 753 is the
date that's often given

00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:51.047
to the founding of Rome by Romulus,

00:02:51.047 --> 00:02:55.968
one of twin brothers Romulus
and Remus raised by a she-wolf.

00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:58.032
They were abandoned and
raised by the she-wolf

00:02:58.032 --> 00:02:59.145
as legend would have it,

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:01.027
and then Romulus eventually
kills his brother

00:03:01.027 --> 00:03:03.086
and then becomes the first king of Rome.

00:03:03.086 --> 00:03:05.274
We don't know how much of this is true.

00:03:05.274 --> 00:03:08.333
I suspect a lot of this is very legendary.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:12.252
Legend would have it that
Rome is named for Romulus,

00:03:12.252 --> 00:03:14.192
but some historians today think

00:03:14.192 --> 00:03:15.996
well it might have been
the other way around.

00:03:15.996 --> 00:03:18.043
We have the city of Rome,
they needed a founding story,

00:03:18.043 --> 00:03:20.770
hey let's say this person
Romulus started it,

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.413
and we don't know the exact date,

00:03:22.413 --> 00:03:24.709
but there seems to be
a reasonable consensus

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.731
that around this mid eighth century BCE

00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:31.228
you have the founding of the city of Rome,

00:03:31.228 --> 00:03:33.373
but it's important to
realize that at that point

00:03:33.373 --> 00:03:36.338
the founding of the city
that the kingdom of Rome,

00:03:36.338 --> 00:03:40.157
it wasn't a significant power
on the Italian Peninsula

00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:41.151
at the time.

00:03:41.151 --> 00:03:44.657
Where I have this X marked,
that's where Rome is,

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:46.768
and what you see in
green, this is actually

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:48.663
the Etruscan civilization,

00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:52.746
and for most of this period
of the Roman kingdom.

00:03:54.178 --> 00:03:56.274
So this period right over here,

00:03:56.274 --> 00:03:58.937
it's actually the Etruscans
that are dominant power

00:03:58.937 --> 00:04:01.111
and for significant fractions of this

00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:04.438
they were dominant over the Roman kingdom.

00:04:04.438 --> 00:04:06.152
Over the city of Rome,

00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:08.235
but as we get to 509 BCE,

00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:12.167
this is when the Roman
Republic is established

00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:14.522
and in this blue green
color, this is the kingdom.

00:04:14.522 --> 00:04:16.783
The gold color, this yellow
color is the republic

00:04:16.783 --> 00:04:20.236
and then the red color is when
the empire gets established

00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:23.859
by Julius Caesar and his
adopted son Augustus,

00:04:23.859 --> 00:04:26.127
and as we get into this,

00:04:26.127 --> 00:04:28.402
I guess you could say
this republic period of,

00:04:28.402 --> 00:04:29.934
or into the Roman Republic.

00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:32.184
This is when it starts
to really exert itself

00:04:32.184 --> 00:04:35.577
as more of a dominant
influence in the region,

00:04:35.577 --> 00:04:38.622
and it continues to be a
dominant influence in the region

00:04:38.622 --> 00:04:40.336
for several hundred years,

00:04:40.336 --> 00:04:44.894
and then as we get into the
first several hundred years

00:04:44.894 --> 00:04:46.969
in the common era.

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:48.841
So after the time of Jesus.

00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:51.008
As we get into the 200s, the 300s,

00:04:51.008 --> 00:04:53.456
this is when we start
to see a real decline

00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:57.047
of the Roman Empire and
the western empire at least

00:04:57.047 --> 00:04:59.902
gets sacked multiple times
in the fifth century,

00:04:59.902 --> 00:05:03.079
and the year 476 is what's typically given

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:05.827
for the end of the Roman Empire,

00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:08.793
but even that's not exactly
the end of the Roman Empire,

00:05:08.793 --> 00:05:10.526
because in the fourth century

00:05:10.526 --> 00:05:12.300
you have the Roman Empire splitting into

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.183
this eastern and western empires,

00:05:14.183 --> 00:05:17.811
and the eastern later gets
known as the Byzantine Empire.

00:05:17.811 --> 00:05:20.811
That goes on for another 1,000 years

00:05:22.702 --> 00:05:25.115
until it's, as I
mentioned, I think earlier,

00:05:25.115 --> 00:05:26.865
taken over by the Ottomans,

00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:28.497
but to get more appreciation for

00:05:28.497 --> 00:05:31.284
how the Roman Empire grew

00:05:31.284 --> 00:05:33.138
and then eventually starts to shrink,

00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:35.997
I have some maps over here.

00:05:35.997 --> 00:05:39.724
So this first map, this
is roughly from the

00:05:39.724 --> 00:05:42.974
third century BCE and third century BCE

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:47.262
you might remember Rome is
a republic at this time,

00:05:47.262 --> 00:05:51.417
but it's not the dominant
power in the Mediterranean.

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:53.665
Just to give ourselves some bearings,

00:05:53.665 --> 00:05:58.283
you might remember that in
the later fourth century BCE

00:05:58.283 --> 00:06:01.586
that's when Alexander conquers much of,

00:06:01.586 --> 00:06:05.289
or most of Greece, Macedonia,
the Persian Empire.

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.519
Which included at the time Egypt,

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:11.260
and as we get into the third century BCE,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.154
you still have the fragments
of Alexanders empire,

00:06:15.154 --> 00:06:18.094
but these are still significant
powers in the regions.

00:06:18.094 --> 00:06:20.546
You also have the Carthaginian Empire.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.644
Which you see here in blue in North Africa

00:06:22.644 --> 00:06:24.269
and southern Spain,

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:26.975
and this period you have a series of wars

00:06:26.975 --> 00:06:29.734
between the Romans and the Carthaginians

00:06:29.734 --> 00:06:31.166
known as the Punic Wars,

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:33.534
and we'll do videos in
depth on the Punic Wars.

00:06:33.534 --> 00:06:35.072
They're called the Punic Wars

00:06:35.072 --> 00:06:37.086
because the term Punic, it comes from

00:06:37.086 --> 00:06:39.017
what the Romans called the Phoenicians,

00:06:39.017 --> 00:06:41.911
and Carthage was actually settled,

00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:43.668
founded by ancient Phoenicians.

00:06:43.668 --> 00:06:46.277
So you can kinda consider
this the Phoenician War

00:06:46.277 --> 00:06:48.925
or the descendants of the Phoenician Wars,

00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:51.827
but that's why it's called Punic,

00:06:51.827 --> 00:06:55.628
but the Romans eventually
win the multiple rounds

00:06:55.628 --> 00:06:57.837
of Punic Wars, take over their territory,

00:06:57.837 --> 00:07:00.234
and eventually destroy Carthage.

00:07:00.234 --> 00:07:02.984
Carthage is destroyed in 146 BCE,

00:07:04.016 --> 00:07:07.375
and we'll talk about that in more detail.

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:11.369
Now as we go into the first century BCE,

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:16.175
this is when Rome goes form
being a republic to an empire,

00:07:16.175 --> 00:07:19.998
and it happens when the
general, Julius Caesar,

00:07:19.998 --> 00:07:24.614
he's able to conquer Gaul
for the Roman Republic.

00:07:24.614 --> 00:07:26.947
So Gaul is modern day France

00:07:28.048 --> 00:07:30.554
and some other surrounding regions,

00:07:30.554 --> 00:07:35.429
and he is so powerful that
when he comes back to Rome,

00:07:35.429 --> 00:07:39.410
a civil war ensues and
Julius Caesar is able to

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.225
essentially win the civil war,

00:07:41.225 --> 00:07:43.459
declare himself a dictator,

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:47.338
and then his adopted son
Augustus, right over here,

00:07:47.338 --> 00:07:49.838
is in 27 BCE declared Emperor,

00:07:51.992 --> 00:07:55.341
and that's the beginning
of the Roman Empire,

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:57.685
and we keep going, and I
think I've already mentioned

00:07:57.685 --> 00:07:59.036
it once in this video,

00:07:59.036 --> 00:08:03.953
but eventually we get a split
in the fourth century CE

00:08:03.953 --> 00:08:06.137
where we have eastern and western halves

00:08:06.137 --> 00:08:07.566
of the Roman Empire.

00:08:07.566 --> 00:08:10.621
The western side centered at Rome,

00:08:10.621 --> 00:08:14.756
the eastern side centered at
what was originally Byzantium,

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:18.609
renamed Constantinople,
and today Istanbul,

00:08:18.609 --> 00:08:20.831
and as we get into the fifth century,

00:08:20.831 --> 00:08:22.357
that's when the western empire

00:08:22.357 --> 00:08:24.362
especially starts to
really go into decline

00:08:24.362 --> 00:08:27.270
and is eventually sacked in 476,

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.437
but the eastern empire keeps on going.
