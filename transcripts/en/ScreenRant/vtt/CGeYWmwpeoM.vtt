10 Amazing Hidden Easter Eggs In Superhero
Movies

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Introduction

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.720
Comic book fans are enjoying the Golden Age
of superhero movies, as many of their favorite

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.180
characters are finally being adapted for the
big screen.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.750
Everything from Batman to The Inhumans is
coming through the pipeline, meaning the filmmakers

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.180
are truly exploring their libraries of characters.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.630
As directors work on their projects, they’re
always looking for ways to honor the history

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.859
of the mythology, sneaking in references that
die-hard fans will get.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.150
Here are 10 Amazing Hidden Easter Eggs in
Superhero Movies.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.510
Spider-Man 2

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.270
Doctor Strange is making his way to theaters
as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.360
but he’s been name-dropped in movies well
before Disney got a hold of him.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.579
When the Daily Bugle staff is trying to coin
a name for new villain Dr. Octopus, someone

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.170
suggests Doctor Strange.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.420
J. Jonah Jameson says it’s catchy… but
it’s unfortunately taken and can’t be

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.420
used.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.070
It’s an obvious reference to the Sorcerer
Supreme and suggests that Stephen Strange

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.930
could have been around in Raimi’s universe.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.980
It would have been fun to see the duo team
up, and hopefully that can still happen in

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.320
the MCU.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.320
The Dark Knight

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.470
Batman needs a new suit to increase his mobility,
and Lucius Fox is happy to oblige.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.009
When showing Bruce Wayne the new armor, Fox
remarks that it’ll leave the Caped Crusader

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.010
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.540
Bruce is most concerned about how it’ll
hold up against dogs after encountering some

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:22.450
early in the film, to which Fox replies it
should do fine against cats.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.409
The joke is a sly nod towards famed Batman
character Selina Kyle/Catwoman, who would

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.540
be played by Anne Hathaway in the sequel,
The Dark Knight Rises.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.850
Nolan must have been thinking ahead to the
third installment.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.500
X-Men: Days of Future Past

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.100
Quicksilver was the breakout star of this
time traveling adventure and fans can’t

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.450
wait to learn more about him in X-Men: Apocalypse.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.079
Fans could learn more about his parentage,
which was hinted at in Days of Future Past.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.710
While with Magneto, Quicksilver notes that
his mother once knew a man who could control

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.439
metal, alluding to the characters’ comic
book histories.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.430
In the comics, Quicksilver is actually the
son of Magneto, so it’ll be interesting

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.619
to see if that angle is explored in a future
film.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.680
It seems like too large an element to ignore,
so hopefully Bryan Singer found room for it

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.240
in Apocalypse.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.250
Iron Man 2

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.670
At the end of his second solo movie, Tony
Stark learns from Nick Fury he’s not fit

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.979
for the Avengers Initiative.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.220
But it’s what’s going on in the background
that’s more interesting.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.310
There’s a map visible with certain spots
highlighted, including one in Africa.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.420
That could very well be a reference to the
fictional nation of Wakanda, home of Black

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.420
Panther.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.030
Marvel is known for planning far in advance,
so it wouldn’t be surprising if they were

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.599
planting the seeds six years before the character
first appeared in a film.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.830
There’s also a dot in the Atlantic Ocean,
which could be for Namor, but he’s not showing

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.760
up anytime soon.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.760
Iron Man

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.930
Well before Iron Man was an international
movie star, he had his own cartoon show.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.950
When he brought Tony Stark to the big screen,
Jon Favreau found a way to tip his hat to

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.950
the animated version.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.660
While Rhodey has pilots tracking down Stark
in the Iron Man suit, he gets a phone call

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.660
from Tony.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:56.190
Rhodey’s ring tone is a midi version of
the 1966 cartoon’s theme song, a fun little

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.319
nod for fans that remember the series.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:01.770
It may not be the most obvious reference,
but for those who watched the show or are

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.730
longtime fans of the character, it was a nice
way to bridge the adaptations.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.730
Green Lantern

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.050
2011’s Green Lantern wasn’t the hit WB
wanted, but they did have confidence in the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.350
project before it bombed.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.210
Throughout the film, they planted hints for
possible sequels, including a marking on Carol

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.210
Farris’ helmet.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.319
That’s no ordinary star; it’s the symbol
of Star Sapphire, the villain Carol eventually

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.640
turns into in the comics.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.000
We’ll never know for sure if this is an
angle that would have been developed in the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.890
series, but it’s a hint the filmmakers were
thinking about it.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.750
With the Lantern Corp. set to return in the
DC Extended Universe, perhaps they can follow

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.320
through on this tease.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.030
The Amazing Spider-Man 2

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.230
For all their faults, the relationship between
Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy was a strongpoint

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.690
of the Amazing Spider-Man series.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.640
That’s what made Gwen’s death in the second
film so heartbreaking.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.409
Though it was implied Gwen would perish long
before the movie came out, Spidey fans knew

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.560
what was going on the minute the clock tower
showed up in the third act.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.400
The time shown, 1:21, is a nod to the comic,
The Amazing Spider-Man #121, the issue in

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.780
which Gwen died at the hands of the Green
Goblin.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.310
As shocking as the scene was, attentive viewers
still had plenty of time to prepare themselves.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.310
Fantastic Four

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.840
Marvel’s First Family has always had bad
luck on the big screen, but there’s no denying

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.049
it’s fun to watch Stan Lee cameo in the
films.

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:17.050
For the first Fantastic Four film in 2005,
Lee portrayed postman Willie Lumpkin.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.760
This wasn’t something just created for the
movie; Lumpkin is a comic book character who

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.970
would frequently deliver mail to the Fantastic
Four at the Baxter Building.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.110
It’s a cute moment for those familiar with
the comic, and a perfect character for Lee.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.150
They do share a striking resemblance.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.720
Too bad the rest of the film couldn’t be
this entertaining.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.050
Superman: The Movie

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.990
When a young Clark Kent is testing out his
powers, he runs by a train that just happens

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.740
to have a young Lois Lane on board.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.990
Lois is with her parents, who are no ordinary
Hollywood extras.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.320
They’re played by Kirk Alyn and Noel Neill
- who portrayed Superman and Lois in the original

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.530
movie serials from the 1940s.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.660
The Last Son of Krypton has been a pop culture
icon for decades well before Richard Donner

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.590
proved a man could fly, so it was nice to
see the director pay respect to that storied

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.820
history.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.639
In 2006, Neill was brought back once more
to play the elderly wife of Lex Luthor in

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.790
Superman Returns.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.000
Captain America: The First Avenger

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.350
As an All-American Brooklyn kid living through
World War II, Steve Rogers is probably the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.630
only movie hero that hates Nazis more than
Indiana Jones.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.710
Marvel has been selling that idea from the
very beginning, having Cap punch Adolf Hitler

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.780
in the face on the cover of the comic’s
very first issue.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.310
Years later when the Star Spangled Man was
brought to the big screen, the famous image

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.080
was recreated during the propaganda montage
as Steve tours the country in his costume.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.139
Even to those who never read the source material,
the connection was easy to make.

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.870
Those are our picks for great Easter eggs
in superhero films.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.100
Are there any we missed?

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.260
