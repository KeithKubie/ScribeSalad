super creepy it's I can't recall a movie
where like I kind of breathed heavily

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910
where like I kind of breathed heavily
 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.760
where like I kind of breathed heavily
during it like after a scene was over

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770
during it like after a scene was over
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.380
during it like after a scene was over
like a scene or two I would just go the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
like a scene or two I would just go the
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.440
like a scene or two I would just go the
guy to catch my breath but what's

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450
guy to catch my breath but what's
 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.250
guy to catch my breath but what's
interesting about it is that some people

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
interesting about it is that some people
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.930
interesting about it is that some people
and everyone I think will kind of get

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
and everyone I think will kind of get
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.580
and everyone I think will kind of get
what they're looking for

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
what they're looking for
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.459
what they're looking for
but there's a very distinct kind of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
but there's a very distinct kind of
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.020
but there's a very distinct kind of
separation between the first half and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030
separation between the first half and
 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.639
separation between the first half and
the second half I feel like people are

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649
the second half I feel like people are
 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650
the second half I feel like people are
either gonna love the first half more

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660
either gonna love the first half more
 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.939
either gonna love the first half more
than the second half or love the second

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949
than the second half or love the second
 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.349
than the second half or love the second
half more than the first half I'll get

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
half more than the first half I'll get
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.529
half more than the first half I'll get
to that a bit but I

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
to that a bit but I
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.100
to that a bit but I
this is spoiler free the most I can say

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
this is spoiler free the most I can say
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.109
this is spoiler free the most I can say
about it cuz the least you know going in

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
about it cuz the least you know going in
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.000
about it cuz the least you know going in
the better is that it's about a death in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
the better is that it's about a death in
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.520
the better is that it's about a death in
the family and the things that happen

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
the family and the things that happen
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.730
the family and the things that happen
after that that's really the most I

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
after that that's really the most I
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.149
after that that's really the most I
should say in terms of the film itself

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159
should say in terms of the film itself
 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.770
should say in terms of the film itself
in terms of like that the mood and the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
in terms of like that the mood and the
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.780
in terms of like that the mood and the
tone I think one of the reasons it works

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
tone I think one of the reasons it works
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.390
tone I think one of the reasons it works
so well is that the first half of this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
so well is that the first half of this
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.179
so well is that the first half of this
is really just creating this

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189
is really just creating this
 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.399
is really just creating this
unbelievably uncomfortable disturbing

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409
unbelievably uncomfortable disturbing
 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.200
unbelievably uncomfortable disturbing
feeling of dread I mean just this

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
feeling of dread I mean just this
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.649
feeling of dread I mean just this
absolute that's the only word I can use

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
absolute that's the only word I can use
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.510
absolute that's the only word I can use
it's just dread you're just watching it

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
it's just dread you're just watching it
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.920
it's just dread you're just watching it
and like I said after so many of these

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930
and like I said after so many of these
 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.050
and like I said after so many of these
scenes I just would take a breath

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
scenes I just would take a breath
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.960
scenes I just would take a breath
because it is just so uneasy and there's

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970
because it is just so uneasy and there's
 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.700
because it is just so uneasy and there's
so many scenes particularly in this

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710
so many scenes particularly in this
 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.039
so many scenes particularly in this
first half where I mean I'm just you

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049
first half where I mean I'm just you
 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.050
first half where I mean I'm just you
kind of don't want to watch it and it's

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060
kind of don't want to watch it and it's
 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.830
kind of don't want to watch it and it's
it's not yeah there is some gore but but

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840
it's not yeah there is some gore but but
 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.600
it's not yeah there is some gore but but
that's not particularly even the reason

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610
that's not particularly even the reason
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.330
that's not particularly even the reason
why it's just these performances with

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340
why it's just these performances with
 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.999
why it's just these performances with
this family and what they talk about it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
this family and what they talk about it
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.059
this family and what they talk about it
how they talk about it to me in many

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
how they talk about it to me in many
 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.890
how they talk about it to me in many
respects is kind of a scariest part of

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
respects is kind of a scariest part of
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.520
respects is kind of a scariest part of
the movie and

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530
the movie and
 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.590
the movie and
it's not like a boo or anything like

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600
it's not like a boo or anything like
 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.050
it's not like a boo or anything like
that uh but it's just watching this

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
that uh but it's just watching this
 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.080
that uh but it's just watching this
family interact off each other after

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090
family interact off each other after
 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.380
family interact off each other after
this death and it's just you feel it I

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390
this death and it's just you feel it I
 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.610
this death and it's just you feel it I
mean you just feel like you're in the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
mean you just feel like you're in the
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.430
mean you just feel like you're in the
room listening to him say just these you

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
room listening to him say just these you
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.780
room listening to him say just these you
know awful but truthful things it's one

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
know awful but truthful things it's one
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.120
know awful but truthful things it's one
of the few times where you know you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130
of the few times where you know you
 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.290
of the few times where you know you
always say that don't keep things

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300
always say that don't keep things
 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.150
always say that don't keep things
bottled up you know you communicate and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
bottled up you know you communicate and
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.380
bottled up you know you communicate and
stuff like that but I mean later with

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390
stuff like that but I mean later with
 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.729
stuff like that but I mean later with
this I'm like no you guys probably

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739
this I'm like no you guys probably
 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.260
this I'm like no you guys probably
shouldn't be saying half what you're

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270
shouldn't be saying half what you're
 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.630
shouldn't be saying half what you're
saying but it's it doesn't feel quite

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640
saying but it's it doesn't feel quite
 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.479
saying but it's it doesn't feel quite
exploitive it just walks that tightrope

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489
exploitive it just walks that tightrope
 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.370
exploitive it just walks that tightrope
of not quite being like an exploitation

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
of not quite being like an exploitation
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.790
of not quite being like an exploitation
movie for the first half's that can have

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800
movie for the first half's that can have
 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.590
movie for the first half's that can have
a little bit of a different different

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600
a little bit of a different different
 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.259
a little bit of a different different
story but but again it still works the

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269
story but but again it still works the
 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.900
story but but again it still works the
best comparison I can draw to this is

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910
best comparison I can draw to this is
 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.970
best comparison I can draw to this is
that it's kind of like a mix between

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
that it's kind of like a mix between
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.640
that it's kind of like a mix between
Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650
Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist
 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.640
Rosemary's Baby and The Exorcist
now that's high praise so clearly it's

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650
now that's high praise so clearly it's
 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.729
now that's high praise so clearly it's
not as good as either of those but it

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739
not as good as either of those but it
 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.400
not as good as either of those but it
has a very similar feel where the the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410
has a very similar feel where the the
 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.350
has a very similar feel where the the
reason the scares in the second half

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360
reason the scares in the second half
 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.840
reason the scares in the second half
work as well as they do because the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850
work as well as they do because the
 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.490
work as well as they do because the
movie doesn't really turn straight-up

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
movie doesn't really turn straight-up
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.360
movie doesn't really turn straight-up
horror until roughly the second half but

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
horror until roughly the second half but
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.830
horror until roughly the second half but
the reason it works so well is because

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840
the reason it works so well is because
 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.140
the reason it works so well is because
it creates this environment where you

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150
it creates this environment where you
 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.780
it creates this environment where you
are just so uneasy and it feels real and

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790
are just so uneasy and it feels real and
 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.100
are just so uneasy and it feels real and
because of that you feel like you're

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110
because of that you feel like you're
 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.280
because of that you feel like you're
with them more in these scenes when the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290
with them more in these scenes when the
 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.110
with them more in these scenes when the
scary stuff starts happening because if

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120
scary stuff starts happening because if
 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.449
scary stuff starts happening because if
this movie source start off with the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459
this movie source start off with the
 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.770
this movie source start off with the
stuff that happens in the second half

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780
stuff that happens in the second half
 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.060
stuff that happens in the second half
kind of in the first half like a lot of

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070
kind of in the first half like a lot of
 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.890
kind of in the first half like a lot of
horror films do it would have worked as

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900
horror films do it would have worked as
 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.710
horror films do it would have worked as
well it had to really create this really

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720
well it had to really create this really
 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.190
well it had to really create this really
just disturbing environment so with that

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200
just disturbing environment so with that
 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.680
just disturbing environment so with that
said the there is a very distinct

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690
said the there is a very distinct
 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.910
said the there is a very distinct
separation between the first half and

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920
separation between the first half and
 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.440
separation between the first half and
the second half like there are clues

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450
the second half like there are clues
 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.509
the second half like there are clues
being set up and everything but the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519
being set up and everything but the
 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.030
being set up and everything but the
first half is very much a super

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040
first half is very much a super
 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.140
first half is very much a super
slow-moving uncomfortable family I don't

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150
slow-moving uncomfortable family I don't
 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.840
slow-moving uncomfortable family I don't
see drama because it because it there

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850
see drama because it because it there
 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.420
see drama because it because it there
are horror elements to it but it's

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430
are horror elements to it but it's
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.729
are horror elements to it but it's
mostly watching this family interact off

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739
mostly watching this family interact off
 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.250
mostly watching this family interact off
each other and just this incredibly

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260
each other and just this incredibly
 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.940
each other and just this incredibly
uncomfortable unnerving way and then the

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950
uncomfortable unnerving way and then the
 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.930
uncomfortable unnerving way and then the
second half goes

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940
second half goes
 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.330
second half goes
more traditional horror and it's done

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340
more traditional horror and it's done
 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.660
more traditional horror and it's done
well it's done very very well uh but in

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670
well it's done very very well uh but in
 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.340
well it's done very very well uh but in
my opinion it kind of like I said people

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350
my opinion it kind of like I said people
 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.600
my opinion it kind of like I said people
are gonna love the first half more

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610
are gonna love the first half more
 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.680
are gonna love the first half more
they're gonna love the second half more

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690
they're gonna love the second half more
 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.810
they're gonna love the second half more
I like the first half more because

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820
I like the first half more because
 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.850
I like the first half more because
everything was a little bit more vague

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860
everything was a little bit more vague
 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.310
everything was a little bit more vague
you didn't quite know what was going on

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320
you didn't quite know what was going on
 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.650
you didn't quite know what was going on
but it was just enough that kept you

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660
but it was just enough that kept you
 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.590
but it was just enough that kept you
interested and it you questioned

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600
interested and it you questioned
 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.520
interested and it you questioned
constantly who's crazy here who isn't

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530
constantly who's crazy here who isn't
 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.560
constantly who's crazy here who isn't
crazy who has their head together and

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570
crazy who has their head together and
 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.460
crazy who has their head together and
who doesn't because just suddenly these

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470
who doesn't because just suddenly these
 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.470
who doesn't because just suddenly these
things are thrown at you they're so

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480
things are thrown at you they're so
 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.950
things are thrown at you they're so
strange and so odd and you're not sure

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960
strange and so odd and you're not sure
 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.480
strange and so odd and you're not sure
if it's legit or not but then when you

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490
if it's legit or not but then when you
 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.520
if it's legit or not but then when you
see certain things starting to move and

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530
see certain things starting to move and
 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.690
see certain things starting to move and
starting to happy you're like well wait

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700
starting to happy you're like well wait
 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.710
starting to happy you're like well wait
maybe it is uh but for some people they

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720
maybe it is uh but for some people they
 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.330
maybe it is uh but for some people they
might be going in saying well yeah I

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340
might be going in saying well yeah I
 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.210
might be going in saying well yeah I
know it's gonna be real or I know that

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220
know it's gonna be real or I know that
 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.710
know it's gonna be real or I know that
shit's gonna happen it's a horror film

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720
shit's gonna happen it's a horror film
 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.500
shit's gonna happen it's a horror film
so why don't we get to that faster but

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510
so why don't we get to that faster but
 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.060
so why don't we get to that faster but
for me I think because I've seen that so

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070
for me I think because I've seen that so
 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.410
for me I think because I've seen that so
many times in horror films

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420
many times in horror films
 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.230
many times in horror films
I feel like this starts off as a great

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240
I feel like this starts off as a great
 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.840
I feel like this starts off as a great
movie and then it becomes a good horror

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850
movie and then it becomes a good horror
 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.310
movie and then it becomes a good horror
film and the because for me when they

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320
film and the because for me when they
 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.140
film and the because for me when they
start getting explaining what's going on

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150
start getting explaining what's going on
 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.430
start getting explaining what's going on
I felt like I personally didn't need

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440
I felt like I personally didn't need
 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.960
I felt like I personally didn't need
that I just because there were little

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970
that I just because there were little
 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.970
that I just because there were little
clues in the opening serve indicating

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980
clues in the opening serve indicating
 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.970
clues in the opening serve indicating
what was going on and when you see it

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980
what was going on and when you see it
 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.830
what was going on and when you see it
all kind of come together at the end I

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840
all kind of come together at the end I
 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.690
all kind of come together at the end I
did realize I'm like man fer for the

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700
did realize I'm like man fer for the
 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.600
did realize I'm like man fer for the
family dynamic that was going on what it

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610
family dynamic that was going on what it
 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.150
family dynamic that was going on what it
amounts to really did not connect much

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160
amounts to really did not connect much
 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.550
amounts to really did not connect much
to what they were building up with the

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560
to what they were building up with the
 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.130
to what they were building up with the
family like why we were watching them go

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140
family like why we were watching them go
 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.320
family like why we were watching them go
through as much as they were going

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330
through as much as they were going
 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.280
through as much as they were going
through but it could very well be that

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290
through but it could very well be that
 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.860
through but it could very well be that

and it's one of those films where it's

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220

like I think I want to watch it and see
 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.020
like I think I want to watch it and see
if there is more of a connection with

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030
if there is more of a connection with
 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.219
if there is more of a connection with
the second half to the first half

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229
the second half to the first half
 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:40.800
the second half to the first half
because I felt like

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810
because I felt like
 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.770
because I felt like
wasn't much particularly when it ended I

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:42.780
wasn't much particularly when it ended I
 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.570
wasn't much particularly when it ended I
was saying well that was very disturbing

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580
was saying well that was very disturbing
 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.310
was saying well that was very disturbing
very creepy but I was like man that was

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320
very creepy but I was like man that was
 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.680
very creepy but I was like man that was
a house a different movie in the second

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690
a house a different movie in the second
 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.960
a house a different movie in the second
half like a good movie but that did not

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970
half like a good movie but that did not
 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.520
half like a good movie but that did not
feel like what the first half was

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530
feel like what the first half was
 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.530
feel like what the first half was
building up to which again you could say

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540
building up to which again you could say
 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.450
building up to which again you could say
well kind of a surprise and catches you

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460
well kind of a surprise and catches you
 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.930
well kind of a surprise and catches you
off-guard which it does but it's one of

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940
off-guard which it does but it's one of
 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.120
off-guard which it does but it's one of
those things where I feel like if they

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.130
those things where I feel like if they
 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:05.610
those things where I feel like if they
kept it more vague I probably could have

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:05.620
kept it more vague I probably could have
 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.320
kept it more vague I probably could have
drawn more connections to what the

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:07.330
drawn more connections to what the
 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.330
drawn more connections to what the
family was going through with the horror

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340
family was going through with the horror
 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.810
family was going through with the horror
elements because what I loved about the

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820
elements because what I loved about the
 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.490
elements because what I loved about the
first half and kind of the middle is

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500
first half and kind of the middle is
 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.310
first half and kind of the middle is
that the horror imagery really reflects

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:17.320
that the horror imagery really reflects
 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.460
that the horror imagery really reflects
what's going on with these characters

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:20.470
what's going on with these characters
 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.810
what's going on with these characters
emotionally like one of the characters

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820
emotionally like one of the characters
 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.600
emotionally like one of the characters
sleepwalks and so half the time you

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610
sleepwalks and so half the time you
 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.920
sleepwalks and so half the time you
