00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.754
We've seen now that if the graph of a function doesn't have any breaks in it,

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:07.300
then the curve is going to pass through all the y values that lie between the y

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.202
value of the starting point and the y value of the ending point of whatever

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:16.550
region of the graph that we're looking at. This concept has a special name.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.850
It's called the intermediate value theorem. Now, let's say that all we know

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.306
about the two end points of this curve, which I've now labeled A and B, is that

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:31.296
the y-coordinate of point A is a negative. And the y-coordinate of point B is

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:35.214
positive. If that's the case, then what is the one value of y that we know the

00:00:35.214 --> 00:00:40.475
curve has to pass through between point A and point B? There's only one that we

00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:44.283
can be completely sure of. Think carefully about this.
