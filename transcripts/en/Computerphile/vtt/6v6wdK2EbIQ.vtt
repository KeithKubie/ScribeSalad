00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.360
Well, thank you for the opportunity to
flog my own book.  Um, sorry.  I'll rephrase

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.860
that differently.  Actually something that
I was working on while I was here in

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.439
England two years ago was a book on Go,
which was published shortly after I

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.759
returned.   And most of the work, I would say
almost entirely the entire part of the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:28.460
work, was done by Alan Donovan, a colleague
from Google.  He's in New York now but he

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.960
in fact grew up in Salisbury.  So Alan and
I wrote this book on Go, which is in many

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.250
ways a very interesting, useful language.
I would not call myself a Go expert at

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.200
all in spite of having worked on it in
this sense.  Alan is the true expert, but

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.210
worth doing.  The other thing that I also
did, in part because I was on sabbatical

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.590
for a year, was to update a book that I
wrote maybe six seven years ago called

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.420
D is for Digital.  It's a book for very
non-technical people, people whose

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.690
interests and expertise is not in
computing but in other things, but who would

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.260
like to understand how do these
things work, how what does it mean to

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.820
write a program, what does it mean to use
the web, how does the Internet work, what

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.170
kinds of risks are there to our privacy
and security -- kinds of good things

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.060
like that.  So I had written a book on
that several you know at least five or

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.670
six, seven years ago like that.  And it was
getting a little dusty because things

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.190
change rapidly, and so I did a second
edition of that.  And the other thing I

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.570
had done, and probably because my
colleague Dave Brailsford, the first book

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.220
self-published.  He will I'm sure tell you
that self publication is a recipe for

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.659
having things disappear without a trace.
And so that the first edition did sort

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.630
of disappear without much trace.  The
second edition was published by

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.369
Princeton University Press, who also has
an arrangement with Oxford University

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.530
Press, and so I'm hopeful that the book
gets a lot more publicity.  It's called

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.740
Understanding the Digital World, which is
a much fancier title but okay.
&gt;&gt; Sean:  So that's

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.190
the updated version of D is for Digital.
&gt;&gt; BWK: that's it.
&gt;&gt; Sean: I'm actually intrigued to know because

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:17.130
we started Computerphile maybe four years ago.
What has changed today?  What sorts of things?

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.160
&gt;&gt; BWK: I think the most obvious one -- the first
version was done I think in 2011.  In 2013

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.630
Edward Snowden revealed something that
people had suspected but not really

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.200
realized: just how extensively they are
being spied on by various government

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.220
agencies like the NSA in the United
States and GCHQ in England and

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.000
presumably similar ones everywhere in
the world.  And what Snowden did was to

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.480
make it crystal clear that there was an
enormous amount of that stuff going on,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.890
in spite of denials and in spite of
legal restrictions in various countries

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.540
on how information could be collected
and used.  And so that was a big thing.  I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.420
think the other thing that sort of
parallels it in some sense, another

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.450
change, is the continuing growth of
commercial surveillance: how we are being

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.000
monitored continuously as we use the
Internet and our phones and so on, by

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.299
companies like Google and Facebook and
who knows who else.  And the enormous

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.400
growth of the hidden advertising market
there, the trackers that watch you when

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.930
you use your computers and when you use
your phones.  And then in some sense the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.180
commercialization of criminal threats
against you, that this is that people are

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.859
out to get your money and your identity
in a way that was I think much less so.

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.030
It was more amateur six seven years ago
than it is today.  So all of these are

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.799
things that are I think substantially
different, mostly in intensity.  They're

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.930
much worse.  Defenses are harder come by,
although we do understand something

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.989
about that.  So that was the bulk of
the sorts of things that

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.900
changed in it.  And then of course
something was just trying to clean up

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.780
the places where I explained it poorly
the first time around; let's see if we

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.019
could do better the second time around.
You keep trying it until you get it

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.549
right.  There are authors who claim that
they write their stuff right the first

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.200
time and it never needs work.  I don't
think that applies to most people and

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.260
certainly does not apply to me.  So even
in the process of writing a book, you

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.239
work really really hard
over and over and over

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.280
again on what you say.  And then
you get it out and you realize there's a

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.919
mistake, or you could have said that much
better, or something has changed

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.660
underfoot, and so what you said is no
longer accurate because the world has

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.199
changed around you.  So you pile enough
of those effects on in a field like

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.380
computing which is changing rapidly, and
it means that books tend to date

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.490
relatively quickly.  And so some parts --
you know binary numbers work the same

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:50.669
way today as they did when, I don't know,
George Boole was at them.  But the

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.729
explanations of those perhaps could be
improved and the reasons why you should

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.069
care about them may have changed as well.
So that's the genesis of the second

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.849
edition.
&gt;&gt; Sean:  When you come over here you
don't fly, do you?  I don't recall

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.919
the details of this but I'm interested
what it's like spending days on the

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:14.550
ocean in this day and age, when you're so
used to being connected.  Can you tell me 
a little bit about that?
&gt;&gt; BWK: Oh, yeah.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.620
The genesis -- my wife does not like to fly
at all and we are a stage where

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.099
fortunately we can take a relatively
long period in the summer, so we have

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:28.770
three times now, we're in, you know, in the
middle of the third time, have come to

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.860
England on the QM2,
which fortunately sails from New York,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.210
which is you know 50 miles from where we
live and lands in Southampton, which is

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:44.280
perfectly fine.  And so the trip takes
seven days, and you're in the middle of

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.229
the Atlantic, and there isn't a lot to do
out there, except the QM2 itself is a

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.729
very big floating -- not quite luxury but
close to it -- hotel in some ways -- and they

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.300
try to entertain their guests, and they
certainly feed their guests really well.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.580
There's lots of good food
continuously, and entertainment put on of

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.610
one sort or another, and they have a
library and so on and so on. But the other

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.069
and really your question is: you're cut
off from electronics and so on.  And it

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:17.099
turns out to my surprise you're not,
really.  What they provide is satellite

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.270
internet.  You have to pay for it but my
wife and I have sailed enough now that

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.810
they give us a hundred and twenty
minutes free over seven days.  So you can

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.500
figure this is approximately twenty minutes
a day of Internet

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.380
connectivity.  And so I use that to check
mail.  And I've found that typically I only

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.180
use about half of it.  I log in, check
my mail in, you know, two three minutes,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.300
maybe kill off one important thing if
there is one, and then just turn it off

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.770
again.  I don't miss it a bit.  It works
well for me because I don't use a fancy

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:54.350
mailer.  I am using an old-fashioned
text-only mailer, Alpine, and so the

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:05.180
fact that the latency is infinite
doesn't matter.  
&gt;&gt; Sean: [laughter]
&gt;&gt; BWK: Yes, right.  So it turns out

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:11.060
that you can get along very nicely
without connectivity for a week if you

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.020
have more or less arranged your affairs
properly before you set off, and if you've

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:23.450
told people you know I'm not gonna
respond to you.  
&gt;&gt; Sean: I'm guessing that you still work though, that
you still work and it's just lack of connectivity.
&gt;&gt; BWK: Yeah, right.  You can still

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.290
do things.  It's actually very nice for
doing things like editing books or

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.320
something like that, where you have all
the text on your own computer and

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.990
you can fiddle with it and then at the
end, resync with the world when you

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:46.580
arrive. 
&gt;&gt; Sean: Fantastic.  And what's next then, Brian?  
What's next for you?  Will you stay in the UK for a while?
&gt;&gt; BWK: Yeah, we'll be in the UK until the beginning

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:53.090
of August and then we go back on the
QM2.  So we're in staying in Lincoln at

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.300
this point, which is a town we hadn't
spent enough time in in the past, and then

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.200
we're going off into Yorkshire for a
while, and then into Northwest Wales, and

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.690
then down to Ilfracombe, and then down to
Dartmouth, and back in Salisbury, and then

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.470
home.  So kind of a week at a time.
Oh, and there's an Oxford in there

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:17.570
somewhere as well, I forgot.
&gt;&gt; Sean:  So to us in the UK, that's
quite a big journey but perhaps when
you're from the States it feels not so far.
&gt;&gt; BWK: In terms

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:22.250
of distances, distances in England are
tiny; in terms of travel time, distances

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.960
in England are very long.  It took me an
hour and a half to get from Lincoln to

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.550
Nottingham this morning and I think the
distance there is what, 30 or 40 miles?

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:37.960
So because the roads are narrower and there
a lot of people on them.
