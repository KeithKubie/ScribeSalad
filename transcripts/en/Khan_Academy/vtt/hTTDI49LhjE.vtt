00:00:00.361 --> 00:00:02.379
- [Voiceover] What I want to
do in this video is see if

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:04.723
we can evaluate the definite
integral from negative three to

00:00:04.723 --> 00:00:09.287
three of the square root
of nine minus x squared dx.

00:00:09.287 --> 00:00:11.383
I encourage you to pause this
video and try it on your own.

00:00:11.383 --> 00:00:15.623
I'll give you a hint,
you can do this purely

00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:19.499
by looking at the graph of this function.

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:22.718
All right, I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:00:22.718 --> 00:00:24.414
So let's just think about,
I just told you that you

00:00:24.414 --> 00:00:26.184
could do this by using
the graph of the function.

00:00:26.184 --> 00:00:28.890
Let's graph this function.

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:34.564
Let's get a y-axis here.

00:00:34.564 --> 00:00:38.067
This is my y-axis.

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:40.571
This is my x-axis.

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:44.985
You might be saying, "Oh
well, what is the graph

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:46.738
"of this thing?", it
might not jump out at you.

00:00:46.738 --> 00:00:49.518
It's been a little while
(mumble) of a hint since you've

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:52.991
done conic sections, maybe
in your Algebra class.

00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:55.427
Let's just remind ourselves.

00:00:55.427 --> 00:00:58.852
If this function, if we said y is equal to

00:00:58.852 --> 00:01:03.001
some function of x, which
we see is the square root

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.365
of nine minus x squared.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.170
Then we could say, "Well,
that means that y squared must

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.865
"must be equal to this thing squared."

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:13.665
Which is nine minus x squared.

00:01:13.665 --> 00:01:18.452
Then we could say, "Y squared
plus x squared is equal

00:01:18.452 --> 00:01:22.836
"to nine." and you might
recognize this as a circle

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.219
centered at origin with radius

00:01:30.358 --> 00:01:32.916
equal to three, the square root of nine.

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:36.797
So radius is equal to three,
centered at the origin.

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:39.112
Now, they graph of this is
not going to be a circle.

00:01:39.112 --> 00:01:41.437
This is a function.

00:01:42.098 --> 00:01:44.007
It would be a circle and it would not be

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:45.961
a function anymore if
you said the positive and

00:01:45.961 --> 00:01:48.035
negative square roots of here.

00:01:51.203 --> 00:01:53.424
When we took the squares
of both sides we got

00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:55.925
the bottom back I guess you could say.

00:01:55.925 --> 00:01:59.147
But up here, we're only talking
about the principal root.

00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:00.106
When you're talking
about the principal root

00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:01.870
you're really talking about the top.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.091
This is the top of a circle centered at

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:07.783
the origin with radius three.

00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:11.480
So this is top of circle
cause it's the positive

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.326
square root, so let's draw that.

00:02:13.326 --> 00:02:16.667
It's gonna have a radius of
three, centered at the origin.

00:02:16.667 --> 00:02:21.010
This is gonna be negative three,
this is going to be three.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.281
This is going to be three right over here.

00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:27.185
So this function is
going to look like this.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:33.280
It's actually only defined
between negative three and three.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.238
The absolute value of x
is greater than three,

00:02:36.238 --> 00:02:38.135
then you're going to get
a negative value in here.

00:02:38.135 --> 00:02:40.084
Then you can't take the principal root,

00:02:40.084 --> 00:02:42.170
as if we're defining it over

00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:47.513
a positive or non-negative
values I should say.

00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:49.219
So this is the graph.

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.508
What is the definite integral
from negative three to three.

00:02:52.508 --> 00:02:55.361
Well it's just the area under the curve

00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:57.884
and above the x-axis, it's the stuff that

00:02:57.884 --> 00:03:00.063
I am shading in in green.

00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:01.083
Well, what's that?

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:02.729
We don't need Calculus to figure that out.

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.447
You can do this with just
traditional geometry.

00:03:05.447 --> 00:03:09.037
The area of the entire circle,

00:03:09.037 --> 00:03:11.659
if there were an entire circle,
would just be pi r squared.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.393
So it would be pi times three squared,

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:16.868
which is equal to nine pi.

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.082
Now this is only half
of the entire circle.

00:03:19.082 --> 00:03:21.591
So we're gonna divide that by two.

00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:24.543
The area is nine pi over two.

00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:28.846
So this thing is nine pi over two.
