[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.077 --> 00:00:05.760
ANDREAS PREUER: Hi,
my name is Andreas,

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.012
and I'm a partner development
manager at Google Play.

00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:11.220
In my day-to-day job I work
with the most interesting

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.713
mobile game developers in
North America and Europe.

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:16.379
There are many familiar
faces, actually,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.690
in here-- quite exciting.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.700
And I hope to help
actually developers

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.670
on making their mobile games
business successful on Google

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.060
Play.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.880
TOBIAS KNOKE: Hi,
my name is Tobias.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.550
I'm a partner a development
manager based in London

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.570
and working with developers
in Western Europe.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.580
Today, at the first session
after the lunch break,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.900
we want to help you
to promote your game

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.830
and to grow your user base.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.810
But before talking about the
key essentials for your user

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.270
acquisition strategy, we would
like to put this into context.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.690
As you heard earlier before,
the mobile industry is growing.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.490
And it's getting more
competitive, as well.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.450
There are more than 10
million developers worldwide,

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.870
and each year they publish
more than one million apps.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.500
And if you look on the right
side, if you think about games,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.290
the lifecycle of games
has shortened as well

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.850
over the past years.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.750
In 2012, the average
game matured after a bit

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.240
more than 150 weeks.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.660
Last year, it was a
bit less than 50 weeks.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.170
So you have a competitive
market, shorter life cycles,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.480
and also increasing
production values.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.780
And this means you want to have
your user acquisition strategy

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.852
as effective as possible.

00:01:30.852 --> 00:01:32.310
ANDREAS PREUER:
Today we will cover

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.970
three key examples for your
user acquisition strategy.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.850
First I will talk about how you
can better understand your paid

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.000
and organic traffic,
then second, Toby

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.850
will show you how to convert
with effective channels,

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.320
and third, Toby and Andrew will
talk about how to engage users

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.349
in a social platform.

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:52.890
Let me kick it off
with understanding

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.730
your paid and organic traffic.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.080
You can find a conversion funnel
in the Google Play Developer

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.920
Console.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.040
The conversion funnel shows
you Play Store visitors,

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.920
installers, and bias
by acquisition channel

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.830
you can also see the
relevant conversion rates

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.170
and you can drill down
on search keywords

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.660
and UTM track channels to
better understand where

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.440
your users are coming from.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.710
You can also find a country
breakdown of Google Play's

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.180
conversion funnel.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.570
You can drill into performance
in your key markets

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.420
and learn about
underperforming markets.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.660
If you learned [INAUDIBLE]
the installer's conversion

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.100
rate in a specific market
is below your expectations,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.150
you can take action and improve
the localized store listing.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.130
You can then launch a
store listing experiment

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.740
to test your updated
store listing

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.026
to get more game installs.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.780
However, optimizing your
business strategy in isolation

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.370
is not that helpful.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.340
So let's look back at store
listing organic conversion

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.080
rates.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.000
How do you know if
your conversions are

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.910
as good as they can be,
or you're leaving actually

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.390
an opportunity on the table?

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.890
At Google I/O, we've
announced benchmarking

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.721
against your peers.

00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:14.970
This feature is coming soon
to Google Play's developer

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.766
console, and you are
now able to understand

00:03:17.766 --> 00:03:19.140
how your store
listing conversion

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.000
rate compares to similar games.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.120
First, we are providing
an overall benchmark

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.400
for your organic users.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.670
And then we also, actually,
provide a country breakdown

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.160
that helps you to understand
how your game is actually

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.080
performing versus the
benchmark in a specific market.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.710
If you understand that
your game is potentially

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.990
underperforming in
a specific market,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.050
you can actually take action
based on this insight.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.510
So here you can see one example.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.000
And the game is
actually performing OK,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.660
but it could do better.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.840
So you can actually optimize
the localization of the store

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.700
listing and prove
the performance of it

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.868
and get much better results.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.540
If you want to understand
users even better

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.880
than what you've seen
actually in the conversion

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.274
funnel in the play store
and the developer console,

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:19.940
you can actually use
Firebase Analytics.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.640
It was touched upon actually
earlier in the presentation.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.820
And Firebase
Analytics for mobile--

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.360
there's a couple things for you.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.830
So first, it's actually entirely
free and it is unlimited.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.040
You are able to actually
measure 500 different event

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.580
types and 25 key
value pairs per event.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.530
You're also able to access
unlimited, unsampled data

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.860
through [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.900
Firebase is very
much user centric.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.280
So you can actually focus on
users instead of sessions.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.740
And then you will
also see metrics

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.330
that are meaningful for
you as a game developer.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.440
So you will see actually
daily active user stats,

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.840
but you will also see, for
example, LTV stats that you

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.180
can use for optimization.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.950
I've just seen my
colleague walking in.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.720
He will talk later a little bit
more about LTV optimisation.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.720
Firebase helps you to
already get these stats.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.600
And this is full right
baked into Firebase.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.360
Firebase is also well integrated
with other Google products,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.510
so it is integrated
with our ads product,

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.760
with our notifications
product, and you can easily

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.640
target audiences that
have actually captured

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.810
with Firebase on other things.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.430
It is also very easy to actually
track any user acquisition

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.130
campaigns through any paid
channels that you have.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.350
You can see here a
couple of partners

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.390
that are integrated
with Firebase,

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.977
and you can then actually
attribute your ads band,

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:53.560
and you can understand,
is it actually

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.260
a good way to invest in one
of the channels, or is it

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.690
a better way to actually
invest in the other channels.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.210
And so by implementing
Firebase you will actually

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.450
get all of this data, and
you can take action right

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.100
after that.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.730
So now we talked about
how to understand

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.950
your paid and organic traffic.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.290
Let's move on and talk
about how you can convert

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.090
with effective channels.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.690
Earlier today, Mark referenced
a number of installs

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.800
on Google Play.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.150
Last year we had 65
billion installs.

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.920
And at the Play Store,
we matched the best users

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.200
with the best content.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.520
We want personalized
collections,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.180
and offer seasonal
collections as well.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.370
But the vast
majority of installs

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.470
still comes from search.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.480
There are more than
one billion users

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.180
on Google Play, and
more than 190 countries,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.770
as you know already.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.690
And all these users search.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.060
On google.com, there
are each month more

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.300
than 100 billion searches.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.200
So you cannot only achieve
success by reaching the users

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.740
on google.com, but
also on the Play Store.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.200
Let's have a look at an example.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.520
This is a store listing
of War and Order,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.660
and the developer decided to
do search ads on google.com.

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.800
That's something you
might be familiar with.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.100
A user searching for a
strategy game and both

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.620
paid and organic
results are shown.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.870
But also, as you can
see on the right side,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.790
you can do the same
in the Play Store.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.245
Both organic and paid
results are shown.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.700
So the best way of
executing this campaign

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.860
is working with a tool.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.350
Who here in the audience
has heard about the key word

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.670
tool for add words?

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.700
Some people have.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.540
So if you're wondering what are
the best keywords for my Play

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.360
Search ads campaign,
we have a keyword tool

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.370
which helps you to get the right
keywords for your mobile game.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.310
Keywords are very important
to optimize your campaign

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.890
day by day, and we encourage
you to use this tool

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:03.180
to optimize your campaigns
for the Play Store.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.760
So now you might ask yourself,
OK, now I go back home

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:06.570
and try it out.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.310
But will that work?

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.500
Well, we have one example
here from Nordeus,

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.450
the developers of Top Eleven.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.990
I'm actually a big Top Eleven
addict and my team knows that.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.440
But these guys use
the play search ads,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.170
and they achieve the highest
seven day [INAUDIBLE],

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:25.410
68% higher than other
Google channels.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.700
And also the play search
ads, compared to google.com--

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.659
they were 59% lower
in terms of the CPI.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:36.750
So I encourage you to
try this out at home.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.700
Don't forget the
three best practices.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:44.070
One, use the keyword tool,
two, run target CPA campaigns

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:48.130
and ensure that the CPA is
lower than your lifetime value,

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.230
and last but not least, optimize
the campaigns day by day.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.090
Because with an
advertising campaign,

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.110
it's basically like
with a mobile game--

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:58.870
it's never finished.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.870
So now we talked
about understanding

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.220
your paid and organic
traffic, converting these guys

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.240
with effective channels.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.230
But the players, if they're
not playing your game,

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.496
they are actually
on social platforms.

00:09:11.496 --> 00:09:12.870
They are talking
about your game.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.940
They are watching
videos about your game.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.620
And the number one social
platforms for games is YouTube.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:22.590
95% of all gamers turn to
YouTube for information

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.780
and entertainment.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.160
Gamers watch 144 billion
minutes every month

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.800
on YouTube for live videos,
recorded videos, and streams.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.330
So actually somebody
calculated that number.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:44.030
Now, the real stars on
YouTube are the influencers.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.770
Who here in the audience has
worked with YouTube influencers

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.170
before?

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.250
OK, I see-- wow, a lot of hands.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.520
More than the key word tool.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.710
All right.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:00.720
So please raise your hand
again if you were successful.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.270
That's quite good, but I think
we can increase the conversion

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.680
rate a bit more.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.530
You see some examples
here on the slide.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.570
So on the top
right, you see KSI.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:12.150
That's one at the top
YouTubers in the UK,

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.680
14.5 million subscribers.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.810
You see ConCrafter, a very
popular YouTuber in Germany.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.590
LDShadowLady is the most
popular of female gamer

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.250
on YouTube, with more than
2.5 million subscribers.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.190
And last but not least, gamers
in France turned to [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.580
to learn more about the latest
games and updates and let's

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.260
play videos.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.590
So these are some examples.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.871
But now you might ask yourself,
OK, what is the right strategy?

00:10:40.871 --> 00:10:42.870
What are the YouTubers I
should be working with,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.120
and how does success look like?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.510
So we thought we should ask
someone who knows it best.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.237
Please welcome with me, Andrew
Stalbow, the CEO of Seriously.

00:10:59.065 --> 00:11:00.190
ANDREW STALBOW: Hey, there.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:04.810
I'm Android Stalbow, CEO
and co-founder at Seriously.

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.290
We've got one app currently
out in the market called

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.780
Best Fiends, and I'm
going to talk a little bit

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.110
today about our
marketing strategy, which

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.820
is primarily focused on
YouTube and influencers.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.760
And I'm also going to
share a little short video

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.130
at the end, which shows how
we are planning on taking

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.141
our work to the next level.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:32.440
So our approach is
to build a brand.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.380
We look at the app that
we have and the apps

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.660
that we have coming
as the platform

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.630
for our intellectual property.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.810
We think it's a great
opportunity right now,

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:47.800
with everybody moving from
traditional media platforms

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.640
to new devices obviously,
like mobile tablets,

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.850
for entertainment brands
to be directly connected

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.360
to their audience.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.130
One of the great challenges the
traditional media industry have

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:03.430
is that the IP is
normally distributed

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:07.030
on someone else's platform
other than the creators.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.740
And we thought by
being connected

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:15.040
we might have an opportunity to
build up our IP in a big way.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.960
We try to be as creative
in our marketing

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.540
as we are in our
product development.

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:27.760
Our apps are about introducing
a world and characters

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.920
and a story to the market.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:36.040
And when we were thinking about
how we can be super creative,

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.070
we knew that as a small
early stage startup,

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.620
it would be really,
really hard to compete

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:45.250
with the massive marketing
budgets of some of the biggest

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.680
players in the app stores.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.107
And so we asked when we
launched, when we launched Best

00:12:51.107 --> 00:12:53.650
Fiends, coming up
to two years ago,

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.430
we asked the CEOs
of most mobile game

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.650
companies, what works for you?

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:04.161
And everyone said, Facebook,
Twitter, great acquisition

00:13:04.161 --> 00:13:04.660
platforms.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:06.166
And we said, what doesn't work?

00:13:06.166 --> 00:13:07.290
And they all said, YouTube.

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.640
I can't make YouTube
work for acquisition.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.210
So we thought that we'd
really focus there.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.600
And over the last
few months, we've

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:20.590
been super focused on taking
our approach on YouTube

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.520
as upper level, really
focused on US-UK as kind

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.710
of core markets
for us, and we've

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.990
had some really
interesting learnings.

00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:31.900
So we'll share some
of those with you.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:37.540
Our strategy is based on the
app being a live service.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.530
So every two to three
weeks we update our app

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:45.080
with some fun new product
features, new content,

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.270
new levels, new characters,
enhance the experience,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:54.160
and we mirror the product update
with big marketing pushes.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.840
We've actually got one today.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.250
On average, we're looking
to hit somewhere between 70

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:04.210
and over 150 videos over a
weekend that kind of help

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:05.170
promote our game.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.380
Today we've got an update where
we're introducing a treasure

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.530
hunt into our game.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.160
It's a really popular
feature with our audience

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:22.080
where if you find 15 stickers
that we've hidden in the game,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.710
you get to unlock a new
fiend, Terry the Tarantula.

00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:27.870
You can otherwise
buy him for $10,

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.480
or you can win him by
finding all the stickers

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:32.490
in the next three weeks.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:37.080
Each of those stickers comes
from a famous YouTube star.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:42.810
And over the next few
days, these YouTubers,

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:46.110
including Rachel
Levin, Rosanna Pansino,

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.880
are going to run a
video saying, hey, find

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.770
my sticker in the game.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:52.650
And if you find all of them from
all these other YouTube stars

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:54.210
as well, you unlock
the character.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:57.150
Which is really nice to be
able to kind of integrate

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:00.918
your marketing message
with the product itself.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:09.450
So overall as a company, we've
got two million daily players.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.160
But over the last
three or four months

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:15.330
when we realized that we
could scale this up in the US,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.590
we've be making some
really nice progress.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:20.550
We're now around
450 thousand DAU

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:27.720
since we started focusing on
a big influence of strategy.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.590
And if I look at our
progress that we've made,

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.132
we really kind of shifted
our DAU from a year ago.

00:15:35.132 --> 00:15:36.840
And you can see that
we've kind of really

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.420
started building our base in
the US, which is now our biggest

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:39.919
market.

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:44.500
So here are some
of the key lessons

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.050
that we've learned from
working with influencers.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.830
You know, what I'd say is this
is what we've learned so far,

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.360
but the market is
always changing.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.318
And now it's getting more
and more competitive.

00:15:56.318 --> 00:16:00.060
I saw like 80% of you have done
work with YouTube influencers.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.480
I think the trick is,
take this, but you've

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.060
got to kind of be more
creative than what we've done.

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.340
Because the things
always moving.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:12.330
And I think it's really, really
important to try and outdo

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.900
what you've done before

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.720
So the number one thing
we kind of learned

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.320
is, YouTubers are
brands themselves.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.020
They're connected
to their audience.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.410
They like working
with other brands.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:31.664
And if you haven't got a
brand vision for your product,

00:16:31.664 --> 00:16:33.080
you should really
think about that

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.600
in terms of how you
communicate with a YouTuber,

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.480
because that's what will
get them very excited.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.730
The second thing is, most
big brands as we know them,

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.020
most big, big brands tend
to be very, very detailed

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:51.470
about what they're looking for
for the YouTuber to do or say.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:53.330
The reality is,
that doesn't work.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:55.760
You've got to let the
YouTuber be authentic.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.940
They've got a genuinely
like your product,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.220
and if they don't, I don't
think it's a good fit.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.560
So it's really important
they like your product,

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:07.550
and that you allow them
to be very authentic.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.130
And when I say integrate
back in for maximum effect,

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.937
the example is that
treasure hunt today.

00:17:11.937 --> 00:17:13.520
I think it's a really
nice way of kind

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:17.720
of allowing them to say, hey, I
enjoy the experience of playing

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.442
the game, or playing the app.

00:17:20.442 --> 00:17:22.400
And there's a reason why
you can find something

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.390
from me in there.

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.540
These guys have amazingly
close relationships

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:28.220
with their audience,
and they've got

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:31.340
to feel natural and authentic.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:35.720
Working with big guys is
great, because it sets you up

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.740
in the marketplace and allows
other influences to come in

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.560
and say, oh, I'd like to
work with you because KSI

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.820
worked with you.

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.160
I'll tell you a funny
story about our very, very

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.100
first experience working
with an influencer.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.181
When we launched we
worked with PewDiePie.

00:17:52.181 --> 00:17:54.180
It was like, our launch
had a very small budget.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.210
We put most of it into
a PewDiePie video.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.352
And we definitely learned
some lessons there.

00:17:58.352 --> 00:17:59.810
But I'd say it's
really important

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.393
to work with some
of the big guys that

00:18:01.393 --> 00:18:05.990
allows you to focus on some of
the new up and comers as well.

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.680
What I love about YouTube as
a platform and influence is,

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.220
generally, is that many,
many of these views

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.570
are occurring on mobile.

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:17.960
So if you're trying to kind
of deliver nice acquisition

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.820
and build your
business, you're always

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.070
one click away from a download.

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:26.750
And I think that's what makes
the platform so powerful.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:31.330
And you know, we've tried loads
of things in our marketing.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:34.160
I really encourage our
team to think creatively

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.760
about trying new stuff
that we can learn from.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:41.600
And what's incredible
about this platform is,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.050
unlike, say, a television
buy, or a one-day kind

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:48.980
of digital media activation,
the video is live.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.740
And you'll carry on doing views.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.470
We go back to videos that we
did at the start this year,

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.600
and they've added another
half a million views.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.610
So it's not ephemeral
like television.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.818
So I think it's a really,
really interesting platform

00:19:00.818 --> 00:19:03.080
to focus on.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:07.730
The other thing you get
is, you get a long tail,

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:10.650
you get, in theory,
an endorsement

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:12.859
if the YouTuber
likes your product.

00:19:12.859 --> 00:19:14.900
But the other thing you
get as well, in addition,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.100
is media value on top.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.810
You reach a big audience.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:22.610
And for us, as a company,
that is valuing the brand

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.190
that we're trying to build and
looking to build value there.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.230
Actually kind of
putting this out there,

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:28.730
you get to see that
you're even more

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.344
effective across other
acquisition channels, too.

00:19:31.344 --> 00:19:33.260
So one of the things
we're starting to look at

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.690
is how this also helps
with our retention as well

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:36.648
as acquisition.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:43.160
You know, it's really important
that if you are working

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:46.430
with an influencer, they
are upfront, honest,

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:48.699
straightforward about
what you're doing.

00:19:48.699 --> 00:19:50.240
There are certain
rules that you need

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.530
to comply with in
different markets,

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.314
but at the end of the day,
the kind of golden rule

00:19:55.314 --> 00:19:56.480
is, just be straightforward.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.710
If you're paying
an influencer, they

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.302
need to make sure that they
do mention that very clearly.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.780
So today we're actually
launching a video that kind of

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:09.250
takes the evolution of the
700 or so YouTube influencer

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:12.740
videos we've done, and
takes it to the next level.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.160
And really, the way we
kind of think about it is,

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.130
we've been building
our two million DAU

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:23.330
and 40 plus million downloads
on the back of other people's

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.550
influence of videos.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.950
And we think that's a
really nice strategy

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:30.050
and we're going to carry
on working on that.

00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.591
But we wondered if there was a
way that we could kind of take

00:20:32.591 --> 00:20:34.230
that to the next level.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.810
So what we're launching
today is a scripted video

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.020
that will be working very
hard on for quite a few months

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:46.850
now, where we integrate
traditional Hollywood talent,

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:52.460
in this case Kate Walsh, who
was in the television show

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.930
"Grey's Anatomy," [INAUDIBLE],
and appeals to our core

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:01.230
audience demographic of
25 to 45-year-old women,

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.330
and marrying that with
two of the world's biggest

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:07.550
YouTube stars,
Rosanna Pansino, who's

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:11.090
the biggest kind of
celebrity chef on YouTube,

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.020
and Joey Graceffa, who's very,
very popular, particularly

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.750
within the LGBT
community, and marrying

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.950
those two was a fun, scripted
video that has been inspired

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:23.210
by our fan base.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:25.610
Now, I don't know how many
of you play Best Fiends,

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.850
but one of the things that
our community on social media

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.860
tell us quite a
lot is, actually,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.290
don't download Best Fiends.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.730
It's kind of addictive.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.610
And a few people have said,
hey, I'm totally addictive.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.650
Send me to Best Fiends rehab.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:41.900
So we were kind of
inspired by that

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.900
and created a video
to that effect.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.660
So if it's cool,
it's two minutes,

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.634
and we'd like to
premiere it today.

00:21:49.634 --> 00:21:51.952
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:56.480
- There is a contagious
epidemic sweeping the nation.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.230
It's not just in our
cities or our workplaces,

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:00.753
or even our homes.

00:22:00.753 --> 00:22:01.503
It's in our hands.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.050
- It's taken over my life.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:13.390
- Once you start,
you can't stop.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.570
- I don't know who I am anymore.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:18.660
- Most people think Best
Fiends won't happen to them,

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.600
that it's simply harmless fun.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.240
- I thought I could
just try it once.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.850
- But soon, it
becomes an obsession.

00:22:27.850 --> 00:22:29.530
- I wouldn't say I'm obsessed.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:32.270
I'm spirited, passionate.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:34.080
That's what's going on here.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.721
- Some people we can help.

00:22:37.721 --> 00:22:42.590
- Doc says I may never
use my thumbs again.

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:45.260
You always think it will happen
to someone else's family.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.810
Look what it did to our Billy.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:53.900
- Others require more
specialized treatment.

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:58.340
- I have finally
beaten level 256.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:01.650
I'm a YouTube star.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:03.650
- Course you are.

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:07.070
Start by recognizing the
warning signs, tiredness,

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.830
gamers thumbs, night
terrors, and sweaty eyes.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:11.840
- It's so hot.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:16.100
- In just seconds, anyone
can be playing Best Fiends.

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.672
After all, it's free to
download from Google Play.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.370
- It took me about
a month to done it.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.980
- One click, and
you may have begun

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:40.604
an obsession you can't stop.

00:23:40.604 --> 00:23:41.940
Oh, hey, [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.525
Mo!

00:23:43.525 --> 00:23:45.920
I was just talking
about Best Fiends.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.242
Oh, no, no, I'm a doctor.

00:23:47.242 --> 00:23:48.700
- Oh, of course
you are, Ms. Walsh.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.866
Let's get you back into bed.

00:23:49.866 --> 00:23:51.050
- No, it's Dr. Walsh!

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:51.750
No, I--

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.210
- Right now there is no
cure for Best Fiends.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.630
My advice-- do not download
Best Fiends from Google Play.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.970
Not once, not ever.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:01.655
The world will be better for it.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:05.730
Hm, [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:17.855 --> 00:24:21.260
- Worst case of Best
Fiends I've ever seen.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.692
Remember when she used
to be a doctor on TV?

00:24:23.692 --> 00:24:25.319
- I still am!

00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:25.902
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:25.902 --> 00:24:27.152
ANDREW STALBOW: That was cute.

00:24:27.152 --> 00:24:29.610
So yeah, we're
launching that today.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.410
We're promoting it in
our game and really

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:34.140
trying to use our
app as a platform

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.660
to promote our video as well.

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.540
And we're super excited about
it, so thanks for watching.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.640
