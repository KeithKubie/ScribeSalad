MALE SPEAKER 1: It
is a great honor

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.410
to have you here at Google.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.530
You are the person I'm
most excited about hosting

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.114
in many years.

00:00:12.114 --> 00:00:13.821
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Thank you.

00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:15.740
MALE SPEAKER 1: We're
very grateful to you

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.305
for the generosity of your
time and your presence.

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:20.315
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Thank you.

00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:22.110
MALE SPEAKER 1: So
the topic of today--

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.480
I know at this level
people are signing topics,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.980
so they come here
not really knowing

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.890
what we're talking about.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.650
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Sometimes.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.460
MALE SPEAKER 1: The
topic is inner connection

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.580
and meditation.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.960
Changing the world
from the inside out.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.590
Cool, huh?

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.734
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.750
So before we talk about
that, medication and changing

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.770
the world, I want to ask
you a few simple questions

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.960
about yourself, so
the audience will

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.620
know you a little bit more.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.170
So the first question-- it
sounds like a kid's question--

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.740
but it's a good one,
which is, how is it

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.720
like to be the Karmapa?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.470
What is the best thing
and the worst thing

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.386
about being a Karmapa?

00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:56.976
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:56.976 --> 00:01:01.780
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH KARMAPA:
Best thing and worst thing--

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.670
better to use--
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:19.270
TRANSLATOR: So first
of all, I'd like

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.099
to just say hello and
welcome to everyone.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.265
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:02:24.413 --> 00:02:26.780
TRANSLATOR: When I was
recognized as the Karmapa,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.810
I was seven years old.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.880
And generally, at that time,
before I was recognized,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.910
my family had already
a very strong custom

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.560
of having great faith
towards the master who

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.230
was known as Karmapa,
considering that master

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.630
to be a very important
precious master.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.750
So we all felt that way
about this individual who

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.460
is known as Karmapa,
but none of us

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.440
had the expectation
that I was going

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.380
to become that individual.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.730
So I became the Karmapa
in a very sudden manner.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.740
And at first I
thought it was just

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.470
going to be a great fun time.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.380
To become the Karmapa.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.610
I would have many opportunities
to play and many things

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.190
to play with and so forth.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.243
That was my first impression.

00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:11.409
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.820
TRANSLATOR: But it
didn't turn out that way.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.500
And what I would
say is that, if I

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.520
had time to prepare to
become the Karmapa, then

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.400
it would've been fairly
easy and approachable.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.100
But without any time to
prepare, it is very difficult.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.560
And the way that
happened for me is

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.740
that I didn't have
any time to prepare.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.770
Everything happened
very suddenly.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.430
And there were a
lot of adjustments

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.910
to make that I wasn't prepared
for-- parting from my parents

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.580
for long periods of time, and
there were many other things

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.000
that I had to give up.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.520
So in the end, I found
out that it's not fun.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.010
Quite difficult.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.260
MALE SPEAKER 1: So what's
the best thing about being--

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.600
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH KARMAPA:
What's the best thing?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.725
Best thing.

00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:04.917
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:06.250
The best-- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:06:18.642 --> 00:06:20.350
TRANSLATOR: I think
one really good thing

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.280
about being the Karmapa
is the opportunity

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.120
that it has afforded
me to recognize

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.430
my own responsibilities.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.800
I think that's-- obviously
I believe everyone has great

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.450
responsibilities to everyone
else and to the planet,

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.180
but a lot of people don't have
an opportunity to recognize how

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.050
much responsibility they have.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.890
So I feel that the
role of Karmapa

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.450
has given me an opportunity to
recognize the fact that I have

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.180
a lot of responsibility to
try to benefit others, as well

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:58.520
as the entire environment,
the world and all

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.460
of its inhabitants,
as best I can.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.940
And being in this position has
helped me to recognize that,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.150
and I would say
that's a good thing.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.360
MALE SPEAKER 1: That's
a beautiful answer.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.370
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Thank you.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.703
MALE SPEAKER 1: So talk about
responsibility, my friend.

00:07:09.703 --> 00:07:10.930
You're a young man.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.670
You're 29 years old.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.010
So what's the most
important thing

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.467
the Karmapa has to do
for the next 29 years?

00:07:17.467 --> 00:07:18.925
HIS HOLINESS THE
17TH KARMAPA: Wow.

00:07:18.925 --> 00:07:19.755
29 years.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.515
I'm already 29 years.

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.020
with great far reaching and very
specific plans for the future,

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.260
including the long term future
like having a 25 year plan,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.170
a 10 year plan--

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.003
MALE SPEAKER 1: Our

00:08:11.003 --> 00:08:13.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.670
But yes, more than
that sometimes.

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:17.920
TRANSLATOR: I'm not like that.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.350
I don't build very specific
plans for the long term.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.040
I feel like I'm building up
to that in a gradual way.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.131
So for now I don't have
any specific plans--

00:08:28.131 --> 00:08:30.130
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.477

00:08:33.477 --> 00:08:35.018
MALE SPEAKER 1:
That's a good answer.

00:08:35.018 --> 00:08:35.809
Thank you.

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:37.638
It's good because

00:08:37.638 --> 00:08:39.179
you're always doing
the right thing--

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:39.770
HIS HOLINESS THE
17TH KARMAPA: Yes.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.269
Try to.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.720
MALE SPEAKER 1:
You're very humble.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.340
So I want to shift gears now to
talk about practice, meditation

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.580
and Buddhism.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.290
So the topic of our
conversation is inner connection

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.590
and meditation.

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:59.214
And what practical advice do
you have for secular Americans--

00:08:59.214 --> 00:09:01.630
people in this room and people
watching this-- by the way,

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.254
a million people will
be watching this.

00:09:03.254 --> 00:09:07.060
So what advice do you have
for the good people on how

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.681
they can develop
their inner connection

00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:10.555
and their meditation.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.440
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Inner connection.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:15.940
Meditation.

00:09:25.455 --> 00:09:26.330
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:10:37.686 --> 00:10:39.500
TRANSLATOR: So the
21st century is

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.620
a time of great development,
great improvement

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.400
on many fronts, and
also great change.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.310
Because of the very
rapid developments

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.730
that are happening, sometimes
we feel overwhelmed by that.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.280
And the question
becomes how do we

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.370
balance a sense of
inner peace in our minds

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.610
with this continuing external
development and change.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.880
So meditation is something that
can assist in that very much.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.880
It can help us to
stabilize our minds,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.270
bring peace to our minds,
and have more control

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.030
over our minds so that
we're not overwhelmed

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.520
by this continuous change
and development that's

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.040
happening externally.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.206
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.620
TRANSLATOR: Many
forms of our happiness

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.840
actually depend upon outer
things, external objects.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.290
But the nice thing about
meditation and what I think

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.750
is one of the most
important things

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:15.860
that meditation does for us
is it helps us to connect

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.670
with a happiness,
a peace of mind,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:22.330
a sense of satisfaction that
is not at all contingent

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.544
upon external objects, but that
comes from within ourselves.

00:12:25.544 --> 00:12:27.710
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.690
TRANSLATOR: For example, a
lot of meditation techniques

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.650
focus on immediate
phenomena that are already

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.220
present within ourselves.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.420
Of course, working
with the breath

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.980
is a very common
technique in meditation

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.260
and the breath is something
that is always with us for

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.240
as long as we're alive.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.640
And so sometimes
we don't recognize

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:14.470
these precious natural
resources that we

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:16.700
have with us all the time.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.980
So from one
perspective, meditation

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.230
helps us pay attention and
care to these natural resources

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:29.450
that we have, which in
turn helps us to relax.

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:32.790
And from another
perspective, it also

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.430
helps us engender a natural
sense of wonderment or awe

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:43.774
or joyfulness about what is
precious within us already.

00:14:43.774 --> 00:14:45.940
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.840
TRANSLATOR: So
meditation isn't just

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.210
about relaxing and
helping us to de-stress.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:38.300
It's something that can
increase our awareness,

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:41.770
can help us develop more
mindfulness, but not only that.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:48.750
It can help us develop a deeper
sense of joy and appreciation.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.010
What do we appreciate?

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.310
We not only appreciate
the natural environment

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.700
that is around us, but
we, through meditation,

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.000
heighten our appreciation
of our own bodies.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.514
And many other things.

00:16:05.514 --> 00:16:09.710
MALE SPEAKER 1: So at what point
does kindness and compassion

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:10.500
develop?

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.240
So we just look at the wonder of
the inner phenomenon and outer.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.730
Does then kindness
and compassion

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.450
arise naturally or does
it need extra work?

00:16:27.464 --> 00:16:29.630
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:18:36.405 --> 00:18:37.780
TRANSLATOR: Well
firstly, I think

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.180
that meditation is something
that naturally connects us

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.870
with who we are in
an uncontrived way.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.780
So many things we
do in our lives

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.050
are contrived attempts at
becoming something else.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:53.270
But meditation brings us back to
the natural state of who we are

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.860
and what we're made out of.

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:58.110
And I think that can become a
stepping stone for developing

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.440
further qualities.

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.260
For example, I mentioned
awareness earlier.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.770
The awareness that we
develop through meditation

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.950
is an awareness of the
reality that we all

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:13.000
depend upon each other.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.100
For example, when
we become more aware

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.090
of our breath in meditation,
then we naturally

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.230
become more aware of the fact
that our breath isn't just

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.670
this autonomously
existent thing.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.710
It depends on other
phenomenon in order to arise.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.720
We might develop
an appreciation,

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.810
for example, that
the air we breathe

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:34.550
comes to us from
plants, and so forth.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:38.330
And so in this way, meditation
deepens our appreciation

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.030
with the interdependent
reality of things.

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.320
We make a much
stronger connection

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.710
with that appreciation
and that becomes

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:51.910
the springboard for compassion.

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:55.220
MALE SPEAKER 1: I like that.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.420
So I'm going to ask about
mindfulness-- your opinion

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.050
of mindfulness in the West.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.080
As you know, mindfulness
has become very popular

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.230
in the West, especially
in companies.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.260
Even here in Google
we have a program

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.150
called "Search Inside Yourself",
which is based on mindfulness.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:11.110
And beyond that we're also doing
things we're talking about.

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:13.180
Shamatha-- clearing the mind.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.320
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], insight,
and [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.400
innocent compassion.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.430
So I want to know your opinion
of the mindfulness movement

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.900
in the West, and
whether there's anything

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.870
you think should be
encouraged and anything

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.480
we should be careful about.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.550
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Mindfulness.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.510
Can you talk a little
bit of mindfulness.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.970
Everybody have mindfulness.

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:37.585

00:20:41.712 --> 00:20:44.170
MALE SPEAKER 1: In Pali, I
think it's [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:46.336
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:22:13.685 --> 00:22:15.310
TRANSLATOR: So just
to say a little bit

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.351
about mindfulness itself.

00:22:16.351 --> 00:22:19.910
Of course mindfulness is a
very well-known phenomenon

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:22.240
these days and I
think most of us

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.700
have a basic understanding
of what it means.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.960
But you could say for
nontraditional perspective

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:32.690
or from commonly presented
perspective of what's

00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.999
in the Buddha's
teachings we can say

00:22:34.999 --> 00:22:37.540
that an essential meaning of my
influences that it teaches us

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.970
how to take care
of our mind or how

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:43.420
to give our mind some
guidance so in the beginning

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:45.410
our mind has these
traits which are quite

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:50.030
similar to a small child small
child needs to small children

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:52.265
need some guidance
and some boundaries

00:22:52.265 --> 00:22:54.140
if they don't have any
guidance or boundaries

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.370
and they can get into trouble
so mindfulness is a method

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:01.250
to take good care of
our mind and give it

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.400
some kind of guidelines.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:10.047
And in that way, understand
it's true state more clearly.

00:23:10.047 --> 00:23:11.880
MALE SPEAKER 1: I have
so questions for you,

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.750
but I promised them I'd give
them time to ask you questions.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.840
I'm trying to cut down my
question-- my one question.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.530
I'm interested to know about
what you think about science.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:22.110
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Science?

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.750
MALE SPEAKER 1: Yes, so-- we
have a common friend, Richard

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:25.250
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:27.360
I know we're going to visit him.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:32.270
He is a pioneer of the
newer science of meditation.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:35.540
So I'm interested to
know are you excited,

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.720
are you concerned, that
meditation is becoming

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.404
a field of scientific inquiry?

00:23:40.404 --> 00:23:42.570
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:26:02.578 --> 00:26:05.230
TRANSLATOR: Of course
science and spirituality

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.710
have different
ways of proceeding

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.240
to their respective goals.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:14.270
And we don't need to have
the same way of proceeding,

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:18.380
and we don't need to merge these
two disciplines or fields such

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:21.320
that they then share
the exact same goals

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.350
or have the exact
same methodologies

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.070
or produce the
exact same results.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:34.010
However, I think that they can
be beneficial to each other.

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.430
Now, I'm not sure whether
it's important or not

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:40.750
in terms of the
notion of science

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.387
being able to prove the ideas
of Buddhism, for example.

00:26:44.387 --> 00:26:46.220
I'm not really sure
whether that's important

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:51.080
or not, but what I would say
is that not only Buddhism

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.910
but many ancient spiritual
traditions have been spending

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.960
all of this time
throughout history focusing

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.390
on the inner world
of the mind, and I

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:02.930
think that can be a good
resource for further research

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:06.820
that can be used by science.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:12.000
In any case, both science and
the great spiritual traditions

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.550
share the same
goal of performing

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.240
a good service for
the world and making

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.120
a better future for everyone.

00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.310
So I think there's a lot
of harmonious opportunities

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.890
that can be explored there.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:24.470
And I myself have been to
the Mind and Life conference

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.885
a few times, and I see
a lot of potential.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.100
MALE SPEAKER 1: So I'm
going to shift gears now

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.250
to changing the world.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.780
Specifically, how you
are changing the world.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.540
You recently announced
that you were

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.860
established full ordination
for women in your lineage.

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.271
To us that's very exciting.

00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:49.520
Can you tell us more about it?

00:27:56.404 --> 00:27:58.570
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:30:34.442 --> 00:30:37.050
TRANSLATOR: Right now, I feel
like I'm taking small steps

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.970
or beginning to
take small steps.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.270
In Tibet, as well as many
other Buddhist countries

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:44.360
throughout history, women
have faced difficulty

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.685
in achieving the status of
full monastic ordination.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:55.700
And there are some
areas where people

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.800
have been striving to make
improvements and change this.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.230
And in some other
areas the status quo

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:05.676
is being allowed to
remain up until now.

00:31:05.676 --> 00:31:07.050
But from the
Tibetan perspective,

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:08.810
it's been hundreds
of years since women

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:12.830
have been able to achieve
or receive full ordination.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:17.680
And I think that this is a very
important situation to remedy.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.660
His Holiness the
Dalai Lama, as well as

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.720
many other Tibetan
Buddhist leaders,

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.840
have been putting
efforts into this.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.860
And therefore I think
it's very important.

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:33.240
Because of course, there are
many, many women practitioners

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.460
of Buddhism who have
great faith in the dharma

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:41.600
and should be properly seated
as leaders in their communities,

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.180
and the status of
full ordination

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.160
is a very important
position of leadership.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.290
And so I think it's worthy of
effort from that perspective,

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:53.229
and therefore I'm going
to put as much effort

00:31:53.229 --> 00:31:54.770
in accordance with
whatever abilities

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:58.320
I have to help make
this change, to help

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.460
bring this change about.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:04.770
In general, these
days we're observing

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:09.550
a lot of rapidly changing
dynamics regarding

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.630
women and leadership.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:16.720
We've observed various countries
having female heads of state,

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.540
female leaders of
government, presidents,

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:20.980
prime ministers, and so forth.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.945
And ongoing discussions
in certain countries

00:32:23.945 --> 00:32:26.320
about whether that would be
permissible, in certain other

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.370
countries about whether
that would be possible

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:30.420
and when it would
happen and so forth.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.780
And I really see the
status of full ordination

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.890
as a similar level of
leadership for women to hold

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:39.050
and that's why I think
it's important for society.

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.970
MALE SPEAKER 1:
You're very humble.

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:41.730
You do a lot.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:42.230
Thank you.

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:45.562 --> 00:32:46.520
You're very humble.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.019
That's big.

00:32:47.019 --> 00:32:49.420
But to you-- you know
what would be really cool?

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.172
For the 18th Karmapa
to be a woman.

00:32:52.172 --> 00:32:54.036

00:32:54.908 --> 00:32:56.366

00:32:56.366 --> 00:32:58.217

saw this here first.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:26.460
TRANSLATOR: Since there's 900
years of history behind me,

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.642
I don't know if I can make an
immediate change, of course.

00:33:29.642 --> 00:33:32.100
I think I might have to meditate
for a longer time in order

00:33:32.100 --> 00:33:32.940
to be able to do that.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.106
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.200
TRANSLATOR: So I think from
a Buddhist perspective,

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.866
if we look at the
teachings of Buddhism,

00:33:53.866 --> 00:33:56.500
there's no problem
at all in that,

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.680
in having the subsequent
Karmapa being a female.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.970
But from a societal
perspective, I sometimes

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:06.213
wonder what kind of
difficulties there would be.

00:34:06.213 --> 00:34:08.139
MALE SPEAKER 1: That's
very thoughtful.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:08.639
Let's see.

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.860
I have two more questions
before we open up.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.321
So the three things
I admire about you.

00:34:13.321 --> 00:34:15.570
And there are more than
three, but the three big ones.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.780
I admire your progressive,
your open mind.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.949
I admire your work
towards women's rights.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.764
And the third thing I admire
about you is environmentalism

00:34:25.764 --> 00:34:29.409
You're known to be a very
avid environmentalist.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:32.170
So the question here is,
my friend-- Your Holiness--

00:37:15.351 --> 00:37:15.850
Sorry.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:16.495
TRANSLATOR: No, no.

00:37:16.495 --> 00:37:16.994
I'm sorry.

00:37:16.994 --> 00:37:18.020
I'm sorry.

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:22.385
MALE SPEAKER 1: Your Sorry-ness.

00:37:22.385 --> 00:37:24.135
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Sorry-ness.

00:37:24.135 --> 00:37:29.811
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:29.811 --> 00:37:31.600
TRANSLATOR: So the
environmental issue

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.450
is of course a global issue.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:36.000
It's a huge issue for
everyone on the planet

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.280
and for the planet itself.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:40.050
And therefore I see my
activities in relation

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:43.970
to this as very small,
humble activities.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.600
But nevertheless, Tibet is a
little bit of a special place

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.860
in terms of the environment.

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.570
Particularly for Asia, it's
known as a treasury of rivers

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:55.080
because it's the source
of so many Asian rivers.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.110
And it's known also
as the third pole,

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:00.770
because of the
important role that it's

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:02.730
glaciers and so on play.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:06.180
So since Tibet is this
very important place

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.390
for the environment,
I think it's good

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:12.330
if monks and nuns can begin
some of the transformations that

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:14.810
need to occur in terms
of our living style.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:17.400
And monks the nuns have a
special opportunity and ability

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.980
to lead the people and lead
the way in this regard.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.290
So therefore, I'm
doing the best I

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:26.630
can to help change some of our
practices at our monasteries

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:29.270
and make the monks and
nuns more aware of what

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.730
needs to change with
regard to the environment,

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:37.080
with the wish that that will
slowly begin to extend outward.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:44.420
So things haven't gone along
perfectly in the exact manner

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.510
that I would have hoped, but
we're making our best efforts

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:54.200
and progressing
along slowly in this.

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.520
Basically with the environment,
the important point for us

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:01.310
to understand is that
not changing anything

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.370
about our lifestyle, yet doing
a few things here and there

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.430
for the environment is
not really going to help.

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.280
That's not going
to be sufficient.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.990
What's required is the change
in the way that we live.

00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.490
A change in our style of living.

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:15.300
And in order to do
that, we have to work

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.591
on transforming our motivation.

00:39:19.125 --> 00:39:21.500
MALE SPEAKER 1: I have one
more question for His Holiness

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:22.980
before I open up to the floor.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.720
So if you want to, you can
start lining up now at the mike.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.550
So the last question
for Your Holiness.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:34.269
What can we, Google and the
Silicon Valley, do to help you?

00:39:34.269 --> 00:39:35.685
HIS HOLINESS THE
17TH KARMAPA: Oh.

00:39:40.865 --> 00:39:41.740
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:40:38.197 --> 00:40:41.160
TRANSLATOR: This is my first
time visiting Google today,

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.445
so I'm already overwhelmed
by its vastness.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:50.540
And basically I just want
to say thank you to Google

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.330
for having me as a guest here.

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:57.550
Google, of course, is a
very influential company.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:02.150
And it's doing very
positive influential things

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:06.830
in terms of it's
practices in relation

00:41:06.830 --> 00:41:10.650
to society and relation
to human well being.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:14.470
And therefore I'd like to offer
these words and sentiments

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:17.280
of praise toward Google for
that and thank them for that.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.770
But other than
that, I don't have

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:20.587
any special requests to make.

00:41:20.587 --> 00:41:21.670
MALE SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.605
Anything I can for you,
you tell me off stage.

00:41:23.605 --> 00:41:25.480
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.424
Privately.

00:41:26.424 --> 00:41:29.200
[LAUGHTER] Thank you, thank you.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.470
MALE SPEAKER 1: So we
have some Dory questions,

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.010
and so best alternate life
question and then Dory

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.675
question.

00:41:34.675 --> 00:41:35.300
Yes, my friend.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:36.642
JD.

00:41:36.642 --> 00:41:38.850
AUDIENCE: Your Holiness,
thank you for your presence.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:39.750
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Thank you.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.570
AUDIENCE: On the
topic of meditation,

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:43.560
I have a couple of questions.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.650
I'm a student of the
Six Yogas of Naropa

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:51.472
and been learning about the
practice of tummo meditation.

00:41:51.472 --> 00:41:52.930
And so I wondered
if you could talk

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:56.760
about the benefits of tummo
meditation and perhaps

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.120
any advice for a
westerner wishing

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.742
to practice tummo-- inner fire.

00:42:02.742 --> 00:42:04.200
HIS HOLINESS THE
17TH KARMAPA: Wow.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.130
MALE SPEAKER 1:
It's a hot question.

00:42:06.130 --> 00:42:07.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.126
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:36.730
TRANSLATOR: Firstly, I haven't
done any practice of tummo

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:42.150
for myself, so I can't
explain in great detail

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:43.820
about that practice.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.990
But what I would
say in general is

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:51.350
that there's different
ways in Buddhism

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:55.490
we approach taming our
mind or calming our mind.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:44:01.830
One is in reliance on the
prana, or the inner winds,

00:44:01.830 --> 00:44:04.800
and then one is by working
with the mind itself.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:07.760
So working with the mind
itself to tame our mind

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.210
is the safe way to
relate to our mind

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:11.920
in the context of meditation.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.487
It takes a little bit more time.

00:44:13.487 --> 00:44:15.320
You need a little bit
more patience in order

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:18.460
to transform your mind that
way, but if you stick with it

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.580
you can do it and
there's less danger.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.310
The Six Dharmas
of Naropa, and in

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:26.090
particular the
practice of tummo,

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:28.250
falls into the
category of relying

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:31.860
on the pranas, or inner winds,
in order to transform the mind.

00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.760
And that's a more
dangerous approach.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:38.140
You get to the desired result,
it is said, in a faster way.

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.900
But because you're
going faster, it's

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.470
also more dangerous
at the same time.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:44.970
So greater caution
needs to be applied

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.590
when taking that approach.

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:48.490
But if you have
that proper caution

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.790
and if you regard
that practice not just

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:54.230
as being about inner heat
or something like this,

00:44:54.230 --> 00:45:02.370
but as a method for further
enhancing and establishing

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:06.460
peace of mind, and
peace in our mind,

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:09.822
then such practices can
definitely be beneficial.

00:45:09.822 --> 00:45:11.530
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Thank you.

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:11.850
MALE SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:13.050
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Thank you.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:14.610
MALE SPEAKER 1: So
this is a question

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:18.620
that was sent through the
net-- our internal internet.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:23.380
This is asked by [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.700
When we or our loved
ones face suffering

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.540
from incurable diseases,
disability, or death,

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:34.020
how can we best
ease the suffering

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.080
and help with healing?

00:45:37.504 --> 00:45:39.670
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.045
TRANSLATOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:45:44.004 --> 00:45:46.170
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:47:33.792 --> 00:47:35.860
TRANSLATOR: So yes,
we do have difficulty

00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:39.330
accepting very difficult
situations that befall us,

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:41.600
including death.

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.240
Generally speaking
of course, death

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.730
is a part of the
natural cycle of things,

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.060
even though we don't
want to experience it.

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.760
But by virtue of being born
into this body that means

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.620
this body is going to die.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:57.420
So therefore I think
some type of training

00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:01.220
in the recognition of the
inevitability of death

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:05.210
is very important and
can be very beneficial.

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:09.800
Some type of training and
employment of our imagination

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:13.390
to get used to
this idea of death,

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:18.100
and to regard our own human
life as simply a process that

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.360
includes death.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.420
And that way we can come
to see, if we become

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.020
familiar with
thinking in this way,

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.890
we can come to see death
not as an insult or instance

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:32.790
of becoming conquered, but as
a natural part of the process

00:48:32.790 --> 00:48:33.920
that is our life.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:36.086
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.400
TRANSLATOR: And to
help us do this,

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.864
we can use our imagination
to regard one day

00:48:44.864 --> 00:48:46.155
as being like a whole lifetime.

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:54.770
AUDIENCE: Your Holiness,
thank you for your time today.

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.270
In your opinion, what's
the greatest threat

00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:59.555
to our planet and
our human existence?

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:04.920
HIS HOLINESS THE
17TH KARMAPA: Wow.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.795
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:50:33.126 --> 00:50:36.020
TRANSLATOR: Well, there are
many dangers to the world

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:40.840
and to beings on the planet that
we could think of and identify.

00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:44.070
Of course, sometimes there's
terrible natural disasters

00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:45.610
that occur and so forth.

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:49.080
But I think even more
severe than all of that

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:54.000
is the harms that are
inflicted on the planet

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.670
through the selfishness
of human beings.

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:01.000
If we look at how many changes
the planet has undergone

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.430
since the time humans
have been inhabiting it,

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:07.050
it's a relatively
short time span,

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:09.660
but we can see that there's
been great changes that

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:11.460
have been brought to
the planet and have

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:15.970
been caused to the planet
by the conduct of humans.

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:18.200
If this was just a
natural cycle of change,

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:22.460
I think things would be changing
at a much different rate.

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:27.310
So therefore I think
generally speaking

00:51:27.310 --> 00:51:30.940
that if we don't find
a way to transform

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:36.400
our own desires as human beings
or put a limit on our desires,

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.547
then that spells great
danger for the planet.

00:51:38.547 --> 00:51:39.630
MALE SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:44.150
So this is another
Dory question.

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:46.300
This one comes from Doug.

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:49.660
Buddhism has been a presence
in America for 150 years

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.300
and in the past decades
has become widespread.

00:51:52.300 --> 00:51:57.080
So given that, might we expect
a homegrown super meditator,

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.020
some sort of America Milarepa?

TRANSLATOR: Well, I think such
a thing as definitely possible.

00:54:03.050 --> 00:54:05.400
There's nothing
impossible about it.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.000
On the other hand,
my general feeling

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:15.070
is that there are more
obstacles then there

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:17.340
are favorable conditions
for such a thing

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:19.570
to arise at this
point, because there's

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:24.680
a lot of materialistic focus
in general in our society,

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:25.580
and so forth.

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:27.410
So there are some obstacles.

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:30.530
At the same time,
what can happen

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:33.900
is that sometimes no matter
how strong the obstacles are,

00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:39.280
then the individuals
ability grows that much more

00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.270
to counter those obstacles.

00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:44.540
So nothing is impossible
in that regard.

00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.680
But another thing
to note is that we

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.640
may have great spiritual
practitioners among us,

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:51.780
but maybe they're
not very well known

00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.030
or don't have a lot of fame.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:55.940
And at the same time,
we have to acknowledge

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.810
that just because
individuals are famous,

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:01.390
that doesn't mean they're
necessarily great in terms

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:03.380
of their spiritual qualities.

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.280
So I think that
the identification

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:07.670
of a great spiritual
master needs

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:10.740
to happen very personal level.

00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.850
And we might not be
able to spot them

00:55:12.850 --> 00:55:16.485
in the same way we
would spot a superhero.

00:55:16.485 --> 00:55:18.110
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Anybody in the audience

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:20.570
who turns out to be a great
meditator or superhero,

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:25.211
please come talk to us after
the talk so we can identify you.

00:55:25.211 --> 00:55:27.055
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:27.977 --> 00:55:30.530
AUDIENCE: Your Holiness, it's
been a great pleasure for me

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:32.570
to meet you in person.

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:36.690
I watched the documentary
about your previous incarnation

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:39.410
and how they find your
present incarnation

00:55:39.410 --> 00:55:42.230
and I find it very fascinating.

00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:45.240
My question today is
that, personally I

00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.450
feel that there's a great
loss of ancient wisdoms

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:52.930
despite of the human
advancement in recent years.

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:55.040
It's become much
harder for people

00:55:55.040 --> 00:56:00.890
to pursue spiritually and have
control over their lives--

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:04.320
to go into the mountain to
meditate 10, 20 or more years

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.970
to reach spiritual
enlightenment.

00:56:06.970 --> 00:56:09.700
So I was wondering what's
your advice for people

00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:12.940
who find it hard to
control of their lives,

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:18.270
and do you personally find it
harder to pursue spiritually

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:22.930
because of the tremendous amount
of responsibilities and burdens

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:23.524
that you have?

00:56:23.524 --> 00:56:25.690
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:58:27.405 --> 00:58:28.780
TRANSLATOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:58:36.794 --> 00:58:38.960
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:59:27.315 --> 00:59:30.410
TRANSLATOR: Well to answer
your later question first,

00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:34.030
I do find it difficult myself
to practice spirituality

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:35.870
in this modern age.

00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:37.610
From one perspective,
you could say

00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:39.780
that I live in a
spiritual environment

00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:42.150
because I'm a leader of
a spiritual tradition

00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:45.360
and so I have certain
elements of spirituality

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:47.060
in my physical environment.

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:50.421
But from another perspective,
because I'm a spiritual leader,

00:59:50.421 --> 00:59:51.920
these days you have
to deal with all

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:57.020
kinds of politics and comings
and goings and relations that

00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.760
are sometimes
unsavory and so forth.

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:04.010
So what that leads
me to realize is

01:00:04.010 --> 01:00:06.180
that there's a great
deal that's contingent

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.940
upon our own motivation.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:11.350
If we don't have a strong,
positive motivation

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:13.240
from our own side, then
it's very difficult

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:16.140
to practice spirituality
because the environment has

01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:19.890
such a strong manipulative
effect on our mind.

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:23.090
So sometimes when people are
in a very peaceful environment

01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:25.210
where there's not a
lot of distraction

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:27.590
or maybe not a lot of
outer a development

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:31.640
in that particular area, they
can practice spirituality well.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:34.520
But if they go to a place
where everything is abundant

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:37.570
and there are more distractions,
then their spiritual practice

01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:40.060
starts to fade away.

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.630
And I think that this
is my own shortcoming

01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:48.640
as well that perhaps I have,
just as much as anyone else.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.870
And therefore I think
it's very important for us

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:56.370
to create a supportive
environment for ourselves that

01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:59.886
matches our intention to
practice spirituality.

01:00:59.886 --> 01:01:01.260
In the traditional
Buddhist text,

01:01:01.260 --> 01:01:04.400
they talk about going to an
isolated place to meditate,

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.170
for example.

01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:08.870
In a modern context, when you're
sharing an apartment or house

01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:10.630
with another person,
even if there's only

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:13.049
two people inside
the residence, you

01:01:13.049 --> 01:01:15.090
talk about how you're
going to split up the space

01:01:15.090 --> 01:01:17.250
so you can have your
own private area.

01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:19.460
So in the same way I think
it's very important for us

01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:22.570
to create physical
space for ourselves

01:01:22.570 --> 01:01:26.296
so that we can do
things such as meditate.

01:01:26.296 --> 01:01:28.110
MALE SPEAKER 1:
Thank you very much.

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:30.740
This next question is relevant
to what you just said.

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.290
It is, what are the most
effective meditation

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.354
techniques that you have used?

01:01:35.354 --> 01:01:37.520
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:01:56.702 --> 01:01:58.660
TRANSLATOR: I don't have
any special techniques

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:02.610
that I rely on in a
continuous way all the time.

01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:04.570
Meditation techniques
are something

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:06.112
that just kind of
come and go for me.

01:02:06.112 --> 01:02:08.278
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:02:08.278 --> 01:02:10.684
MALE SPEAKER 1: What's a
current technique that you--

01:02:10.684 --> 01:02:12.050
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:13.800
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Very smart.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.586
MALE SPEAKER 1: Dealing
with difficuly people.

01:02:17.586 --> 01:02:20.194
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: Current technique.

01:02:20.194 --> 01:02:22.700
Wow.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.680
Forgot.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.330
Forgot.

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:31.410
I actually, I don't have
any special technique.

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.535
Maybe just like--
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:57.190
TRANSLATOR: So if you
could call it a technique,

01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:00.600
I find that the
main thing I do is,

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:03.490
when I notice that I'm
feeling strong emotions,

01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:07.270
that I try to not follow
after the emotionality of it,

01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:13.420
but instead sustain a feeling
of relaxation within that.

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:16.100
MALE SPEAKER 1: That's good.

01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:17.810
You have the last live question.

01:03:17.810 --> 01:03:20.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for visiting us,

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:22.140
and hope you come back again.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:27.230
My question is, Silicon Valley's
known for its innovation,

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:28.900
and we consider
that innovation has

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:32.500
a lot of similarities to
meditation-- deep focus,

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.150
searching for answers.

01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:38.490
But at the same time, it also
has a lot of material focus.

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:42.070
Do you think there's a
trade off between innovation

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:45.190
in the Western sense versus
doing good for humanity

01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:46.351
through meditation?

01:03:46.351 --> 01:03:47.934
HIS HOLINESS THE
17TH KARMAPA: Mm-hmm.

01:03:47.934 --> 01:03:49.309
TRANSLATOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:04:15.994 --> 01:04:18.160
HIS HOLINESS THE 17TH
KARMAPA: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:52.655
TRANSLATOR: There
definitely can be

01:05:52.655 --> 01:05:55.510
a lot of overlap
between innovation

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:57.030
and what you might
call a wholesome

01:05:57.030 --> 01:06:01.665
intention or pure intention
of the path of spirituality.

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:06.950
In fact, if we
look at innovation

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:11.400
I think we can see that most
of the great brilliant ideas

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:15.570
from the innovators of society
occur to them when their minds

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:17.730
are relaxed and open.

01:06:17.730 --> 01:06:21.770
And in the same way, the best
of our wholesome intentions

01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:25.910
and altruistic
states of our heart

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:29.230
occur when our minds
are open and spacious.

01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:32.420
So I think these two,
innovation and pure intention,

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:37.350
are close cousins or
relatives with each other.

01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:41.320
When we appreciate our
interconnectedness,

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:46.700
we can further develop
natural altruism,

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:49.600
which can be known
by another name

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.166
that we might call
responsibility.

01:06:52.166 --> 01:06:54.140
MALE SPEAKER 1: Your
Holiness, any last words

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:54.946
for the audience?

01:06:54.946 --> 01:06:56.834
HIS HOLINESS THE
