00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.029
Every get told your internet friends aren’t
real?

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.140
Yeah me too.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.040
I think otherwise, but let’s take a look
at what the science has to say.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.150
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.660
Having friends is incredibly important to
your health, I mean humans are social creatures.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.640
A recent study published in the journal Perspectives
on Psychological Science showed that those

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.170
who spend more time alone have a greater risk
of dying.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.630
Researchers from Harvard Medical School say
that strong relationships are “every bit

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.850
as powerful as adequate sleep, a good diet,
and not smoking.”

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.649
But in today’s digital age, do internet
friends count as real friends?

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.670
Recent research from Stanford University found
that when people connect in online communities,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.600
they initially trust strangers but that trust
erodes over time.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.340
The looked at a popular website, Couchsurfing
and found that rating systems initially create

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.570
trust between strangers but once people have
a lot of reviews, it’s harder to build stronger

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.570
social ties.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:56.691
And this makes some sense.

00:00:56.691 --> 00:01:00.129
I mean if you’re about to sleep on a stranger’s
couch you want to know that other people had

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.129
good experience there.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.640
(and that they aren’t going to kill you
or anything) but on the other hand it could

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.610
make experiences and relationships more predictable.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.110
I feel like there’s a lot of bias against
having internet friends.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.250
My own mother tells me that they’re not
real.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.250
Like WHAT!?

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.250
Come on.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.420
Other people think this too, one NYT article
claimed that shared experience is the basis

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.520
of good friendships.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.909
But science shows that sharing personal information
creates strong social ties.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.810
Researchers call this self-disclosure.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.079
When you share something about yourself it
feels good and some studies show it might

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.480
make people like you more.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.550
But it also makes you like the person you
told your secret to more.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.649
Research seems to be up in the air about trust
between internet buddies.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.540
Some studies show that people actually share
more intimate details with their friends online

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.540
than in face to face.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.720
It’s kind of a way to overcompensate for
the lack of physical intimacy.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.720
but other studies show the opposite.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.759
One study published in the Public Library
of Science compared the effects on happiness

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.829
of real life friends and online friends.

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.730
The study found that on-line friends have
zero or negative correlations with subjective

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.730
well-being.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.960
But to be fair the average age of that study
was 45.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.890
I think the youths have a very different way
of interacting on Facebook, reddit, tumblr

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.820
, whatever than older adults..

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.369
But at the end of the day, friendship is personal.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.020
One study published in the journal Computers
in Human Behavior found that social networks

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.590
provide just another way to connect with people
and that this connectedness is associated

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.050
with lower depression and anxiety and greater
life satisfaction.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.160
And those internet friends can turn into IRL
friends, one study showed that 30% of people

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.920
will meet up with their online pals.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.910
Anecdotally, I have a great community of internet
friends, (HI SAN) some of whom I’ve met

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.120
IRL and have become my best friends.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.160
So what do you think?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.450
Do you have internet friends?

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.020
Let us know …..
