1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:05,050
Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:07,400
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,250
ah,

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:15,020
just checking in. Oh, you,
what's going on? How are Ya?

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:18,260
There's some happy people out there.
There's some sad people out.

6
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:22,790
There was a wonderful couple of days
of soccer. Here are the World Cop,

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,750
France or Hall Beats Belgium

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:32,750
and England falls to Croatia.
It's coming,

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,550
omits calming. Oh my folly. Looked it
up to see like why do they keep saying

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,350
that it's coming home?

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,630
You know,
I immediately assume like,

12
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:48,631
well obviously England must've won the
most championships and this is their

13
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:53,110
arrogant fucking way of being like, yeah,
this is where it rightfully belongs.

14
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:58,150
Kind of like when the Yankees win a
world series and then all those fucking

15
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:03,151
talking heads on on Espn
logo and everything is all
is right in baseball again.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,880
It's why.
Why?

17
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:11,881
Because a toward had million dollar team
on a fucking play off series play off.

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,920
Turns out that's not what it is.

19
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,230
Evidently the game of soccer now
this might our football footie,

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,030
whatever the fuck you call it.

21
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,900
Evidently it was according to the English.

22
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,780
It was created in England.

23
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,800
They were the ones who decided despite
the fact that you have four limbs,

24
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:39,620
you can only use two.
They wanted a degree of difficulty.

25
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:41,900
They weren't like the animals over here.

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,340
You know where we get bored and
they're like, pick it up, you know,

27
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,570
tackle them, which meant jump on his
back and throw him to the fucking ground.

28
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:52,900
I now tackle over there
as you trip somebody,

29
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,710
you stick your foot out in your triple.
So evidently it started over there.

30
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:58,791
That's what they're saying.

31
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,980
So that's what it meant because I
thought it meant that they had the most

32
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:04,760
championships. And then I looked
up all time World Cup champions.

33
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,240
All right. What you gotta do?
How the fuck do you not to do?

34
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:10,490
I don't give a fuck what the sport is.
I want to know who dominated.

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,810
Turns out Brazil since
1930 they won the most.

36
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:19,811
They've won five 58 60 to 70 94 2002
which is a fucking lot considering it's

37
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:26,780
every four years. How many have
there been? One, two, three,

38
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:31,280
four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 1520.

39
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,620
This is a 21st one.
They've won 21,

40
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:38,621
like whatever fucking was at
20% of 25% of them than Germany.

41
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,140
Auntie. Yeah, they, they
got for Italy has four. Oh,

42
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,620
they should have had five in
[inaudible] 94 I remember that one. Uh,

43
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,720
Argentina hand, God, that
guy, whatever his name was.

44
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,670
Uh, the hell was that guy's
name? Diego or some shit.

45
00:02:58,671 --> 00:03:00,430
What the fuck was his name?
I used to know his name.

46
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:02,610
Okay.

47
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,010
And were those fucking names where it's
just like the second they gave him that

48
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,390
his name is just like, pussy is going
to be rated down on this guy. Right.

49
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,940
Um, I forget the hand to God
guy. That guy, it was weird.

50
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:18,700
He was like in shape and he also look fat.
What the fuck was his name?

51
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,083
Okay.

52
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,000
Diego Era Gamo was something like that.
I can't fucking remember. Then. Uh,

53
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:29,290
I got my hope. I say this right. I
always, always was Uruguay urgh away,

54
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,720
won it twice. And then England,
France, and Spain of all one at once.

55
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,460
That's interesting cause I thought Spain
was a powerhouse and I would've thought

56
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,920
in England when a bunch way back in the
day when it's probably just a bunch of

57
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,000
white guys running around.
Right? Yeah. I also don't want,

58
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:49,060
so that's why they say it's coming home.
It's not some arrogant shit. It's like,

59
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:52,030
Hey, you know, this game at the
whole world loves, you know,

60
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,450
not to pat ourselves on the back,
but guess what? We came up with it.

61
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,630
It's our shit. Okay. Every, you
know, you know what I mean? You know,

62
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:04,240
it's not just all about colonization.
The caste system.

63
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:05,740
Yeah.

64
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,230
And it's slaving people of other colors
around the world. It's not just about,

65
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:15,160
that's not all we did. Okay. Yay.

66
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:18,430
Hey, you want to focus on the
negative? You can do that. Okay.

67
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,490
But you can't deny that the beautiful
game of football known as soccer rover

68
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:29,440
here in the states as we sit
around eating Arby's, right.

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,260
Was evidently created in England.

70
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,810
I don't know when they did it.

71
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:44,660
You'd think for it to have a World Cup
by 1934 to sweep the fucking nation.

72
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,980
Wait a minute.

73
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:47,610
Yeah.

74
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,380
They also had an empire back then. Oh, I
get it. So they came up with this game.

75
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,020
They'd come in,
they'd fucking take you over.

76
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,230
They'd fucking kill a bunch of
people. And everybody was like, man,

77
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:02,250
these guys are fucking assholes,
man. Settle down. Settle down.

78
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,710
We're gonna teach you a little game.
All right? You can't use your arms.

79
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,860
A lot of you had your arms chopped
off because you couldn't find any gold

80
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,460
anyways. So this is going to work
real well for you all. I can use it.

81
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,200
Your fate in your fucking had

82
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,390
and the game spread like
wildfire across the globe

83
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,820
as England expanded her empire.

84
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,500
I never understood why it was considered
female. Was that the tone it down?

85
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,320
There was a bunch of Luna tick guys going
around the world going and this is a

86
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:40,980
nice place to live. Too Bad. There's other
people here. What can we do about this?

87
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,450
Everybody does it right? Everybody's
done it since the beginning of time. You,

88
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,040
you go back,
you go back far enough in history books.

89
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,410
This is what all guilty white
people do. Everybody. Yeah.

90
00:05:52,411 --> 00:05:55,830
You know a Africans and slave, the other
African jewelry. Would you say that shit,

91
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:01,280
try get past it. You know it's like the
Billy Joel Song. We didn't start the fire,

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,340
which has got to be the most classic,

93
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,490
the most classic fucking
baby boomer response. I mean,

94
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:14,360
what a fucking baby. He couldn't even
take a little bit of responsibility,

95
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,650
you know, hey, you know we,

96
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:20,440
we can start here and he
starts naming all this shit.

97
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,480
Half of it is like pop stars
like Marilyn Monroe. What did,

98
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,480
what did she have to
do with foreign policy?

99
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,750
I know she fucked a couple of
Kennedy's but I mean other than that,

100
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,380
I don't think that dictated
whether or not we went into Cuba.

101
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,110
Doris Day fucking
[inaudible] to Bubba.

102
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,660
Papa trouble into sue as the fucky.

103
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,030
He must've been on blow what he
wrote that song. It's like, Billy,

104
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:51,050
are you going to take any responsibility
for the self centered cons that the

105
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,950
baby boom generation was? I'm not saying
everything you did was bad. I mean,

106
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,360
he invented the Frisbee,
right?

107
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:58,610
Was that you guys or was
that the greatest generation?

108
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,563
Yeah.

109
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:00,910
I don't know.

110
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,050
Somewhere in there there's gotta be
truth right from the greatest generation.

111
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:06,430
Okay.

112
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:09,880
You know, that generation also didn't
want to play baseball. Jackie Robinson,

113
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:14,590
by the way, uh, to the
baby boomers who are,

114
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,580
you know, widely considered the
most selfish cons, you know,

115
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,050
this country has ever produced, right?
Just sitting around staring at the navel,

116
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,400
you know, this is the dawning
of the age of Aquarius,

117
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,890
right? That's the same
generation that gave us hippies,

118
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,240
but truly Birkenstocks,
you know,

119
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:44,060
fucking in the mud at a concert. I used
to have a theory way back in the day,

120
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:47,990
you know, when they talked about HIV and
aids, they always said that, you know,

121
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,780
it was some, somebody, you know,

122
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,000
always try something about a monkey or
some shit and some guy in France. Got It.

123
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,020
Um, I never thought it was then. I
used to have a theory that, you know,

124
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,710
if you watch the woodstocks tapes and
you just see all those naked white people

125
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,840
rolling around fucking each
other in the mud, I mean,

126
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,070
he can't tell me that something
didn't come out of that, you know,

127
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,260
at least a stronger strain of the mumps.
Right.

128
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,940
So anyways, to get back to it,
you know, I was, I was, uh,

129
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,860
working as an actor.

130
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,950
I was acting during the last couple of
days and I was talking to this dude going

131
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:24,550
like,
yeah,

132
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,760
how come England keeps saying it's coming
home when they were talking about the

133
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,410
World Cup? And he goes, is
that what they're saying?

134
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:35,360
Those colonizing constantly
fucking dude went off. No.

135
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,060
It's just like, you know, white
people when we're not all bad. I mean,

136
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,560
there's some things,
you know,

137
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:45,540
Blue Windows curtains, you know,
we've done some nice things,

138
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,770
you know, now you can look out
your house and see all the,

139
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,620
the lack of opportunity, right. Right.
From inside your house without people.

140
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,470
Am I actually taking credit for
windows? I Dunno. I have no idea.

141
00:09:01,471 --> 00:09:04,920
I don't read. Oh, speaking
of which, oh my God.

142
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,540
Oh my God.

143
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,080
I said on my last podcast that the
Obama's bought an $82 million house.

144
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,500
Turned out it was an eight
point $1 million house.

145
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,860
It wasn't even 8.2 million.

146
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,700
That's how off I was and
this is my favorite thing.

147
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:28,470
So now all these people are
like, what? They're all gone.

148
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:32,910
Why don't you do your fucking homework
man? Like nothing makes people flip out.

149
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,750
Not even religion, unless you make fun
of Muslims to those fucking lunatics.

150
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:40,530
A liable to do something,
but fucking if you make,

151
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:44,910
if you make fun of like
a Democrat or Republican,

152
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:47,280
nothing brings people out of the woodwork.
So all these people are like,

153
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:49,680
why don't you do your fucking homework?
Blah Blah. Which is hilarious.

154
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,860
This whole podcast is based
on me not doing any homework,

155
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,230
not reading whatsoever.

156
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,020
So I'm just going to tell
you political concept there.

157
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,170
You've got a lot of fucking nerve.
A lot.

158
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:05,070
I just said AIDS came for white people
fucking in the mud at Woodstock.

159
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,530
Are you going to come back at
me on that one? What did you do?

160
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,360
Your fucking homework,
man.

161
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,270
Okay.

162
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,290
This whole podcast exists for
one reason and one reason only.

163
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:18,720
It's to make you feel smarter.
Ice.

164
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,440
We here at the Monday
morning podcast and by we,

165
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:24,860
I mean me in the voices in
my head that agree with me.

166
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,591
We hear it.

167
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:31,150
The Monday morning podcast set
the bar so low that even you,

168
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,160
you know with that college that you went
to that advertised on television and

169
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:41,550
you drove yourself there and they like
living there was not even an option.

170
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,270
They didn't have dorms.
They just, you know,

171
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:48,570
was your college one giant sad building?

172
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,330
Look at like a high school for
people in their twenties yeah, yeah.

173
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:58,020
That's who you are. And you
know what, even you get to
feel smart on this podcast.

174
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,790
So my favorite thing is,

175
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,440
yeah,

176
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,440
if you go back and you listen to my
podcasts on Monday when I thought I was so

177
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:10,900
fucking write about the Obamas buying
this $82 million house is somebody

178
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:14,410
actually wrote into the podcast and
goes, you know bill, I love you,

179
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,120
but why don't you do your homework?

180
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,510
Obama just signed a $62 million book deal.
Okay.

181
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,750
And this is what's fucking hilarious.
He's telling me to do my homework.

182
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,410
He didn't even do the homework to look
up to double check what the fuck I said

183
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:30,090
even say if it was true,

184
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,560
he just took it for granted that I said
$82 million house and then he's like,

185
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,820
he took that as truth and started
looking up the guy's fucking book deal.

186
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,100
So why don't you do your
fucking homework man. All right.

187
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:48,300
For the 9 million time.
Okay on this podcast.

188
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,510
Okay.

189
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,500
Do not take anything I say seriously?
Okay.

190
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:55,810
You can disagree with the web and
you can correct me and all that,

191
00:11:55,811 --> 00:11:57,730
but just don't get upset

192
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,320
and don't be fucking surprised that I,
I fucking don't read.

193
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,090
And then my,

194
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:10,090
my facts might be off
by a good $72 million.

195
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,500
Okay.
You know,

196
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,570
if you guys sound like all you fucking
political cuts out there bitching at me,

197
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:20,800
you sound like all these fucking fat
actresses out here who are bitching about

198
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:24,820
Hollywood acting as though they're
surprised that so much of this fucking

199
00:12:24,821 --> 00:12:26,710
industry is based on how you look.

200
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,070
What was that really a shocker?

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,210
Had He never been to a movie?
You didn't notice a trend.

202
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,580
Do you think it's just you?

203
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,350
Yeah.

204
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,470
You know what I mean? You fucking
sloppy tits. Who's having a rough time?

205
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,220
I'm a fucking bald redhead and male.
I have no sympathy for you.

206
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:48,893
Okay?

207
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,780
No, he's knocking down their fucking door
to put me in an action movie. You know,

208
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,310
I could be hell boy. Do a fucking cycle
of steroids. I already have the head.

209
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,810
You just fucking painted
red and you're ready to go.

210
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,230
I could do a headstand and fucking
my head would turned so red.

211
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:08,650
You could save feeds the amount of money
you'd save on makeup and time alone.

212
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,170
Bill, do a fucking handstand.
Okay, you're in the scene.

213
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,193
Um,

214
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,180
yeah.

215
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,013
Anyways,

216
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,980
so I guess the Obamas bought an
eight point $1 million house,

217
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:29,810
not an $82 million house,
which then led me into this whole thing.

218
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:32,480
Like he's on his, he, this is
his third book that he's written.

219
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,150
It's like he was writing
books while he was president.

220
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,790
Aren't you supposed to be
running the fucking country?

221
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,860
Fucking sitting there dealing with the
Russians and all these terrorist groups

222
00:13:42,861 --> 00:13:45,710
and all that shit.
And then you're like fucking at nighttime,

223
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,740
take out a little legal pad. It was the
best of times. It was the worst of times.

224
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,390
These fucking assholes
out right in the books.

225
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,130
They always get like somebody else.

226
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,090
It's like written by Bill Clinton and the
other guy who actually wrote the book.

227
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,070
Yeah, I want to run a thriller. Well, how
about you and me Ron it right. Like, Oh,

228
00:14:03,071 --> 00:14:06,550
you'll put your name and put my name on
the cover and then you lock write it.

229
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,640
What is that book about?
You've got to write what you know.

230
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,760
It's gotta be something about somebody
fucking sneak around on his wife. Right.

231
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,880
Sticking cigars and people. Oh, it's too
on the nose. I wanted to be challenged.

232
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,070
I wrote about a guy who was faithful.
Um, sorry for the bad Bill Clinton.

233
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,680
Uh, now you guys spill once
you do your whole book.

234
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,040
The book is actually bugs experiences,
Oxford,

235
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,470
Oxford in England,

236
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,160
the home where it all started.

237
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,470
I take both of those games.
I was working both days,

238
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:48,220
so I have to go back and watch
them and I gotta tell you, man,

239
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,260
I am so fucking sold in that game though.
I don't know what happened.

240
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,330
I had so much fun making fun of soccer
all these fucking years. And it's uh,

241
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,400
it's crazy. And then watching the
highlights of when a goal is scored,

242
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:01,970
like my whole,

243
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,090
my whole complaint about the sport
is what makes the sport so great.

244
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,320
The fact that scoring is so God
damn difficult. The fucking,

245
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,370
that the emotion that gets led
off when these people score.

246
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,420
I mean, Jesus Christ, like in my country,

247
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:24,340
if you dump a beer on somebody's
after some sort of point is scored,

248
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,430
you're going to get into a fight over
there. I mean, it looked like a fucking,

249
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,120
I dunno what it looked like.
It looked like a,

250
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:34,360
a sports bar combined with
the money shot in a porno.

251
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,920
Everybody's jumping up and down,
just spray and booze all over the place.

252
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,510
Part of me that was a little
annoying. Like why, why,

253
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:47,270
why are you wasting all that good
boots? You know, cause I'm a, I'm,

254
00:15:47,271 --> 00:15:49,180
I'm, I'm taking another
month off. You don't me.

255
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,363
Okay.

256
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:55,500
I impose my own little fucking
sabbaticals, you know what
I mean? And after that,

257
00:15:55,501 --> 00:16:00,330
that my little excursion over
there to Europe, oh my God,

258
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,600
there's just I aisle that says Rasaka
the 1664 bet fucking beer tastes so god

259
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:11,040
damn good in that Goddamn
glass in that one cafe,

260
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,990
uh, over there in Europe, over there
in France. Right then I refuse, I've,

261
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:20,690
I've seen it over here and I've been
tempted to buy it and it's like,

262
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:23,180
I'm not going to fucking do it
because this is what happens.

263
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:26,510
Like when you go to Ireland and you drink
Guinness over there and then you come

264
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:29,810
back here and you want to continue it,
it fucking sucks.

265
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,470
And you know what else I did? You
know, it's just unbelievably like,

266
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:37,610
just on another level is
Indian food in England.

267
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:39,030
Yeah.

268
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,880
I went to this fucking place. The Indian
food was so goddamn good. I've been, I,

269
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:47,550
I've ordered it twice since then.
Once in France it was okay.

270
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,870
And then I ordered it here
in la in it fucking sucked.

271
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,420
And it was like, I got
to walk away, you know,

272
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,450
it's like you go to Paris and he
come home and be like, you know,

273
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,450
I'm going to have a French breakfast.
I'm going to get a, I saw. Right.

274
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:04,210
And then you'd go down to the
fucking supermarket and you get an,

275
00:17:04,211 --> 00:17:07,060
and it's like somebody pulled
it out of this shoe, you know,

276
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,160
it just all goes back to
the when in Rome thing.

277
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:10,280
Okay.

278
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,880
Yes. Go on. Um, you know what I mean?

279
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:19,310
That's the only thing that sucks
about traveling. You know what I mean?

280
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,330
Like, uh, I'm, I'm, I think I'm going
to do a Gig in buffalo coming up.

281
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,860
I haven't been there in fucking forever.

282
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,040
And what's going to happen is I'm going
to go to Duffy's or that other fucking

283
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,330
place with,
you know,

284
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,590
where they came up with buffalo wings
and I'm going to eat them and they're

285
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:35,950
going to be so goddamn good.
And then I'm going to come back out here.

286
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,230
I'm going to have that fucking crack
in my, my, my system going, well,

287
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:39,651
I'm going to get,

288
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:42,710
I gotta get some wings out here and
when eat them and they're going to suck.

289
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,820
And then it's just depressing.

290
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,880
Do you like I the only place to get
good wings in Buffalo? It really is.

291
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,660
I've never gone to any other place other
than buffalo that really knows how to

292
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:57,900
make good buffalo wings.
That's it.

293
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,620
Now I just lob that out there for all
of you guys to lose your fucking shoe.

294
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,300
Yeah.

295
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,120
She, which brought low jockey. Good.

296
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,120
Okay.

297
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,070
But you want to do is go to Cincinnati.

298
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,890
You can go to fucking mfi
stay of the best ones.

299
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,470
I followed Joe Rogan on all social media
and he posted this really fascinating

300
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:21,120
thing that within 10 minutes I was like,

301
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,070
I don't even know what the
fuck this guy's talking about.

302
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,290
He was talking something about fasting

303
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,970
and how it's actually could be good
for you. I mean, I've read, I mean,

304
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:32,940
Dick Gregory wrote a whole bunch of
books on this type of Shit, right?

305
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,420
Rest his soul and a saying
how, you know, let's see.

306
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,580
Oregon's rejuvenate and
all of that type of shit.

307
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:42,380
And I thought it was really fascinating.
Until about 10 minutes in, I realized I,

308
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,720
I didn't understand what the guy was
talking about and I looked at him and he

309
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:49,980
was not in the best of shape. He
looked a little mushy, you know,

310
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,950
which I would think would
happen if you fast it,

311
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,660
you'd get a little fleshy cause
your body would keep eating muscle.

312
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,220
You know what I mean? I
Dunno. But anyways, um,

313
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,530
the fuck was my point.
Let's talking about food out cheeses.

314
00:19:05,531 --> 00:19:09,530
I don't fucking know. I have no
idea. Troubled in this. Sue is

315
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,900
JFK blown away.

316
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,970
Tips the table over like a fucking baby.

317
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,353
MMM.

318
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,330
Why am I talking about that?

319
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:27,331
Because I was watching TV late night
and I watched all these old 80s

320
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,203
videos

321
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,320
and that song came on,
you know,

322
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,050
I'm telling you my new show is 77 sunset
strip with FM Zimbalist jr who I was

323
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:46,000
always a big fan of cause that FBI
show and uh, and I've been, you know,

324
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,070
I've been maintain,
you know,

325
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,820
I think yesterday was the first day I
snapped while driving in a while and it

326
00:19:51,821 --> 00:19:53,890
felt weird and I immediately

327
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,780
dialed it back down and my move for all
you other angry guys out there like me

328
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,660
and you're not angry, you're
not an angry guy. You just,

329
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,300
that's your default emotion.
Like, you know what I mean?

330
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,890
I'd like to really be an angry guy.

331
00:20:07,891 --> 00:20:10,620
You just have to be like walking
around seeding, which I don't,

332
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,520
I walk around totally normal and then
something happens and I fucking flip out,

333
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,020
you know, and have a fucking meltdown
and then it just takes people. It's just,

334
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:24,050
it's so fucking over the
top that everybody forgets
what a great guy was for the

335
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:27,150
previous four hours.
That's essentially what it is.

336
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,210
And it's like a fucking five
minute meltdown, you know,

337
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,710
it's like, what about the other
four hours when I was a good guy?

338
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,640
And it's just like no bill.

339
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,510
No what you did in that five
minutes negated all that.

340
00:20:39,511 --> 00:20:42,870
It's like doing four hours of fucking
cardio and then sitting down and eating a

341
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:46,800
box of fucking Oreo cookies. It's
just, it, you just negated all of that.

342
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,840
It's over. You still a fat fuck
emotionally. So anyways, I,

343
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:54,190
I listened to baseball,

344
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,750
I listened to the red
sox on Sirius Xm and uh,

345
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,350
actually watched, then I came home
that's making me watch them again.

346
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,480
Fucking Chris sales up God damn beast.

347
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,050
You watched the game last night when he
walked that guy and he didn't think that

348
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:11,160
he walked him and he got fucking mad
cause he started throwing like 98,

349
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,310
99 miles an hour on the corners.
That crazy delivery.

350
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,860
Um, I dunno, we shall see that.

351
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,330
I don't know who that bum was that they
brought in the fucking eighth inning.

352
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,170
Then almost gate, we were up four to
nothing and he's like, you know what?

353
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,200
Let's make the gamblers nervous is an
nice fatty hanging out over the plate.

354
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,890
Bam. Base head, boom. Double four to one,

355
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,720
load them up and they finally got him
out of there. Then our relief pitcher,

356
00:21:40,721 --> 00:21:42,430
I don't know anybody's name,
that guy who comes out there,

357
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,890
he hangs his arm like he's
driving a shirt or some shit.

358
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,960
He came out there and shut
them the fuck down. Um,

359
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,720
so I'm,
I'm like a,

360
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:56,080
I'm back into that shit and I'm actually
going to be really sad when the World

361
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,410
Cup's over.
When is the finals out on Saturday?

362
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,450
That's going to be crazy

363
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,370
one match for all the fucking models.

364
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,250
Can you imagine if that comes
down to penalty kicks again?

365
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,950
I used to think that was the
stupidest fucking thing ever.

366
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,440
Like a world basketball, basketball
championship coming down to foul shots.

367
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,970
You know what I mean? That would just be
like boring as shit. But now I get it.

368
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,070
I get it.
Because if you fuck it up,

369
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,150
I really feel like the goaltender has
like no pressure cause all he has to do is

370
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:30,610
just guess,
you know,

371
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,170
I love that they're guessing it's just a
total guests. And when they guess, right,

372
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,260
they guess, right. They
stand up like, yeah, like,

373
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:42,610
like there was some sort of intelligent
thought there. It's just like left, right,

374
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:47,320
left, right diving left.
Fuck you went right. Um,

375
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:50,810
that always, it's always funny
when they guess wrong when they're,

376
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,830
they start to dive that way and they
realized that guy went the other way and

377
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:57,010
you just watched the goaltender, like
his whole body goes limp. Like, ah,

378
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,950
I should tell the other way and he
just fucking lands on the grass. Um,

379
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,410
but the pressure on the shooter,
they don't want to miss the net.

380
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,210
So I,
I,

381
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,270
I'm gathering it takes massive balls to
try to shoot it up top to go top corner,

382
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,880
which why wouldn't you just go there?
He's not going to fucking get that.

383
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:19,811
Cause it's like,

384
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:24,610
what if I miss then I'm that cunt that
fucking missed for the rest of my fucking

385
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:28,600
life in fat, crooked, great teeth,

386
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,710
fish and chip eating.

387
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:33,790
Fucking assholes can get my grill
everywhere I go for the rest of my life.

388
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,090
People who never accomplish it now can
take out the failure of their life on me

389
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,180
cause I tried to go top shelf. What
do you guys call it? What do we do?

390
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:45,860
What do you guys call shelfs
over them? The Bonnet. The boot.

391
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,790
What the fuck do you always have
some stupid fucking name for it? Um,

392
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,230
I've noticed that I'm cooking shows.

393
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,640
Every ingredient you guys pronounce
differently. Oregano, Oregon.

394
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,860
No tomato,
tomato.

395
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,360
Bazell Basel Second. They just fucking
with me. There wasn't one thing.

396
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,490
Do we hate England that much?
By the end of it,

397
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,350
I really think that we would like to
summer school kids that came over here in

398
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,650
like the weird religious people.
Yeah.

399
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:18,800
We all came over here and you had
people who weren't good in school.

400
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:23,360
Fucking people that were too into religion
and those two people combined made

401
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,194
Americans.

402
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,200
That's why I am the product of that.

403
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:33,680
And I thought an eight point $1
million house was $82 million.

404
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,790
Why don't you do your homework,
but you go fuck yourself.

405
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,290
Do my homework. I'm not in
fucking school. All right.

406
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,570
I didn't get in this business to think.
All right, let me, uh, let me read it.

407
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:51,740
A little bit of advertising here.
JFK blown away.

408
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:55,640
A tipping over your fucking table.

409
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,380
I still love Billy Joel
cause he got so hammered,

410
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:04,460
he drove his car through his fucking
neighbor's living room window. I mean,

411
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,600
can you, can you loan him enough sugar
in your lifetime to get past that?

412
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:12,980
You know, every day I'd be
knocking on the door. Hey Man,

413
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:15,980
if you want to borrow a rake or a
wheel barrow, anything, anything,

414
00:25:15,981 --> 00:25:18,110
you know Barrow by the way,

415
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:23,111
not barrel roll out the Barrow where
Ray can some fuck and leaves a,

416
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,370
by the way, Dean del Ray from the
letter B talk podcast on all things.

417
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,780
Comedy has the legendary Henry
Rollins on his podcast this week.

418
00:25:35,781 --> 00:25:38,840
This is a dream guests for Dean del race.
He want to listen to them.

419
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,260
Fan Boy out while asking
all the questions.

420
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:46,820
You always wanted to hear Henry
Rollins answer. Give a take a few,

421
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,170
um, checking out in the all things
coming network. Let there be talk.

422
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Dean del Rey with the Great Henry
Rollins who had such a funny bit on iron

423
00:25:56,901 --> 00:26:00,290
maiden. He actually made
me question whether I was,

424
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:04,250
I am more on for liking the band and then
of course I put on one of their songs

425
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:08,660
and I was like, no I
wasn't. I wasn't right.

426
00:26:08,661 --> 00:26:13,661
It sounds like we read this book about
a bloke who had wings and he flew too

427
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:15,050
close to the sun.

428
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:19,550
So this song's about a bloke who put some
wings on and flew too close to the sun.

429
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,160
Um, alright, put your box.

430
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:29,070
Butcher box delivers healthy 100% grass
fed and grass finished beef free range,

431
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:32,470
organic chicken and this right.

432
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:35,980
This is the money shot right
here and heritage bread,

433
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:40,981
pork [inaudible] pork chop I've ever
had in my life that I ever made in my

434
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:46,380
house. I think maybe one time and
went to some five star restaurant.

435
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:49,020
You know the ref fucking chefs
walking around wearing clogs.

436
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,270
You've got to go to one of those places,
you know,

437
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:55,080
and there's all these old bald guys
like me with these skinny young broads,

438
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,500
you know, Aka their second
or third wife. You know,

439
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,610
you gotta go to a place like that.

440
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:02,850
If you don't want to drop that kind of
cash and you still want to the best pork

441
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:05,630
chop you ever going to have you get,
you gotta get butchered bucks.

442
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,880
All right there, there's my personal
file that I just made it personal. Okay.

443
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,780
The incredible quality of butcher box
meets starts with the commitment to

444
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:17,310
raising animals humanely and free of
antibiotics and hormones before they kill

445
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:21,240
them. Each box comes with at
least nine to 11 pounds of meat,

446
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:26,460
which is enough for 24 individual sized
meals. You could feed a fucking army.

447
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:30,510
You can choose from five different
box types. All beef, beef and chicken,

448
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:34,410
beef and pork mixed box.
Go crazy man.

449
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,210
Throws many animals in there. As you can
custom box let you choose your own cuts.

450
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,300
Come on, man. It's the fucking

451
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,440
get the grill.
Go and and get some butcher box.

452
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,790
This ad always makes me hungry.
That's how good the food has been.

453
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,070
A antibiotic slash hormone free butcher
box believes in healthier food system

454
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,900
where everyone has access to
meets the way nature intended.

455
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,320
Now like these cows in mainstream where
they got the fake tits in the fucking

456
00:28:04,321 --> 00:28:06,390
botox. All right, you
want the original ones,

457
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,530
free of antibiotics and hormones
and humanely raised on open pasture.

458
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:13,590
Let them walk around.
Um,

459
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,990
selection is amazing.

460
00:28:15,991 --> 00:28:19,590
Bushbucks carefully curated the finest

466
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,410

Four sigmatic that that said Stigmata

472
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,570
this episode is brought to you by four
sigmatic four sigmatic the leading online

473
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:17,670
purveyors of shrooms, man. That's right.

474
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:20,040
There's Shalon shrooms on the Internet,

475
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,790
but really this company sells mushroom
coffee that actually tastes great.

476
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:28,200
It is damn good for you. I fucking love
mushrooms. I would actually try this.

477
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,540
You know, I love mushroom soup. I've
always wanted to try mushrooms. You know,

478
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,960
I know. I know where you're
going to say. Talk to Ari.

479
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:41,190
Shaffir four sigmatic um,

480
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,630
is from Finland. So you know, it's good.

481
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,840
The same country that gave
you Santa Claus. Angry beards

482
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,150
two

483
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:53,250
go. Rask. I hit how it says the
goaltender for the Boston Bruins.

484
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:56,040
Like he didn't already know that.
And of course, mushroom coffee.

485
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,940
Did you know that Finnish people consume
more coffee per capita than any other

486
00:29:59,941 --> 00:30:04,630
country? Almost three times more
than Americans. I don't like that.

487
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:05,770
We're losing to them.
And coffee.

488
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,220
Mushroom coffee has half the
caffeine of regular coffee,

489
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:13,270
but it's twice as magical. It's
easy on the gut, less acidic,

490
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,500
and you don't get the jittery feeling
you get from regular coffee too.

491
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:20,860
And I'm sold. I'd love a nice hot cup
of fucking mushroom coffee right now.

492
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:26,470
Um, evidently I'm drinking the mushroom
coffee with lion's Mane and Chaga.

493
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,280
Lion's mane. There's hair in the
fucking coffee. Tastes just like coffee.

494
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,690
Not like mushrooms.

495
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,200
Oh.
Oh,

496
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,440
okay. Oh, they told me not to say it
tastes like mushrooms. I guess it doesn't,

497
00:30:41,441 --> 00:30:46,060
it tastes like coffee. Lion's mane
mushroom is your brain's best friend.

498
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,370
Long used by Buddhist monks. They
never lose their shit. Right.

499
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,710
To help with focus during meditation.

500
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:57,880
I gotta try this shit perfect
for when I need to get shit done.

501
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:01,660
Think of it as supercharged
instant coffee. Come.

502
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:03,310
I like how this is all in the past tense.

503
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:05,560
Like I've done this in my life
has changed for the better,

504
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:10,090
but I'm sold coming easy to use
carry single serving packets.

505
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:15,270

511
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,600
And to see me made with, I don't know,
maybe we'd and mushrooms, I don't know.

512
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,900

513

514
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,160
Oh wait a minute, but a boop, boop.

515
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,440
Me undies me on [inaudible] the
world cop is coming home due to,

516
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:57,540
to, to beyond [inaudible] beyond
ease is sick of fucking being alone.

517
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,410
But then England,
lots of the Croatians,

518
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:07,400
now that Cup is still on vacation and
ain't coming home and he fucking time soon

519
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:12,300
. Sorry to everybody over
there. Congratulations Croatia.

520
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:15,660
I love that.
Number 10 number 10 on Croatia.

521
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,450
That fucking guy is a play

522
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,770
of France has a great team.
I don't know who to root for here.

523
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,660
I obviously love France. Patty. Oh,

524
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,050
I have a great time when I'm over
there, but I gotta tell you, man,

525
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,070
Croatian system, good luck and God damn
people. And it's only 4.1 million of them.

526
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,780
According to Pete Davidson,

527
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,600
there's more people in New York then
there's in their entire country and they

528
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,440
are in the finals.
So I think I kind of have to root for them

529
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,690
cause they're the underdogs again.
Oh fuck it. I'm ruined for Croatia.

530
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,800
All right. How does it like got here?
I got to hear the national anthem.

531
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:59,760
I gotta learn that by
Saturday. Oh fuck. And Croatia.

532
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:04,170
There's only 4 million cons.

533
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,750
Croatia national,
national fun.

534
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,520
I almost wrote fucking anthem.
Anthem.

535
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,080
You know this is going to be some fucking
Dracula, Eastern European shit. Oh,

536
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:19,170
by the way, that tour is going down.
I'm getting all the dates. Okay.

537
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:22,560
I'm not talking shit.
I'm going out there.

538
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:26,100
Croatian national anthem
with English lyrics.

539
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,600
Let's not very probation. Is it? What
do they speak over their [inaudible]

540
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,833
all right,

541
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,810
let's, oh, it's only two and a half
minutes long. I'm already liking this.

542
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:42,730
It's like a Beatles song. Well,
where's the fucking, where's the music?

543
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,700
It's scrolling. Scrolling, scrolling.

544
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,100
[inaudible]

545
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,710
all right. There's no fucking way I'm
going to be able to lend us. Ah, right.

546
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:07,993
Oh,

547
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,670
it comes down.
Woo.

548
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,850
It's very cinematic. You know
what? I like it. I like it.

549
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:22,640
God dammit. It's very cinematic. Um,

550
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,140
yeah,

551
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,880
I like ours too. I was the big, it's,
it's based off a drinking song. You know,

552
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,840
we did, we pulled the Jimmy page when
we wrote it. Like out on the tiles.

553
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:36,980
I guess Jason Bond. I'm told that story
on, that's Super Group show on VH one

554
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,130
way back in the day,
right?

555
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,940
That I'm out on the tiles.

556
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,210
You know that de

557
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:49,620
[inaudible] weapon weapon dead,
dead,

558
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,480
but dead could go by Junko Beko but
Dadda Dadda ba Ba da Ba da Ba da Ba da by

559
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:55,620
debit,
but a dead dead.

560
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:01,470
[inaudible] MMM.
That was actually a drink at some,

561
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,950
I'm out on the towels.

562
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,890
I had a little Jenkin of some men of
something and I'm out on the Taos.

563
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:11,500
So Jimmy just, you know, I guess John came
in singing that and Jimmy's like, Ryan,

564
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,650
what said someone that's already
been written. Um, Mondays,

565
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,150
Mondays are made with sustainably
sourced material from beechwood trees.

566
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,440
They're naturally soft,

567
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,770
makes a fabric that won't sag
down or write up. Trust me.

568
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,300
Once you put on a pair, you'll get it.
Feel free to improvise here. A boy,

569
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:35,080
what you love about me on these,
I love the way it cradles my fucking nuts.

570
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:39,360
I'm Mandy's is. So you'll love your
first pair. If you're not happy,

571
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:42,720
they'll do whatever they can
to get you into the right pair.

572
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:45,840
They'll send a fucking horny and
had another one. And if they can't

573
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,570
keep them and they'll refund you.

636
00:39:49,231 --> 00:39:53,700
I think it's Helux. I feel
like I knew this. I feel like
I gave you shit about it.

637
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:58,320
Okay. And now I don't remember. Now
you don't remember? Hey, so last night

638
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,840
I went, last night I
was out and about, uh,

639
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:05,700
went to a bobcat.

640
00:40:05,701 --> 00:40:10,260
Goldthwait has a new show
on true TV called bobcat.

641
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,460
Goldthwait. Uh, was it
monsters and um, misfits,

642
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,100
misfits in monster or something like that.
I don't know what it is,

643
00:40:17,101 --> 00:40:20,310
but it's on true TV. I watched an
episode of it last night. It's fucking,

644
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:24,240
it's classic bobcat. It's totally
original. If you just look up,

645
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:27,900
if you just search bobcat
Goldthwait right. If you do that,

646
00:40:27,901 --> 00:40:30,510
you're going to find it. It's on
true TV. Well, those last name,

647
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,810
what was the last night?
Wednesday? Yes. Wednesday.

648
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:37,620
So Wednesday night at 10 o'clock on
true TV. That's all right. There you go.

649
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,670
So I went down to the premiere.

650
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,920
I got there late because
I was working as an actor.

651
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:48,230
I had to take off my little fucking
tight when I was done acting. Yeah,

652
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,420
I was feeling guilty because I wanted
to go down there. I had friends,

653
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:53,700
I had to see them,
but I hadn't done standup in a minute.

654
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,980
And I'm going to be in Portland
and Seattle this weekend,

655
00:40:55,981 --> 00:40:57,810
so I got to shake the fucking rust off.

656
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:01,020
I wish I could go to Portland and Seattle

657
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:06,570
with you. Well Nia, it's only a
southwest or Alaskan flight away.

658
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,710
Yeah. I want to go. I want
to have a friend in Portland.

659
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:14,660
I've always wanted to see Portland and
I just feel like the microphone is so

660
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:15,250
close to my [inaudible].

661
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,090
Oh, sorry. Um,

662
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,280
yeah. And I've never been to
Seattle either. Both places.
I've been wanting to go.

663
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,350
I invited you. Yeah, you did.
Can I get back to my story? Oh,

664
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:30,790
sorry. So this is what I love
about La. So I'm walking out,

665
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:35,240
I ubered over right. Smoke a cigar with
one of my great friends in this business.

666
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:40,400
And then I was walking out going out,
man, I didn't do standup. Should I pause?

667
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,650
I don't want to fucking Uber over
there. And then Uber Home, fuck this.

668
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:45,890
So I just started walking home
and I walked by a fucking,

669
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,393
oh this.

670
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,910
And there was these young comics
parking out front, a comedy show coming.

671
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,480
They saw me coming down the
street and they laugh, hey,

672
00:41:52,481 --> 00:41:55,150
want to go to a comedy show?
I now, and they go, do you
want to go up? I'm like, Nah,

673
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:58,540
thank you though. And then I walked
about 10 feet. I was like, fuck it.

674
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,040
I need to get a set in.

675
00:42:00,041 --> 00:42:05,041
And I went in there and I did a set at
Hooters last night upstairs in the big

676
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,740
room, the main room in the main room.
It was a bunch of young kids there

677
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,150
while you were there? No.
What about the Buffalo Shrimp?

678
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,760
Yeah, I literally walked
in. It was awesome.

679
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,870
They put me on like the fucking president.
They put me on immediately. I went up.

680
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:25,270
I did. Um, of course bill, everybody
knows you at Hooters. I, um,

681
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:28,720
I went on and I said, I do tend to
15. I feel like I did around 12.

682
00:42:28,721 --> 00:42:32,410
It felt like a 12. I got my labs, I shake
the rust off and I fucking walked out.

683
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:34,990
It was great. Perfect. Then I walked out,

684
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:39,160
walked halfway down the block and there
was a taxi, which I love old school,

685
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:43,960
and I got into it. I say, I say, you work.
And he goes, he goes, yes. And I got in.

686
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,490
I go, how you doing? He goes,

687
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,050
yeah. So, so I was like, all right,
I appreciate that. And he goes,

688
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,600
and he left this mother fucker where
they fucking fucking drive it home.

689
00:42:55,601 --> 00:43:00,040
Just curse. I can be myself just
cursing everybody in the way.

690
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,170
So you had a good night last night? I
had a great night. Yes. Without alcohol.

691
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:08,590
I don't need it, man. Can we just
talk about Hooters for a second?

692
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,650
I really love the, the
Buffalo Shrimp. What is,

693
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,610
yeah, it's shrimp with buffalo
sauce. It's just like, oh.

694
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:21,190
And they give you like this blue cheese
dipping sauce to go with it. Oh my God,

695
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:24,370
it's too blue cheese
is the most disgusting.

696
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,260
One of one of the more disgusting foods.

697
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,100
You know that we watched an undercover
brother and they were talking about how

698
00:43:30,101 --> 00:43:33,130
white people like white people, like
very underrated movie, by the way.

699
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,610
It's so funny. Yeah. Oh, um,

700
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,130
white people like Manet's and evidently
black people don't, I don't fucking know.

701
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,060
Um, my, whatever. I don't
know what I like Manny's

702
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,450
within reason. I like, man,
he's like, man, he's on fries.

703
00:43:50,451 --> 00:43:51,830
I like mayonnaise on roast beef.

704
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:58,450
I like eating Manet's in front of
people that don't enjoy Manet's. Um,

705
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:02,390
no. I like, uh, but blue cheese
is just, fuck God. It's like

706
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:08,720
Buffalo shrimp and, and blue cheese.
Oh my God. It's just like, it's like a,

707
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:13,820
it's like mucus. It's gross.
I think when you eat wings,

708
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,850
you're just eat the wings. You don't
even use any of this size. No rant.

709
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:21,700
What about ranch? What do, what
are your feelings about ranch? Oh,

710
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:24,320
it's all right.
I just

711
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,280
know that for a man he is, you know, I
like ketchup. I like ketchup. Manet's

712
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,620
mustard. I like the Basic Maryam.

713
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,690
I'm a basic white dude.
I like pickles. Yup. Uh,

714
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,340
I like, I like a snake. Here's,
here's a nice little surprise here.

715
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,380
You can see that I've traveled.
I like a stuffed. All of

716
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:54,410
does that make me interesting?
Now my walking it out. Do you,

717
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,220
what's that? Some dance they did
in Atlanta. God from years ago.

718
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:03,360
Oh God. I'm on Instagram. I know. All
the latest dances are really neat.

719
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,520
I want you to get up and do
the mashed potato for me.

720
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:11,670
I got to get you to do a a in my
feelings challenge. All right,

721
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:16,200
go ahead and do it. Well, the dance,
you got to play the song. It's a dance.

722
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,950
It's a dance that you do to
Drake song called in my feelings.

723
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:24,360
I can't stand drinking. Do
you love me? Are you writing?

724
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,150
You haven't seen it. I can't.
I can't stand that guy.

725
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:31,260
Not Literally that guy you used to,
you use,

726
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,180
you use the electric. He used the
car, always whining about somebody.

727
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:38,160
It's just like he,
he's got this great life.

728
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:41,460
He's banging models and I've got to sit
there and listen to whining about the

729
00:45:41,461 --> 00:45:44,700
model that he used to fuck. Who doesn't
call them back anymore? It's like Drake.

730
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:48,900
You would just fucking or she moved on.
He's emotional.

731
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,240
He isn't,
he's selfish.

732
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,680
Um,
but he loves magic magic.

733
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:03,150
I've seen like three different videos
of him running away after a trick.

734
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,700
That's what's really funny
about black people as you can.

735
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:13,110
You can see somebody hustling you,
lying to you and all that type of shit.

736
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:14,530
You know the like he just just,

737
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,370
you can smell bullshit
from a mile of fucking way,

738
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,870
but you get a magician does a card trick.
You guys run away like he's a witch.

739
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:25,680
Yeah. What the fuck was, yeah.
Cause that's that devil shit.

740
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:33,780
Fuck around with magic and it's that.
It's slight ahead near all that.

741
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:37,260
Oh No, that's the devil. Yeah.
If that guy could do that shit,

742
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:38,250
if that guy could do that shit,

743
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:41,220
he would just fucking like
levitate into a bank vault.

744
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,840
You wouldn't be fucking hustle and
doing magic on a street corner. Right.

745
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:51,410
It's still
it just playing with evil forces.

746
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,270
That's what the magic shit.
All right.

747
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:57,060
Play with evil forces with the magic shit.

748
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,220
You heard that that
should be on a tee shirt

749
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:03,570
playing with the evil forces,
with the magic shit

750
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,870
that has to be in a rap song has to be
in something I don't like hate Drake.

751
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,390
I just like, his fucking
music is just like, you don't,

752
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:16,350
you don't like those guys that just call
up and they just dump your day the day

753
00:47:16,351 --> 00:47:18,870
on you. It's just like, dude,
you ever in a good mood?

754
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:22,500
What happened now Drake,

755
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,880
people are coming for him
trying to expose, you know,

756
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:34,330
his family life that he was trying
to keep private, you know? Yeah.

757
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:37,380
That's none of my business. I
call him anymore. That was weak.

758
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,920
That was week doing that shit.

759
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:45,790
[inaudible] we didn't start the
fire. All right. I gotta get,

760
00:47:45,791 --> 00:47:48,370
I gotta get off my tape. Oh my God. I hate

761
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,870
is that video Charlie Chaplin.

762
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:55,270
Teddy Roosevelt fucking
people from the past.

763
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:59,140
Baba Baba [inaudible] stop
fucking avoiding the topic.

764
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:02,350
Saying a generation did
a lot of shitty things.

765
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,800
Trouble in this too is it's the worst
line ever. All right. Having said that,

766
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,180
I love a,
I like a lot of his songs.

767
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:15,840
I feel like you don't talk enough
about stuff that you enjoy.

768
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,910
I feel like you're now going to talk
about what you don't like about me and the

769
00:48:18,911 --> 00:48:21,280
relationship.
Yep.

770
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:25,330
So I feel like you don't talk enough
about the things that you like.

771
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,670
You always talk about
what you can don't like.

772
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,230
And I just see what's going on and on how,

773
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:31,360
I love soccer and I hated
soccer and I love it.

774
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:34,120
But there's been this whole
fucking transformation. Yeah,

775
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,870
I missed that part because
you focus on the negative. No,

776
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:40,330
I think you have a nice guy.

777
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,700
He's such a hassle.
We finally became friends again.

778
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:50,350
We're buddies again because of the
work that I've put in like skews me.

779
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:52,360
What about me now?
I told you,

780
00:48:52,361 --> 00:48:56,590
you becoming like this goth chick that
shops at hot topic. That was your vibe.

781
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,900
Gloom and doom.

782
00:48:58,901 --> 00:49:02,400
A lot of really a modern references today.

783
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:07,210
Today not exist anymore. I don't
know. Do they? I don't know.

784
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:10,390
I haven't been to a mall in awhile,
so fuck you haven't,

785
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:14,230
last time I talked to you. Where
are you? I'm at the Grove. Oh yeah.

786
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,850
But they don't have a hot topic. So
do they still exist? I don't know.

787
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,950
They're high end. All
right, go ahead. Shit on me.

788
00:49:23,951 --> 00:49:26,110
What do you got? No, no, you're right.

789
00:49:26,111 --> 00:49:29,770
We're friends again after
having a little moment there.

790
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,790
So now I'm going to keep it positive.
I think you're great.

791
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:38,650
I think that you are stick with the devil
shit with the creepy vibes or whatever

792
00:49:38,651 --> 00:49:43,630
the fuck you said. Um, oh God. Anyways,

793
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:48,460
I was trying to end on an upbeat
note. Um, who wore it better?

794
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,900
The Marvin Gaye beard.
Drake or Marvin Gaye. Oh,

795
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,790
Marvin Gaye. Obviously rock the Marvin
Gaye beard. Better than Drake would.

796
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:03,430
Who would that red hat better?
Marvin Gaye or Jacques Cousteau.

797
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,713
Marvin Gaye.

798
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:10,150
And now my goal is to try to get you,
not to say Marvin Gaye.

799
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:16,340
Um, who was more important? God,

800
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,570
I can't go that route. You'll
get upset with that one. Oh,

801
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,630
I didn't even have anything there.

802
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,620
Where'd you have to keep
saying Marvin Gates and Improv?

803
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,600
He should have to Jacques Cousteau.
Then I can go on the French way.

804
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:32,480
I had the ocean outlet. You
just paid him into a corner. Oh,

805
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:37,580
so it's my fault that you're
not, uh, I dunno. Good at Improv.

806
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,820
Yeah.
I killed upstairs at who?

807
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:46,610
In the big room and didn't even bother
to give buffalo shrimp. It's like, yeah,

808
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,170
I was too busy killing
upstairs at a hooter.

809
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:55,370
So when is your next uploaders see at
the Hooters and Hollywood and in the big

810
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,260
room? Well, I guess they're
moving, they're moving their
show across the street to,

811
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,840
uh, looters. I don't fucking know.
Whatever's across the street,

812
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:08,980
that fucking Hollywood boulevard,
you know, we didn't have,

813
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:12,550
we didn't have any fire for the cigars
there, so I had to go into tourist play,

814
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,310
have been fire cell.

815
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,710
We rubbed some matches bucket to gather,
um,

816
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,190
and went into one of those
touristy places and I bought a,

817
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:27,110
I love California lighter for my buddy
who hates la, which is worth twice.

818
00:51:27,111 --> 00:51:28,600
And then it broke.
Yeah,

819
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,630
it was like three bucks and then it ran
out of lighter fluid. They're so cheap.

820
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:37,280
All those, like they're always going, hey
man, we got souvenirs for $5. It's like,

821
00:51:37,281 --> 00:51:40,760
no, you need to be solidly
souvenirs for 50 cents, if that.

822
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:44,060
My favorite thing is when you go to
New York and they have that, you know,

823
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:48,380
that that foam rubber thing where you
wear the crown from the fucking statue of

824
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:53,030
Liberty. People walk around with that.
Like, I went to New York and I got this.

825
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,740
Can you imagine how many of those are
floating around the fucking ocean?

826
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:01,850
Some poor fucking porpoises trying to
swallow that thing. All right, we're out.

827
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:06,040
I'm out of time yet cause I got, I got
shit to do here. Or is it 52 minutes? Um,

828
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:10,070
thank you for coming on here
in bringing the positivity.

829
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,660
I try. I'll do better next,
huh? I'll do better next time.

830
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:17,180
You did great with Devil Shit
with the evil stuff over there.

831
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:21,650
Whatever the fuck you said. Um,

833
00:52:24,651 --> 00:52:29,090

there who is offended. Um,

834
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:34,160
I don't apologize. All right. That's
something that a mature adult does. Uh,

835
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:38,270

hour of a greatest hits from a Thursday

Monday morning

837
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,410
podcast, whatever. Fuck I say and
I have a great couple of days.

838
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:46,990
You can send a check in and
you're thirsty. Go fine.

839
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,010
[inaudible] [inaudible]
traveled as much as we have

840
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:24,260
[inaudible] live in houses.
Some of the slight,

841
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,323
the loose,

842
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,910
you guys see that car.
I just saw a commercial

843
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:43,430
for Kentucky Fried Chicken where the
parents are all excited because the two

844
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:47,390
bratty kids won't sit
still at the dinner table,

845
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:51,120
but they got them this fucking
chicken and they're feeding it to the,

846
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:55,580
basically very subtly saying that there's
drugs in this chicken that will make

847
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:59,960
you a spastic children. Chill the fuck out
and spastic. I mean like, you know, not,

848
00:53:59,961 --> 00:54:02,480
not the way they mean it
over there in Great Britain,

849
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,150
you can't say that on the comedy.

850
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:09,170
So you can say it in a comedy club over
in Scotland, but you'll have a rough,

851
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:12,740
you'll have a rough go of it if you
say the kid was spastic over there,

852
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:16,730
that means like severely
mentally challenged over here.

853
00:54:16,731 --> 00:54:18,980
It just means you're not
going to get laid to you at 26

854
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:23,380
when

855
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:27,790
you were in Grad school looking
over a fucking cadaver, right,

856
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:30,070
with some other fucking nerve narrowed.
Right.

857
00:54:30,071 --> 00:54:31,300
And you're just sitting there going,

858
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:34,450
you know the ankle bones
connected to the knee bone. Right.

859
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,850
Has any of this made any sense?
What shouldn't?

860
00:54:36,851 --> 00:54:40,720
It's fucking Sunday night and I am spent
and I got a whole bunch of Shit I have

861
00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:44,530
to do tomorrow so I got to do it
tonight. All right, I'm off my game.

862
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,480
All right, you, you cleanse your liver and
like 42 43 days or something like that.

863
00:54:49,481 --> 00:54:52,180
Every drunk guy knows has
told me that if he drunk,

864
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:55,210
I know that does not
have a medical degree.

865
00:54:55,211 --> 00:55:00,211
Has told me that if you go 42 43 days
you will cleanse your liver at least to

866
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:03,880
the booze.
You know now if you fucking,

867
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:07,930
you start doing blow or a,
you know,

868
00:55:07,931 --> 00:55:11,530
eating a bunch of trans fat fucking
food or feeding your kids Kentucky Fried

869
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:15,130
fucking chicken,
Jesus Christ.

870
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,430
What happened to parents
that you got a drug,

871
00:55:18,431 --> 00:55:23,410
your kids to keep them under control,
you know, you know what it is.

872
00:55:23,411 --> 00:55:27,490
Kids don't respect their parents, they
respect him, but they don't respect like,

873
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,000
oh my God, this, this
person could wring my neck,

874
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,850
could pick me up by my hair.
Right.

875
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,180
Could grab a paddle and fucking,
you know,

876
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,250
mostly hit my ass,

877
00:55:39,251 --> 00:55:43,150
but also kinda hit my lower back
because I'm squirming right.

878
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,650
That doesn't exist anymore. So now these
kids are so fucking out of control.

879
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:52,390
These people have to go down to
Kentucky Fried Chicken. Okay.

880
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:53,291
And I,
I,

881
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:58,291
I use the term chicken very loosely
to go down and whatever that is,

882
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:04,210
that's in that bucket. Okay.
If it doesn't have a beak,

883
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:07,990
it doesn't have feet. If
it's fucking, you know,

884
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:13,390
justice, it's breasts is sticking out
like the cast on fucking, uh, what was,

885
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:17,560
what was that show with the Italians
there on New Jersey shore. Jersey shore.

886
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:21,370
Right. My world. That's
not a fucking chicken.

887
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:23,810
You know,

888
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:28,250
you want the chicken that looked like
Mark McGuire in his rookie season.

889
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,600
You don't want to eat the chicken.

890
00:56:29,601 --> 00:56:33,770
That looks like mark McGwire when
he fucking played for the cardinals,

891
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:35,203
you know,

892
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,020
do you eat a regular fucking chicken?
First of all,

893
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:43,080
it's going to look like a pigeon to
you because you so used to seeing those

894
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:47,520
roided up once that they have murderer's
row that you got down there at your

895
00:56:47,521 --> 00:56:52,500
fucking Shaws, right? You
Vons, you, JC Penney's,

896
00:56:52,501 --> 00:56:55,680
wherever the fuck you buy your
goddamn chicken, you go down,

897
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:59,160
you go down to any one of the
main stream fucking supermarkets.

898
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,830
Okay. And I swear to God, when you get
to the chicken section, okay, if you,

899
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,020
if you slept for the last 30 years,

900
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,650
like that Van Gundy guy under the
bridge or whatever his fucking name is,

901
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:14,670
Van Morrison, the hell's his
name, Rip Van Winkle. Right.

902
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,750
It was one of those people,
one of the vans. Um,

903
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:23,080
if you slept for the last 30
years and you went down, okay.

904
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:26,350
And they showed you what a chicken
was, you'd be like, ah. You'd be like,

905
00:57:26,351 --> 00:57:31,060
that ain't no chicken. Okay. It's a
goddamn Turkey. I know. Fucking yeah, die.

906
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:33,410
No fucking Turkey.
When I say what

907
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,400
I no such thing as a mad pad.

908
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:42,010
Fucking chicken can't
be done. No Sir. No Sir.

909
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:46,550
Get off my property. Okay. I'm, I'm
done with your witchcraft. Okay. Hey,

910
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:51,000
I said get the fuck Outta here.
The fuck off my property.

911
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,113
MMM

912
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:01,420
honey, get the gun. Um, yeah,

913
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:04,390
you would think it was a fucking Turkey.
And the thing is, is now it's a chicken.

914
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,370
And I remember I watched
one of those food inks,

915
00:58:06,371 --> 00:58:08,410
one of those fucking liberal
goddamn things, you know,

916
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:11,710
talking about flying carpets in
electric roads and all that bullshit.

917
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:13,820
Somewhere in there they were
talking about, you know,

918
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:18,840
the food supply and I'll poison it
is poisonous poisoning than it is.

919
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,540
It is.
Um,

920
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:26,290
so I fucking went down to a
farmer's fucking mom and um,

921
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:32,290
I said, I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna all I want, I want,

922
00:58:32,450 --> 00:58:35,810
I want an all natural fucking chicken.
I can't even talk. I'm so tired.

923
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:40,060
One an all natural chicken.
The guy goes,

924
00:58:40,061 --> 00:58:44,530
these are all natural. And I said,
all natural. And he goes, well,

925
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,840
I'm like, come on, where is it?

926
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:51,520
And he had to walk around the
corner sitting over there, lonely.

927
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,320
I swear to God, looking like a dove look
going in. Somebody killed the fucking,

928
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:00,160
he goes right there.
That one right there is 100% all natural.

929
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:04,680
Nothing's wrong with it. And
I was like, I was like, what?

930
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:07,790
That's what a chicken is
supposed to look like.

931
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:11,300
And he raised his eyebrows and he,

932
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:14,150
he kind of put his lips together
so they were a straight line.

933
00:59:14,151 --> 00:59:18,860
And then he nodded, you know, that
looked at people do like, like, yeah,

934
00:59:18,861 --> 00:59:22,040
I'm in the Matrix. I realize
I'm in the Matrix. You know,

935
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:27,680
I knocked the bitch up so I got to be
selling these roided up chickens. No.

936
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,720
Um, anyways, anyway, what
the fuck I'm talking about?

937
00:59:32,721 --> 00:59:35,660
So basically that's what these
people are eating over there. Okay.

938
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:40,280
There they are drugging up
their kids,

939
00:59:40,281 --> 00:59:45,281
but I can't get mad at him because I
actually did that to Charlie Murphy and

940
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:49,040
Darnell Rawlings. I've told
this story before, Hey,

941
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:50,960
I'll tell it against my fucking podcast.

942
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:54,830
I actually drug I the exact thing that
they're doing in their Kentucky Fried

943
00:59:54,831 --> 00:59:59,270
Chicken commercial where they're trying
to get their kids to sit still by just

944
00:59:59,271 --> 01:00:04,100
feeding them so full of these fucking
trans fats from these roided up beatless

945
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:08,750
fucking chickens with their Dolly
Parton breasts. Disses right.

946
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:14,000
I did that to fucking Darnell and Charlie.

947
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:19,600
I was hung over and we taken a car
service from Chicago xannies up to one of

948
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:21,860
those whenever the fuck it was

949
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:28,510
Saint Charles was a three city run
and one of them was Saint Charles.

950
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,560
So we're getting in the fucking Limo,
Don L's in rare form.

951
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,550
Charlie's in rare form their fucking
Gavin and trash and people and me and

952
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:40,460
everybody and I just don't
want to hear it. I'm like,

953
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:44,600
I don't want to listen to these fucking
guys running that Goddamn yaps in the

954
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:48,050
back of this car the whole fucking way up.
I want a nice quiet ride.

955
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,960
This is going to suck.
And I walked outside,

956
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:54,710
hung over and I walked into
this Chicago where you know,

957
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,430
almost got hit by three
fat people. And, um,

958
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:04,460
I looked up the street and I saw it,
I saw Popeye's and I was like,

959
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:05,360
oh,
thank God.

960
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:10,760
And I fucking walked in there and I got
all this fucking Popeye's chicken with

961
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:13,790
biscuits and all of this shit food.

962
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,320
And I brought it back to the car.
And as the car pulled up,

963
01:01:18,321 --> 01:01:21,710
they came out and I say, guys, I
got to sell some. I got some food.

964
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,350
And they were like, oh, that's
fucking great. You know,

965
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,370
they were hungry or whatever.

966
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:30,290
And they started showering that
fucking Popeye's food. And I sat back,

967
01:01:30,291 --> 01:01:31,720
nibbling on drumstick,

968
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:39,860
and I swear to God,
10 minutes later they were asleep.

969
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:43,400
I'm not lying.
They were fucking asleep,

970
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:47,690
snoring the whole way up. And I was
just sitting there, loving life,

971
01:01:47,691 --> 01:01:50,900
the whole fucking write up. And I, you
know what, I admitted to him later,

972
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:55,340
they thought it was funny,
but that's basically what it
is. They call it the Itis,

973
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:57,471
that's what they call it.

974
01:01:57,471 --> 01:01:59,990
When you eat that shit food and
then you have to go to sleep,

975
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:03,950
they call it the Itis, I guess. And
by they, I mean African Americans.

976
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:08,480
Um, they call it the fucking
Itus and that's what the gut,

977
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:13,780
and I learned that from don because I
don't know how that man stayed in shape,

978
01:02:14,991 --> 01:02:16,520
but he had the worst diet.

979
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:20,430
He's one of those guys who
like you stopped for gas
and he comes out of the gas

980
01:02:20,431 --> 01:02:23,490
station with like one of
those gas station hotdogs

981
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:31,830
and he would eat it and then he would
immediately fall asleep. And I got,

982
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,250
I would say to Charlie, look at this guy
were, he's sleeping. And Chad be like,

983
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:36,660
yeah man,
he got the itis.

984
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,080
Let me explain that to me and what
that little bit of information,

985
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:46,370
it went into my evil white brain and I
drug my two African American friends way

986
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:51,380
back in the year 2005.
Um,

987
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:54,240
and that's a little chicken story for you.
What time did you like dad? Everybody.

988
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,450
So that's what the fuck
they're saying right there.

989
01:02:57,451 --> 01:03:00,720
That's what Kentucky Fried
Chicken is allegedly saying.

990
01:03:00,721 --> 01:03:02,070
I guess they have to say a legit,

991
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:08,540
so that lawyers on retainer don't attack
my fucking podcast as far as I can

992
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:12,150
tell. I'm asking you right now, uh,

993
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:16,890
Kentucky Fried Chicken hiding
behind your fucking letters, KFC.

994
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:18,750
Is that what the fuck you do?
Is that what you're saying?

995
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,130
Yeah.

996
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:26,130
If you've got kids who are not stimulated
enough that they can't even sit down,

997
01:03:26,391 --> 01:03:30,980
if you haven't read yet to have run them
around, you got to tie your kids out.

998
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,340
Open the door. You send them out in
the fucking yard. Go ahead. Go outside,

999
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:37,100
get outside and play.
That's what you do.

1000
01:03:37,101 --> 01:03:40,100
Like a Goddamn one of
those fucking Irish dogs.

1001
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:42,410
It was bred to have to to herd sheep.

1002
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,640
You've got to let that fucking thing
run around. Run around in circles. Guy,

1003
01:03:46,641 --> 01:03:50,330
get out there, take a ball, and you
just fucking throw it out in traffic.

1004
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:54,770
Let the dog run around. Dodgy cars that
comes in, it's going to lay down. Okay?

1005
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,120
It's not going to jump all over.

1006
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,850
Company sticking it's cold nose
right in their fucking who has.

1007
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,560
That's what you gotta do with your kids.
You've got to send them outside, right?

1008
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:07,550
But to catch a Predator and all
these other fucking shows, you know,

1009
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:11,420
all these shows on TV where people
forget they're kids are in a car with the

1010
01:04:11,421 --> 01:04:12,410
windows rolled up.

1011
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:16,310
Their kids are too fucking dumb to roll
them down or they're too weak because

1012
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:19,710
they haven't gone outside and climb to
fucking tree and they stay in there and

1013
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:23,690
their, their brains get
cooked like a boxer, you know?

1014
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:25,430
Okay.

1015
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,640
Do you know that dog boxes?
They know they don't do well in this sun.

1016
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:31,430
Well we'll need to do fat kids. If you
leave the windows rolled up, you know,

1017
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,630
and they got those weak arms at all.

1018
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:37,670
That doesn't like the most tedious things
they ever did was take a wrapper off

1019
01:04:37,671 --> 01:04:41,360
of a fucking, uh, an ice
cream sandwich. Right?

1020
01:04:42,290 --> 01:04:43,520
You can't leave them in the car.

1021
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:48,830
My mother left us in the car all the
fucking time. She would go to school.

1022
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:53,090
She was going to school during the day
trying to further her education as she

1023
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:57,620
left five fucking kids in the car with
the windows rolled up and money for

1024
01:04:57,621 --> 01:05:00,530
Burger King. And she would say
to us, just go into the Burger.

1025
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,370
That's the only time you were
to leave this car over the left,

1026
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:07,550
over the next three fucking
hours when I'm in class.

1027
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:11,840
And she would disappear around the
corner after we set. Absolutely mom.

1028
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:16,400
And she walked away. And uh, we
immediately would get out of the car,

1029
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,580
start up and down the streets in Boston.

1030
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:22,870
We go into fucking burger king and we,
we'd have something to eat.

1031
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:23,860
Do you know what,
what happened?

1032
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:27,490
Nowadays they just saw five fucking
dirty face kids walking up and down,

1033
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,300
calm AV Boylston street
going into a burger king,

1034
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,790
look like the cast to fucking nanny.

1035
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:37,510
Someone would've filmed it and
my mother would have been in,

1036
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:41,470
Jay would have taken
us away, you know, but,

1037
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:45,130
but they didn't cause there was no
cameras back then or videotape ones.

1038
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:48,610
I mean there was, but only the
people add them on like the news

1039
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:54,250
and a young Steven Spielberg. So we went
in there and we fucking got some food,

1040
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:00,270
Kline bunk cars and fucking yelled
at people and Shit, you know,

1041
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:03,100
hanging on plant parking
meters and all that. Hence,

1042
01:06:03,101 --> 01:06:07,150
we had the fucking forearm strength to
roll down the windows and none of us ever

1043
01:06:07,151 --> 01:06:09,880
had an issue in the car.
And you know what?

1044
01:06:09,881 --> 01:06:13,030
I think that's one to grow on today.
You go people,

1045
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:17,290
I'm not saying KFC is food,
I'm not, I'm just kidding.

1046
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,140
I'm not saying it's bad food. Every
once in awhile, who's kitten home?

1047
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:23,230
Every once in we don't go would be great
if he could just fucking do heroin the

1048
01:06:23,231 --> 01:06:27,310
way you can eat McDonald's. Just like
every once in awhile he'd just be like,

1049
01:06:27,311 --> 01:06:31,330
you know what? Yeah, let's
just fucking tie off.

1050
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:34,720
Not off for the rest of the fucking day.

1051
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:38,680
And like the people that work
understood it, you know? Hey,

1052
01:06:38,681 --> 01:06:41,950
where were you yesterday? Od and yeah,
I got this black tar heroin came in.

1053
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:46,930
You know, I hadn't done it like three
months away. Figured fuck it. Oh,

1054
01:06:46,931 --> 01:06:49,720
is that what you did? How
was it? I wasn't, you know,
like, like you went to Aruba,

1055
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,190
you said October was all ice.

1056
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:57,400
I don't remember shit
she can do, you know,

1057
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:58,353
you get addicted to

1058
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,533
[inaudible].
That's fine.

1059
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:09,070
Hey,
what's going on?

1060
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:13,240
It's bill Belper and it is the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

1061
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:15,890
July 12th,
2010

1062
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:17,623
all la.

1063
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:22,690
I'm sorry,

1064
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:27,690
I was really gonna act like I could speak
Spanish there all although you'll soy

1065
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,840
comical, anemia, maybe litchi

1066
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:38,480
or numb on Santa Bent.
The loan A's Una COMESA.

1067
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:41,360
I actually,
if you can't tell,

1068
01:08:41,361 --> 01:08:46,100
I've actually finally broken open my
Rosetta stone that I got for Christmas two

1069
01:08:46,101 --> 01:08:50,120
and a half fucking years
ago. Whatever it is. Yeah,

1070
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,830
I got it for a year and a half ago.

1071
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,930
December of 2008 I got
a the Rosetta stone.

1072
01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:01,230
Um, oh God. Yeah. Black or Negro.

1073
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:06,540
Roho um, I, I got it, dude.
It's the shit. It's a shit.

1074
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,610
I'm going to be fluent in Spanish.

1075
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:12,210
I've always wanted to learn
another language and I am
trying to immerse myself.

1076
01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:15,900
That's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying
to immerse myself in the language.

1077
01:09:15,901 --> 01:09:20,380
I'm listening to it on the radio.
I'm also listening to it. Uh,

1078
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:25,960
you know, I'm listening to shit
like this on a, on my iTunes,

1079
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:29,160
hoping I can pick up some
shit. You know, you gotta,

1080
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:32,320
you gotta immerse yourself in this shit.
You got to listen to stuff like this.

1081
01:09:44,410 --> 01:09:46,270
A fucking great.
Is that

1082
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:50,970
got to have a fucking be able
to fucking no. What that means.

1083
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:55,920
Sing that have pigment in my chest
so I can actually wear that open.

1084
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:58,860
I'm going to go stab a ball.
Latino shirt.

1085
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:02,380
How much pussy would you get if he
could fucking, it's just unbelievable.

1086
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:05,780
It's half the shit that they say.

1087
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:10,610
It sounds like fucking dirty talk when
you're banging a girl in need yet.

1088
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:14,690
Pipit itchy. That means a girl who's
drinking them is drinking milk.

1089
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:20,290
There's no way to say that without,
just sounded like you're fucking, yeah,

1090
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:25,220
Nina. Vivid, itchy. Hey, next time
you guys are banging your girl. Okay.

1091
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:29,610
You got a Doggie style. Just lean down in
her ear and just feel like, ah, it itchy,

1092
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:31,260
needy of vivid,
itchy.

1093
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:39,280
Shall we even have an orgasm or fucking
world around and elbow when you,

1094
01:10:39,380 --> 01:10:42,290
you in the face either way. Either
way. It's going to be funny,

1095
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:48,160
but I want to be fluent in that Shit
and uh, I'm liking Rosetta stone.

1096
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:52,780
I really like it. You sit there and
you put on like a, a bill, Bellamy,

1097
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,170
Janet Jackson sort of headset,
you know, and uh, yeah,

1098
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:01,020
you put it on some stretchy
pants and then you put,

1099
01:11:01,021 --> 01:11:04,250
you put in the fucking CD Rom or whatever
the hell it is. And then they just,

1100
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:08,320
they just start speaking to you like
you're a baby sitting in the crib.

1101
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:10,270
That's exactly what it is.

1102
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:16,410
Two very stereotypical Mexican look and
faces just sort of peer into the screen,

1103
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:20,880
like you're laying in the crib and then
they just start speaking to you and they

1104
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:24,030
tickle your tummy. It's, it's
tremendous. It's a tremendous,

1105
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:29,430
it's a tremendous way to
nom. I'm just fucking around,
dude. It's awesome. It's a,

1106
01:11:29,431 --> 01:11:31,590
if you ever thinking about
doing it, like, you know,

1107
01:11:31,591 --> 01:11:34,260
I always wanted to learn to
speak a different language.

1108
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:35,820
Whenever I rode the subway,

1109
01:11:35,821 --> 01:11:39,660
I was nervous that Puerto Rican
through actually calling me bad words.

1110
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:44,190
What does [inaudible] mean?
Um, is that even Puerto Rican?

1111
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:46,530
This is what's killing me.
This is how fucking what I am.

1112
01:11:46,531 --> 01:11:50,590
I actually believe that I'm
going to learn this shit. Uh,

1113
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,240
El Nina Bibliology,
I'm going to learn this shit and uh,

1114
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:59,460
therefore I will be able to go
to Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico,

1115
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:03,990
Brazil or whatever, and be able to
understand every motherfucker out there,

1116
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:10,190
even though people I know this dude
who is Cuban and he tells me it's,

1117
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:14,240
it's really different. Not totally
different, but, um, I mean, I don't know.

1118
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:18,750
He seemed a little peeved when I was
like, yeah, and I can go to fucking Cuba.

1119
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:22,290
I can go to Dominican Republic.
It's not the fucking same thing.

1120
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,680
All right, sorry. You know
when it's one of those things,

1121
01:12:25,681 --> 01:12:29,490
I'm not even trying to be offensive and
I offended you, but it's like, you know,

1122
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:31,860
do you think when I go to Ireland
or I went, I went to Scotland.

1123
01:12:31,861 --> 01:12:34,770
I can understand those fuckers,
everything that they said,

1124
01:12:34,771 --> 01:12:35,970
but I knew what they was saying.

1125
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:43,410
Am I being ignorant right here?
Do you guys, is it a complete,

1126
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:47,940
it's not a completely different
language. Ah, they'll,

1127
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,190
Nina Bibby lit.

1128
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:52,350
You can't say that and fucking Cuba
and they won't know what you're talking

1129
01:12:52,351 --> 01:12:55,110
about. Is that because economy, communism,

1130
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:57,631
you know,

1131
01:12:57,631 --> 01:13:01,470
I already stopped this podcast and
started it again because I'm doing this

1132
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:03,120
Sunday morning.
My fucking brain isn't awake yet.

1133
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:08,430
Stuttering like a goddamn jackass.
Ah.

1134
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:13,460
Pantaloneys Sabbat
doors will not come Isa.

1135
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:19,740
I can't fucking wait. I can't wait
the first time somebody from uh,

1136
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:22,710
I was going to say somebody from
another language. That's how dumb I am.

1137
01:13:22,711 --> 01:13:26,640
Somebody speaking Spanish talk shit
about me because I'll tell you right now,

1138
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:30,420
I would fucking do it all the time.
I would do it all the Goddamn time.

1139
01:13:30,421 --> 01:13:34,410
If English was the second language was
not the main language of this country.

1140
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:39,210
And I had another English speaking
friends in and I was walking around people

1141
01:13:39,211 --> 01:13:43,020
who did not understand English and it'll
be our own little private language.

1142
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:47,310
I would be shitting on people,
right and left perverted stuff.

1143
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:52,320
Can you imagine that? If nobody understood
English, everybody just spoke Spanish,

1144
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:54,330
right? Your bosses, some can't,

1145
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:57,390
but she's got a nice rack and you sit
in there and she could literally walk by

1146
01:13:57,391 --> 01:14:01,050
and like, dude, I would tit, fuck
this bitch right on a Goddamn desk.

1147
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:04,890
And then turn around me. Oh
La me boss. Ah, you know,

1148
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,400
no wonder they're so fucking laid
back. They can get it out. I gotta sit.

1149
01:14:12,401 --> 01:14:16,150
I got to sit on all this goddamn rage
because I don't have some secret fucking

1150
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:19,870
language. All right. All right. Mexicans.

1151
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:22,780
I mean you fucking hide out and
I'm breaking down your code.

1152
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:28,180
So I'm telling you this time next year,
you better watch your tongue. Okay, good.

1153
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,190
All the I could turn learning
another language seat,

1154
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:34,450
see it and see here me stuttering.

1155
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:39,190
It's in the morning only I could turn
speaking another language and my only,

1156
01:14:39,191 --> 01:14:41,350
I could turn a the language,

1157
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,880
relax Mexico,
just relax.

1158
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:49,570
Just really listen to a couple of my
podcasts and realize how fucking stupid I

1159
01:14:49,571 --> 01:14:54,010
am. And also how I get totally psycho
into something for about 10 days.

1160
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:59,250
And then I just walk away from it and
then it just sits there gathering dust on

1161
01:14:59,801 --> 01:15:03,790
my desk.
Anyways,

1162
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:07,990
so it was a big week this weekend
in sports. It's actually, uh,

1163
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:11,500
what time is it right now?
It's 10 43 and this is the funny thing.

1164
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:16,870
In 17 minutes,
the World Cup final is starting,

1165
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:20,530
which is basically the championship,

1166
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:23,170
one of the true
championships of the world.

1167
01:15:23,171 --> 01:15:25,060
It's the entire world competes for it.

1168
01:15:25,810 --> 01:15:28,990
And as big a fucking sports fan as I am,

1169
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:31,030
I could give a shit.

1170
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:37,140
The only thing that I would find less
interesting than the World Cup final was

1171
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:42,130
the Lebron James Hour long
press conference to announce
what team he's going to

1172
01:15:42,131 --> 01:15:45,250
fucking go to. You know,
that's actually bullshit.

1173
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,710
I totally respect the game of soccer.
It just,

1174
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:50,530
it fucking bores the shit out of me.
And A,

1175
01:15:50,531 --> 01:15:54,010
we have a number of soccer fans on here
and they send me emails and they get mad

1176
01:15:54,011 --> 01:15:58,450
at me. They say, says, Dear Bill Dude,

1177
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:01,120
until you have a better
understanding of the game,

1178
01:16:01,121 --> 01:16:03,250
you gotta stop ragging on soccer.

1179
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,510
Find someone that knows a little bit
about the game and take some fucking time

1180
01:16:07,690 --> 01:16:12,370
and watch a couple of games.
Dude, watch the World Cup finals.

1181
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:17,440
Uh, exclamation point. What?
Cause you fucking say so. Um,

1182
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:21,070
do you realize that if you added up
everyone that watched the NFL, the NBA,

1183
01:16:21,071 --> 01:16:22,720
the Nhl,
and MLB,

1184
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:26,890
you would only have about half as
many people that watch soccer do.

1185
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:27,760
Do you realize that?

1186
01:16:27,761 --> 01:16:31,270
I'm not so fucking stupid that I don't
realize that you just pulled that stat

1187
01:16:31,271 --> 01:16:34,480
out of your ass.
Give me some numbers you didn't.

1188
01:16:34,481 --> 01:16:38,650
You said you would have about
PAF is about really? Yeah.

1189
01:16:38,651 --> 01:16:43,150
You're going to guesstimate there.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it bill.

1190
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:45,820
Thanks dude. All right.
This is the deal. All right.

1191
01:16:45,821 --> 01:16:50,821
I'm so sick of these fucking soccer
cunts trying to convince me that it's an

1192
01:16:52,450 --> 01:16:56,140
exciting sport. Do you think that
I haven't sat down and watched it

1193
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,970
earlier this year when I watched
the Olympics, I got into curling.

1194
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,200
I was watching the cross country skiing.
Will you shoot the gun?

1195
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,100
I'm very open minded when
it comes to sports. Okay.

1196
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:11,420
But to sit there and killed two,

1197
01:17:11,421 --> 01:17:16,421
three fucking hours of my day to watch
a zero to zero fucking game and watching

1198
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:21,080
these guys flop around like a bunch of
Goddamn POW goes Saul's every 10 fucking

1199
01:17:21,081 --> 01:17:24,170
minutes. It's, it's, I try, dude.

1200
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:29,090
I tried it just because the whole
fucking world is watching the sport.

1201
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:32,780
Does it mean that I should?
All right.

1202
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:37,100
The whole world was wearing an acid wash
jeans and the lay fucking eighties I

1203
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:41,510
followed that trend and I
got the embarrassing God
damn pictures to prove it.

1204
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,740
Where the fuck did that get me?
You know what I like about soccer?

1205
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:48,110
I like the highlights,
the highlights, you know,

1206
01:17:48,111 --> 01:17:51,470
and they show it in slow motion motion.
Absolutely gorgeous sport to watch,

1207
01:17:51,471 --> 01:17:55,040
but to sit there for fucking two hours
listening to those God damn mosquito

1208
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:59,780
horns, you're really
asking too much. All right,

1209
01:17:59,781 --> 01:18:02,780
everybody flopping around like a
bunch of God damn fucking girls.

1210
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,530
Get off the goddamn ground.
Fucking pussies.

1211
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:10,430
The guy doesn't even touch you
and you flop around on the ground.

1212
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:13,820
It's so a feminine. That's what
I can't stand about that sport.

1213
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:18,140
You know this guy did bring
up a good point. He goes,

1214
01:18:18,141 --> 01:18:20,900
you're telling me the basketball
players. Yes. Basketball players do.

1215
01:18:20,901 --> 01:18:25,250
Basketball is a very fucking a feminine
sport when it comes to that shit.

1216
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:31,010
That fake fucking flopping around.
Yeah,

1217
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,680
no other, you know, that's the
closest thing. I'm trying to think.

1218
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,720
There's a couple guys in the NHL,
look,

1219
01:18:35,721 --> 01:18:39,110
there's always going to be a couple
of broads in every sport, you know,

1220
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:43,160
but at least in, in, in the NHL
soccer fan, you know what they have,

1221
01:18:43,161 --> 01:18:46,880
they have a penalty for pretending that
somebody hit you two minutes. You get,

1222
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:49,190
it's called diving.
Two minutes for diving,

1223
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:52,460
get up you fag and getting
the Goddamn penalty box.

1224
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:00,260
I was, I dunno, I, I, dude, I tried. I
fucking tried. I tried to watch the shit.

1225
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,630
I don't give a fuck.
Um,

1226
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:06,530
I find the Premiere League
way more enjoyable to watch.

1227
01:19:06,531 --> 01:19:09,740
I can watch that game, but I got to
tell you like, I don't know what it is.

1228
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,490
I start to get a headache and I get a
little bit of a stomach ache when I'm

1229
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:18,491
watching it because the amount of
effort that I have to put in to,

1230
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:20,420
you know,
do,

1231
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:25,310
to sit there and in two hours of your
fucking life to watch a one to nothing

1232
01:19:25,311 --> 01:19:27,920
game. That's why, you know,

1233
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:32,720
so I think I finally figured out why
they fight in Nhl hockey cause you can

1234
01:19:32,721 --> 01:19:35,480
actually have a one to nothing
fucking game. So, you know,

1235
01:19:35,481 --> 01:19:40,100
then we basically have guys going, it's
legal to smash somebody's, you know,

1236
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:43,130
against the boards. You can
drop the gloves, he could fight.

1237
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:47,690
There's a lot of other exciting things
that, that, that do happen. All right?

1238
01:19:47,691 --> 01:19:50,060
But to sit there for two fucking hours.

1239
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:56,790
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my
God. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

1240
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:01,220
yeah. Ooh, ah,

1241
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,730
it's the sports equivalent
to fucking blue balls.

1242
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:10,230
I don't fucking like it. I really
don't. I just don't. I don't like it.

1243
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,510
I don't fucking like it.
Okay.

1244
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:15,510
And you can't make me fucking like
it because the whole world likes it.

1245
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:20,730
All right. Is this is a major part
of the fucking world that, you know,

1246
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:25,260
they, they take out a high grade piece
of sandpaper and then they, they,

1247
01:20:25,261 --> 01:20:27,030
they rubbed the girl's fucking clips off.

1248
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:30,090
That doesn't mean that I think it's
right. Wow. That was really disgusting.

1249
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:34,650
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 12 minutes into
the podcast, getting that fucking gross.

1250
01:20:34,651 --> 01:20:39,360
I should have saved that towards
the end for the die hard fans. Um,

1251
01:20:39,390 --> 01:20:42,600
so anyways, that, that Lebron
James Announcement, um,

1252
01:20:42,720 --> 01:20:46,860
speaking of mind numbingly boring.
Um,

1253
01:20:48,230 --> 01:20:50,920
I listen to think about fucking
soccer. Like I'm invited to this, this,

1254
01:20:50,921 --> 01:20:55,921
this party where they're going to watch
the finals and whenever you find a

1255
01:20:57,390 --> 01:21:00,550
person who's really into
soccer, you know, yeah,

1256
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,880
they always get like the
little soccer shirt on.

1257
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:06,900
They always have like these little
fucking wimpy torsos. If you notice,

1258
01:21:06,901 --> 01:21:10,830
that was the last time you saw somebody
jacked that was into fucking soccer.

1259
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:15,180
You don't always have like those little
fucking, those little European torsos,

1260
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,450
you know,
your little seventh grade bodies.

1261
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,710
It does anybody lift weights or do
pushups or anything in fucking Europe?

1262
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:23,881
Do you just,

1263
01:21:23,881 --> 01:21:28,650
you just take the torso God gave you and
then you just start stuffing fish and

1264
01:21:28,651 --> 01:21:33,651
chips down your fucking throat and you
just let it all sort of slide down until

1265
01:21:34,801 --> 01:21:38,550
you look like Jethro Tull. Um, all right.

1266
01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:41,460
I think I've tried that shit enough.
Let's trash in American sports.

1267
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:45,840
Let's talk about fucking
Lebron James and his fucking,

1268
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:50,010
first of all, his howdy doody
puppets shirt that he wore. You know,

1269
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:53,790
there really is this theory out there
that black guys are so cool that they

1270
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:56,790
really can wear any type of clothing
and make it look good. Well,

1271
01:21:56,820 --> 01:22:01,680
that was an example when it doesn't
quite always work. I mean, that was a,

1272
01:22:01,681 --> 01:22:02,760
I don't know what that was.

1273
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:07,110
That looked like he was going to go
sing on the Grand Ole Opry in like 1948.

1274
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:12,300
Um, all right, the fuck
am I talking about?

1275
01:22:12,301 --> 01:22:14,570
Let's get into this whole
podcast thing. Alright. Uh,

1276
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:18,720
the Lebron James one hour announcement
for everybody out there who's saying how

1277
01:22:18,721 --> 01:22:23,070
fucking lame it was. Um, you
know who's fault that is?

1278
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:24,570
It's your own God damn fault.

1279
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:29,130
It's your own fucking fault for
sitting there and watching it. Okay?

1280
01:22:29,131 --> 01:22:33,180
It's not like ESPN lied.
They told you what it was going to be.

1281
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:38,880
[inaudible] this is going to be a one
hour special of an athlete announcing

1282
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:41,490
which team he's going to go
fucking play for. I mean,

1283
01:22:41,491 --> 01:22:45,060
how long should that realistically take?
It's like the fucking Oscars.

1284
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,710
How long should it take to be and to,

1285
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:52,750
to take to just fucking be like
in the Oscar goes to Sean Connery

1286
01:22:55,080 --> 01:23:00,080
and the Oscar for the best fucking
dress in a period piece goes to Claire,

1287
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:02,303
Bill Billingsley,

1288
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:08,110
Bill Billingsley clear bill Billingsley
fucking Douche bag. Go Burn.

1289
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:09,120
Not even fucking awake.

1290
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:12,970
Trying to do a podcast to get it out of
the Goddamn way to go to some stupid ass

1291
01:23:12,971 --> 01:23:16,420
fucking party that's showing the finals
of a sport that he doesn't give a fuck

1292
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:20,950
about. That starts in
nine minutes. Oh my God.

1293
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:25,810
Somebody hit fucking
record. Um, yeah. I mean,

1294
01:23:25,811 --> 01:23:29,200
you knew what the fuck it was going to
be. Why did you even watch it? I mean,

1295
01:23:29,201 --> 01:23:30,550
can't you tell that that day,

1296
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:35,200
that guy just got some fucking horrific
and he just got horrific advice from his

1297
01:23:35,201 --> 01:23:37,450
people around him who they were just like,

1298
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:42,250
we're going to create the biggest
media stir ever. All right,

1299
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:45,700
we'll go to Chicago first. We'll gain
some interests. We'll go to the Knicks,

1300
01:23:45,701 --> 01:23:48,670
we'll get some interested. We'll
go down and fucking man, oh,

1301
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:51,280
where the fuck is he going to?
Who gives a shit?

1302
01:23:53,050 --> 01:23:57,700
Nobody cares except the people in
those fucking towns. I gotta tell you,

1303
01:23:57,701 --> 01:24:00,580
I really did enjoy him. Fucking, you know,

1304
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:05,290
tear in the hearts on in
Knicks fans because as always,

1305
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:09,010
New York fans are the most fucking,
just like a,

1306
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:15,280
that's the sense of entitlement that
fans of New York sports have just because

1307
01:24:15,281 --> 01:24:16,660
they live in New York City.

1308
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:21,190
If I have to watch one
more fucking asshole on TV,

1309
01:24:21,340 --> 01:24:26,020
talk about the big stage in
New York. Okay. Overrated.

1310
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:29,710
Underrated for this week. Overrated.
The big stage in New York,

1311
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:34,840
there's only one big stage in New York.
It's in fucking Yankee stadium.

1312
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:40,480
That's the only big stage that is in New
York. 27 championships. You go there,

1313
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,130
there is pressure to win.

1314
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:47,920
What is this big like when Lebron
didn't pick fucking in New York? I'm on,

1315
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:51,700
you know, I'm online and I read three
comments and I'm like, there you go.

1316
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,560
That's enough evidence for me.

1317
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:56,530
I'm going to judge every new
fan in New York right now.

1318
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:01,360
They were all sitting there going like,
oh, he was afraid of the bright lights.

1319
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:05,710
He couldn't handle the big stage
of New York. Let me ask you this,

1320
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:06,630
Nick fans,

1321
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:11,630
where is the big fucking stage for
professional basketball in New York City?

1322
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:16,840
Huh? Madison Square Garden, that place,

1323
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:21,400
the biggest thing that happens in Madison
Square Garden every year is Elton John

1324
01:25:21,401 --> 01:25:26,170
comes there and sell. He fucking
sells out 20 shows. You know

1325
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:31,720
Bruce Springsteen comes there and
sings his songs about New Jersey.

1326
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:34,780
The circus comes once a fucking year.

1327
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:39,520
Those are the biggest days every year.
And Madison Square Garden.

1328
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:42,550
All right, and in case you don't
know what I'm talking about,

1329
01:25:42,551 --> 01:25:47,460
next time you go there and there's
yet another horrific played by May,

1330
01:25:47,461 --> 01:25:49,630
by either the fucking
rangers or the Knicks,

1331
01:25:49,780 --> 01:25:53,890
and you look up and discussed to that,
to the sports gods,

1332
01:25:54,010 --> 01:25:55,330
like what the fuck?

1333
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:59,740
When you're done praying for some messiah
to come in there and save those two

1334
01:25:59,741 --> 01:26:02,710
pathetic fucking franchises,
look up at the ceiling

1335
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,780
and tell me what you see.

1336
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:10,970
A striking lack of
championship fucking banners.

1337
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:13,400
I'll even give you the goddamn
answers you dumped. Fucks.

1338
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,080
There is no big stage and
it's so fucking disrespectful.

1339
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:23,760
I've everybody to say that all the
fucking time. Talking about Amy,

1340
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:28,160
you know when they talk about
the biggest stage in, in major,

1341
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:32,240
Major League baseball team, what do they
say? Fenway Park. How about Saint Louis?

1342
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:37,280
Say they got,
they got 10 fucking world series titles.

1343
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:41,120
That's not even a good example.

1344
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:45,230
It's not like the Knicks are in
second place with titles. Dude,

1345
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:50,090
Yankee stadium is the big stage and
made major league baseball. Okay?

1346
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:55,520
The fucking Celtics have
17 NBA championships that
we're all one in Boston.

1347
01:26:56,830 --> 01:27:00,920
All right. The Los Angeles Lakers,
11 titles have been one there.

1348
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:05,150
They once a year they hold hands with
somebody from Minnesota and they add the

1349
01:27:05,151 --> 01:27:07,190
five that we're in. That's,
that's the thing right there.

1350
01:27:07,550 --> 01:27:11,420
The Minneapolis Lakers have more
titles than the fucking New York next.

1351
01:27:11,421 --> 01:27:14,740
Do you guys understand that?
That a team that's dead,

1352
01:27:14,750 --> 01:27:18,920
that fucking moved west.
All right.

1353
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:24,040
That moved fucking West around the same
time the Brooklyn Dodgers went out to la

1354
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,020
still has three more
fucking titles than you do.

1355
01:27:27,260 --> 01:27:32,260
You don't have a big stage there and
nobody is afraid to play in New York City

1356
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:35,630
and there's certainly not afraid
to play the fucking Knicks.

1357
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:41,240
So get off your own dicks.
I'm sick of it. All right.

1358
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:46,360
The jets haven't won it since 69 the
Knicks haven't wanted since 73 the mets

1359
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:48,920
haven't won it since fucking 86

1360
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:54,920
who else has left? The giants
are, are a respectable franchise.

1361
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:58,520
That's the best you have. You have
a respectable franchise that is one.

1362
01:27:58,521 --> 01:28:03,500
The same amount of Superbowls is the
patriots, the packers, the Redskins,

1363
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:07,910
and the Raiders.
The giants are in the middle of the pack.

1364
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:11,450
All right?
There's no big fucking stage.

1365
01:28:11,570 --> 01:28:14,630
And they sit there and they act like
these sports writers in New York.

1366
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:17,480
These fat man tinted jackasses,

1367
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:22,780
these fill mush nics are going intimidate
a guy at the level of fucking Lebron

1368
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:25,190
James. They're not. I hate to
tell it to you in New York.

1369
01:28:25,191 --> 01:28:28,910
The reason why he didn't go to Madison
Square Garden is cause she has suck.

1370
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:32,270
That's why,
I mean think about that.

1371
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:36,710
Who the fuck wouldn't want to
go play in New York? You know,

1372
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:42,100
New York is the city is the
Paris of fucking of America.

1373
01:28:42,171 --> 01:28:45,620
It's the best fucking city we have.
All right.

1374
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:50,090
But just because there's a bunch of
people outside of Madison Square Garden

1375
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:52,760
succeeding and doing some shit,

1376
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:55,160
most of whom aren't even
from New York by the way.

1377
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:58,273
That's another thing.

1378
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,160
New Yorkers think they're the shit
just because they live there just

1379
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,360
because they're standing on the corner
of fucking 52nd and third eaten a slice.

1380
01:29:07,390 --> 01:29:11,560
You know, if I can mark it
there, I'll make an anywhere.

1381
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:16,400
Are you really making it with your dirty
fucking sneakers standing there outside

1382
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:19,040
of Tad steaks?
You're not doing shit.

1383
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:23,030
None of you are all you fucking pieces
of Shit fucking gathering outside of

1384
01:29:23,031 --> 01:29:24,230
fucking port authority.

1385
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:28,440
Yeah. That's another thing of, Oh
man, I'm trashing the York this week.

1386
01:29:28,441 --> 01:29:33,210
I don't give a fuck. Listen to me. I
don't give a fuck who bill. Really?

1387
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:35,790
You're being dangerous.
It's dangerous to make

1388
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:42,070
the alarm Bray and a data resol.
Um,

1389
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:48,590
do Frank Sinatra's from New Jersey.
Okay. He was bridge and tunnel.

1390
01:29:49,290 --> 01:29:49,950
Okay.

1391
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:53,700
The kind of the kind of guy that Paris
Hilton wouldn't have fucked in one of her

1392
01:29:54,030 --> 01:29:57,780
whore night clubs down there
in the meatpacking district.
If he came in and said,

1393
01:29:57,781 --> 01:29:58,920
oh,
I live in Hoboken,

1394
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,670
she would have turned a little pointy
nose up to the ceiling and walked away,

1395
01:30:02,671 --> 01:30:07,030
or in a big fucking Sasquatch
feet that she tries to hide.

1396
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:12,230
Bye Jack. And a god Goddamn fucking
ass in the air to eye level.

1397
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:18,240
No girls would have banged that guy.
But what did he do? He came in there,

1398
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:21,780
he came in there and he fucking sang a
song and he took over your fucking city,

1399
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:25,560
the way a bunch of people from other
states that you fucking New Yorkers looked

1400
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:28,090
down on.
We come in there all the time.

1401
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:33,040
We come in there and we blow away half
the fucking talent in New York because

1402
01:30:33,041 --> 01:30:35,530
you guys are standing there
eating a slice of pizza,

1403
01:30:35,531 --> 01:30:40,240
looking at the fucking empire state
building going, oh, it's open all night.

1404
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:44,510
You're not doing shit.
You don't have a big stage.

1405
01:30:44,511 --> 01:30:49,430
You have a sorry ass fucking NBA team.
You know this.

1406
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:52,100
How dumb the fucking nics are.
Isaiah Thomas,

1407
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:57,930
there was a league called the CBA that
did find for like 30 fucking years and

1408
01:30:57,931 --> 01:31:00,810
then s what's his face?
Isaiah Thomas.

1409
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:05,560
Thomas became president of the
league and in like three, four years,

1410
01:31:06,010 --> 01:31:10,140
I don't have the fucking stats. I don't
know, five years. It went out of business.

1411
01:31:11,530 --> 01:31:14,900
Okay. I'm not talking about, you know,

1412
01:31:14,901 --> 01:31:17,480
a winning franchise went
to a losing franchise.

1413
01:31:17,630 --> 01:31:22,010
I'm not talking about a
franchise that existed in a city,

1414
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:25,130
had to move.
I'm not even saying the franchise folded.

1415
01:31:25,131 --> 01:31:28,340
I'm talking about an
entire fucking league.

1416
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,460
He got it to controls.

1417
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:36,320
He pushed the yolk forward and just flew
the shit right into the goddamn ground.

1418
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:40,170
All right?
And like bugs bunny.

1419
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:45,260
He stepped out right before it hit the
ground before any of it got on him and

1420
01:31:45,521 --> 01:31:47,770
then the next go.
Yet that's our guy.

1421
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:53,370
That's the guy we're going to get to
run the f a fucking NBA franchise.

1422
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:55,740
The guy who fucking

1423
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:01,360
flew bootleg NBA into the goddamn
ground. That's the fucking dude. See,

1424
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:04,830
that's why Lebron didn't come.
Not because he's afraid of the big stage.

1425
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:07,500
You want to know who is afraid
of the big stage? Jeff Weaver.

1426
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:10,460
Jeff Weaver was afraid of the big stage.
Okay?

1427
01:32:10,461 --> 01:32:14,210
But Lebron James is not afraid
of the big, the big stage. Okay?

1428
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:20,780
He could fucking put his nuts on Jeff
waivers chest and hold them down in the

1429
01:32:20,781 --> 01:32:22,790
deep end of a fucking pool.
All right?

1430
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:25,130
He's not afraid of fucking
Madison Square Garden

1431
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:28,090
and I also thought it
was really fucking ironic

1432
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,770
of the three emails that
I read by New Yorkers,

1433
01:32:31,771 --> 01:32:35,610
which I'm now judging all of them,
they were going like, you know Miami.

1434
01:32:35,611 --> 01:32:40,130
That's Dwayne Wade's town. If he goes
down there and wins a championship there,

1435
01:32:40,250 --> 01:32:41,690
nobody's going to respect him.

1436
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:47,440
Can you fucking believe a New Yorker had
the balls to say that with the fucking

1437
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:52,120
pile on team that the Yankees have
been for the last 12 fucking years?

1438
01:32:52,780 --> 01:32:57,780
Every goddamn free agent on the fucking
planet just clinging to Derek Jeters

1439
01:32:57,991 --> 01:33:02,340
leg. Show me how to do
it. I want to win one too.

1440
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:07,770
Huh? Roger Clemens, that fat buffalo wing,

1441
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:12,230
Eaton Jackass. Was it
hard up in Toronto? Roger.

1442
01:33:12,350 --> 01:33:14,900
Then he fucking comes down there
and jumps in the fucking Limo.

1443
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:18,830
The fucking balls are these New York
fans to sit there and question somebody's

1444
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:23,360
piling on another team to go in a fucking
championship. I, I can't even take it.

1445
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:29,230
I think I've got to drink some throat
coat tea that I mentioned that on this

1446
01:33:29,231 --> 01:33:32,440
podcast cause I already deleted the
other one when I was annoyed with how

1447
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:35,120
fucking unfunny I was.
Um,

1448
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:37,910
ground when I go out on a limb here and
say that the ratings for this in New

1449
01:33:37,910 --> 01:33:41,180
York City are going to be kind of low
this week I've got this throat coat tea,

1450
01:33:41,210 --> 01:33:45,260
which is a great, if you stand on stage
and you don't know how to write a joke,

1451
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:48,150
you have to scream at jokes or even
feel like to call your girlfriend and

1452
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:51,930
comment at the top of your lungs.
You know, you have to do that.

1453
01:33:51,931 --> 01:33:55,290
And then the next day you want to do it
again. But you throw his two tore up.

1454
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:59,700
You can't do it. Well get organic
throat coat tea. Everybody.

1455
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:04,760
You could call your girl account seven
days a week. Three and 65 days a year.

1456
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:10,080
That'd be a great commercial, right? Just
have the girl crying in the background.

1457
01:34:10,081 --> 01:34:13,740
Sitting down in the fetal position is
you're fucking sitting in the field.

1458
01:34:13,770 --> 01:34:18,220
Fetal position bill curled up
in the fetal position bill.

1459
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:22,660
He had dumb fuck. All right, let's see.
What did I do so far in this podcast?

1460
01:34:22,661 --> 01:34:25,630
I pissed off anyone who isn't from America

1461
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:27,290
or I guess you know

1462
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:32,720
Americans who are also into soccer and
then I trashed a a giant media market.

1463
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,410
See right there bill.

1464
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:39,830
That's why New York is such the
big stage because it's worded

1465
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:42,960
the biggest media markets in
all of the fucking cook for you.

1466
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:48,980
How pathetic are you fucking teams that
you've got to bring up the level of

1467
01:34:49,261 --> 01:34:51,150
media in your city,

1468
01:34:53,350 --> 01:34:56,440
the level of media gimme a fucking break.

1469
01:34:57,630 --> 01:34:58,910
Two Championship banners,

1470
01:34:58,911 --> 01:35:03,911
1970 fucking three do you know in 1973
the Chevy Vega was considered a sports

1471
01:35:06,101 --> 01:35:10,100
car.
And if you go on the game show network,

1472
01:35:11,120 --> 01:35:15,830
people lose their fucking
minds about that car, you know,

1473
01:35:15,990 --> 01:35:18,000
and you can win.
And then they opened the current

1474
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:24,440
Brad Little Chevy Vega and these people
with their fucking big Greg Greg Bait,

1475
01:35:24,441 --> 01:35:29,090
Brady fucking belt buckles,
and they're fucking,

1476
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:34,370
ah, who's that dude from? Knocked
up, observe and report their,

1477
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,560
there's Seth Rogan fucking Afros go
absolutely fucking ape shit over a Chevy

1478
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:45,140
Vega.
That's when you guys won it last.

1479
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:51,460
People from are dying of old
fucking age on that team.

1480
01:35:51,651 --> 01:35:55,580
Who Do you have an attorney? Who are
the fucking, the Nix, the greats.

1481
01:35:58,190 --> 01:36:00,700
Who Do you got?
Bill Bradley Dodd.

1482
01:36:01,070 --> 01:36:04,640
He became a senator and
then he fucking died.

1483
01:36:09,890 --> 01:36:12,020
This is what it is.
You want to get down to brass tacks here?

1484
01:36:12,021 --> 01:36:17,000
What's really bugging me is, uh, in
Boston we only have four sports teams.

1485
01:36:17,570 --> 01:36:21,470
Okay. We're playing a fucking, you know,

1486
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:26,240
we got one, one bullet in the chamber
and those cuts down there in New York,

1487
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,920
they're doubled down in two out of
the four fucking sports every year.

1488
01:36:31,090 --> 01:36:33,560
This split and fucking aces
in two different sports.

1489
01:36:34,310 --> 01:36:38,300
So they pad their stats with
championships. But I respect the Yankees.

1490
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:43,750
The Yankees are the greatest
franchise in an an all for sports.

1491
01:36:43,851 --> 01:36:47,300
They got the fucking championships.
You have to respect it. They got them.

1492
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:52,450
And I would never ever try to act like
somebody was afraid to play in Boston

1493
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:58,970
because of the media or whatever the fuck
that you know or call it the big stage

1494
01:36:58,971 --> 01:37:02,060
in Boston.
All right.

1495
01:37:02,061 --> 01:37:04,490
I would never do that out of
respect for the fucking Yankees.

1496
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:07,940
The fact that they have 20 more
fucking championships than we do.

1497
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:10,610
Okay,

1498
01:37:10,610 --> 01:37:15,610
so give me the fucking respect that
I deserve as a Boston Celtics Fan,

1499
01:37:15,741 --> 01:37:20,741
that we have 15 more fucking NBA
championships than you do fucking idiots.

1500
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:23,810
The big state.

1501
01:37:23,811 --> 01:37:28,811
I'm so sick of these fat
mantated shitheads with their
fucking game worn jerseys

1502
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:33,020
and they yell shit at players on the
field and they think that they're

1503
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:34,040
intimidating them.

1504
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:40,270
You know like the fact that you got a d
up Kobe Bryant that you know that night

1505
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,940
isn't enough to make you nervous?
No,

1506
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,350
it's the fat fuck with the
shaved head and fucking row 58 g

1507
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:54,830
who Stew's Chanten airball it. They don't
care. They don't even fucking hear it.

1508
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:58,170
They don't even hear it. Lebron James
is not afraid to go to New York.

1509
01:37:58,350 --> 01:38:02,220
He wanted to win. All right? That's
why the fuck he went to Miami.

1510
01:38:04,140 --> 01:38:07,600
But uh, you know, and I would really
love it and this is the deal if,

1511
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:11,520
if the fucking Lakers didn't exist,
um,

1512
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:15,840
with this stupid tee shirts claiming that
the Los Angeles Lakers have fucking 16,

1513
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:17,310
because that's what the t shirt says.

1514
01:38:17,370 --> 01:38:19,920
It says Los Angeles
Lakers 16 championships,

1515
01:38:19,921 --> 01:38:24,900
not Los Angeles Slash Minneapolis Lakers.
Um,

1516
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:29,160
so now I have to become a Miami heat fan.
I really do. But just for the record,

1517
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:33,600
dude, I don't like any of this shit.
I didn't like the 2008 Boston Celtics.

1518
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:37,850
I didn't like that either.
Where you just go out and,

1519
01:38:37,851 --> 01:38:40,860
and just everybody piles on one team.
I don't fucking like it.

1520
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:45,500
I don't like this age of the super teams.
It's a,

1521
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:49,180
yeah, I don't even, that's not, I don't
know what it is anymore. It's like the,

1522
01:38:49,190 --> 01:38:50,220
it's like a,

1523
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:54,450
it's sports are becoming like what
wreath retail stores have become.

1524
01:38:54,450 --> 01:38:56,070
They're all like these super stores now.

1525
01:38:57,030 --> 01:39:00,330
There's not like just the regular
hardware store. That example,

1526
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:03,480
I use every podcast.
It's always a hardware store with me,

1527
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,620
but fucking one trick pony. It's
all fucking, it's all Walmarts now.

1528
01:39:07,621 --> 01:39:11,400
Home depots best buys,
all of that type of shit.

1529
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,640
And uh,
I dunno,

1530
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:18,290
it's not the same kind of pride like,
uh,

1531
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:23,370
that you had back in the day when you
watched red Arrow back get some unknown

1532
01:39:24,691 --> 01:39:28,830
center from Golden State.
You know Robert Parish,

1533
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:33,600
who the fuck knew who he was before he
came to the Celtics and he goes after

1534
01:39:33,601 --> 01:39:38,601
Kevin Mchale wasn't a highly touted
draft pick and then Larry Bird,

1535
01:39:39,351 --> 01:39:42,870
he works on for like three fucking years
and gets them to come to the Celtics

1536
01:39:42,871 --> 01:39:44,280
like that with some interesting shit.

1537
01:39:44,580 --> 01:39:47,820
But nowadays when you got
shit like Kevin Mchale,

1538
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:52,821
a former Celtic is working for the
grizzlies and he gives the fucking Celtics

1539
01:39:53,101 --> 01:39:56,280
Kevin Garnett for nothing,
for nothing.

1540
01:39:57,270 --> 01:39:59,550
Decimates an entire fucking franchise.

1541
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:04,740
The same way Jerry West is fucking
working from Memphis and gives the fucking

1542
01:40:04,741 --> 01:40:09,660
Lakers Pau Gasol for nothing. I mean,
it's, I don't know. I don't fucking know.

1543
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:14,340
And the fact that these fucking knick
fans are sitting there talking about that

1544
01:40:14,341 --> 01:40:19,341
guy piling on as the god Damn Yankees
are Erin negotiations to try to get cliff

1545
01:40:19,831 --> 01:40:24,110
Lee. Like they don't have enough
with fucking sabbatical. Aja Burnett,

1546
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,760
Marianna Rivera,
fucking Alex Rodriguez,

1547
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:29,280
Al fucking to share all those guys.

1548
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:32,220
I love all the names of fading away cause
I don't even watch baseball anymore.

1549
01:40:32,221 --> 01:40:36,250
It's such a fucking stupid goddamn sport.
Um,

1550
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:42,180
dude, if the Yankees got cliff Lee, you
might as well just mail them the trophy,

1551
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:46,890
you know, and um, this is what it is.
I Dunno if I'm just as crabby old man.

1552
01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:51,450
I'm really trying to find the art in,

1553
01:40:52,170 --> 01:40:53,003
uh,

1554
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:57,730
signing all these free agents because
it just seems to me like whoever has the

1555
01:40:57,731 --> 01:40:58,660
most fucking money

1556
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:04,940
will eventually get most
of the best guys in.

1557
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,600
Occasionally you'll lose out on a guy,
occasionally a cliff Lee,

1558
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:10,030
we'll go to the rangers,
you know,

1559
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:14,890
or somebody will pick the fucking angels
or maybe they'll go to the fucking red

1560
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:16,720
sox or something like that.
But generally speaking,

1561
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:20,260
you start with the fucking Yankees
and then it just goes down. I Dunno,

1562
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:22,940
I just doesn't seem like there's any
fucking skill that I had just spent over

1563
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:28,120
five. You know what it is. I'm on my
fucking period this week, half hour a rag.

1564
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:33,010
Ragging about that shit. Let's get to uh,
let's keep, let's just totally fucking,

1565
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:36,520
uh, make a left turn here. And, uh,

1566
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:42,100
somebody asked me some for
some advices week. All right,

1567
01:41:42,101 --> 01:41:43,870
here we go. This is, this
is now, this is a quote.

1568
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:48,900
This is a situation that I think a lot
of people that all embrace can deal with.

1569
01:41:51,850 --> 01:41:56,590
Um, let's see here. Uh, hey
bill, huge fan. Love you. Comedy.

1570
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,220
Pull a good book, but the hope
this won't get too long. Um,

1571
01:42:01,150 --> 01:42:04,870
it starts with one of my good
friends going out with this girl. Uh,

1572
01:42:04,871 --> 01:42:07,710
they went out for a body of right
off the bat. You know, you can't,

1573
01:42:07,730 --> 01:42:08,920
can't you tell where this is going?

1574
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:13,210
This story starts with one of my good
friends going out with this girl.

1575
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:18,800
They went out for about a year or
two to honor on and off. Come on,

1576
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,820
Bill. Focus here. Just try to
read this smoothly. All right,

1577
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:24,640
let's start over and starts with one of
my good friends going out with this girl.

1578
01:42:24,670 --> 01:42:29,050
They went out for about a year or
two on and off. I'm still though,

1579
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:30,850
even when they were together,

1580
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:34,570
they were never really good in quotes.

1581
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:39,893
Here we go.

1582
01:42:40,090 --> 01:42:44,590
They fought basically all the time and
just didn't seem right for each other

1583
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:46,170
though.
G Gee,

1584
01:42:46,420 --> 01:42:50,590
you know where this is going during
the early stages of their relationship.

1585
01:42:50,591 --> 01:42:54,190
My friend thought I had
a thing for her old Judy.

1586
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:57,190
She's a,
she is a good looking girl.

1587
01:42:57,370 --> 01:43:01,420
She is a good looking girl and I was
friends with her before they even got

1588
01:43:01,421 --> 01:43:02,740
together.
Dude,

1589
01:43:02,741 --> 01:43:07,741
you are so justifying what the fuck
you either did or about ready to do.

1590
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:11,260
I love it.
They weren't really good for each other.

1591
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:14,740
Even when they were together, they
just, there was something missing.

1592
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:19,720
I actually knew her before
he did. Um, here we go.

1593
01:43:19,721 --> 01:43:23,020
She is a good looking girl and I was
friends with her before they were even

1594
01:43:23,021 --> 01:43:23,470
together.

1595
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:28,470
I admit I might have inadvertently been
a little flirty with her sometimes.

1596
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:36,910
Oh, I'm sorry. It was I just flirting
there. Do you have a future at uh,

1597
01:43:36,911 --> 01:43:41,911
at BP the next time they pollute an
entire Gulf of a nation that they're not

1598
01:43:42,251 --> 01:43:47,230
even citizens of and they need to bring
somebody out to stand behind the podium.

1599
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:48,550
Dude,
this is fucking great.

1600
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:52,940
I might have inadvertently
been a little flirty with her.

1601
01:43:53,690 --> 01:43:56,810
How the fuck do you even do that? How do
you inadvertently flirt with somebody?

1602
01:43:58,030 --> 01:44:00,350
Why are you really look beautiful in
that dress? I'll tell you if you will.

1603
01:44:00,351 --> 01:44:03,890
My girlfriend, I have a debit.
Duh. I mean, wait, what the
fuck do you go with? Oh,

1604
01:44:03,891 --> 01:44:06,920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's right.
You're not my girlfriend. I'm sorry.

1605
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:11,120
I thought you were my girlfriend for a
second. What was I thinking? Jesus Christ.

1606
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:13,790
I'm so embarrassed. My face
turning red. Oh my God.

1607
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:18,260
I was just inadvertently
flirting with you right then. Ah,

1608
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:22,790
Jesus. Uh, here we go. But he
goes, this is what he says.

1609
01:44:22,791 --> 01:44:25,610
I might have inadvertently been a
little flirty with her sometimes,

1610
01:44:25,611 --> 01:44:28,250
but that shit always happens
with a guy and a girl.

1611
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:33,251
I think do the level of
guilt just weighing you down
as you're trying to justify

1612
01:44:33,561 --> 01:44:38,340
all of this? Uh, either
way I told him, um,

1613
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:41,090
I didn't like her,
which was true dude,

1614
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:44,660
stop lying to yourself
anyways, it passed. However,

1615
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:46,670
I always got this
feeling that there was a,

1616
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:51,650
there was still an undertone that
he resented me since then. Yeah.

1617
01:44:51,651 --> 01:44:56,420
Probably because of all the inadvertent
flirting and the fact that you were

1618
01:44:56,421 --> 01:45:01,220
emoting that they weren't right for
each other. Um, but anyways, let's,

1619
01:45:01,221 --> 01:45:04,070
let's, let's fast forward as
he says, fast forward now.

1620
01:45:04,071 --> 01:45:09,020
They've been broken up for at least
a year and don't talk. She says,

1621
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:13,220
uh, he randomly texts
her Texas, her texts her,

1622
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:18,260
Jesus Christ. I can't even fucking
read. She says he randomly texted her,

1623
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:22,670
but uh, that she doesn't ever
answer him. But regardless of that,

1624
01:45:22,910 --> 01:45:27,770
now this girl likes me. What? Oh my God,

1625
01:45:27,771 --> 01:45:31,790
I didn't see that coming.
Wait a minute. Anyways,

1626
01:45:31,791 --> 01:45:36,791
but she actually likes me and basically
says she wants to fuck my voice.

1627
01:45:37,281 --> 01:45:38,300
Just cracked in the perfect.

1628
01:45:40,850 --> 01:45:44,330
Says she wants to fuck.
Am I getting excited?

1629
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:49,400
I need some more throat coat here and
basically says she wants to fuck. Um,

1630
01:45:49,401 --> 01:45:54,401
she tells me stuff like she wishes she
went out with me instead of him to begin

1631
01:45:54,981 --> 01:45:58,040
with.
Now I do all right with girls,

1632
01:45:58,550 --> 01:46:00,860
but I don't have them
lining up or anything.

1633
01:46:01,070 --> 01:46:05,150
So I'm not trying to let a
virtual shirt thing passed me by.

1634
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:08,960
Oh my God. And this is when it's
getting Jerry Springer here.

1635
01:46:10,550 --> 01:46:12,730
Uh, with most guys. I don't, I,

1636
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:17,790
I'd feel like they'd not care if I went
forward or at least understand why I

1637
01:46:18,471 --> 01:46:22,580
did.
Do you realize what you're saying?

1638
01:46:22,581 --> 01:46:27,050
I think most guys wouldn't care if their
best friend went out and bang their

1639
01:46:27,051 --> 01:46:29,960
fucking ex-girlfriend within
a year of them going out.

1640
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:34,310
I think that they'd understand.
So anyways, he goes,

1641
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:35,600
I think most guys wanted to stand,

1642
01:46:35,601 --> 01:46:40,601
but this buddy of mine is a little nuts
and it's also a situation where he's the

1643
01:46:41,031 --> 01:46:45,950
type of guy that if he were in my
position, he do the same thing. Ah, dude,

1644
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:49,950
you just justifying, you don't even need
my advice, you're going to do it. Um,

1645
01:46:50,940 --> 01:46:54,570
my other friend who knows the
whole situation says I should,

1646
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:59,070
but others I've talked to
about it. Say I shouldn't. Uh,

1647
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,690
the last I talked to her,

1648
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:06,380
she said she wanted to hang out just me
and her and then I should let her know

1649
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:13,320
when I want to. Uh, all right. I
guess this seems getting kind of long.

1650
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:14,700
I have one question.

1651
01:47:14,701 --> 01:47:19,470
Do I have any justification and
fucking this girl and two, if I do,

1652
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:24,330
would you say I should go through with it?
Okay.

1653
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:26,250
All right,
sir.

1654
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:32,010
There there's just this just a
ton of shit going on here. Okay.

1655
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:36,840
Right off the bat. Um, you have
to be honest with yourself.

1656
01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:40,290
All right? You weren't inadvertently
flirting with this girl.

1657
01:47:40,650 --> 01:47:42,960
You actually probably,
uh,

1658
01:47:43,560 --> 01:47:47,850
like this girl before this guy even got
with her. Or maybe the fact that the guy,

1659
01:47:48,120 --> 01:47:50,190
your friend got with her
and he was banging her,

1660
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:54,420
made you all of a sudden interested in
her. See, I don't know you as a person,

1661
01:47:54,630 --> 01:47:59,460
you could be a very sadistic,
a human being. Actually,

1662
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:01,140
I'm going to go out on a
limb and say you're not,

1663
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:04,530
because the fact that you actually
give a fuck enough to write me and ask

1664
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:06,240
whether you should do this,

1665
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:10,260
that means you actually have
some sort of guilt about it. Um,

1666
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:16,140
so you won't get off on bang in
your fucking, uh, best friends,

1667
01:48:17,010 --> 01:48:20,760
ex-girlfriend a two. There's a lot of
shit here that could blow up in your face.

1668
01:48:22,050 --> 01:48:25,740
Okay? In a perfect world, all right,

1669
01:48:26,310 --> 01:48:30,240
you're a man and you say,
you know what a,

1670
01:48:30,241 --> 01:48:32,880
that's not going to be worth
the, the, the blow back.

1671
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:36,420
It's not going to be worth the
fucking damage that I'm going to do.

1672
01:48:37,020 --> 01:48:40,830
This guy's my best friend.
I don't even though he would do it to me,

1673
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:42,930
I'm not going to do it to him.

1674
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,470
And then I also need to stop being
friends with this guy because anybody who

1675
01:48:46,471 --> 01:48:50,340
would go out and fuck my ex girlfriend
within a year is not truly a friend.

1676
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:53,940
I need to get better friends.
But despite all that,

1677
01:48:53,941 --> 01:48:57,120
I'm still not going to do what the
fuck he would have done just because he

1678
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:58,143
would've done it to me.

1679
01:48:58,470 --> 01:49:02,300
And you just walk away from the situation
and you go out and you chat up some

1680
01:49:02,490 --> 01:49:07,170
other fucking broads. That's, that is
like, if you want to be knighted someday,

1681
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:12,770
buy one of those fucking broads over
there and a in the castle in England,

1682
01:49:13,290 --> 01:49:17,520
you know, if you want to go over there
with Surf Surf Phil Collins looking on

1683
01:49:20,040 --> 01:49:22,590
and get knighted,
that's what the fuck you do.

1684
01:49:23,220 --> 01:49:26,800
But if you're going to bang this broad,
um,

1685
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:30,300
you've already fucked up.
Okay.

1686
01:49:30,660 --> 01:49:33,900
Fucking your best friend's ex girlfriend.

1687
01:49:34,110 --> 01:49:39,110
It's like committing a murder you
want is few people involved is humanly

1688
01:49:39,721 --> 01:49:40,554
possible.

1689
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:46,040
I learned that on an episode of uninformed
when we had a cop come in and me and

1690
01:49:46,291 --> 01:49:50,620
my, uh, cohost Joe to
Rosa were saying that,

1691
01:49:51,340 --> 01:49:54,650
um, you know, we were trying to come up
with how to commit the perfect murder.

1692
01:49:54,651 --> 01:49:57,530
And I remember said, okay, I get me and
a buddy of mine, he goes right there,

1693
01:49:57,531 --> 01:50:01,260
you fucked up right there. You fucked up.
He goes, the more people you bring in,

1694
01:50:01,950 --> 01:50:04,200
the bigger chance you have
of getting caught. You know,

1695
01:50:04,780 --> 01:50:07,990
cause you're not going to rat yourself
out. But the other guy, if he gets scared,

1696
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:11,680
might go down to the police station
and try to cop a plea. All right?

1697
01:50:11,770 --> 01:50:15,340
That's the same shit with this. If you're
going to fuck your best friend's girl,

1698
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:20,090
ex-girlfriend, you don't go around
and ask other friends going, dude,

1699
01:50:20,091 --> 01:50:21,220
should I do with

1700
01:50:22,490 --> 01:50:23,323
you?
Don't.

1701
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:28,140
And you already did. All right.
And then the other side of it is,

1702
01:50:30,180 --> 01:50:33,720
mmm, I don't know how the
two of these people broke up,

1703
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:38,070
but uh,
you know,

1704
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:40,460
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

1705
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:45,350
And for all, you know, this
chick might be a fucking psycho.

1706
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:49,050
All right? I mean, I
think it's a good thing

1707
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:51,820
that he's texting her and
not the other way around

1708
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:57,440
and that she is not texting him back.
Granted,

1709
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:02,260
you're taking her word for it,
that that's what the situation is now.

1710
01:51:02,261 --> 01:51:06,370
For all you know, it's the
reverse. And if it is the reverse,

1711
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:08,560
she wants some sort of vengeance,

1712
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,800
which means she goes out and bangs his
best friend and then low and behold feels

1713
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:19,780
guilty the next day and then
has to tell him, all right,

1714
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,040
just to let you know

1715
01:51:21,660 --> 01:51:23,310
that is on the fucking table.

1716
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:28,890
If you really want to know whether or
not you want a jerk, if you want a jerk,

1717
01:51:28,891 --> 01:51:31,440
if you want to fucking,
I got ahead of myself here.

1718
01:51:31,441 --> 01:51:36,441
If you want to fuck this girl and not
just go jerk off to her and after he had

1719
01:51:36,511 --> 01:51:38,550
done,
if you still want a Banger,

1720
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:43,440
you want a banger and then just fucking
man up and deal with the fucking

1721
01:51:43,441 --> 01:51:46,790
consequences of it and go out and
bang her because who gives a fuck?

1722
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:51,830
Because someday you're going to be
80 and who gives a shit, you know?

1723
01:51:52,780 --> 01:51:56,280
Or on the other side, if you actually have
feelings for this girl, that's a whole,

1724
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:57,460
then you should definitely do it.

1725
01:51:57,461 --> 01:52:00,010
If you actually feel like this girl could
be the girl that you're going to spend

1726
01:52:00,011 --> 01:52:02,800
your life with,
then I would definitely say go for it.

1727
01:52:02,950 --> 01:52:06,700
Knowing full well that your
friendship with this other guy is, uh,

1728
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:11,320
is going to end. MMM. I Dunno.

1729
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:15,920
So Dude, you know what, it's
fucking on you. You know,

1730
01:52:15,921 --> 01:52:19,550
if you asked me what I do at a yeah,
I would have back in the day I would have,

1731
01:52:19,700 --> 01:52:21,800
but now that I'm an older,
wiser man, I wouldn't,

1732
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:25,340
I would just fucking rub one out to
her and then be afterwards going, oh,

1733
01:52:25,341 --> 01:52:28,610
thank God I didn't fucking do that.
Thank God I didn't do that. And I was,

1734
01:52:28,611 --> 01:52:33,240
I would also fucking not hang out with
the other guy because any guy friend of

1735
01:52:33,241 --> 01:52:36,420
mine that would fuck an ex girlfriend
of mine within a fucking year, I,

1736
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:37,600
I wouldn't want to be friends with.

1737
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:38,530
Yeah.

1738
01:52:38,530 --> 01:52:40,420
Even though I just
described all of my friends

1739
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:45,200
do it.
I don't know what to tell you.

1740
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:48,960
I don't know what to tell you.
Um,

1741
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:54,170
you probably shouldn't do what you
should. You shouldn't, dude, you should.

1742
01:52:54,350 --> 01:52:57,740
And you should go out and go fucking bank
somebody else. You shouldn't. All right.

1743
01:52:57,860 --> 01:53:02,330
But I feel like a hypocrite because
I would, I would. But then again,

1744
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:06,250
I'm also a fucking 42 year old
guy. Never got married. So when,

1745
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:08,600
so you're listening to a
complete fucking scumbag here.

1746
01:53:08,630 --> 01:53:13,550
So Jesus Christ, this is why I
don't have a fucking advice show,

1747
01:53:14,930 --> 01:53:18,950
you know, because in my
attempt to be honest, I, I, I,

1748
01:53:19,190 --> 01:53:21,770
I tell you both things, do
it. Don't do it. I would,

1749
01:53:21,771 --> 01:53:24,020
but you shouldn't have a nice day.

1750
01:53:27,170 --> 01:53:29,000
Um, you know what? Let's,
let's go to the listeners.

1751
01:53:30,260 --> 01:53:31,850
I would love to hear from
the women because they,

1752
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,910
they're going to have on both sides. They
can have like, you shouldn't do that,

1753
01:53:34,911 --> 01:53:37,790
your friend. And then they're also
going to be mad on some level.

1754
01:53:37,791 --> 01:53:42,440
Like why did guys feel like they own
somebody just because they youth to go out

1755
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:45,590
with them?
Because we are territorial,

1756
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:47,630
were territorial that way.

1757
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:53,080
And you have to understand that whoever
you've banged in your life as a female,

1758
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:58,790
um, for the rest of your
life, that pussies not yours
anymore. It belongs to him.

1759
01:53:59,270 --> 01:54:03,410
And you can say it's yours.
It isn't because he fucked it.

1760
01:54:08,860 --> 01:54:11,270
All right? You know what?
I, I feel like, you know,

1761
01:54:11,271 --> 01:54:13,400
there wasn't enough
ignorance on this podcast,

1762
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:15,740
so I feel like I had to just
say something stupid like that.

1763
01:54:15,741 --> 01:54:19,160
But that's how guys work. And,
um, I didn't even ask you,

1764
01:54:19,161 --> 01:54:23,180
this is your best friend.
Is he bigger than you are physically?

1765
01:54:23,181 --> 01:54:26,420
Can he beat you down?
Does he take Jujitsu classes?

1766
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:32,930
Um, has he ever had any
murderous thoughts that he,

1767
01:54:33,320 --> 01:54:36,560
I'm sort of divulge to you at a,
you know,

1768
01:54:36,561 --> 01:54:41,430
a night of drinking too many
Tequila shots and you see an agony,

1769
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:46,130
darker side of him. You know, there's,
there's a whole bunch of Shit, ah,

1770
01:54:46,160 --> 01:54:48,470
this is what she got to do.
This is what you gotta do.

1771
01:54:48,471 --> 01:54:53,180
Go out and get yourself a
fucking pimp hat. All right?

1772
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:57,980
And this is what you have to do.
You've got to go to this girl and you,

1773
01:54:57,981 --> 01:55:02,360
you just got to lay it on the fucking
table. That's what you gotta do.

1774
01:55:03,320 --> 01:55:05,930
You just gotta be honest
with her and just say, look

1775
01:55:08,060 --> 01:55:08,690
sweetheart,

1776
01:55:08,690 --> 01:55:13,280
I have wanted to fuck you
since 2006 you don't say that,

1777
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,060
but basically you finesse
your way into that.

1778
01:55:17,180 --> 01:55:19,340
You've got to tell her that
you've wanted to hook up with her.

1779
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:24,440
And the only reason why you
didn't, this is the deal. This is

1780
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:31,370
all right. Well, we had a little technical
difficulty there. I left you hanging.

1781
01:55:31,640 --> 01:55:33,500
Sorry about that.
The batteries just died.

1782
01:55:33,501 --> 01:55:37,760
I was right in the middle of trying to
tell this dude how we could go out and

1783
01:55:37,761 --> 01:55:38,630
bang this girl.

1784
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:43,690
Now I gotta fucking stick this into the
goddamn girl garageband and splice it

1785
01:55:43,741 --> 01:55:45,930
together,
which I already did that this point.

1786
01:55:45,931 --> 01:55:50,640
So why even bitch about it when you
listen to this fucking thing? All right,

1787
01:55:51,510 --> 01:55:54,930
let me wrap this Goddamn podcast up by
telling this kid how to go out and fuck

1788
01:55:54,931 --> 01:55:57,650
his best friend's ex girlfriend. All
right? This is what you do. You gotta,

1789
01:55:57,660 --> 01:56:01,170
you gotta have a talk with
this girl before you do it.

1790
01:56:01,470 --> 01:56:06,000
Don't just go over there and
just fucking sneak over there.

1791
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:10,170
You know,
with this nervous excitement fucking rail,

1792
01:56:10,171 --> 01:56:14,160
this girl bust your nut and then realize,
oh my God,

1793
01:56:14,161 --> 01:56:17,910
I have no fucking feelings for this girl.
And then you know,

1794
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:21,780
risking that she'll then,
you know, be resentful.

1795
01:56:21,781 --> 01:56:25,860
All the bullshit I said on
the first fucking installment
of this Goddamn podcast,

1796
01:56:26,490 --> 01:56:29,670
this is what you gotta do. You gotta
fucking get everything out in the open.

1797
01:56:30,640 --> 01:56:31,473
All right?

1798
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:37,430
In fucking let her convince you that it's
the right fucking thing to do and get

1799
01:56:37,981 --> 01:56:41,370
her to say that she ain't gonna say shit.
All right.

1800
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:45,390
Get her to say that. And when she
says she's not going to say Shit,

1801
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:48,000
you have to read her.
All right?

1802
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:54,510
Like a fucking seasoned goddamn pro.
You know,

1803
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:58,800
the 27 fucking, uh, pantomimes align,

1804
01:56:58,801 --> 01:57:02,880
whatever that fucking goddamn
movie was true romance.

1805
01:57:03,220 --> 01:57:06,750
You gotta look at her and Jay, you have
to, you have to make a fucking assessment.

1806
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:08,940
If this girl can keep
your fucking mouth shut

1807
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:12,900
by presenting these
scenarios, you up. Look,

1808
01:57:12,901 --> 01:57:14,130
I'm going to get worried that tomorrow.

1809
01:57:14,131 --> 01:57:17,460
What if you're going to wake up feeling
guilty and then you have to confess to

1810
01:57:17,461 --> 01:57:22,260
him, you know, I'm not going to
feel, I'm not gonna feel guilty.

1811
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:25,110
Yeah, you are. You're just
fucking, I don't know.

1812
01:57:26,190 --> 01:57:27,830
I'm really giving you shit advice.
Do what?

1813
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:31,380
I'm trying to give you a fucking scumbag
way to go out and go do this shit.

1814
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:35,880
Just like,
I dunno.

1815
01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:37,140
I'm fucking bad at this,
man.

1816
01:57:37,141 --> 01:57:40,860
I have to be in the moment that what the
fuck dirtbag goddamn thing would I be

1817
01:57:40,861 --> 01:57:45,600
saying? All right, this is what you
do. You don't go over a fucking places.

1818
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:50,190
What you do don't go over a goddamn
place. See, this is the hard thing.

1819
01:57:50,191 --> 01:57:53,130
Now you've got to go out. You've
got to meet her in public. Okay?

1820
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:57,930
So there's no sexual fucking tension
that you can act on. All right?

1821
01:57:57,931 --> 01:58:01,560
So your Dick won't be like, dude, she's
fine. She's not lying. She's not lying.

1822
01:58:01,561 --> 01:58:05,890
She's going to be cool.
What you have to do is, um,

1823
01:58:08,850 --> 01:58:11,220
you're going to meet in a public
place where then people can see a CTO.

1824
01:58:11,221 --> 01:58:14,670
This is just a, it's just a fact. It's a,
it's a tough one. Tell you why to do it.

1825
01:58:14,671 --> 01:58:16,470
If you can actually fucking pull this off,

1826
01:58:16,770 --> 01:58:19,260
why don't you write me back and
tell you, tell, tell me how you,

1827
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:23,130
how the fuck he did it.
I remember a long time ago,

1828
01:58:25,230 --> 01:58:28,170
I was in the beginning of a relationship
and I was banging is still banging this

1829
01:58:28,171 --> 01:58:32,190
other psycho on the side
and uh,

1830
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:34,500
like a dirt bag,
you know?

1831
01:58:35,700 --> 01:58:38,910
And I remember there was gonna be a point
where the two of them were going to be

1832
01:58:38,911 --> 01:58:40,590
at the same fucking place.

1833
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:47,170
So I just dealt with it. But I,
that was it before we hooked up,

1834
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:49,100
I just said, look, you've
got to be honest with you.

1835
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:52,660
This girl I'm coming down with, we're
new. I'm starting to have feelings for

1836
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:54,183
all right.

1837
01:58:54,590 --> 01:58:58,280
I told her that I cleaned up everything
on the side, which I haven't with you,

1838
01:58:58,281 --> 01:59:00,680
so I need you to not act weird

1839
01:59:00,850 --> 01:59:02,710
when I fucking come down
there. If I don't, you know,

1840
01:59:02,711 --> 01:59:06,530
if I'm not saying hello to you. Okay.
That was before I hooked up with her.

1841
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:07,470
She's like, fine, fine.

1842
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:10,860
And then when she went down there
and then she did that. Cool.

1843
01:59:10,980 --> 01:59:14,430
Because in her head she's probably
holding out like maybe if I had cool,

1844
01:59:14,490 --> 01:59:18,090
he'll see how fucking cool I am and then
I want to be with me and not this other

1845
01:59:18,091 --> 01:59:20,940
bitch.
And meanwhile I fucking got away with it.

1846
01:59:21,290 --> 01:59:23,330
And you know what a part of me died?

1847
01:59:24,010 --> 01:59:26,980
Another fucking chunk of my soul came
out and said, dirty fucking game.

1848
01:59:27,590 --> 01:59:31,580
It's a dirty goddamn game. I'm a piece
of shit. Don't fucking listen to me.

1849
01:59:32,430 --> 01:59:36,380
All right, what else do we got
this week? But by the way, dude,

1850
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,200
now that I've talked about a
for 10 fucking minutes, you got,

1851
01:59:39,201 --> 01:59:41,210
you got to write a Spec and
let us know what happened.

1852
01:59:42,390 --> 01:59:43,223
All right?

1853
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:47,940
You know, I realize this might be like
one of those stupid Hollywood movies.

1854
01:59:48,090 --> 01:59:52,200
And then I realized that's not the
person I wanted to be it. If you do that,

1855
01:59:52,201 --> 01:59:55,590
I don't want to fucking hear it. But if
you don't, if you do the dirty bullshit,

1856
01:59:55,830 --> 01:59:56,750
I want to hear about it.

1857
01:59:59,280 --> 02:00:03,930
Okay. Would I be the worst fucking life
coach ever? Um, all right, here's a,

1858
02:00:03,931 --> 02:00:05,560
here's a segment,
corporate costs.

1859
02:00:06,020 --> 02:00:08,270
Hey Bill,
for someone who flies as much as you do,

1860
02:00:08,271 --> 02:00:13,271
can you take a shot at explaining the
logic behind why a one way ticket almost

1861
02:00:13,551 --> 02:00:16,160
costs more than a round trip.

1862
02:00:18,460 --> 02:00:19,540
Um,
for a domestic fuck

1863
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:24,260
for domestic flights, maybe
this isn't a problem. However,
I'm flying from your, uh,

1864
02:00:24,270 --> 02:00:29,270
from Europe at the end of the month on
a one way ticket and it costs one and a

1865
02:00:29,441 --> 02:00:33,520
half times more than a round trip chip
ticket. And I immediately said, well,

1866
02:00:33,521 --> 02:00:34,960
why don't you buy the round trip ticket?

1867
02:00:35,140 --> 02:00:37,410
And he addresses this
immediately and says,

1868
02:00:37,411 --> 02:00:41,550
and if the airline company can prove
that I purchased a roundtrip ticket,

1869
02:00:42,030 --> 02:00:44,880
it with the intent of not using
the return for the flight,

1870
02:00:44,881 --> 02:00:49,110
they can legally charge for the
price difference between the fares.

1871
02:00:49,830 --> 02:00:53,670
What the fuck is this normal business
practice? I hate to tell you it,

1872
02:00:53,790 --> 02:00:58,370
but it is because that's how
corrupt are fucking government is.

1873
02:00:58,400 --> 02:01:01,940
That's how powerful corporations
are around the fucking world. They,

1874
02:01:02,150 --> 02:01:04,340
they do whatever they,
whatever they want to do.

1875
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:09,360
And they have this thing where every
quarter they have to show a profit,

1876
02:01:10,220 --> 02:01:11,870
all right? Oh, actually they have to, to,

1877
02:01:11,920 --> 02:01:14,240
to show more of a profit
than the previous quarter.

1878
02:01:14,270 --> 02:01:17,720
They can't even just have the same
amount of profit. It's not enough.

1879
02:01:17,960 --> 02:01:22,960
And basically they've legally run out
of ways to create revenue streams.

1880
02:01:23,441 --> 02:01:26,080
So what they're doing now
is they're just stealing.

1881
02:01:27,330 --> 02:01:31,530
They're stealing from people. All
right? If you have a one way ticket,

1882
02:01:31,710 --> 02:01:35,610
that means you're going home or you're
starting a new life and you want to get

1883
02:01:35,611 --> 02:01:37,140
the fuck out of where you're at.

1884
02:01:37,530 --> 02:01:40,100
So that's why they know that they can
charge you a ton of fucking money.

1885
02:01:42,050 --> 02:01:44,840
All right? And then we'll watch some buys,
a round trip ticket, then we'll fucking,

1886
02:01:44,841 --> 02:01:48,740
we'll just write this little bill here
and we'll have the senator who we fucking

1887
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:53,900
paid for his goddamn campaign helped
push it through. Isn't that how it works?

1888
02:01:53,901 --> 02:01:57,350
They just call the senator. I
don't know anything. Um, yeah, no,

1889
02:01:57,351 --> 02:01:58,310
it's a piece of shit thing.

1890
02:01:58,311 --> 02:02:02,690
So what you gotta do is you have to
vandalize the airplane. All right?

1891
02:02:03,110 --> 02:02:06,320
Do something to vandalize the fucking
airplane. Now that you don't even do that,

1892
02:02:06,470 --> 02:02:09,350
cause all they're going to do is
just pass that expense onto us.

1893
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:13,880
This is what you have to do.
Um,

1894
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:19,660
you have to find out who it
is that came up with that.

1895
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:22,630
Who created that? Who was, uh,

1896
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:27,470
who was the lobbyist who push that thing
through how that somehow became legal.

1897
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:30,760
You've got to find out where they
live and then you just gotta.

1898
02:02:30,820 --> 02:02:34,310
You gotta tailor them the whole
fucking week. Get their patterns down,

1899
02:02:34,640 --> 02:02:38,000
figure out when they go to
the Goddamn Jim. All Right,

1900
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:42,920
borrow a pair of pantyhose
from your fucking girlfriend.

1901
02:02:43,220 --> 02:02:45,740
Put it over your head,
height and some shrubs.

1902
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:50,120
And when that dude comes walking out of
the gym with that fucking towel around

1903
02:02:50,121 --> 02:02:50,690
his neck,

1904
02:02:50,690 --> 02:02:54,200
you just blast them right in the face
and then you fucking choke them with it.

1905
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:56,660
Your choke him.
You Mush his face into the mulch

1906
02:02:59,420 --> 02:03:00,240
and you'd be like desperate,

1907
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:03,500
a one way ticket from fucking hall
and back to the state yet can't,

1908
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:06,380
and then you get in your fucking
Ford Festiva and you drive away.

1909
02:03:07,070 --> 02:03:10,520
That's the only way to get back at
him. And, uh, and if you do that,

1910
02:03:10,521 --> 02:03:15,260
I'll give you a free DVD, a
underrated overrated for the week, uh,

1911
02:03:15,740 --> 02:03:20,150
underrated, the movie waiting. Uh, it's
all about the world of restaurant waiters,

1912
02:03:20,151 --> 02:03:23,990
cooks, it, et cetera. It's
funny, honest and quite gross.

1913
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:27,630
I imagine it is because I've worked in
a couple of fucking restaurants in the

1914
02:03:27,631 --> 02:03:28,970
shit that goes on.
You know,

1915
02:03:30,080 --> 02:03:33,670
the shit that you'll do when you're not
cooking for a family member is really a,

1916
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:38,320
it's staggering. I'll leave
it at that. Um, overrated. Um,

1917
02:03:38,440 --> 02:03:40,040
this is pretty bitter.
But anyways,

1918
02:03:40,041 --> 02:03:44,000
when you watch the special features on
a DVD and there's always the making of

1919
02:03:44,001 --> 02:03:47,990
feature, far too many of these
features, including the movie waiting,

1920
02:03:47,991 --> 02:03:52,310
then I just recommended have the actors
and the directors jokingly calling

1921
02:03:52,610 --> 02:03:57,170
others on the film, useless,
awful, amateur, amateurish,

1922
02:03:58,240 --> 02:04:02,840
etc. Uh, they'll talk about how the
whole film is a disaster and we'll, uh,

1923
02:04:02,900 --> 02:04:07,520
and we'll go straight to video.
Get it. They don't really mean it.

1924
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:13,100
They're joking around. Lol, lol. See,
I told you it was a better one. Yeah,

1925
02:04:13,101 --> 02:04:16,000
I guess, you know, I
of understand, I mean,

1926
02:04:16,001 --> 02:04:17,510
how many times can you
just sit there and go,

1927
02:04:18,410 --> 02:04:23,030
Aston Kutcher was absolutely brilliant
in Madame of the butterfly or the

1928
02:04:23,031 --> 02:04:26,870
butterfly effect, whatever the
fuck it was called. Um, that scene,

1929
02:04:26,900 --> 02:04:31,400
his reaction here is right up with
Bruce Willis in die hard part three.

1930
02:04:31,730 --> 02:04:35,330
When he turns around and looks at the
greenscreen and pretends to be looking at

1931
02:04:35,331 --> 02:04:38,220
a jumbo jet, it was absolutely
some of the best act. I mean,

1932
02:04:38,221 --> 02:04:42,840
how long could you listen to that so
they gotta make fun of themselves. Um,

1933
02:04:42,841 --> 02:04:44,220
I would go with arrogance.

1934
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:48,960
I would just talk about my scenes
and how fucking amazing I am. Um,

1935
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:51,870
while I was pointing out the
dumb shit that I did in it, uh,

1936
02:04:51,871 --> 02:04:55,590
youtube videos for the week and do
this, I'm going to tell you, man,

1937
02:04:55,620 --> 02:05:00,150
I think I'm recommending,
or at least the listeners of my podcast,

1938
02:05:00,330 --> 02:05:03,030
we're recommended some of the
funniest and best fucking, uh,

1939
02:05:03,870 --> 02:05:06,840
youtube videos out there. How great. Well
those youtube videos last week, you know,

1940
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:10,860
all right,
here's one duck face song search,

1941
02:05:10,890 --> 02:05:15,400
duck face song like quack,
quack, duck face song. Um,

1942
02:05:15,401 --> 02:05:17,430
this is an amazing one.
Search,

1943
02:05:17,460 --> 02:05:20,610
fake Yoyo trickster fool's,

1944
02:05:20,611 --> 02:05:25,380
every TV station everywhere. I mean,
granted it could have been shorter,

1945
02:05:25,381 --> 02:05:30,330
but fake Yoyo trickster fool's,
every TV station everywhere.

1946
02:05:30,331 --> 02:05:31,111
This is hilarious.

1947
02:05:31,111 --> 02:05:36,111
This guy goes on and he claims to be a
Yoyo champion and he actually sucks at it

1948
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:41,280
and he talks all this shit and then he
goes on there and he can't pull off any

1949
02:05:41,281 --> 02:05:46,281
tricks and he just stands there and
leaves the morning news guy with the

1950
02:05:46,561 --> 02:05:51,480
awkwardness of him completely failing
and not handling the failing and just

1951
02:05:51,481 --> 02:05:56,460
leaving it in the lap of the reporter and
it's, uh, it's fucking awesome. Um, AH,

1952
02:05:57,270 --> 02:06:00,840
here's one for all you kids and I'm going
to use the young kid where this one is

1953
02:06:00,841 --> 02:06:05,160
epic. Um, this one isn't on Youtube.

1954
02:06:05,670 --> 02:06:10,290
This is how cutting edge the
Monday morning podcast is. Uh,

1955
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:15,320
go to www.everythingisterrible.com.

1956
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,120
And then search for the video.

1957
02:06:18,121 --> 02:06:22,410
This is hip hop and uh,
it's awesome.

1958
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:26,580
It's a fucking white lady's soccer mom,

1959
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:30,210
you know, and she's going to
let you know what time it is.

1960
02:06:30,630 --> 02:06:35,220
I'm going to leave it at that. Everything
is terrible.com. I'm a couple more,

1961
02:06:36,270 --> 02:06:38,910
uh, for all you knick fans out
there who are licking your wounds,

1962
02:06:38,911 --> 02:06:43,911
go to go search a Lebron James
Decision interview parody.

1963
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:49,110
I think you'll enjoy that one immensely.
Uh,

1964
02:06:49,140 --> 02:06:52,590
for all you death metal fans who have
a sense of humor and because this one

1965
02:06:52,591 --> 02:06:54,600
really hinges on actually
knowing the song,

1966
02:06:55,140 --> 02:07:00,140
there's a band called Cannibal corpse and
the name of the song is hammer smashed

1967
02:07:00,331 --> 02:07:04,020
face.
And if you don't already know that song,

1968
02:07:04,021 --> 02:07:06,000
I suggest you listen to it first.

1969
02:07:07,830 --> 02:07:11,520
Listened to Cannibal corpse hammer
smashed face for as long as you can,

1970
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:17,040
unless you're death metal
fan. And then you'll love it,
um, or a fan of comedy. Um,

1971
02:07:17,041 --> 02:07:21,570
and then go to search
Cannibal Corpse Hammer,

1972
02:07:21,571 --> 02:07:26,160
smash his face smashed face,
Disney radio version,

1973
02:07:26,730 --> 02:07:30,780
some fucking genius out
there. Basically, you know,

1974
02:07:30,781 --> 02:07:32,670
I guess death metal is a lot of like,
I dunno,

1975
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:35,200
the darker cords and he turned them all,

1976
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:37,510
plays the same court but in a major court,

1977
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:42,720
which are they happier once and then
he sings the song with the same lyrics.

1978
02:07:43,241 --> 02:07:46,870
It's fucking great. Um, and
that is it. You know what,

1979
02:07:46,871 --> 02:07:50,900
I didn't bring up asides from
fro hyping, uh, the month, uh,

1980
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:54,430
the MM podcast.com,
um,

1981
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:58,330
is um, uh, and all of this Lebron Shit.

1982
02:07:58,331 --> 02:08:03,331
I didn't really bring up like the fans
of fucking Cleveland and yet another

1983
02:08:03,641 --> 02:08:06,640
fucking blow that those people
have to take. I mean that just,

1984
02:08:06,641 --> 02:08:11,641
it's brutal between the industry
leaving that town and then I'll,

1985
02:08:12,191 --> 02:08:16,260
you know,
cc Sabathia he went,

1986
02:08:16,261 --> 02:08:20,440
ended up going in New York.
Manny Ramirez went to Boston,

1987
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:23,830
Jim told went to Philly.
I mean,

1988
02:08:23,831 --> 02:08:28,831
they had the team and now they
finally get like fucking arguably,

1989
02:08:29,590 --> 02:08:32,800
I would say the next Kobe level player.
He's got a way to go.

1990
02:08:32,801 --> 02:08:37,570
But the next Coby level player player in
Lebron James gave him a reason to go to

1991
02:08:37,571 --> 02:08:42,040
the downtown area. It sucks. It
sucks because downtown Cleveland,

1992
02:08:42,041 --> 02:08:43,900
if you really look at the buildings,
if he can look,

1993
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:48,580
pass the scary homeless people
and really look at the buildings,

1994
02:08:49,630 --> 02:08:52,180
uh, it's beautiful. It's
just that, you know,

1995
02:08:52,660 --> 02:08:54,250
getting back to these corporate clients,

1996
02:08:54,550 --> 02:08:59,410
they just pulled up stakes and they left
because they were sick of paying people

1997
02:08:59,440 --> 02:09:03,880
a fair wage and they were sick of having
to pay for health insurance and they

1998
02:09:03,881 --> 02:09:08,881
wanted to have some eight year old go put
the fucking grill on a Goddamn fucking

1999
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:13,210
caprice classic. I don't fucking
know. Same thing with Detroit.

2000
02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:17,440
Those all those cities, Buffalo, all of
them, if you look at them, the buildings,

2001
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:18,423
they're very,
they're,

2002
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:22,660
they're beautiful cities and you can see
what they used to be and it's a fucking

2003
02:09:22,661 --> 02:09:26,770
shame. Um, I dunno, I dunno
how to bring them back,

2004
02:09:28,330 --> 02:09:32,920
you know, buy American, which is why
I'm going to get the fucking challenger.

2005
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:34,271
Okay.

2006
02:09:34,271 --> 02:09:37,690
And if I find out that it's actually
put together down and fucking Honduras,

2007
02:09:37,691 --> 02:09:40,940
I'm going to be fucking pissed.
All right.

2008
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:49,360
Al Challenger is dodge not put together
in fucking whatever the fucking thing is.

2009
02:09:49,390 --> 02:09:53,770
I'm going to learn Spanish. God dammit,
and I'm going to have two podcasts.

2010
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:59,350
I'll have one in fucking a on glaze
in one in fucking spend. Y'All,

2011
02:10:00,020 --> 02:10:00,853
would that be great?

2012
02:10:02,020 --> 02:10:04,840
Then I could find that I could actually
trash people in their native language

2013
02:10:04,841 --> 02:10:07,900
about how much soccer is fucking
boring. All right. That is a,
