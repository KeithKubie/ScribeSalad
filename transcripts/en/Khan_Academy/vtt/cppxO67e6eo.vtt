00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.810
My son has been successfully
subdued, so I think this is a

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.474
good time to learn about the
Price to Earnings ratio.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.800
And a lot of times you'll
hear people talk about

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.400
a stock's P/E Ratio.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.530
And it's all the same thing.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.560
It's just a faster
way of saying

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.300
Price to Earnings ratio.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.720
So let's think about the Price
to Earnings ratio of the

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.100
company in question, this widget
case study, I guess you

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.350
could call it, that we've
been dealing with.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.370
Let's say that the market
value-- we talked before that

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.170
the book value per share
of this company is $5.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.590
Because the book value of its
equity is $5 million.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.060
And there's 1 million shares.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.890
So 5 million divided
by 1 million is $5.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.860
But let's say that the market
price, let's say that this is

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.800
Widgets Inc. and let's say
that its ticker symbol is

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:12.500
WINC, for Widgets Inc. And its
price is, it's trading at--

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.140
let me make up a good
number-- let's say

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:22.640
it's trading at $3.50.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.970
And then we learned in the first
video that a price by

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.170
itself doesn't tell
us a whole lot.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.700
So how may shares are there?

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.305
We know there's a
million shares.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.602
So the market cap, or what the
market perceives the value of

00:01:38.602 --> 00:01:41.380
this equity is, the market
capitalization,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.100
is these two numbers.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.130
If we have a million shares,
then each of them, the market

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.450
is saying, is worth $3.50, then
the equity of the company

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.230
is worth $3.5 million.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.550
And this is the market value of
the equity, what the market

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.610
thinks the equity's worth.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.699
So this is interesting.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.500
In our case, the book value of
the equity was $5 million.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.230
But the market is saying, no,
no, I don't necessarily

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.680
believe those accountants.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.810
Maybe they're throwing some
stuff in here that's not

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.720
really there.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.350
So we say it's only worth
$3.5 million.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.010
In this case, the company's
trading at a discount to its

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.970
book value.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.060
And I won't go into detail on
that now, but that's actually

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.970
a fairly unusual circumstance,
unless people are very

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.040
suspicious about the accounting
or the actual book

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.960
value of the company.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:49.970
Or if they think that this is
just a kind of an asset with a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.040
useful life that has
been shortened.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.060
If you owned a bunch of video
stores, then all of a sudden

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.390
you say, I have $10 million of
video stores, and then the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.950
next day someone makes on-demand
videos there, all of

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.040
a sudden, maybe your assets
aren't worth what you thought

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.730
they were before.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.430
But we'll talk a lot more about
that when we deal with

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.280
real examples.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.580
But in this case our market cap
is below our book value.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.240
And you can even look at
it from the price.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.610
I said the price doesn't
tell you much.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.440
But it tells you a decent
bit if you think

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.530
of things in per-share.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.260
Because we know that the book
value per share is $5.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.990
The price per share, the market
price per share, is

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.370
$3.50, so you could also
say it's trading at

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.160
a discount to book.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.050
Now, what were the earnings
of the company?

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.800
Well it was making $0.35.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.670
So let me write this down.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.550
Earnings was $350,000 in 2008.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.900
And let's just say we're looking
this from the vantage

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.560
point that 2008 has happened.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.650
This isn't like I'm at the

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.590
beginning of 2008 and modeling.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.760
So let's say we're looking at
this on January 1, 2009.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.980
And let's say the company has
already released its earnings,

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.480
although it normally
takes a lot longer.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.120
Probably closer to
45 to 90 days.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.710
But let's say they released
their earnings.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:13.800
So we say, oh this company
made $350,000 in 2008.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.920
Or another thing that you might
see a lot when you look

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.839
at companies, is that this is
trailing 12 months earnings.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.400
You'll see this TTM sometimes.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.320
Because when someone says
earnings, are those the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.460
earnings last year?

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.660
Are those the earnings
that you're

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.260
predicting for next year?

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.060
So this is trailing 12
months earnings.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.150
And if you want to look at
earnings per share, EPS, is

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.650
this number divided by the
number of shares was $0.35.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.120
So first, just to learn what
the Price to Earnings ratio

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.570
is, let's just calculate it.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.000
Then we can talk about what it
actually means and if we have

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.260
time, we can have a discussion
on why a company might have a

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.610
higher or lower Price
to Earnings Ratio.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.320
And that discussion can actually
get quite involved.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.700
But in this case, you literally
just take the price

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.260
of the stock and you divide it
by the earnings per share.

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.360
So let me switch colors just
to ease the monotony.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.500
The Price to Earnings ratio
is equal to the price-- so

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.260
$3.50-- divided by the
earnings per share.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.200
Divided by $0.35.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.980
So in this case, the Price
to Earnings ratio is 10.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.440
What does that tell you?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.260
well there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.600
One is, you could kind
of flip this.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.250
No-one ever talks about the
Earnings to Price ratio, but

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.780
that's an interesting thing
to even think about.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.470
Because it connects it with
a lot of other financial

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.460
concepts that are out there.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.790
So this is kind of a Sal special
ratio, but it's a

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.660
useful one to think about.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.870
The Earnings to Price ratio is
just the inverse of this.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.820
0.35:3.50, which is
equal to 1/10.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.470
Or 10%.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.740
And so the way to think about
it is if you're paying $3.50

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.100
per share for this company, and
let's say the company next

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.290
year-- so this is trailing
12 months earnings.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.110
But let's say this company, for
whatever reason, it's a

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:16.255
really stable company.

00:06:16.255 --> 00:06:17.890
It's doing the same
thing every year.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.750
It's not growing.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.900
It's not shrinking.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.020
Let's say that not only is this
the trailing 12 months

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.130
earnings, but this is also--
actually, I'll introduce

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.460
terminology right here.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.810
So this is trailing 12 months.

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.930
You could also have
forward earnings.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:33.600
What are forward earnings?

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.910
You can probably guess.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:36.750
The earnings I just said, this
is actually what happened to

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.180
the company.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.160
This was the earnings of
the company last year,

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.580
or the last 12 months.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.240
Forward earnings are, you know,
there's a bunch of guys

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.560
with MBAs and CFAs working for
the banks, and they write

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.390
research reports.

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.750
And they model the company.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.980
They meet with the company.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.420
They analyze the industry.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:56.440
And if they're good analysts,
they'll come up with a number.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.250
They'll say, I think
this company is

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.080
not going to change.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.190
It's such a super
stable business.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:11.880
They're going to make $0.35
in 2009 as well.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.920
So in this case, this would
be the forward earnings.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.170
And usually if it's a
well-followed company, there

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.640
might be 10 or 15
or 20 analysts.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.230
And what they do is they average
out all of the numbers

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:23.580
from all of those analysts.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.490
And then if the average is,
let's say, $0.35, they'll call

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.320
this the consensus.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.280
So the consensus is just the
average of all of the sell

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.500
side analysts out there.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.530
And maybe I should do a whole
video on what sell side means,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.840
but since I said the word
I'll tell you right now.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.900
Sell side are like the
investment banks and the

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.660
research houses.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.470
And the reason why they're the
sell side is because they're

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.830
always selling you stuff.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.130
They're selling you stocks.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.530
They're brokering
transactions.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.210
They write these research
reports because they want to

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.320
go to institutional investors
or people who have their

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.880
brokerage accounts with these
banks, and essentially sell

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.460
them stock.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.900
Say hey, you should buy Widgets
Inc, because it's only

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.160
trading at a Price to
Earnings of 10.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.110
And we really like it.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.520
It's much better than buying
treasury bonds right now,

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.965
because you're making
more money on it.

00:08:08.965 --> 00:08:12.840
You're making 10%, and that's
just to connect the dots.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.830
Price to Earnings of 10.

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.760
If it's stable, you're making
the equity will grow in this

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.400
coming year by 10%.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.340
And that's better than what you
get out of treasury bonds.

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.260
So that's what sell
side means.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.740
So a sell side analyst
is someone who

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.890
publishes these reports.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.020
A buy side analyst is someone
who works for a hedge fund or

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.860
works for Fidelity
at a mutual fund.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.630
Or works for an endowment
or a pension someplace.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.690
And they're managing other
people's money.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.909
And they're trying to figure
out if they can

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:42.929
believe what's happening.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:44.330
So they're going to do
their own analysis.

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.140
So that's what the
buy side is.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.070
Those are the people who are
actually managing money and

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.360
deciding what they want to
invest the money in.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.020
The sell side are the people who
do analysis and say, hey

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:55.330
due to my analysis isn't
this a good stock?

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.230
Don't you want to buy
or sell this stock?

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.820
So fair enough.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.950
That was a bit of a diversion.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.360
Anyway, going back to Price to
Earnings, we calculated the

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.020
Price to Earnings.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:04.910
It was 10.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.140
But the reason I wanted do to
Earnings to Price is because

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:13.430
it connects it back to things
like yield and interest. I can

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.120
do a Price to Earnings
on my bank account.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:19.940
Let's say in my bank account
I have $100.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.455
So this is a diversion
right here.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.670
So let's say I have $100
in my bank account.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.360
And over a year I make 2%
interest. Let's say it's

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.570
guaranteed 2%.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.470
Maybe it's in the CD.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:38.950
So I have $102 at the
end of the year.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.960
This 2% were my earnings.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.675
So I made $2 of earnings.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.540
So the way to think about a bank
account is, well how much

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.790
do I pay for that
bank account?

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.560
Well in this case I paid $100
for the bank account.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:58.860
So the price would be $100.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.600
And the earnings on the
bank account in

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.930
that year were $200.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:07.720
So it has a Price to
Earnings of 50.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.970
Or if you do the Earnings
to Price, if you do

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:16.180
$2/$100, you get 2%.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.920
Which is normally how we think
about bank accounts.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.930
We say, oh I'm making 2%
interest on that bank account.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.530
Now, this actually leads to a
very interesting question.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.090
If a bank account only gives
me 2% on my money, and this

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.760
company is arguably giving me--
assuming that it's stable

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.980
and I believe the consensus--
it's giving me 10% on the

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.760
money, why would I even hold
this bank account?

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.750
Why wouldn't I just pour
all of my money?

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.160
Why am I willing to pay a higher
Price to Earnings for

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.310
the bank account than I
am for this company?

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.080
And I think you already get the
sense that the lower the

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.790
Price to Earnings, all else
equal-- and that's a big

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.230
thing-- all else equal, the
lower the Price to Earnings,

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.800
you're paying less
for something.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.810
You want to have a lower
Price to Earnings ratio

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.870
for the same asset.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.310
Because you're getting the same

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.430
earnings for a lower price.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.110
But when you lower the Price to
Earnings you are increasing

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:09.950
the Earnings to Price.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.210
So you would increase
your yield.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.260
You want to maximize
this number.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.900
But I'll finish this video with
kind of a basic question.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.150
Why would someone ever keep
their money in the bank at 2%

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:27.715
or a Price to Earnings of 50,
when they could have a Price

00:11:27.715 --> 00:11:30.010
to Earnings of 10 with
Widgets Inc.?

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.920
And the answer is because
this is very uncertain.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.660
Who knows what happens
with Widgets Inc.?

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.220
Maybe all of these guys
were-- Maybe this

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.330
is a big Ponzi scheme.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:40.770
I mean, most companies in
this country aren't.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.730
And that's another thing to talk
about, is country risk.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.440
Because even though you're
probably suspicious of them

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.720
now, the US has some of the
most transparent companies

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.130
with some of the best accounting
standards.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.710
If this was in-- you know,
I don't want to state any

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:54.490
countries because people all
over the world listen to these

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.850
videos-- but if it were a
country with less solid

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:58.940
accounting standards, you would
be like, they might be

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.830
making up all of their numbers
so I don't trust it.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:05.180
Or you might say, you know,
Widgets Inc., even though the

00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:10.660
analysts are saying that they're
going to make $0.35

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.940
this coming year, you might
say, you know, I

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:13.590
don't believe that.

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:17.660
I think there's actually a lot
of risk in Widgets Inc. That

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.400
there's actually more volatility
here than anyone

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.170
gives credit for.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.330
They might go out of business.

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.990
There's a strong competitor.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:24.740
There's a lot of
risk involved.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.950
And the other thing is,
even if you don't

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:26.510
think there's risk.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:32.290
Even if you think that this
company's going to make $0.35

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.740
forever, the other reason why
you might prefer to have a

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.530
bank account over Widgets Inc.
is because you're guaranteed

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:44.250
to get $102 back for your bank
account at the end of the year

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:44.830
if you wanted.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:50.950
Assuming this is a CD with
a one year duration.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.880
You're guaranteed to get your
$102 back, especially if it's

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.300
FDIC insured.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.980
But in this case, even though
the earnings might be the

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:01.610
same, something horrible might
happen to the markets and

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.930
everyone just dumps their
stocks, money flows just run

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.050
outside of markets.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.530
And for whatever reason people
get scared, and the price

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.760
could go down a lot
from $3.50.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.240
It could be very,
very volatile.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:18.740
And this thing, maybe the price
goes from $3.50 to $1.75

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:19.520
a year later.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.330
Which it seems like a really
good deal, because now the

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.310
Price to Earnings is $1.75
divided by $0.35, would now be

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.490
a 5 Price to Earnings.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.330
But this could happen.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.550
I mean, companies go from a 10
to a 5 Price to Earnings.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.860
And then all of a sudden, if
you want that money, if you

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.540
need that money a year later,
you've lost half of it.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.020
So there's some volatility in
the price even though you're

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.750
assuming that the earnings
are stable.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:46.070
So that's a little bit of a
taste of why someone might

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.620
realistically, in this case, pay
a higher Price to Earnings

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:49.740
for safety.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.180
Safety because you know that
this earnings stream is

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.020
guaranteed.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.270
And liquidity.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.940
Liquidity because you
know you're going to

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:57.860
get your money back.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.930
That you're going to be able to
essentially sell your bank

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.340
account and get cash for it.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.810
And you know that it's
going to be $100.

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.420
That there's no volatility
in price.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:07.930
Well in this case, you're
uncertain about

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:09.160
the earnings stream.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.320
You're uncertain about what the
market will be willing to

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.030
value it at a year later.

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:15.950
And frankly, you might
be uncertain about

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:16.870
liquidity in general.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:19.080
Maybe this is a really small
company and not a lot of

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.150
people trade in it.

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:22.510
And you might not even be able
to find anyone to buy it a

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.360
year later.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.290
The epitome of an illiquid
asset is maybe a really

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.490
expensive $20 million house.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:30.910
Even though it might be worth
$20 million, a year later you

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:33.240
might not-- there are only so
many people who can afford a

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.630
$20 million house.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.200
So it's an illiquid asset.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.530
Anyway, I want to
leave you there.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:40.330
In the next video we'll go into
more depth on Price to

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.320
Earnings ratio, and think about
things like growth and

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.650
stability and whatnot.
