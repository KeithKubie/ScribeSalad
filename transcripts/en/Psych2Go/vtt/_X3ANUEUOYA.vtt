00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.420
Networking: that elusive thing that adults do.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.920
That word that darn extroverts keep throwing around.

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.405
For us introverts, it's a cursed word

00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:21.055
that only brings destruction and terror.

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:24.055
To never be spoken or mentioned

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:26.955
in our introvert circle. Unfortunately,

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:29.755
our circle is not the only circle in the world.

00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:32.935
And in this world, you're going to need to network!

00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:35.885
But wait, what is networking?

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:38.875
Networking is the process of making personal connections

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:41.505
with people. It can be done to increase

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:44.425
your network of friends or your career network.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.980
The more people you know, the more resources you have.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.480
Unfortunately, networking requires talking to people.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:55.425
That's why it can be so scary for introverts.

00:00:55.425 --> 00:00:58.365
Now that you know what it is, how can introverts

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:01.045
get out of their circle and into the network?

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:04.345
You gotta get the conversation going,

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:07.145
but leave behind all that 'How's the weather?' stuff.

00:01:07.195 --> 00:01:10.385
Number one: Talk about what brought you together!

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.520
Maybe it's a party, talk to your new connection

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.860
about the why or how you got there.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.540
If you find out you have some mutual friends,

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:21.675
try some gossip. But maybe that doesn't work.

00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:24.335
That's okay! Just try something else.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.360
Number two: try and find a deep solid similarity.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.140
Not something like 'I like pizza and puppies';

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.380
everyone likes those. Unless they're allergic. Or an alien.

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:38.835
Or just someone not worth talking to.

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:40.515
Try to really identify something

00:01:40.515 --> 00:01:43.075
that opens up some common ground for a discussion.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.300
Race, nationality, generation, even political or religious topics

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.460
can work if the time is right.

00:01:49.465 --> 00:01:52.185
Keep things light, and always smile.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.560
And if you can, get really deep and personal.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.300
You're doing well, but you gotta think fast,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.540
because that evil, dreaded lull in conversation is coming up.

00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:06.275
What do you do? Number three:

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.780
ask some follow-up questions!

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.360
Any type of opinion they spit at you, ask to clarify!

00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:15.495
For example, 'You have a dog. Great.

00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:18.225
'What's its name? Is it a boy or a girl?

00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:21.040
'Oh, you believe dogs should be gender fluid?

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.260
'That's great! When did you start believing that

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.120
'gender shouldn't be imposed on dogs?' et cetera.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.960
Try to get more personal and more philosophical

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.875
as you go on to avoid any more lulls.

00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:34.375
But also remember that silence is natural.

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:36.575
Don't panic if there's a pause.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.440
It's a great thing to keep in mind with our next point.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.460
Number four: If you're talking, keep talking!

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.240
If you think you're talking too much, just ask!

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.360
If they say you are or you feel like you are,

00:02:49.445 --> 00:02:51.475
ask a question to change it up.

00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:54.205
Questions are a great way to get the pressure off you,

00:02:54.205 --> 00:02:57.375
maintain a conversation and avoid awkwardness.

00:02:57.495 --> 00:03:00.395
Just avoid one-word close-ended questions, like

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.100
'Do you want coffee or water?'

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.340
Finally, we decided we were going to put these tips to the test.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.295
So the author of this article tried out these tips

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.460
when they went out to dinner with four people

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.440
they were gonna go to college with the next year,

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.760
whom they had never met before.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.380
They mostly relied on tip number one and talked about college.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.060
Cover the basics when you first meet people.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.320
Avoid the clichÃ©d conversation starters

00:03:26.325 --> 00:03:29.085
and the discussion was pretty natural.

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:32.225
Asking 'What about you?' was a valid way to relieve the pressure

00:03:32.225 --> 00:03:34.960
if they ever felt like they were talking for too long.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.540
Remember: conversations aren't always easy or

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.895
stimulating, especially at the beginning.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.785
But once you hit it off, it's fun!

00:03:43.785 --> 00:03:44.780
Just relax.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.400
