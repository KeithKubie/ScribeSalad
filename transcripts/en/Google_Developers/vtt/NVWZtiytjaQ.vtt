Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.290
I'm Steven Bazyl from the Google
Drive Developer relations team.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.000
Today I want to talk to you
about a new feature, which

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.570
is the integration of Gmail
and Drive with attachments.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.579
To show off this
feature, I just want

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:21.370
to take a look at this
email I sent myself.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.510
It's just a few photos that
I took on my recent vacation

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.800
to Alaska.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.820
And if I click on one of
these files, what we see here

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.429
is this great
preview experience.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.220
It's the same preview
experience that we've

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.330
had in Google Drive itself
for quite some time.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.840
Of course, you can scroll
through these files.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.530
And this one here I want to
do a little bit more with.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.130
If you go down to
the bottom here,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.790
you see this Open With menu.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.480
Here I have a few applications
that I've already installed.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.340
I like Pixlr.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.200
I use that application a lot.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.550
I also have CafePress.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.680
But if I want to try
out something else,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.110
I can, of course, click
Connect More Apps.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.280
And here we see
applications, like PicMonkey,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.270
which is another great
photo editing app.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.590
I can install that and
edit with that as well.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.060
But for now, I wanted
to stick with Pixlr.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.330
So here I'm going to go
back, open with Pixlr,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.840
and in just a few seconds here
we'll see the photo open up.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.594
The cool thing is
with Pixlr they

00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:21.260
didn't have to change
anything for this.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.676
This is the same
Drive application

00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:25.475
that they've had since we've
had this feature in Drive.

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:27.600
It just now works with Gmail.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.320
So if you've built
a Drive application,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.820
this is a great new
feature for you.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.032
It means a lot more users are
exposed to your application.

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:36.240
And if you haven't gotten
around to building one yet,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.740
you have a lot more
reasons to do so.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.500
I hope you enjoy
this feature, and I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.820
hope it brings a lot more
success to your applications.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.370
Thanks.
