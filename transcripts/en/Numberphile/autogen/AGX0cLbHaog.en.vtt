00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.309
 
I thought I would mention one other

00:00:03.309 --> 00:00:03.319
I thought I would mention one other
 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:06.650
I thought I would mention one other
problem that arises that you can ask

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660
problem that arises that you can ask
 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.379
problem that arises that you can ask
about polygons you could ask is there

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389
about polygons you could ask is there
 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.780
about polygons you could ask is there
what's called a periodic orbit when I

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
what's called a periodic orbit when I
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.060
what's called a periodic orbit when I
say orbit that might be started off at a

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070
say orbit that might be started off at a
 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.660
say orbit that might be started off at a
point you bounce off the walls and after

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670
point you bounce off the walls and after
 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.620
point you bounce off the walls and after
some long number of times can you always

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
some long number of times can you always
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.130
some long number of times can you always
find a path that repeats itself so let

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
find a path that repeats itself so let
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.160
find a path that repeats itself so let
me give one very very classical example

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
me give one very very classical example
 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.859
me give one very very classical example
of that and that goes back to the square

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
of that and that goes back to the square
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.110
of that and that goes back to the square
if you start let's say on the bottom and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
if you start let's say on the bottom and
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.080
if you start let's say on the bottom and
move off at a right angle 90 degrees you

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
move off at a right angle 90 degrees you
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.940
move off at a right angle 90 degrees you
move to the top now when you get to the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950
move to the top now when you get to the
 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.250
move to the top now when you get to the
top because these are parallel this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260
top because these are parallel this
 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.250
top because these are parallel this
angle is also 90 degrees and so the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260
angle is also 90 degrees and so the
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.830
angle is also 90 degrees and so the
billiard path says you rebound where

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
billiard path says you rebound where
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.750
billiard path says you rebound where
angle of reflection equals angle of

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
angle of reflection equals angle of
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.639
angle of reflection equals angle of
incidence and that means that when you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649
incidence and that means that when you
 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.680
incidence and that means that when you
come to the side you will bounce off

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
come to the side you will bounce off
 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.779
come to the side you will bounce off
exactly the way that you came in you

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
exactly the way that you came in you
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.760
exactly the way that you came in you
will you will come to the side and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
will you will come to the side and
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.619
will you will come to the side and
bounce right back you'll come back along

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
bounce right back you'll come back along
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.720
bounce right back you'll come back along
this line and then you will bounce and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
this line and then you will bounce and
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.970
this line and then you will bounce and
repeat yourself so that's what's called

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980
repeat yourself so that's what's called
 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.490
repeat yourself so that's what's called
periodic there are other periodic lines

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
periodic there are other periodic lines
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.620
periodic there are other periodic lines
so for example you could start at a 45

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
so for example you could start at a 45
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.640
so for example you could start at a 45
degree angle

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
degree angle
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.770
degree angle
everything would be 45 degrees and you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
everything would be 45 degrees and you
 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.359
everything would be 45 degrees and you
would come back right where you started

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
would come back right where you started
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.609
would come back right where you started
and then repeat yourself in fact if you

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
and then repeat yourself in fact if you
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.700
and then repeat yourself in fact if you
start at any point at any angle that is

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
start at any point at any angle that is
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.310
start at any point at any angle that is
a rational number of a quotient of two

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
a rational number of a quotient of two
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.149
a rational number of a quotient of two
integers if you started with an angle of

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
integers if you started with an angle of
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.179
integers if you started with an angle of
27 degrees starting here you will come

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
27 degrees starting here you will come
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.219
27 degrees starting here you will come
back after a certain number of bounces

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
back after a certain number of bounces
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.999
back after a certain number of bounces
that's true for a square and in fact one

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
that's true for a square and in fact one
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.660
that's true for a square and in fact one
can prove for any rational polygon where

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
can prove for any rational polygon where
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.080
can prove for any rational polygon where
all the angles are fractions of 180

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
all the angles are fractions of 180
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.920
all the angles are fractions of 180
degrees or P over Q times 180 degrees

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930
degrees or P over Q times 180 degrees
 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.830
degrees or P over Q times 180 degrees
again I like to write it like that you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
again I like to write it like that you
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.420
again I like to write it like that you
can always find a periodic orbit no not

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
can always find a periodic orbit no not
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.520
can always find a periodic orbit no not
from any point there's some periodic

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
from any point there's some periodic
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.910
from any point there's some periodic
orbit from somewhere some periodic orbit

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
orbit from somewhere some periodic orbit
 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.219
orbit from somewhere some periodic orbit
from somewhere there might be so there

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
from somewhere there might be so there
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.139
from somewhere there might be so there
will be some direct some point in some

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149
will be some direct some point in some
 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999
will be some direct some point in some
direction where there will be a periodic

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
direction where there will be a periodic
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.980
direction where there will be a periodic
orbit example on this saw if there are

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
orbit example on this saw if there are
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.569
orbit example on this saw if there are
none but there is one sitting over here

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
none but there is one sitting over here
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.749
none but there is one sitting over here
well yeah usually what happens if it in

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
well yeah usually what happens if it in
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.729
well yeah usually what happens if it in
most cases that's that's possible in

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
most cases that's that's possible in
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.860
most cases that's that's possible in
fact you can always find periodical

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870
fact you can always find periodical
 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.470
fact you can always find periodical
that will hit every side in most cases a

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480
that will hit every side in most cases a
 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.540
that will hit every side in most cases a
periodic orbit will hit aside there

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550
periodic orbit will hit aside there
 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.910
periodic orbit will hit aside there
might be other points on that side where

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920
might be other points on that side where
 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.760
might be other points on that side where
the orbit in that same direction is not

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770
the orbit in that same direction is not
 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.910
the orbit in that same direction is not
periodic so in other words you start at

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920
periodic so in other words you start at
 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.380
periodic so in other words you start at
a point on a side and move in a

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390
a point on a side and move in a
 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.140
a point on a side and move in a
direction it might close up meaning

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
direction it might close up meaning
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.059
direction it might close up meaning
periodic but if you move the point a

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069
periodic but if you move the point a
 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.949
periodic but if you move the point a
little bit and set it off in the same

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959
little bit and set it off in the same
 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.290
little bit and set it off in the same
direction what could happen is that it

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300
direction what could happen is that it
 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.360
direction what could happen is that it
isn't periodic look what might happen is

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370
isn't periodic look what might happen is
 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.130
isn't periodic look what might happen is
it hits a corner and then you don't know

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140
it hits a corner and then you don't know
 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.690
it hits a corner and then you don't know
what to do that's different from the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700
what to do that's different from the
 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.910
what to do that's different from the
square in the square no matter where I

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920
square in the square no matter where I
 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.729
square in the square no matter where I
started if I went in 45 degrees it would

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739
started if I went in 45 degrees it would
 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.809
started if I went in 45 degrees it would
be periodic but in a general rational

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819
be periodic but in a general rational
 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.360
be periodic but in a general rational
polygon that may not be the case I want

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370
polygon that may not be the case I want
 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.970
polygon that may not be the case I want
to talk about triangles now that are not

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980
to talk about triangles now that are not
 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.090
to talk about triangles now that are not
necessarily rational but just triangles

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100
necessarily rational but just triangles
 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.270
necessarily rational but just triangles
if they're acute which means all of the

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280
if they're acute which means all of the
 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.449
if they're acute which means all of the
angles are 90 degrees or less what you

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459
angles are 90 degrees or less what you
 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.000
angles are 90 degrees or less what you
could do is you could take the vertex of

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
could do is you could take the vertex of
 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.470
could do is you could take the vertex of
the triangle and drop a perpendicular

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480
the triangle and drop a perpendicular
 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.170
the triangle and drop a perpendicular
down to the opposite side to get a point

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180
down to the opposite side to get a point
 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.080
down to the opposite side to get a point
and then drop this perpendicular down to

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090
and then drop this perpendicular down to
 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.670
and then drop this perpendicular down to
the opposite side and get a point so

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680
the opposite side and get a point so
 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.830
the opposite side and get a point so
these are right angles this triangle

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840
these are right angles this triangle
 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.190
these are right angles this triangle
joining those points gives a periodic

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200
joining those points gives a periodic
 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.430
joining those points gives a periodic
orbit meaning if I start here I go to a

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440
orbit meaning if I start here I go to a
 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.789
orbit meaning if I start here I go to a
line towards here this angle will equal

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799
line towards here this angle will equal
 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.740
line towards here this angle will equal
that angle and I'll bounce like that and

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750
that angle and I'll bounce like that and
 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.560
that angle and I'll bounce like that and
then I'll get to this point and this

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570
then I'll get to this point and this
 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.569
then I'll get to this point and this
angle will equal this angle and I'll

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579
angle will equal this angle and I'll
 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.720
angle will equal this angle and I'll
bounce like that and I come back this

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730
bounce like that and I come back this
 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.640
bounce like that and I come back this
angle equal this angle and I'll repeat

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650
angle equal this angle and I'll repeat
 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.039
angle equal this angle and I'll repeat
myself this example was has been known

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049
myself this example was has been known
 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.140
myself this example was has been known
for hundreds of years I don't think it

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150
for hundreds of years I don't think it
 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.569
for hundreds of years I don't think it
was ever thought of as billiards but

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579
was ever thought of as billiards but
 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.520
was ever thought of as billiards but

high could do this in trigonometry when

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959
high could do this in trigonometry when
 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.590
high could do this in trigonometry when
you do obtuse triangles you can't drop a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600
you do obtuse triangles you can't drop a
 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.479
you do obtuse triangles you can't drop a
perpendicular because if I started at

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489
perpendicular because if I started at
 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.099
perpendicular because if I started at
this vertex and dropped a perpendicular

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109
this vertex and dropped a perpendicular
 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.590
this vertex and dropped a perpendicular
it wouldn't be on that side that's

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600
it wouldn't be on that side that's
 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.750
it wouldn't be on that side that's
because this angle is bigger than 90

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760
because this angle is bigger than 90
 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.120
because this angle is bigger than 90
degrees and in fact for something as

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130
degrees and in fact for something as
 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.880
degrees and in fact for something as
very simple as a triangle obtuse

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890
very simple as a triangle obtuse
 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.220
very simple as a triangle obtuse
triangle one does not know whether there

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230
triangle one does not know whether there
 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.620
triangle one does not know whether there
are periodic orbits so this is a famous

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630
are periodic orbits so this is a famous
 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.229
are periodic orbits so this is a famous
unsolved problem in a subject of what

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239
unsolved problem in a subject of what
 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.300
unsolved problem in a subject of what
this is called as dynamical systems well

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310
this is called as dynamical systems well
 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.279
this is called as dynamical systems well
so again if the obtuse triangle

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289
so again if the obtuse triangle
 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.420
so again if the obtuse triangle
is rational then there are periodic

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430
is rational then there are periodic
 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.220
is rational then there are periodic
orbits so I'm talking about obtuse try

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230
orbits so I'm talking about obtuse try
 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.190
orbits so I'm talking about obtuse try

it had a periodic orbit there are some

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300
it had a periodic orbit there are some

if shown if this angle is less than a

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940
if shown if this angle is less than a
 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.420
if shown if this angle is less than a
hundred degrees then there are periodic

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430
hundred degrees then there are periodic
 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.060
hundred degrees then there are periodic
orbits but that was very very hard work

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070
