so a few lessons one is that HIV remains

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010
so a few lessons one is that HIV remains
 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.970
so a few lessons one is that HIV remains
and will remain a very important and

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980
and will remain a very important and
 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.070
and will remain a very important and
very difficult public health problem

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080
very difficult public health problem
 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.700
very difficult public health problem
locally and globally there will be no

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710
locally and globally there will be no
 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.930
locally and globally there will be no
simple solution even a vaccine or cure

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940
simple solution even a vaccine or cure
 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.240
simple solution even a vaccine or cure
would not result in a simple solution I

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250
would not result in a simple solution I
 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.300
would not result in a simple solution I
think about it if you could say well we

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310
think about it if you could say well we
 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.130
think about it if you could say well we
now have a cure we only have to reach

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140
now have a cure we only have to reach
 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.080
now have a cure we only have to reach
the 30 million people infected in the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090
the 30 million people infected in the
 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.360
the 30 million people infected in the
world before they affect everybody else

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370
world before they affect everybody else
 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.820
world before they affect everybody else
and then we have to deliver it to them

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830
and then we have to deliver it to them
 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.310
and then we have to deliver it to them
or the safe and effective vaccine that's

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320
or the safe and effective vaccine that's
 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.540
or the safe and effective vaccine that's
a hundred percent effective in

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550
a hundred percent effective in
 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.600
a hundred percent effective in
transmitting the virus so we only have

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610
transmitting the virus so we only have
 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.240
transmitting the virus so we only have
six and a half billion people to give

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250
six and a half billion people to give
 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.030
six and a half billion people to give
the vaccine to so we have a lot of

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040
the vaccine to so we have a lot of
 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.220
the vaccine to so we have a lot of
issues now I can't think of anything

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230
issues now I can't think of anything
 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.889
issues now I can't think of anything
better than a cure or vaccine and I

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899
better than a cure or vaccine and I
 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.119
better than a cure or vaccine and I
can't think of anything better than

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129
can't think of anything better than
 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.189
can't think of anything better than
joining the army to try to accomplish

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199
joining the army to try to accomplish
 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.189
joining the army to try to accomplish
these things but I think we can say that

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199
these things but I think we can say that
 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.869
these things but I think we can say that
we're going to need commitment for the

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879
we're going to need commitment for the
 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.910
we're going to need commitment for the
rest of our lives to deal with this

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920
rest of our lives to deal with this
 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.829
rest of our lives to deal with this
problem and that there will be continued

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839
problem and that there will be continued
 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.980
problem and that there will be continued
breakthroughs to help us the preceding

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990
