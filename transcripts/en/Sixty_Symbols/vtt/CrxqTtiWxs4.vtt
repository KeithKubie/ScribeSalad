00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:05.159
It's still a very famous experiment and in fact far more people have heard about

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.519
Schrodinger's cat than have any idea who is Schrodinger or what the cat was doing?

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.520
Schrodinger's cat is what physicists call a

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.920
Thought experiment. What's called a Gedanken thought experiment from the German thought [one]

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.750
I know this is an experiment that you'd like to do and you can talk about the consequences

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.250
But could you never do in practice like what would happen to the earth when it was going round around if the sun disappeared?

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.099
You could never make the sun disappear, but you could still calculate what would happen to the Earth

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.119
Schrodinger was an Austrian physicist who?

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.300
when the

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.309
Nazis invaded Austria

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.589
Fled to the uk and then to Dublin waking [add] quite a colorful career and actually fathered an illegitimate child

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.769
But that's nothing to do with his cat in the cat experiment was something he proposed

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.290
to try and explain an

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.609
Idea or how stupid he thought one of the ideas [that] had been proposed by quantum physicists working in?

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.989
Copenhagen who were discussing how if you couldn't observe something which had two possible [states]?

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.190
The two states could be muddled together, so you couldn't tell which was [which]

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.559
Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment in which a cat is put in a box

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.070
Showing his cat thought experiment. Well it goes something like this imagine you have a cat. I'm sorry

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.709
this is not a very good model, but you can [imagine] this is a cat which can either be alive or Dead and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.780
His idea was [that] you have a steel box which can be closed so that the hole it can be cut off completely?

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.190
From the outside and nobody not even physicists can see inside

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.059
[so] [the] idea is that you put the cat in the box

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.870
and

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.699
at the same time you put inside a small vessel that contains a tiny amount of a

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.929
radioactive [material] and

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.409
The radioactive material has a few atoms

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.170
And you choose the number of atoms so that during a period of say an hour

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.889
There's a 50% chance that one of them might decay

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.980
Radioactively and give out a particle

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.879
So you put that in the box?

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.729
So now [you] have the cat the radioactive material you then take a geiger counter

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.769
Here we have a very fine geiger counter which can detect

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.089
whether the radioactive Decay has taken place or not and

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300
then and this is the cunning part

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.899
You connect the guide counter to hammer

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.279
which if it detects something it will break a

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.939
small glass container containing cyanide

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:06.739
which is poisonous which will come out and kill the cat so we now close the Lid and

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.610
we start

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.290
[timeing]

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.209
So we know that

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.209
While the box is closed

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.989
inside

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:23.989
During the period of one hour there's a chance that a radioactive decay might take place. We there's no way of us predicting

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.500
There are only equations. We write down how much physics

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.220
We try to do that is a quantum process, and we simply can't predict it and if it takes place the geiger counter

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.989
Triggers

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:43.638
gets the hammer the hammer smashes the cyanide and the cat dies the key question that

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.039
Schrodinger asked or the key Gedanken experiment that he put forward is well think about. What is the state of the cat?

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.638
Before you open the box since we don't know whether the radioactive decay has taken place or not

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.609
under this idea proposed by the people in Copenhagen the cat

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.190
Doesn't know whether it is Dead or alive

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.108
You've got no way of knowing whether the cat in the box is alive or Dead

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.880
Quantum mechanically what you would see is that the cat is in a superposition?

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.769
Of states, it's both alive and dead, and it's only when the our app is [up] and we open the [door]

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.280
That we then

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.229
Determine whether the cat is dead or alive, but while the door is shut

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.239
The cat is in this mixture of Dead and alive state

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.019
Now the point of this experiment at least as far as I know as a chemist was that trading has said

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.560
This is a crazy idea you can't have a cat that is Dead or alive

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.900
Now Shirley's idea was to bring this strange

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.660
Quantum business

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.419
to bring it patch to the general public

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.770
But [also] to make it the thing more real and relevant the genius of this experiment

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.750
And why people have thought about it so long and still get excited is

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.299
Because it links and at an event on the atomic scale one atom

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.470
Disintegrating or not to something that everybody can understand the cat being dead

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.210
or alive

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.620
So you can't tell the cat's dead or it's alive

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.639
I mean clearly the cat is never half dead and half alive is either alive and Dead, and I think the usefulness of the

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.110
Of a showing us cat story is a caution

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.939
it's really a cautionary tale that we have to use different rules of

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.270
thinking when we're dealing with everyday objects like cats and

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.039
Quantum objects, so schrodinger came up with this actually to try and show the the Pitfalls with some

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.360
elements of

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.410
the Quantum mechanical

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.759
[concept] because it is such a very strange concept he wanted to try and show the

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:08.689
ludicrousness of thinking like this the idea that the cat is in two separate states at the same time it's both alive and Dead and

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.350
This was really that that's the copenhagen interpretation that you can have this superposition of States showing

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.649
I really wanted to show that that wasn't the case, and [that] was just ludicrous to think like that

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.509
But the problem is we've done experiments and at this quantum. Level. That's how matter behaves

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.280
Our everyday notions of things being a well-defined states

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.090
For large-scale objects just do not apply the quantum level and we have to use

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.530
Just other ways of thinking

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.729
And that's what quantum mechanics is I mean there are lots and lots of examples the one

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:47.390
Probably the most famous one is [the] electron has a spin it in some sense behaves like a little tiny spinning top

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.449
[but] it's a weird quantum mechanical kind of spin

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.100
So it has all sorts of strange properties

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.529
but you can think of an electron as a little spinning top and

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:59.960
So one of the classic sort of [superpose] states you can have is you can actually you know there are two ways that spin think

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.890
And spin right it can go Clockwise or anti-Clockwise

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.809
You can actually have an electron that hasn't yet made up its mind which state it's in

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:10.879
so it actually is in a superpose state where it's both rotating one way and rotating the other way at the same time and

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:17.089
it's only when you do an experiment to actually measure the properties of that electron that it collapses into one state or the other so

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.260
It spins clockwise or anti-clockwise, and so that's an example of a quantum [mechanical] object

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:24.319
Which is can fundamentally be in two states at the same time?

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.590
Einstein got very excited about this and

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.499
wrote two Schrodinger later

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:36.830
Except that in Einstein's case he imagined it with explosives rather than cyanide

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.890
Which perhaps might be more dramatic?

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.789
but is no good because if the explosive went off it would destroy the box, so it would spoil the idea of the

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.460
Experiments. I thought answer I was clever. That's a stupid idea

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:52.010
Well perhaps he had the Strongbox
