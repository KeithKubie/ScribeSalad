Previously, the condition was to keep running this loop, and keep counting

00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:08.750
until we hit $1 million. But now, we want to keep counting the years until we

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.824
hit $1 billion. So we change the loop condition to go up to 1 billion. Now if I

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:19.464
run this, I find out that it'll take about 1600 years for my $100 to grow to

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:23.089
grow to a billion.
