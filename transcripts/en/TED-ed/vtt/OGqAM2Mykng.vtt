00:00:11.617 --> 00:00:15.249
Watch the center of this disk.

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.076
You are getting sleepy.

00:00:18.076 --> 00:00:19.684
No, just kidding.

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:21.518
I'm not going to hypnotize you.

00:00:21.518 --> 00:00:25.559
But are you starting 
to see colors in the rings?

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.906
If so, your eyes 
are playing tricks on you.

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:32.021
The disk was only ever black and white.

00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:36.743
You see, your eyes don't always
capture the world as a video camera would.

00:00:36.743 --> 00:00:39.535
In fact, there are quite 
a few differences,

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:41.687
owing to the anatomy of your eye

00:00:41.687 --> 00:00:44.105
and the processing 
that takes place in your brain

00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:48.634
and its outgrowth, the retina.

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:50.747
Let's start with some similarities.

00:00:50.747 --> 00:00:54.698
Both have lenses to focus light
and sensors to capture it,

00:00:54.698 --> 00:00:57.114
but even those things behave differently.

00:00:57.114 --> 00:01:01.938
The lens in a camera moves to stay 
focused on an object hurtling towards it,

00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:06.880
while the one in your eye responds
by changing shape.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.872
Most camera lenses are also achromatic,

00:01:09.872 --> 00:01:14.146
meaning they focus both red 
and blue light to the same point.

00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:15.941
Your eye is different.

00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:20.894
When red light from an object is in focus,
the blue light is out of focus.

00:01:20.894 --> 00:01:24.458
So why don't things look 
partially out of focus all the time?

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:26.090
To answer that question,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.429
we first need to look at how your eye
and the camera capture light:

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.295
photoreceptors.

00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:38.652
The light-sensitive surface in a camera
only has one kind of photoreceptor

00:01:38.652 --> 00:01:42.511
that is evenly distributed 
throughout the focusing surface.

00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:47.333
An array of red, green and blue filters
on top of these photoreceptors

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:55.040
causes them to respond selectively to
long, medium and short wavelength light.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.503
Your eye's retinas, on the other hand,
have several types of photoreceptors,

00:01:59.503 --> 00:02:04.255
usually three for normal light conditions,
and only one type for lowlight,

00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:06.958
which is why we're color blind 
in the dark.

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:11.653
In normal light, unlike the camera,
we have no need for a color filter

00:02:11.653 --> 00:02:15.475
because our photoreceptors 
already respond selectively

00:02:15.475 --> 00:02:19.108
to different wavelengths of light.

00:02:19.108 --> 00:02:21.096
Also in contrast to a camera,

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:24.056
your photoreceptors 
are unevenly distributed,

00:02:24.056 --> 00:02:27.686
with no receptors for dim light 
in the very center.

00:02:27.686 --> 00:02:33.053
This is why faint stars seem to disappear
when you look directly at them.

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:37.550
The center also has very few receptors
that can detect blue light,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.692
which is why you don't notice the blurred
blue image from earlier.

00:02:41.692 --> 00:02:44.551
However, you still perceive blue there

00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:48.571
because your brain 
fills it in from context.

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:52.520
Also, the edges of our retinas 
have relatively few receptors

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.732
for any wavelength light.

00:02:54.732 --> 00:02:57.498
So our visual acuity 
and ability to see color

00:02:57.498 --> 00:03:02.287
falls off rapidly 
from the center of our vision.

00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:05.946
There is also an area in our eyes
called the blind spot

00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:09.218
where there are no 
photoreceptors of any kind.

00:03:09.218 --> 00:03:11.120
We don't notice a lack of vision there

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.616
because once again, 
our brain fills in the gaps.

00:03:14.616 --> 00:03:19.953
In a very real sense, 
we see with our brains, not our eyes.

00:03:19.953 --> 00:03:22.267
And because our brains, 
including the retinas,

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:24.479
are so involved in the process,

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:28.431
we are susceptible to visual illusions.

00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:31.772
Here's another illusion 
caused by the eye itself.

00:03:31.772 --> 00:03:35.152
Does the center of this image
look like it's jittering around?

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:38.648
That's because your eye actually
jiggles most of the time.

00:03:38.648 --> 00:03:41.768
If it didn't, your vision 
would eventually shut down

00:03:41.768 --> 00:03:46.235
because the nerves on the retina
stop responding to a stationary image

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:50.018
of constant intensity.

00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:51.567
And unlike a camera,

00:03:51.567 --> 00:03:56.162
you briefly stop seeing whenever you make
a larger movement with your eyes.

00:03:56.162 --> 00:03:58.510
That's why you can't see 
your own eyes shift

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.806
as you look from
one to the other in a mirror.

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:06.468
Video cameras can 
capture details our eyes miss,

00:04:06.468 --> 00:04:08.647
magnify distant objects

00:04:08.647 --> 00:04:11.317
and accurately record what they see.

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:14.916
But our eyes are remarkably 
efficient adaptations,

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:17.074
the result of hundreds 
of millions of years

00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:21.801
of coevolution with our brains.

00:04:21.801 --> 00:04:25.968
And so what if we don't always see
the world exactly as it is.

00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:29.637
There's a certain joy to be found
watching stationary leaves

00:04:29.637 --> 00:04:33.113
waving on an illusive breeze,

00:04:33.113 --> 00:04:38.149
and maybe even an evolutionary advantage.

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:41.194
But that's a lesson for another day.
