00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.890
The use of undercover or covert law enforcement
is common throughout much of the world and,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.580
for the most part, men and women tasked with
going undercover are expected to, and do,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.580
follow the law.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.070
However, beyond the occasional bad officer
doing things they aren’t supposed to, exceptions

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.610
can and will be made on a case by case basis,
making undercover police some of the few people

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.890
who are paradoxically legally allowed to commit
certain crimes while they try to catch other

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.350
people committing crimes.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.500
And before we continue, we should probably
also just quickly state that the common internet

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.559
rumor that undercover officers must admit
to being such if asked is completely false.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.880
They can happily lie to your face if they
want, which is pretty essential to the whole

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.759
job of being an undercover agent.

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.130
In any event, as alluded to, before undercover
police officers and covert agents in many

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.310
countries of the world commit any kind of
crime, they are generally required to get

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.290
prior approval from someone higher up the
chain of command.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.510
However, as with most things in life, there
are of course exceptions to this and if an

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.180
individual officer feels that they have to
commit a given crime to maintain their cover,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.450
they’re tentatively free to do so at their
own discretion, but with full knowledge that

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.380
they’ll almost certainly be required to
justify this decision and there’s no guarantee

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.210
that their superiors will agree with them.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.660
This potentially opens up the officer to criminal
charges themselves.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.250
That said, one of the ways some undercover
operations have historically gotten around

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.289
this in a very controversial way is to simply
keep everything under wraps and potentially

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.180
even lie on their reports, which is where
the controversy occasionally pops up when

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.180
this is discovered.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.349
For example, it was noted by the Justice Department’s
Inspector General in 2005 that the FBI regularly

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.910
broke the rules and disregarded guidelines
over the course of their undercover investigations,

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.750
generally with no consequences to the agents
involved.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.180
As a worse example, we have the relatively
recent case where a three year investigation

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.600
ended up all being wasted time and effort
because it was revealed that the undercover

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.329
officer, according to Judge Cam Ferenbach,
“deployed techniques that generated a wholly

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.079
new crime for the sake of pressing criminal
charges against [Jeremy] Halgat.”

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.450
The officer appears to have taken this route
after repeatedly trying to get Halgat to commit

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.129
a crime, but with Halgat refusing.

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.290
Judge Stephen Reinhardt would also ring in
about the ATF’s conduct in this and other

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.959
similar operations around this time, stating,
“In this era of mass incarceration, in which

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.129
we already lock up more of our population
than any other nation on Earth, it is especially

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.950
curious that the government feels compelled
to invent fake crimes and imprison people

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.610
for long periods of time for agreeing to participate
in them — people who but for the government’s

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.439
scheme might not have ever entered the world
of major felonies.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.299
… When the government decides to troll though
poverty-stricken neighborhoods, ordering its

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.200
agents to seek out people who look ‘bad’
and test them at random for willingness to

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.980
break the law in order to obtain large sums
of money, its conduct is unacceptable.”

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.810
Unsurprisingly, as with any industry, there
are always bad eggs to be found.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.600
But for those better officers who actually
stick to the rules, we have, for example,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.950
official FBI guidelines about undercover operations
stating that “Except when authorized pursuant

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.430
to these Guidelines, no undercover employee
shall engage in any activity that would constitute

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.379
a violation of Federal, state, or local law
if engaged in by a private person acting without

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.379
authorization.”

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.530
In fact, if you read the whole document, undercover
FBI agents can’t even jaywalk or litter

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.280
without express permission from a superior
or handler.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.290
Of course, an undercover agent posing as a
hardened criminal would look mighty suspicious

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.730
if they dutifully obeyed every law.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.249
And any criminal operation could quickly weed
out any such undercover agents simply by asking

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.239
them to break a law and seeing what happened
next.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.820
Again, to get around this sort of issue, most
officers are given prior approval to commit

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.840
minor crimes that might come into play in
a given under cover scenario prior to deployment;

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.150
the key here generally comes down to whether
or not committing the given minor crime will

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.190
blow the officer’s cover or not or is integral
to the operation, such as selling or purchasing

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.190
drugs.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.030
On that note, undercover agents can commit
more major crimes, including even bribing

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.870
politicians, so long as prior approval to
do so is obtained.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.139
In the case where approval to commit a crime
or perform a given illegal activity isn’t

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.910
obtained, undercover agents are often given
broad authorization to commit crimes that

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.910
were “unforseen” if they believe doing
so to be “necessary and appropriate” to

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.970
their continuing investigation or in some
cases if necessary for their own personal

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.970
safety.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.169
In such a case, the guidelines note that permission
to commit the crime can be “retroactively

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.220
authorized if appropriate”.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.560
All this said, these officers are usually
prohibited from engaging “in any act of

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.900
violence” or from attempting to instigate
a crime themselves, but, again, there are

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:25.900
exceptions.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.490
For example, they can engage in an act of
violence if doing so in either self defence

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.580
or to protect the life or wellbeing of the
innocent.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.160
It’s also noted that generally permission
is required to break the law not just for

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.919
more obvious reasons, but to ensure that the
officers are appropriately considering the

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.250
issue of entrapment which was somewhat alluded
to in the aforementioned ATF case.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.350
But for anyone unfamiliar with the term, entrapment
is described thusly in the FBI guidelines:

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.129
Entrapment occurs when the Government implants
in the mind of a person who is not otherwise

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:00.690
disposed to commit the offense the disposition
to commit the offense and then induces the

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.440
commission of that offense in order to prosecute.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.400
To avoid this and other such issues, any plan
suggested by an undercover agent must be checked

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:14.139
and authorized by the upper echelons of FBI
command who need to ensure, amongst other

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.889
things, that planning the crime is necessary
to reveal evidence of other, worse crimes

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.180
or the like.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.130
So, for example, an undercover agent could
propose stealing some cars to take part in

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.409
an illegal street race if doing so would allow
them to earn the trust of an individual they

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:34.050
suspect has been hijacking trucks containing
millions of dollars worth of cargo…

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.349
Officers are also often encouraged to develop
romantic relationships as a great tool to

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:38.690
integrate oneself in a given organization,
though as we’ll get into in a minute, this

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.330
one has caused major issues over in the UK
in recent years.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.240
But just as a general rule of thumb to keep
in mind- the more serious the crime being

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.490
investigated, the more leeway an officer or
agent is likely to be given to commit crimes

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.229
in their pursuit of arresting other people
committing crimes.

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:59.530
As an aside, we should probably mention that
many of these protections are also granted

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.690
to FBI and police informants who can be granted
blanket immunity for minor or agreed upon

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:09.229
crimes they may commit while acting as an
informant in return for their testimony.

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.930
This, too, is not without controversy owing
to the secrecy departments usually maintain

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.419
with this sort of thing and the fact that
when deep investigations are sometimes done,

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:22.550
it occasionally reveals things happening outside
of the rules, including in rare cases the

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.770
embarrassment of informants getting away with
a vast array of crimes for their own benefit

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.699
simply because they’re on good terms with
the authorities and are providing valuable

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:31.699
information.

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:35.740
On this note, in a report from 2011, it was
noted that the FBI allowed informants to break

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:39.129
the law almost 6,000 times in that year alone.

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:43.509
Being forced to report these tallies every
year began after it was revealed that the

00:07:43.509 --> 00:07:49.800
FBI was allowing famed mobster and many time
murderer James Bulger to operate a vast crime

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:54.060
ring in exchange for him revealing information
about other mobster activities.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.699
Another reason these informants sometimes
cause controversy is when they more or less

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:01.580
manufacture crimes to keep themselves useful
and on the payroll.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.949
As Former DEA agent Michael Levine notes,
“You want to catch bad guys, people who

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:08.300
are committing crime, people who have committed
murder.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.710
You don’t want your informant to go out
and talk someone into it.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.240
You can do that all day long and fill jails
from the Bronx to Bogota, Colombia.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:22.189
It’s the easiest thing in the world to do,
but that’s not law enforcement.”

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:26.740
Over in the UK the rules are somewhat similar,
though in more recent years the ability of

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:32.250
undercover police to commit crimes has been
drastically limited after a series of scandals

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.280
involving undercover police officers.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.020
These scandals primarily revolved around a
little-known covert unit of Scotland Yard

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.090
known as the Special Demonstrations Squad.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:46.670
In a nutshell, covert officers working with
the SDS were tasked with infiltrating protest

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.010
groups and the like.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.610
The Guardian would eventually reveal that
many officers were doing things like sleeping

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.950
with those they were investigating and in
some cases, marrying and fathering children

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.480
with their targets before, sometimes after
years of a relationship, disappearing forever

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.710
when the investigation was over, including
potentially abandoning not just their unsuspecting

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.290
spouse or partner (and, indeed, in some cases
the officers already had spouses besides in

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.062
their real lives), but the children they had
with these women.

00:09:08.062 --> 00:09:10.400
Just as controversially, the officers had
a common practice of selecting a deceased

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.180
child born around the same time as themselves
and with a similar name, and then assuming

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.950
that identity without permission from the
surviving parents and relatives.

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.150
Not only this, but they would go further and
research the various family member backgrounds

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:24.580
and sometimes even visit the homes and areas
they were supposedly raised in to help their

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.580
cover.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:29.310
Not just insensitive, this also in some cases
placed these surviving relatives in potential

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:34.001
direct danger given the supposed association
between these people and the undercover officers’

00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:35.440
assumed identity, especially when said officers
then up and disappeared when the investigation

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.440
was over.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.340
In addition, other officers were found to
have taken drugs while undercover (a big no

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.590
no due to the risk of becoming addicted, potential
to blow their cover inadvertently while under

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.120
the effects of the drugs, and the fact that
narcotic use can weaken an officer’s testimony

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.910
in court, potentially hurting the whole point
of the operation).

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.020
In some cases they were also found to have
taken part in various acts of violence or

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.890
other such more serious crimes, including
in one case a major arson incident in a public

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.270
building that risked civilian lives.

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:03.010
In perhaps the most famous case, involving
a highly decorated officer by the name of

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:07.450
Bob Lambert, he was investigating an animal
rights group and so hitched up with an animal

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.530
rights activist who would eventually become
the mother of his child.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:12.330
Again, this practice of forming romantic relationships
for undercover officers had formerly been

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.900
considered (and still is in some agencies)
an invaluable tool to quickly integrate an

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.900
agent within some organization.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.300
As for Bob’s lady, however, she only discovered
her whole relationship with him had been a

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.520
sham after seeing his picture in the paper
some two decades after he disappeared from

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.320
her life, leaving her to raise their child
alone and in poverty.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.410
She stated of this, “Bob was there by my
side through the 14 hours of labour in the

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.100
autumn of 1985 when our son was born.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.220
He seemed to be besotted with the baby.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.340
I didn’t realise then that he was already
married with two other children…”

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:45.060
She went on, “There can be no excuses for
what he did: for the betrayal, the manipulation

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.580
and the lies … I loved him so much, but
now have to accept that he never existed….

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.930
I don’t understand what I am supposed to
have done that I was chosen by the state to

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:55.010
be treated like this.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:11:00.500
I was no threat to national security and what
was my child – collateral damage?”

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.940
During the investigation it was also noted
that undercover officers regularly withheld

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:09.320
information about their activities from prosecutors
in instances where it would weaken the case

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.480
they were building or otherwise get the undercover
officers in trouble.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.140
They also occasionally were found to have
allowed false evidence to be used against

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.140
people.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.060
In response to the controversy, the British
government introduced sweeping legislation

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.560
severely limiting the ability of undercover
officers to commit crimes and form relationships

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.510
with those they were investigating.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.350
A Cliff notes version of the 80 page list
of instructions handed to officers is that

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:38.000
sexual contact of any kind, as well as the
taking of any illegal drug during an investigation,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.470
was now technically banned.

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:44.010
However, much in the same way FBI agents and
the like can commit crimes at their own discretion

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.890
if they feel it necessary to their investigation,
the new guidelines noted that undercover officers

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:54.160
could engage in sexual activity to mitigate
an immediate threat, but only to the smallest

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.320
degree needed in a given case.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.520
While seeming absurd on the surface, this
is actually an important clause given that

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:05.690
without it, discovering an undercover officer
would be as easy as simply mandating they

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.150
have sex with someone.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.510
In addition, while undercover officers can’t
otherwise have sex with a person they’re

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.250
investigating or in connection to an investigation,
official guidelines do permit them to engage

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:17.640
in “communications of a sexual nature”
if they feel it is necessary to achieving

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.830
their objective.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.250
So sexting is still considered OK apparently…

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.600
Likewise, the guidelines note that while drugs
are absolutely not “authorised as a tactic

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.400
of a deployment”, officers can take drugs
if there is an immediate, present threat to

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.480
their own or another’s safety.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.470
As with the guidelines about having sex, in
such a scenario, the officer is only permitted

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:41.020
to take enough drugs to “mitigate the threat”
and no more.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.310
So to sum up, undercover agents in most regions
of the world can absolutely commit crimes

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.620
while undercover, though the extent and severity
of the crimes they are allowed to commit varies

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.640
depending on who or what they are investigating.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.960
However, in general, to cover their own backsides
and ensure the case they are building against

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:50.160
someone is as strong as possible, a good officer
will avoid committing crimes

00:13:50.160 --> 00:14:27.600
whenever possible.
