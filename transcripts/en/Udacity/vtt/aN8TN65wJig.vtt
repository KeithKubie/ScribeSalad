00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.760
So, the dollar sign is just a function.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.170
But, now, what can you do with it?

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.430
jQuery returns an array-like object which we call a jQuery collection.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.550
The reason we say it's an array-like object is that it's an object that

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.070
looks and behaves like an array, but also includes some additional methods.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.275
You could pass strings into the jQuery object and

00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:22.760
a jQuery collection of DOM elements will be returned.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.770
On the Udacity website for instance, I've passed #foo into the jQuery object and

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.350
saw an empty array come back.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.680
All right, well, that's not too exciting.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.620
I'll come back to the passing in strings like this in a moment.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.510
But what if you pass in a function?

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.160
You could actually do that too.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.890
This is a pretty neat trick that I'll be revisiting at the very

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.450
end of this class.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.540
You could pass a DOM element into the jQuery object as well,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.020
if you want to call some jQuery methods on it.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.268
You can call methods directly on the jQuery object, like $.ajax.

00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:59.580
$.ajax subtracts away all the annoying nuances of

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.560
ajax into a simple method called on the jQuery object.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.480
You can check out the ajax class if you want to learn more.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.460
Notice that I'm just talking about normal JavaScript operations.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.240
It's worth repeating that jQuery is just a JavaScript library.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.920
It's not a language.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.530
The jQuery function takes in some parameters.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.170
It returns an object and even has some methods attached to it,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.780
just like any other JavaScript object.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.400
But that's enough of me talking.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.950
It's time for you to start practicing.
