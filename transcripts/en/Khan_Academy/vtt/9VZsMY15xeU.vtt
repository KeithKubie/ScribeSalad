00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.510
Welcome to the
presentation on averages.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.980
Averages is probably a concept
that you've already used

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.020
before, maybe not in
a mathematical way.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.790
But people will talk in terms
of, the average voter wants a

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.750
politician to do this, or the
average student in a class

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.760
wants to get out early.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.760
So you're probably already
familiar with the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.760
concept of an average.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.230
And you probably already
intuitively knew that an

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.710
average is just a number that
represents the different values

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.290
that a group could have.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.970
But it can represent that as
one number as opposed to giving

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.350
all the different values.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.010
And let's give a couple of
examples of how to compute

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.070
an average, and you might
already know how to do this.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:47.150
So let's say I had the
numbers 1, 3, 5, and 20.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.980
And I asked you, what is the
average of these four numbers?

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.380
Well, what we do is,
we literally just

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.280
add up the numbers.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.410
And then divide by the
number of numbers we have.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.220
So we say 1 plus 3 is 4.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.960
So let me write that.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.630
1 plus 3 plus 5 plus 20 equals,
let's see, 1 plus 3 is 4.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.190
4 plus 5 is 9.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.310
9 plus 20 is 29.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.430
And we had 4 numbers;
one, two, three, four.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.210
So 4 goes into 29.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.300
And it goes, 7, 7, 28.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.900
And then we have 10, I didn't
have to do that decimal

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.260
there, oh well.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.845
2, 8, 25.

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.880
So 4 goes into 29 7.25 times.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.590
So the average of these four
numbers is equal to 7.25.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.000
And that might make sense to
you because 7.25 is someplace

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.700
in between these numbers.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.450
And we can kind of view this,
7.25, as one way to represent

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.090
these four numbers without
having to list these

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.990
four numbers.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.480
There are other representations
you'll learn later on.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.960
Like the mode.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.700
You'll also the mean, which
we'll talk about later,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.610
is actually the same
thing as the average.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.680
But the average is just one
number that you can use to

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.400
represent a set of numbers.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.730
So let's do some problems
which I think are going to

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.180
be close to your heart.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.830
Let's say on the first four
tests of an exam, I got a--

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.690
let's see, I got an 80, an 81.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.250
An 87, and an 88.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.580
What's my average in
the class so far?

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.890
Well, all I have to do is
add up these four numbers.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:00.790
So I say, 80 plus 81
plus 87 plus 88.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.370
Well, zero plus 1 is 1.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.190
1 plus 7 is 8.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.490
8 plus 8 is 16.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.770
I just ran eight miles,
so I'm a bit tired.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.310
And, 4/8, so that's 32.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.210
Plus 1 is 33.

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.750
And now we divide
this number by 4.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.300
4 goes into 336.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.000
Goes into 33, 8 times.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.900
8 times 4 is 32.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.000
33 minus 32 is 1, 16.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.460
4.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.750
So the average is equal to 84.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.220
So depending on what school you
go to that's either a B or a C.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.250
So, so far my average after the
first four exams is an 84.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.740
Now let's make this a
little bit more difficult.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:04:00.150
We know that the average
after four exams, at four

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.980
exams, is equal to 84.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.200
If I were to ask you what do I
have to get on the next test to

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.010
average an 88, to average
an 88 in the class.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.490
So let's say that x is what
I get on the next test.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.990
So now what we can say is, is
that the first four exams, I

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.910
could either list out the
first four exams that I took.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.950
Or I already know
what the average is.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.210
So I know the sum of the
first four exams is

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.470
going to 4 times 84.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.420
And now I want to add the, what
I get on the 5th exam, x.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.640
And I'm going to divide
that by all five exams.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.770
So in other words, this
number is the average

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.220
of my first five exams.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.510
We just figured out the average
of the first four exams.

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.620
But now, we sum up the
first four exams here.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.220
We add what I got on the fifth
exam, and then we divide it

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.940
by 5, because now we're
averaging five exams.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.030
And I said that I need to
get in an 88 in the class.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.230
And now we solve for x.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:20.080
Let me make some space here.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.080
So, 5 times 88 is, let's see.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.110
5 times 80 is 400, so it's 440.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.030
440 equals 4 times 84,
we just saw that, is

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.910
320 plus 16 is 336.

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.210
336 plus x is equal to 440.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.200
Well, it turns out if you
subtract 336 from both sides,

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.550
you get x is equal to 104.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.560
So unless you have a exam that
has some bonus problems on it,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.760
it's probably impossible for
you to get ah an 88 average in

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.180
the class after just
the next exam.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.380
You'd have to get 104
on that next exam.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.810
And let's just look
at what we just did.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.380
We said, after 4
exams we had an 84.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.530
What do I have to get on that
next exam to average an 88

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.090
in the class after 5 exams?

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.920
And that's what we solved
for when we got x.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.670
Now, let's ask
another question.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.830
I said after four exams,
after four exams, I

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.080
had an 84 average.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.050
If I said that there are 6
exams in the class, and the

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:42.170
highest score I could get on an
exam is 100, what is the

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.730
highest average I can finish in
the class if I were to really

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.030
study hard and get 100
on the next 2 exams?

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.250
Well, once again, what we'll
want to do is assume we get

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:54.520
100 on the next 2 exams
and then take the average.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.890
So we'll have to
solve all 6 exams.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.820
So we're going to have the
average of 6, so in the

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.000
denominator we're
going to have 6.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.370
The first four exams, the sum,
as we already learned, is 4

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.710
exams times the 84 average.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.590
And this dot is just times.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:12.140
Plus, and there's going to
be 2 more exams, right?

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.740
Because there's 6
exams in the class.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.550
And I'm going to
get 100 in each.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.260
So that's 200.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.230
And what's this average?

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.050
Well, 4 times 84, we
already said, is 336.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.250
Plus 200 over 6.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:31.090
So that's 536 over 6.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.840
6 goes into 5 36.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.580
I don't know if if I gave
myself enough space.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.190
But 6 goes into 53, 8 times.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:42.990
48.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.940
56.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:46.640
9 times.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.850
9 times 6 is 54.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.730
6 minus is 20 6 goes into--
so we'll see it's actually

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.630
89.333333, goes on forever.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:59.770
So 89.3 repeating.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.950
So no matter how hard I try in
this class, the best I can do.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.970
Because I only have two exams
left, even if I were to get

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.740
100 on the next two exams.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:13.090
I can finish the class
with an 89.333 average.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.180
Hopefully, I think some of
this might have been a little

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:16.990
bit of a review for you.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.170
You already had kind of a
sense of what an average is.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.340
And hopefully these last two
problems not only taught you

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.100
how to do some algebra problems
involving average, but they'll

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.830
also help you figure out how
well you have to do on your

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.350
exams to get an A in
your math class.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.310
I think you're now ready
for the average module.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.860
Have fun.
