00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.519
So, I have this brother, John. You may have
heard of him.

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:03.219
JOHN: Hi there!

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:06.680
HANK: As it happens, John and I have the exact
same parents.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.160
JOHN: Yes, Mom and Dad Green.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.240
HANK: And since we have the same parents,
it's to be expected

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.040
that John and I would have similar physical
characteristics

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.100
because the source of our DNA is exactly the
same.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.620
JOHN: Hank and I share some genes, but nobody
knew anything about chromosomes or DNA until

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.230
the middle of the 20th century. And people
have been noticing that brothers tend to look

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.320
alike since like, people started noticing
stuff or whatever.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.750
HANK: That was very scientific, John.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.230
JOHN: I will remind you that I am doing you a favor.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.980
Heredity: it's basically just the passing
on of genetic traits from parents to offspring.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.839
Like John said, the study of heredity is ancient,
although the first ideas about how the goods

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.159
are passed on from parents to kids
were really really really really really really

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:55.530
wrong.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.719
For instance, the concept that people were
working with for nearly 2,000 years came from

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.739
Aristotle, who suggested that:
We're each a mixture of our parents' traits,

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.730
with the father kind of supplying the life
force to the new human and the mother

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.140
supplying the building blocks to put it all
together.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.650
Aristotle also thought that semen was like
highly-purified

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.220
menstrual blood, which is why we still refer
to "bloodlines" when

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.230
we're talking about heredity.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.310
Anyway, since nobody had a better idea, and
since nobody

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.720
really wanted to tangle with Aristotle, for
hundreds of years

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.130
everybody just assumed that our parents'
traits just sort of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.730
blended together in us:

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.430
like if a black squirrel and a white squirrel
fell in love and decided to start a family

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.220
together, their offspring would be gray.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.410
The first person to really start studying
and thinking about

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.490
heredity in a modern way was this Austrian
monk named Gregor Mendel

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.820
 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.200
and Mendel demonstrated that inheritance followed particular patterns.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.710
In the mid-1800s, Mendel spent sort
of an unhealthy amount of time grubbing around

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.910
in his garden with a bunch of pea plants,
and through a series of experiments, crossing

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.480
the pea plants and seeing which traits got
passed on and which didn't--he came up with

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.960
a framework for understanding how traits actually
get passed from one generation to another.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.480
So, to talk about Classical Genetics, which
includes Mendel's

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.120
ideas about how traits get passed along from
parents to children,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.930
we kind of have to simplify the crap out of
genetics. I hope you don't mind.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.409
So we've all got chromosomes, which are
the form that our DNA

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.590
takes in order to get passed on from parent
to child.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.010
Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes.
Now a gene is a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.659
section of DNA in a specific location on a
chromosome that

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.480
contains information that determines a trait.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.049
Of course, the vast majority of the time,
a physical trait is a

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.569
reflection of a bunch of different genes working
together, which makes this all very confusing,

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.719
and when this happens it's called a polygenic
trait.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.549
Polygenic: many genes.

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.459
And then again, sometimes a single gene can
influence how

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.319
multiple traits are going to be expressed;
these genes are called pleiotropic.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.930
 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.159
However, some

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.709
very few, but some

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.650
single traits are decided by a single gene.
Like the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.920
color of pea flowers for example, which is
what Mendel studied when he discovered all

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.909
of this stuff, and when that happens,
in Mendel's honor, we call it a

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:53.629
Mendelian trait.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:57.340
There are a couple of examples of Mendelian
traits in humans, one of them being the relative

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.439
wetness or dryness of your ear wax.

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.299
So, there is just one gene that determines
the consistency of your

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.760
earwax, and that gene is located at the very
same spot on each

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.439
person's chromosome.

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.329
Right here! Chromosome 16.

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.659
However, there's one version of this gene,
or allele, that says the

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.599
wax is going to be wet, and there's another
allele that says the wax is going to be dry.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.029
You may be asking yourself what the difference
is between these two things and I'm glad you

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:22.420
asked because we actually know the answer
to that question.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.420
Among the many amino acids that make up this
particular

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.709
gene sequence, there is one exact slot where
they're different. If

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.639
the amino acid is glycine in that slot, you're
gonna have wet ear wax. But if it's arginine,

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.499
it's dry.

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.459
Now comes the question of how you get what
you get from your

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.639
parents. In most animals, basically any cell
in the body that isn't a sperm or an egg -- these

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.590
are called somatic cells -- are diploid,
meaning there are two sets of chromosomes,

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.609
one inherited from
each of your parents. So you get one earwax-determining

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.299
allele from your mom and one from your dad.

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.459
I should mention that the reason for this
is that gametes, or sex cells--Senor Sperm

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.939
and Madame Egg--are haploid cells, meaning
they only have one set of chromosomes.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.439
Again, for emphasis, non-sex cells are called
somatic cells and they are diploid. Sex cells

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.430
are gametes and they are haploid.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.609
This makes a lot of sense because a sperm
or an egg has a very specific motivation:

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:20.620
they're seriously hoping to score, and if
they do, they plan to join with a complementary

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.110
haploid cell that has the other pair of chromosomes
they're going to need to make a new human,

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.470
or buffalo or squid or whatever.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.419
Also, just so you know, some plants have polyploid
cells, which means they have more than two

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.629
sets of chromosomes in each
cell, which isn't better or anything--it's

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.050
just how they do. But
anyway, the point of all that is that we inherit

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.379
one version of the
earwax gene from each of our parents.

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.910
So, back to earwax!

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.440
So, let's just say your mom gives you a
wet earwax allele and your

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.340
dad gives you a dry earwax allele.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.530
Good Lord, your dad has horribly ugly ears!

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.479
Anyway, since your parents have two alleles,
each for one gene inherited from each of their

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.039
parents, the one passed along to you is entirely
random.

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.539
So, a lot of what Mendel discovered is that
when there are two

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.090
alleles that decide the outcome of a specific
trait, one of these

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.490
alleles could be dominant and the other one
recessive.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.319
Dominance is the relationship between alleles
in which one allele

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.750
masks or totally suppresses the expression
of another allele.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.289
So, back to earwax, because I know we all
love talking about it so much.

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.620
It turns out that Mom's wet earwax allele
is dominant, which is why she gets a BIG W,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:26.580
and Dad's dry earwax allele is recessive,
which is why he has to be a little w.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.460
JOHN: Go, Mom!

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.629
HANK: Oh, you're back!

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.099
JOHN: Yeah! You sound surprised.

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:33.330
HANK: Anyway, Mom's allele is dominant,
and that settles it, right--

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.710
we're gonna have wet earwax?

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.789
JOHN: Uh, something about the way that you
said that tells

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:37.960
me it's not that easy.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.139
HANK: Aw, you are so much smarter than you
look. It is indeed not that easy.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.409
So, just because an allele is recessive doesn't
mean it's

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.750
less common in all your genetic material than
the dominant allele.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.710
Which leads us to the assumption, the CORRECT
assumption, that there's something else going on here.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.240
 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.860
JOHN: I'm definitely getting that vibe from
you.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.699
HANK: So, it has to do with Mom and Dad's
parents. Because

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.740
everybody inherits two alleles from their
parents. Mom got one from Nanny and one from

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.759
Paw Paw. And let's just say Mom got a little
w from Nanny and a big W allele from Paw Paw.

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:11.800
That means Mom's genotype, or genetic makeup
when it comes to that single trait, is heterozygous,

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.460
which means she inherited two different versions
of the same gene from each of her parents.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.550
Dad, on the other hand is a homozygote.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.080
JOHN: Let me guess, that means that he had
two of the

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.460
same allele, either a little w or a Big W
allele inherited from both Grandma and Grandpa.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.229
HANK: Right! And in order for this to all
work out the way that I want it to, let's

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.620
just say that both Grandma and Grandpa would
have passed little w's down to Dad, making

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.150
his genotype homozygous recessive for this
gene.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.300
JOHN: Okay, so I'm keeping score in my head
right now. And

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.050
according to my brain, Mom is a Big W, little
w and Dad is a little w, little w.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:43.610
 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.629
HANK: And now we're going to figure out
what our earwax phenotype is. And phenotype

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:51.270
is what's
expressed physically, or in this case, what

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.129
you'd see if you looked
into our ears.

00:06:53.129 --> 00:06:55.300
JOHN: Alright, so are we gonna do a Punnett
Square or

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.090
anything? This is why I do history, if we're
going to do Punnett Squares, I'm leaving!

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.439
HANK: But I was just going to start to talk
about people again. So Reginald C. Punnett,

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:06.379
who was a total Gregor Mendel
fanboy, invented the Punnett Square as a way

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.830
to diagram the
outcome of a particular cross breeding experiment.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.919
A really simple one looks like this:

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:14.419
So, let's put Mom on the side here and give
her a Big W and a

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:17.360
little w. And let's put Dad on the top,
and he gets two little w's.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.069
So if you fill this in, it looks like there's
a 50/50 chance that any child of this mating

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:23.300
will be homozygous or heterozygous.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.159
And as for our phenotype, it shakes out the
same way: John and I both have a 50% chance

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:31.069
of having wet ear
wax and a 50% chance of having dry ear wax.

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:34.810
So I just had to go and call John, because
now he's not participating

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.750
because he doesn't like Punnett Sauares, and
it turns out, that he has wet ear wax. I also

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.860
have wet ear wax. Which, you know, is not
that unlikely, considering that our parents

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.699
were homozygous and heterozygous.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:51.340
This may explain the odor of our bathroom
growing up because it turns out there's a

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.810
correlation between wet ear wax and body odor,
because ear wax and armpit sweat are produced

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.490
by the same type of gland.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.379
Because this one gene has an effect on multiple
traits or phenotypes, it's an example of a

00:08:02.379 --> 00:08:06.650
pleiotropic gene, because the gene affects
how wet your ear wax is, and how much you stink.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.080
 

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.669
One more thing you might find interesting:
sex-linked inheritance.

00:08:09.669 --> 00:08:13.120
So we've got 23 chromosomes:
22 pairs are

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.610
autosomes, or non-sex chromosomes, and 1 pair
the 23rd pair,

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:23.330
to be exact--is a sex chromosome. At that
23rd pair, women have two full length chromosomes,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:27.789
or "XX," and men have one X chromosome
(that they inherited from their Mom) and this

00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:34.269
one little, short, puny, shriveled chromosome
that we call "Y," which is why men are "XY."

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.490
So, certain genetic traits are linked to a
person's sex and are

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.339
passed on through the sex chromosomes. Since
dudes don't have

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:43.409
two full chromosomes on pair 23, there may
be recessive alleles

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:47.480
on the X that they inherited from their mom
that will get expressed,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.959
since there's not any information on the
Y chromosome to provide

00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:53.860
the possibility for a dominant allele counteracting
that specific trait.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.940
Take, for instance, balding. Women rarely
go bald in their youth

00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:00.070
like some men do because it is caused by a
recessive allele

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:03.730
located in a gene on the X chromosome. So
it's rare that women

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.670
get 2 recessive alleles. But men need just
one recessive allele

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.240
and, Doh! Baldy bald!

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.610
And that allele is on their X chromosome,
which they got from

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.040
Mom. But was Mom bald? Probably not. And where did Mom get

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.860
that allele on her X chromosome? Either from
her Dad or her Mom.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.220
So if you're bald, you can go ahead and blame
it on your

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:25.089
maternal grandmother, or your maternal-maternal great-grandfather

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:28.459
or your maternal-maternal-maternal
great-great grandfather

00:09:28.459 --> 00:09:29.480
 

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.639
who probably went bald before he was 30.

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:34.600
So, Genetics, you guys. Resistance is futile.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.380
Thanks to my brother John for sharing his
personal genetic

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:42.600
information with us, and also his face and
voice and all that stuff. That was very nice.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.160
Think of us next time you swab out your ears!
Actually they say that you really shouldn't

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.339
do that because we have earwax for a reason,
and you might poke your brain or something.

00:09:52.339 --> 00:09:55.480
Okay, that's the last time I'm mentioning
earwax.
