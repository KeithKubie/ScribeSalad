00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.770
Simplify the rational
expression

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.680
and state the domain.

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.790
Let's see if we can start with
the domain part of the

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.410
question, if we can start
with stating the domain.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.030
Now, the domain is the set of
all of the x values that you

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.690
can legitimately input into
this if you view this as a

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.210
function, if you said this is
f of x is equal to that.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.150
The domain is a set of all x
values that you could input

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.210
into this function and
get something that is

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.330
well-defined.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.300
The one x value that would make
this undefined is the x

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.210
value that would make the
denominator equal 0-- the x

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.690
value that would make
that equal 0.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.710
So when does that happen?

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.850
Six minus x is equal to 0.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.860
Let's add x to both sides.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.950
We get 6 is equal to x, so the
domain of this function is

00:00:48.950 --> 00:01:02.200
equal to the set of all
real numbers except 6.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.570
So, x could be all real numbers
except 6, because if x

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.220
is 6 then you're dividing
by 0, and then this

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.290
expression is undefined.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.580
We've stated the domain, now
let's do the simplifying the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.510
rational expression.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.000
Let me rewrite it over here.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.260
We have x squared minus
36 over 6 minus x.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.120
Now, this might jump out at you
immediately, as it's that

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.650
special type of binomial.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.830
It's of the form a squared minus
b squared, and we've

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.310
seen this multiple times.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.160
This is equivalent to a plus
b times a minus b.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.390
And in this case, a
is x and b is 6.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.400
This top expression right here
can be factored as x plus 6

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.120
times x minus 6, all of
that over 6 minus x.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.960
Now, at first you might say,
I have a x minus 6

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.390
and a 6 minus x.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.660
Those aren't quite equal, but
what maybe will jump out at

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.750
you is that these are the
negatives of each other.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.710
Try it out.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.130
Let's multiply by negative 1 and
then by negative 1 again.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.000
Think of it that way.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.110
If I multiply by negative 1
times negative 1, obviously,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.890
I'm just multiplying the
numerator by 1, so I'm not in

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.780
any way changing
the numerator.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.390
What happens if we just multiply
the x minus 6 by that

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.490
first negative 1?

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.190
What happens to that
x minus 6?

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.850
Let me rewrite the
whole expression.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.300
We have x plus 6, and I'm
going to distribute this

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.740
negative 1.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.400
If I distribute the negative 1,
I have negative 1 times x

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.050
is negative x.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.020
Negative 1 times negative
6 is plus 6.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.780
And then I have a negative
1 out here.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.540
I have a negative 1 times
negative 1, and all of that is

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.960
over 6 minus x.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.920
Now, negative plus 6.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.600
This is the exact same thing
as 6 minus x if you just

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.080
rearrange the two terms.
Negative x plus 6 is the same

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.950
thing as 6 plus negative
x, or 6 minus x.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.820
Now you could cancel them out.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.650
6 minus x divided by 6 minus x,
and all you're left with is

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.450
a negative 1-- I'll write it
out front-- times x plus 6.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.170
If you want, you can distribute
it and you would

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.900
get negative x minus 6.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.290
That's the simplified
rational expression.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.300
In general, you don't have to
go through this exercise,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.120
multiplying by a negative
1 and a negative 1.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.490
But you should always be able
recognize that if you have a

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.410
minus b over b minus a that that
is equal to negative 1.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.510
Or think of it this way: a
minus b is equal to the

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.670
negative of b minus a.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.240
If you distribute this negative
sign, you get

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.890
negative b plus a, which
is exactly what

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.720
this is over here.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.450
We're all done.
