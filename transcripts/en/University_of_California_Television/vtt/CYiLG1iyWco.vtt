00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.240
by University of California Television.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.380
- I'm Stanley Brandes.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.540
I'm a member of the
Department of Anthropology

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.410
here at Cal and the chair

00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:05.290
of the Foerster Lecturers Committee.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.028
Along with the graduate council,

00:01:07.028 --> 00:01:11.920
we are pleased to present
today, Tanya Luhrmann,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.248
this year's speaker in our lecture series.

00:01:15.248 --> 00:01:20.140
As a condition of this
bequest, the Foerster bequest,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.430
we're obligated to tell
you how the endowment

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.220
supporting the Foerster
lectures on the immortality

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.080
of the soul came to UC Berkeley.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.970
It's a story that
exemplifies the many ways

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.030
this campus is linked to
the history of California

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.793
and the Bay Area.

00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:40.010
In 1928, Ms. Edith Swaybrook established

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.450
the Foerster Lectureship
to honor the memory

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.184
of Agnes A. Foerster and
Constantine E. A. Foerster.

00:01:47.184 --> 00:01:50.230
Edith was a public school
teacher in San Francisco

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.810
for many years and the
teaching profession was,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.530
to her, an opportunity
to develop true knowledge

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.380
and love of the spiritual values of life

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.163
in the young minds entrusted to her care.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.920
Edith's beloved sister, Agnes A. Foerster,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.184
shared her high ideals and hopes,

00:02:09.184 --> 00:02:14.184
as did Agnes' husband,
Constantine E. A. Foerster.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.130
A lawyer by profession, Foerster was a man

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.120
of high intellectual achievements

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.520
and rare personal charm.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.240
Although he passed away at the age of 37,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.780
he had achieved an enviable
place at the San Francisco Bar

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.570
and was considered one of its
most highly-respected members.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.849
For several years prior to his death,

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.970
Foerster was a law partner
of Alexander F. Morrison,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.850
one of the most prominent
of San Francisco attorneys,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.000
for whom our Morrison
Memorial Library is named.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.880
In her last days, Ms.
Edith Swaybrook expressed

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.780
her deep and abiding
interest in spiritual life

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.580
by creating this lecture series on

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.420
the Imortality of the Soul,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.500
or similar spiritual topics.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.110
She believed that through the medium

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.520
of a great university and the
words of scholarly lecturers,

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.880
she might bring new
light upon a topic that

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.430
has interested the world for centuries.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.353
Thank you, Edith Swaybrook.

00:03:11.353 --> 00:03:14.520
(audience applauding)

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.098
And now, about our distinguished lecturer.

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:22.427
Tanya Luhrmann is a very well-known

00:03:22.427 --> 00:03:25.510
and influential anthropologist.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.330
Her work focuses on the ways that objects

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.930
without material presence
come to seem real to people,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.590
and how ideas about the mind
affect mental experience.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.820
Her previous studies
have analyzed phenomena

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.580
such as witchcraft,
charismatic Christians,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.115
and psychiatrists.

00:03:43.115 --> 00:03:46.750
Her wildly-acclaimed
third book, Of Two Minds,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.540
offered an ethnographic study

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.800
of the American Psychiatric Community

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.190
and examined how disciplinary
and ideological pressures

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.450
that accompany psychiatric training

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.970
shaped the experiences of psychiatrists

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.110
and patients alike.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.040
Of Two Minds was awarded
the Victor Turner Prize

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.020
for Ethnographic Writing,
and the Boyer Prize

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.520
for Psychological Anthropology.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.000
In her most recent book,
When God Talks Back,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.470
Luhrmann looks at the way
in which practitioners

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.770
within American Evangelical
Christian communities

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.530
come to experience God
as a being with whom

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.620
they can engage in direct
communication through acts

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.213
of prayer and visualizations.

00:04:29.213 --> 00:04:32.520
When God Talks Back was
named both a New York Times

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.743
Notable Book, and a Kirkus
Reviews Book of the Year.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.940
Tanya Luhrmann is Watkins
University professor

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.530
in the Stanford Anthropology Department.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.900
She earned her BA in
Folklore and Mythology

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.260
at Harvard University in 1981 and her PhD

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.430
in social anthropology
at Cambridge University

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.700
in 1986.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.900
She previously taught

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.050
at the University of California San Diego

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.840
and the University of Chicago

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.210
before joining the anthropology faculty

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.370
of Stanford University in 2007.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.500
She is a recipient of
fellowships and grants

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.240
from the Guggenheim Foundation,
the Templeton Foundation,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.470
the National Institute of Health,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.400
the National Science Foundation,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.870
and she's been elected
to the American Academy

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.705
of Arts and Sciences.

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:24.690
Many of you might also
know her through her,

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.830
the past several years,
she's been an occasional

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.130
op-ed contributor to the
pages of the New York Times,

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.509
where most of her work,
that I've read anyway,

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:39.223
has dealt with the Evangelical
Christian experience.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.473
The title of today's talk is
The Quest for Heaven is Local.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.320
How spiritual experience
is shaped by social life.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.183
Please join me in
welcoming Tanya Luhrmann.

00:05:53.183 --> 00:05:56.580
(audience applauding)

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.093
- Thank you very much.

00:05:58.093 --> 00:06:00.026
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.010
So this is great.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.440
I'm going to present some new work to you.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.363
And, thank you, for
joining me on this journey

00:06:08.363 --> 00:06:11.336
of beginning to understand what,

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:15.580
trying to make sense of the material

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.050
that I'm coming to know.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.150
Alright, I'll begin with my usual caveat

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.070
which is that I'm going to talk about God.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:24.240
But nothing that I say is an argument

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.550
for or against God's real reality.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.444
What puzzles me is that God is invisible.

00:06:29.444 --> 00:06:31.650
And so, the question
is, how do people come

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.160
to feel confident of God's existence.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.743
About 10 years, I set out to understand

00:06:37.743 --> 00:06:40.780
the major shift in American spirituality

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.730
since 1965, towards a
more direct, immediate,

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:47.161
and personal experience of God.

00:06:47.161 --> 00:06:49.410
Arguably, a quarter of all Americans

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.510
are involved in this kind of renewalist

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.970
Christian spirituality.

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.560
And I find myself doing research in

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.460
a Vineyard Christian Fellowship.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.260
So there are about 600 of these churches

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.030
in the country and thousands
of more that are like them.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.430
These are sometimes called
new paradigm Protestant

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:06.710
Christian churches.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.160
They combine a Conservative
social ideology

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.040
with a Liberal social style.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.836
They're more likely to meet
in gyms than in churches.

00:07:14.836 --> 00:07:18.103
They're likely to use a rock
band rather than a choir.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.047
They are Evangelical, by
which people typically mean

00:07:23.047 --> 00:07:26.470
that they see a personal
relationship with Jesus

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.250
as the only route to personal salvation.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.346
And they treat the Bible as literally true

00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:34.260
or near-literally true.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.230
True in all that it informs.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:39.320
So the age of the earth,
maybe that's not so important.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.540
The miracles described in the Gospels

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.820
really took place.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.400
This is the church where I spent time

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.670
as an anthropologist for two years,

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.799
over two years, really, in Chicago.

00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:53.037
This is on a summer
morning along the lake.

00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:55.820
I went to Sunday morning gatherings.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.280
I was a member of a house group for a year

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.010
where we met weekly to pray
and to talk and to read

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.050
the Bible.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:03.260
I hung out with people.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.430
I had coffee with people.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.300
I interviewed people.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.840
I went to all kinds of
regional, national conferences

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.723
and events.

00:08:08.723 --> 00:08:11.410
And then, I moved to California,

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.830
here to the South Bay,

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.130
and did it all over again
with another Vineyard church.

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.420
So let me tell you a little bit about

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.690
the God that I saw in this church.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.600
This is a God who's deeply human.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.560
God is high and mighty and distant,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.400
but also a person among people.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.670
He will hang out with you.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:28.910
He will chat with you.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.330
He's also deeply supernatural.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.550
So as you hang out with God,

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.500
He can intervene in the things,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.370
the little things that you
talk to a friend about.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.440
Like, getting a good haircut,

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.470
or where you want to go on your vacation,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:44.820
or, you know, the argument
you had with your spouse

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:45.653
last night.

00:08:45.653 --> 00:08:47.310
He cares about all that stuff and He

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.440
can make a difference in your life.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.230
To give you a feel of the way that people

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:52.744
talk about this God,

00:08:52.744 --> 00:08:55.160
this is a book by, and I'm quoting here

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.600
from a book by Dallas
Willard who's sort of

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.780
an Evangelical's intellectual.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:03.487
And he says, "God's
face-to-face conversations

00:09:03.487 --> 00:09:06.347
"with Moses are the normal human life

00:09:06.347 --> 00:09:07.550
"God intended for us."

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.270
Which is really quite a claim.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.630
This next quotation comes from my favorite

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.130
ethnographic artifact, Bruce
and Stan's Pocket Guide

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.050
to Talking with God.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.107
And Bruce and Stan tells us,

00:09:20.107 --> 00:09:21.727
"It's really important to understand

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.147
"that God is not an impersonal force.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:25.607
"Even though He's invisible,

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:28.287
"God is personal and He
has all the characteristics

00:09:28.287 --> 00:09:29.120
"of a person.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.567
"He knows, He hears, He
feels, and He speaks."

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.337
You can understand these
engagements with God,

00:09:37.337 --> 00:09:41.010
the prayer practices
as imaginal dialogues.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.200
This is a term that Mary Watkins uses

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.470
to describe a set of conversations

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.440
that we have.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.577
She says, "We may find ourselves speaking

00:09:48.577 --> 00:09:50.267
"with our reflection in the mirror,

00:09:50.267 --> 00:09:52.249
"with a photograph of someone we miss,

00:09:52.249 --> 00:09:54.527
"with a figure from a dream or a movie,

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:55.547
"with our dog.

00:09:55.547 --> 00:09:58.017
"And even when we're outwardly silent,

00:09:58.017 --> 00:09:59.837
"with the ebb and flow of our thoughts,

00:09:59.837 --> 00:10:01.927
"we talk with critics, with our mothers,

00:10:01.927 --> 00:10:04.120
"our gods, our consciences."

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.720
So these are ordinary human events.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.860
You have these inner voice conversations

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:09.837
in your mind.

00:10:09.837 --> 00:10:12.300
Someone like Mary Watkins uses the word,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.590
imaginal, because she's
pointing out that we use

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.710
our imagination, but the
person having the conversation

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:20.650
does not necessarily
experience the conversation

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.313
as imaginary.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.160
And in a church like this,

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.262
people are really encouraged to pray

00:10:27.262 --> 00:10:30.340
with these imaginary dialogues,

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.800
and to experience themselves as talking

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.310
informally to God about
whatever matters to them,

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:37.660
the little ordinary things in your life.

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.280
And to experience God
as talking back to you

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.350
about those experiences.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:44.980
In these churches, God
is also a substance,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.240
a force that comes into
your life in the form

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.550
of the Holy Spirit.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.300
So the Holy Spirit may
make you feel electric,

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.550
may make your skin tingle,
you may feel goosebumps.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.570
The Holy Spirit can move
through a circle of people

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:01.310
and lead to the healing of
the person in the center

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:02.960
of the prayer circle.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.630
The Holy Spirit can sweep down the aisle

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.530
and knock somebody over.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:09.550
And the Holy Spirit can twist your tongue

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.030
so you speak with a language-like sound

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:13.870
that's not actually a language

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.520
but is understood to be a language

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.920
that God can understand
and the Devil cannot.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.230
This is what I was interested
in as an anthropologist.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.980
The task for a congregant in this church

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.470
is to experience the imaginal dialogue

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.890
as not merely imaginary but as somehow

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:34.241
rooted in the world outside the head

00:11:34.241 --> 00:11:37.709
as being, in some part, real in the world.

00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:39.830
The person in the church like this

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.110
must also learn to experience
God's immaterial presence

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.780
to some extent in a material way.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.400
More important, to experience
the imaginal dialogue,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.720
but there's also this
yearning to feel this sense

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:56.600
of God's presence in an empirical way.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.840
I knew that this involved training.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.320
Because when I come out of these churches,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.670
people would sometimes
arrive as a new member

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.617
of the congregation
and say something like,

00:12:05.617 --> 00:12:08.017
"Please, so-and-so, would
you pray to God for me

00:12:08.017 --> 00:12:10.097
"because I know that God talks to you,

00:12:10.097 --> 00:12:12.030
"but Got doesn't talk to me."

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:14.580
And six to nine months
into their experience

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.806
of the church, they
would formulate sentences

00:12:17.806 --> 00:12:21.407
like, "I recognize God's
voice the way I recognize

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:23.901
"my mom's voice on the phone."

00:12:23.901 --> 00:12:27.970
So the book that I wrote
basically did three...

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.790
I'm going to say it did three things.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.520
First of all, I could see
the people, in order to learn

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.121
to experience God is
interacting with them.

00:12:36.121 --> 00:12:39.147
People had to learn to
interpret their thoughts

00:12:39.147 --> 00:12:41.940
and to make sense of
their mental experience

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:43.520
in many ways.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.947
And people had to ask the question,

00:12:45.947 --> 00:12:47.740
"Was that God speaking to me?"

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.710
And they would pick out thoughts

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.380
that they might have
attributed to themselves,

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:56.210
but that they learned to
experience and understand

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.000
as not their own thoughts
but God speaking to them.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.630
In other words, they thought that thought

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.090
was not self-authored.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.735
It was other-authored.

00:13:03.735 --> 00:13:06.456
People would do this by identifying

00:13:06.456 --> 00:13:11.356
a thought that was louder
than other thoughts.

00:13:11.356 --> 00:13:15.160
It would sort of spontaneously
pop into their mind.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.270
It took them by surprise.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.580
And then, they were
made to ask themselves,

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.070
and the church would invite them to ask

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.717
these kinds of question,

00:13:22.717 --> 00:13:25.137
"Is this consistent with the scriptures?

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:27.681
"Is this the kind of
thing that God would say?"

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:30.540
And then, how did you feel
when you had that thought?

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.380
Did you feel as if it gave you peace?

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.213
Did you feel good?

00:13:33.213 --> 00:13:34.777
Because if a loving God talks to you,

00:13:34.777 --> 00:13:37.260
you should feel pretty good about that.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.160
And they would ask people to see if they

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.817
could confirm that that
was what God was saying

00:13:41.817 --> 00:13:43.840
by other means.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.544
I also described in this book

00:13:45.544 --> 00:13:48.107
what I called inner sense cultivation.

00:13:48.107 --> 00:13:51.488
And I made the argument that
the prayer practice people use

00:13:51.488 --> 00:13:55.040
when they're really
intensely trying to use

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.190
their imagination to
allow God to come alive,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.750
had psychological effects
on their mental experience.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.880
So when people began to pray like this

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.750
and they talked informally to God,

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.940
and they tried to imagine
that God was present.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.520
And they would throw
themselves into the scriptures

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.040
so that when they tried to
understand Blind Bartimaeus,

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.270
they tried to see him as he
sat by the side of the road.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:20.130
They tried to imagine
the color of his cloak

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.467
and what it was like when He flung it away

00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:23.300
to follow Jesus.

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.530
They really wanted to see
it as if they were there.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:29.170
And I argued in this book,
using some experimental work,

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.540
I've got a foot in psychology, as well,

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.420
that this actually did change something

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.480
about the quality of
your mental experience.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:37.880
It made your mental
world, inner mental world,

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.194
come alive, feel more real,
feel more external to you.

00:14:42.194 --> 00:14:45.162
I also saw in this church a striking use

00:14:45.162 --> 00:14:46.960
of imagination.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.980
So congregants in churches like this

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.180
are invited to have a
cup of coffee with God,

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.730
to go for a walk with God,
to have a beer with God,

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.183
to go on a date with God.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.000
People would talk about cuddling
with God on a park bench.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.100
There's a lot of, you know, C. S. Lewis

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.880
is really important in churches like this,

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.860
and God is the big fluffy lion, Aslan,

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.096
as a very important imaginative vehicle

00:15:10.096 --> 00:15:12.623
for representing the experience of God.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.590
People value spiritual experience.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:18.350
All these things were important.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.540
One of the things they
did was that the coming

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.440
to use your imagination to experience God,

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.070
it enabled God to feel real to you.

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.388
It also enabled these
Americans to hold God

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:33.330
in a special complicated way,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.840
because if you are imagining
that God is walking

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:39.940
by your side, you know that's God,

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.350
but you also know that, to some extent,

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.990
you're imagining that this is God.

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:45.880
And so, it becomes cognitively
and epistemologically,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.290
really complicated and sophisticated.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.238
And I thought it kind of
helped these Americans

00:15:51.238 --> 00:15:55.070
to manage their own
complicated views about living

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.344
in a secular society, in a
world in which many other people

00:15:59.344 --> 00:16:02.060
had different views about
God, didn't think that God

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:03.470
existed at all.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:07.580
And so, if you make God really,
really imaginatively present

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.840
you get your God, but you
also learn to hold your God

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.580
in a way that is somewhere
between the material

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.280
and the immaterial, available to you,

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.793
but also marked in
different kinds of ways.

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:27.070
So all that seemed to me
to reflect a particular

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.590
and local theory of mine.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.760
Now, we're getting into
that larger project

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.840
that I'm going to describe today.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.190
It seemed to me that, as
these Americans talked

00:16:36.134 --> 00:16:39.793
to me of God, one of
the things that I heard

00:16:39.793 --> 00:16:43.072
was a common American
experience that the mind

00:16:43.072 --> 00:16:45.130
is bounded, private.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:46.893
That there is a wall between your mind

00:16:46.893 --> 00:16:48.420
and the world.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.730
It was hard for these Americans to learn

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:52.500
to come to terms with the idea that God

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.540
was speaking back to them in their mind.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.049
It took them time to adopt the idea

00:16:57.049 --> 00:16:59.460
that there's this external being talking

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.410
in their mind.

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:03.010
These Americans also seemed to me

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:05.240
to exemplify an American tendency

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.250
to treat feeling as
really, really important.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.330
We live in a world in which
sadness can make you sick.

00:17:11.330 --> 00:17:13.530
It justifies you going to the doctor.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.250
It justifies you staying home from work.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:20.610
We treat our internal experience
as worthy of attention

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:22.290
and, in fact, many of these Americans

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:24.090
that I saw in the Vineyard church,

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:25.970
they would talk to God
about their feelings.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.780
What they wanted to know,
when they talked to God

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:29.684
about a fight with their spouse,

00:17:29.684 --> 00:17:32.010
is why they felt so riled up,

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:33.300
and what they were going to do about it,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:34.990
and how God could help
them feel a little bit

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:36.332
more comfortable.

00:17:36.332 --> 00:17:39.580
It's also clear that
there's a complicated story

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.980
about realness, that when
people use their imagination

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.780
to experience God, they
took their imagination

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:48.613
to be important.

00:17:48.613 --> 00:17:50.270
And, in fact, we spent an enormous amount

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.410
of time cultivating
imagination in the lives

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:53.437
of our children.

00:17:53.437 --> 00:17:56.690
But imagination is not real to Americans.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.583
It's mere imagination.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.870
The stuff in your head
kind of comes and goes.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:03.703
It's flimsy.

00:18:03.703 --> 00:18:05.930
It's not of the world in the same way that

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.667
the table and chair is part of the world.

00:18:08.667 --> 00:18:12.590
So I decided to find
out what the experience

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.683
of God was like in a place in which people

00:18:14.683 --> 00:18:17.890
felt very differently about their minds.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.420
And so, the project that I now embarked on

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.470
is the project to compare
the way people experience

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.950
invisible others in new
charismatic Evangelical churches,

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.410
and also folks who struggle
with psychotic illness

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.380
and hear voices.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.110
But I don't talk about that in this talk.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:38.990
I'm looking at churches in
Accra, Ghana, West Africa,

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.800
in Chennai, India, and in the
Bay Area, obviously, here.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.395
And the question that I'm asking,

00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:49.430
if I see differences in
the experience of God,

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.300
does that have anything
to do with different ways

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.560
in which the mind is real for people?

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.300
There are different ways
in which people understand

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.000
the experience of the mind.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.720
The specific questions
I'm going to ask today

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.210
are how do congregants in, actually,

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:08.040
two culturally-different but
theologically-similar settings

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.980
represent the aim and
experience of imaginal dialogue

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.470
in prayer?

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:17.690
What specific spiritual
experiences do congregants

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.090
in these different settings
recognize, elaborate,

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:22.760
and report, and do any
of these differences

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.890
that I find reflect differences in local

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:29.250
theories of mind, different
ideas about the mind?

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.000
And so, I'm going to talk to
you now about my experience

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.704
of going off to Accra, and what
I find when I talk to people

00:19:36.704 --> 00:19:40.400
in the new charismatic churches there,

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.710
of which there of many,
many such churches.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.830
70% of Accra is Christian.

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.107
About half of that population
belongs to these churches

00:19:48.107 --> 00:19:51.020
that, in many ways, are very much like

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.130
the American churches.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.980
They are very recognizable.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.570
So these are big new buildings.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:59.399
They have thousands of people
in their congregations.

00:19:59.399 --> 00:20:01.810
They have tons of
international connections.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.760
They're streaming media
all over the place.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.532
There are billboards everywhere.

00:20:05.532 --> 00:20:08.270
These churches become
a kind of social life

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:09.610
for the middle class.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:14.610
They provide medical
treatment and social events,

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.290
and there's a hair salon,
and you can do banking.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:19.270
You can live your entire
life, if you'd like,

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.848
within the confines of
these huge churches.

00:20:21.848 --> 00:20:23.863
And everybody speaks english.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.500
Which means, basically,
that, for most people,

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.470
this is a venue for the middle class.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.700
And sometimes they're understood as places

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:32.750
where the middle class will come

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:33.730
and meet each other.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.430
It's a good way for a man to meet a woman.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.840
They are very much like
the new charismatic

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.811
Evangelical church that
I studied, the Vineyard.

00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:47.165
Their theology presents to you
with a personal relationship

00:20:47.165 --> 00:20:49.620
with a God who's going to talk back.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.080
This God, people will tell you,

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:52.920
is unconditionally loving.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.440
So it turns out it's a
little bit more complicated

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.520
than that, but that's
what people will tell you.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.630
People will tell you that this God

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.150
is supernaturally efficacious,

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:04.548
and He deals with their
particular concerns.

00:21:04.548 --> 00:21:06.760
With their own ill health.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.360
He gives them stuff.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.970
He's concerned with you
personal experience.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:15.993
People dress casually for
middle-class Africans in Accra.

00:21:16.877 --> 00:21:20.270
These are what the British would call

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:22.080
happy-clappy churches.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.800
Everybody's cheering,
and dancing, and singing,

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.140
and speaking in prophecy.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.513
It's fun to go to these churches.

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:32.360
And these are churches
that are chocked full

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.630
of American books on
Evangelical Christianity.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:39.446
You walk into the
bookstores and down one wall

00:21:39.446 --> 00:21:42.740
there are all the American books
on Evangelical Christianity

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:45.250
that I come across in this
culture and are sitting

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.430
on my bookshelf.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.540
By American authors.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.420
And down the other wall are
all the other books in English

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.286
by African authors about the same topics.

00:21:54.286 --> 00:21:58.130
If you just look at the church,

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.590
it looks like there's
a lot that's similar.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:04.000
This is not a full ethnographic
study that I'm doing.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.210
I'm trying to do a comparative study

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:07.990
in which I look at three
different settings.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.720
So I now can spend four years in Accra,

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.260
and four years in Chennai and, so far,

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:17.420
this is kind of the package
of data that I've collected.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:20.620
But what I want to talk to you about today

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.886
are my interviews with pastoral students

00:22:23.886 --> 00:22:28.886
at a school attached to
one of the big churches.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.413
So these are lovely young people.

00:22:32.413 --> 00:22:35.920
They're a lot like the people that I saw

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.390
in the Chicago Vineyard.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.830
Many of the folks that I spent time with

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:40.780
in the Chicago Vineyard,

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.480
there are eight Vineyards in Chicago...

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:45.730
The people I spent time with were mostly

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:46.810
in their middle 20s.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:48.810
A lot of them went off
to do pastoral work.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.398
They took their Christianity
very, very seriously.

00:22:51.398 --> 00:22:54.440
These 15 students that I spent time with

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.210
in a recent trip to Accra all intend

00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:59.810
to be pastors or to work in some way

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:00.940
in the church.

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.160
They are in their middle 20s.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.500
Their schooling had been
conducted entirely in English.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.050
Some of them prayed in English.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.710
They were immersed in the
thinking of this church.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:12.190
I knew that they...

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.260
And it was very Vineyard-like.

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.030
They'd taken a class, actually,

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.670
on how to experience God
as talking back to you

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:20.640
in your mind.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.470
And they were quite happy to explain to me

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.830
all about this class
and how it enabled them

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.560
to experience God intimately.

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.423
This is the interview that I,

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.274
the structure of the
interview that I did with them

00:23:32.274 --> 00:23:35.090
and, of course, these are loose
semi-structured interviews.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.543
But with each of these young people,

00:23:37.543 --> 00:23:41.031
I asked them about the way
they experienced prayer.

00:23:41.031 --> 00:23:45.060
I asked them how they
prayed and I asked them,

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.170
in effect, to whom do they pray.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.540
How do they understand God?

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.060
How do they understand the
way that God heard them speak?

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.330
How do they understand the interaction?

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.050
And then, I asked them a
whole set of other questions

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.540
about classic spiritual experiences.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.770
So these we know to be phenomena,
psychological phenomena

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:04.750
in the world.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.540
We know that people hear
audible voices periodically.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:13.210
And we know that people
sometimes have visual experiences

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.145
as if they're seeing it with their eyes.

00:24:15.145 --> 00:24:17.270
We know that there's some, you don't have

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.930
to understand this, but there's some sense

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:21.860
that some other person is
near, tangibly present,

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.860
as if they're sitting right next to you.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:28.240
We know that people
have had that experience

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.138
with a non-God Person.

00:24:30.138 --> 00:24:35.138
You would see people shake in
church, weep uncontrollably

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:38.390
when they were experiencing
God, or shake...

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:41.200
You know, they'd become all
weak and they'd fall over

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.990
or they'd act as if a thunderbolt
had gone through them,

00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:45.470
or a bolt of lighting.

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:47.295
You could see people do that.

00:24:47.295 --> 00:24:49.730
We know that there are
out of body experiences.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.250
You can generate them in the lab.

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.140
I'll talk a little bit more about those.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.290
And we know that there are these phenomena

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.660
in which people wake
up and they can't move.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.940
They have an experience
of sleep paralysis.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.028
And you might imagine this is kind

00:25:02.028 --> 00:25:05.890
of the straw dogs argument
that I'm arguing against.

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:09.800
You might imagine that these
experiences of the body,

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.870
they're a result of kind of a God spot,

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:14.520
and they happen to people, more or less,

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.650
in the same way, more or less,

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.030
everywhere in the world.

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.220
And I was curious to know
whether that was really true.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:22.863
So let me first tell
you about the experience

00:25:22.863 --> 00:25:27.200
that I heard from these
students about talking

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.140
to God in their minds, and
having these imaginal dialogues

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.080
in which they're talking
to God and they're waiting

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.890
for God to talk back.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.040
So, in many ways, if
you've read only the first

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.700
10 minutes of my interview,
or you were with me

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.386
for my first 10 minutes, these
young people sound exactly

00:25:44.386 --> 00:25:46.600
like congregants in the Vineyard.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.960
They tell me that God
is their best friend.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.410
They tell me that they can
talk to Him about anything.

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:52.850
I mean, they talk to Him about dinner.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.270
They talk to Him about their dates.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:55.880
They talk to Him...

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.061
They talk to Him about everything.

00:25:58.061 --> 00:26:00.960
They say that God will talk back.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.470
They also say that God
loves them unconditionally.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:05.520
And they're very clear
when I ask them this.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.660
They absolutely, God loves us without end.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.410
He just loves us the way that we are.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.870
And we have to do stuff, too.

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.474
But God just loves us.

00:26:15.474 --> 00:26:19.896
They also described discernment
in remarkably similar ways.

00:26:19.896 --> 00:26:22.939
So a thought will pop into your mind.

00:26:22.939 --> 00:26:26.300
In order to qualify as a
good candidate for something

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.060
that God may have said to you,

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.993
you've to make sure that it's consistent

00:26:29.993 --> 00:26:33.166
with Scripture, the kind of
thing that God might say,

00:26:33.166 --> 00:26:36.150
and you've got to feel good
when God is speaking to you

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.550
because God is good.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.180
So you should feel a sense of peace.

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.740
It gets a little more
complicated than that

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:43.860
if God is telling you not to do something.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.010
But, basically, God is your
friend and God loves you.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.446
And so, you should feel good.

00:26:49.446 --> 00:26:52.946
I actually think, this
is kind of a tangent,

00:26:52.946 --> 00:26:55.890
but there's something...

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:59.160
Universal is a strong
word to use in an audience

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.210
that might not include anthropologists.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:04.390
But I think there's a
kind of topography of mind

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.820
in which there's thing kind of a continuum

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:11.460
of thought phenomena which
are better candidates

00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:16.460
for being non-self-authored
thoughts than others.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.300
Dreams, we know, are good
candidates for not coming

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.100
from yourself but from
coming from some other source

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.270
around the world.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.810
And I think this sense
that, when a thought pops

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.750
into your mind, or it's
spontaneous, or it's loud,

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:32.790
I think we will find
that that is very common

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.960
around the world as being a candidate

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.210
for a non-self-authored thought.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.593
But in any event, this
is they way they talked.

00:27:39.593 --> 00:27:42.050
And it was very clearly
that people were doing

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:43.300
imaginal dialogues.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.585
So this is the guy in Accra
who was most comfortable

00:27:46.585 --> 00:27:48.485
with imaginal dialogues.

00:27:48.485 --> 00:27:51.657
He says, "So I'm lying on my
bed and then I start talking

00:27:51.657 --> 00:27:52.490
"to Him.

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:53.323
"It's awesome.

00:27:53.323 --> 00:27:54.867
"I can talk to God like I'm talking to you

00:27:54.867 --> 00:27:56.897
"and, as you are responding,
even though I don't

00:27:56.897 --> 00:27:58.147
"hear your voice, it comes.

00:27:58.147 --> 00:27:59.767
"It follows a train.

00:27:59.767 --> 00:28:02.187
"A train of conversation,
what you're talking about.

00:28:02.187 --> 00:28:04.530
"So, like, I tried to
find out if it's true."

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:06.533
So here, he's trying to do discernment.

00:28:07.487 --> 00:28:09.697
"I'll ask a question, and
then God will point me

00:28:09.697 --> 00:28:11.667
"to a scripture I've never thought about.

00:28:11.667 --> 00:28:13.777
"So he leads me to this
scripture I've not thought about,

00:28:13.777 --> 00:28:15.087
"I wasn't thinking about a scripture,

00:28:15.087 --> 00:28:16.400
"it wasn't in my mind."

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.957
It pops into his mind.

00:28:17.957 --> 00:28:21.070
"I go, and the scripture
answers what I was asking."

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.597
Meaning it's really God.

00:28:22.597 --> 00:28:24.587
"I was just lying on my
bed and I was laughing

00:28:24.587 --> 00:28:26.030
"and I heard everything.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.470
And then, I really try to make sure

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.200
that it's a back and forth experience.

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.580
He's very clear, it is.

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:35.979
So here's his counterpart
in the Chicago Vineyard.

00:28:35.979 --> 00:28:38.717
She's talking to me about talking to God.

00:28:38.717 --> 00:28:41.327
"I would go get some food,
go out and sit by the lake

00:28:41.327 --> 00:28:43.247
"and eat my food and just, God and I would

00:28:43.247 --> 00:28:46.488
"have conversations about
I like to say His children.

00:28:46.488 --> 00:28:49.217
"Like, if we were dating
and He had children

00:28:49.217 --> 00:28:51.467
"and I didn't, I'd want
to know how his children

00:28:51.467 --> 00:28:52.307
"were doing.

00:28:52.307 --> 00:28:55.307
"And so, you know, I'd ask
him how's such and such

00:28:55.307 --> 00:28:56.517
"going with Drew?

00:28:56.517 --> 00:28:58.947
"How's such and such going with Christy?

00:28:58.947 --> 00:29:00.597
"You know, those sorts of things.

00:29:00.597 --> 00:29:02.537
"I really, really hope that you saving up

00:29:02.537 --> 00:29:04.597
"for their college tuition kind of idea,

00:29:04.597 --> 00:29:06.727
"because, you know, I really
hope you're doing that

00:29:06.727 --> 00:29:08.067
"in their lives.

00:29:08.067 --> 00:29:10.557
"And then, you know, we'd
go out to this relationship

00:29:10.557 --> 00:29:11.900
"with me as his child...",

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.920
and then, she talks of Him.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.520
So those are both clearly
imaginal dialogues

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.290
and, in ways, they're very
similar to each other.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.322
But, also, they're quite different.

00:29:22.322 --> 00:29:24.450
And it seemed to me that the differences

00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.830
between the two of those
echoed the differences

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:31.640
I found between the Vineyard
congregants, in general,

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.570
and the Accra, and the Daniel
Institute pastoral students,

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.470
in general.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:40.440
In general, in Accra, the
back and forth dialogue

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.743
was less playful.

00:29:41.743 --> 00:29:45.314
It was, literally, less back and forth.

00:29:45.314 --> 00:29:48.240
God would talk less frequently.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.170
He would less people modeled...

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:52.272
Less, like, well, I want to the movies.

00:29:52.272 --> 00:29:54.680
I want to talk to you about the kids.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.513
How is Christy doing?

00:29:55.513 --> 00:29:57.330
Okay, you tell me how Christy's doing.

00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:59.910
They didn't really talk like that.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:02.440
God seemed more distant in some sense.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.823
The sense of hierarchy and authority

00:30:04.823 --> 00:30:07.420
was more starkly modeled.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:10.680
Now, that was very clear in the Vineyard.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.431
With the Vineyard congregants,

00:30:12.431 --> 00:30:15.420
the mightiness of God seemed to coexist

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.460
with this intimate buddy-buddy-ness.

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:19.078
That was less true in Accra.

00:30:19.078 --> 00:30:24.078
And no one ever pretended
to experience in order to...

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:26.410
Nobody ever pretended that God was present

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.680
in order to experience as real.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.300
One of the things that C. S. Lewis

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.800
does in Mere Christianity,

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.950
which is one of his best,
most widely-read books

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.130
about Christianity.

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.198
Widely read by Evangelical Christian.

00:30:38.198 --> 00:30:42.350
He says, "Pretend in order
to experience as real."

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:45.699
I never heard that sentiment
expressed in Accra.

00:30:45.699 --> 00:30:48.690
Instead, when people
talked about imagination,

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.140
they were much more pragmatic.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.676
So this man says to me,

00:30:52.676 --> 00:30:54.627
"What you see is what you get.

00:30:54.627 --> 00:30:57.117
"What you see yourself do
is what you can achieve.

00:30:57.117 --> 00:30:58.367
"If you can imagine,

00:30:58.367 --> 00:31:00.605
"what you imagine is what you become."

00:31:00.605 --> 00:31:03.400
And there's a sense that
imagination is very important.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.870
Because you can imagine
yourself as a better

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:08.020
and more-successful person.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:11.147
And there's a line in the Proverbs,

00:31:11.147 --> 00:31:14.030
"As a man thinketh in
his heart, so is he."

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.030
I heard that from, I'm going to guess,

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.230
two-thirds of my Accra pastoral
students at some point.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.980
It just courses through my interviews

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.936
with pastors and with other people.

00:31:23.936 --> 00:31:26.520
I never heard it expressed in America.

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.360
Doesn't mean it's not important.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.383
I was just struck by the
sense that the way you think,

00:31:31.383 --> 00:31:32.850
it really is important.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:36.689
It wasn't, the mind is
not this ephemeral fluff,

00:31:36.689 --> 00:31:39.943
as it's more represented in this country.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:44.370
So it seemed to me that imagination

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:46.785
was not about fostering creativity.

00:31:46.785 --> 00:31:48.450
It was about who you wanted to be

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:49.530
in the world.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:51.910
It was also true that, in general,

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:55.590
the goal of prayer in Accra
was much more pragmatic.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:57.410
People talked about money.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:59.644
They talked about the
health of their family.

00:31:59.644 --> 00:32:02.650
Americans talked about feelings.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.420
And just to give you a
feel of these differences,

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.657
this is a young man in Accra who says,

00:32:07.657 --> 00:32:10.067
"Basically, I pray concerning needs."

00:32:10.067 --> 00:32:10.971
"What kind of needs?"

00:32:10.971 --> 00:32:13.007
"Probably, maybe my family's going through

00:32:13.007 --> 00:32:15.127
"a hard time, so I seek the face of God

00:32:15.127 --> 00:32:17.417
"and I ask God to intervene."

00:32:17.417 --> 00:32:20.517
"So do you pray for your own
emotional needs?", I say.

00:32:20.517 --> 00:32:23.977
"I want to be rich, so I ask
God for wisdom, knowledge,

00:32:23.977 --> 00:32:25.717
"understanding, and knowing how to be good

00:32:25.717 --> 00:32:28.717
"to go about things, which
will promote the productivity

00:32:28.717 --> 00:32:30.061
"and result in it."

00:32:30.061 --> 00:32:31.850
So then, as a contrast,

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.480
this is the kind of
thing that the Americans

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.757
said to me.

00:32:34.757 --> 00:32:37.137
"It's just like talking to a therapist.

00:32:37.137 --> 00:32:38.890
"Especially, in the beginning..."

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:39.847
When talking to God.

00:32:39.847 --> 00:32:41.907
"Especially, in the beginning
when you're revealing things

00:32:41.907 --> 00:32:44.117
"that are deep in your
heart and deep in your soul,

00:32:44.117 --> 00:32:46.890
"the things that have been
pushed down and denied."

00:32:46.890 --> 00:32:47.817
Somebody else:

00:32:47.817 --> 00:32:48.857
"You have all these thoughts,

00:32:48.857 --> 00:32:50.947
"and they all get tangled up.

00:32:50.947 --> 00:32:52.377
"Prayer's almost like housekeeping,

00:32:52.377 --> 00:32:54.537
"like your room's really
messy and you're cleaning it.

00:32:54.537 --> 00:32:56.610
"It's like you gain a perspective."

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:58.300
One of the things I want
to draw your attention to

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:00.606
in that description is
that this young woman

00:33:00.606 --> 00:33:03.150
doesn't think that she
want to take thoughts

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:04.290
out of her head.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.500
She thinks she has many
complicated, tangled thoughts.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:10.020
She wants to get them
a little more orderly

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.210
so they don't arouse such anxiety in her.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:15.904
The Accra Christians will talk
about this quite differently.

00:33:15.904 --> 00:33:18.753
Evil was much more important in Accra.

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:23.020
When you see people in church,

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.465
this is evident.

00:33:24.465 --> 00:33:27.195
Prayer becomes not only
a way of connecting

00:33:27.195 --> 00:33:31.120
to God, but a weapon with
which you can fight evil.

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:33.130
And to give you a feel of this,

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:35.310
I thought I would share with you

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.380
a chunk out of my field
notes from something

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.080
called Jericho Hour.

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:41.767
So Jericho Hour is a three-hour event.

00:33:41.767 --> 00:33:44.040
For Thursday mornings, nine to twelve,

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.000
every week at one of the
big Evangelical churches,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.720
one of these new charismatics churches.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.620
And the whole point of
the church is to break

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:55.540
the bounds of ancestral oppression,

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.880
and to prevent witches who might,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.940
or evils, or demons, or
bad things in the world

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:02.290
that might be oppressing you,

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.763
from getting into your life.

00:34:05.204 --> 00:34:06.554
So here are my field notes.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.006
It's the pastor, he says,

00:34:09.006 --> 00:34:09.997
"In the name of Jesus today,

00:34:09.997 --> 00:34:12.850
"I declare any being,
spirit, or witchcraft

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:14.670
who wants to take from me my name,

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:16.644
I destroy in the name of Jesus today."

00:34:16.644 --> 00:34:19.070
People are intensely speaking in tongues.

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:20.967
And the pastor says,
"Don't stop, don't stop.

00:34:20.967 --> 00:34:21.807
"Pray!

00:34:21.807 --> 00:34:23.227
"Let the Lord show you his power.

00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:24.060
"Pray!

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:24.893
"Don't stop. Don't stop.

00:34:24.893 --> 00:34:26.390
"Let the Lord deliver you."

00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:27.677
And we all said together,

00:34:27.677 --> 00:34:30.127
"In the name of Jesus, every strong enemy,

00:34:30.127 --> 00:34:32.867
"by witchcraft, resisting, I defy by fire.

00:34:32.867 --> 00:34:33.700
"Out, out!

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:35.060
"Don't stop."

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.047
And, "Out of my marriage.

00:34:37.047 --> 00:34:37.957
"Out of our business.

00:34:37.957 --> 00:34:39.030
"Don't stop."

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.470
And the crowd was, like,
there's 5000 people.

00:34:41.470 --> 00:34:42.480
They're jumping up and down.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.470
They're shaking their fists.

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:45.030
They're shouting this.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:46.787
And, "Let the Lord deliver me

00:34:46.787 --> 00:34:47.947
"from any strong enemy!

00:34:47.947 --> 00:34:48.780
"By witchcraft!

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.897
"Enemies of the marriage of the house,

00:34:49.897 --> 00:34:50.917
"of the business!

00:34:50.917 --> 00:34:54.030
"Witches will die, die, die!"

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:56.130
So this doesn't happen, in my experience,

00:34:56.130 --> 00:34:56.963
in the Vineyard.

00:34:56.963 --> 00:34:57.796
(audience laughs)

00:34:57.796 --> 00:34:58.630
It is true.

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:00.120
What's complicated about this

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.070
and sort of hard to wrap my mind around

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:05.030
is that evil's actually really important

00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:08.253
in Evangelical churches
in American Christianity.

00:35:10.313 --> 00:35:12.540
If you're going to take
the Gospel seriously,

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.680
you have to take demons seriously because

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.921
Jesus spends a lot of his
time getting rid of them.

00:35:16.921 --> 00:35:19.693
And people will tell you
that demons are real.

00:35:19.693 --> 00:35:23.180
But in my experience,
although, my churches

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.190
were on the edges of
university communities,

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.423
people under the Americans setting,

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.350
that evil wasn't so salient.

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.940
Where it is extremely
salient in these churches

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:36.773
in Accra.

00:35:36.773 --> 00:35:38.040
In fact, people will make the argument

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.090
that the reasons that
the churches are doing

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:42.380
so well is that they give people tools

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:45.283
to fight the presence
of evil in their lives.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:48.878
When I talked to the students in Accra,

00:35:48.878 --> 00:35:52.188
they were clear that thoughts could damage

00:35:52.188 --> 00:35:54.490
the world at a distance.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:56.420
There was no, it wasn't that thoughts

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.350
were mere stuff that
passed through your mind

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:00.860
and was ephemeral.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:03.905
Anger and envy that could
leak out of your mind

00:36:03.905 --> 00:36:05.430
and cause people real damage.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.461
And they could cause this damage even

00:36:08.461 --> 00:36:11.510
if you weren't intending to cause damage.

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:14.480
The folks who did intend
to cause damage could

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.180
really cause a lot of damage.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.363
So there's this model,
there's a man who says

00:36:18.363 --> 00:36:20.627
these witches are sorcerers.

00:36:20.627 --> 00:36:22.137
"The project in their minds.

00:36:22.137 --> 00:36:23.747
"They could even close their minds

00:36:23.747 --> 00:36:25.287
"and they're so powerful that thoughts

00:36:25.287 --> 00:36:28.254
"will leave their minds and
go out and hurt somebody."

00:36:28.254 --> 00:36:32.160
The first time I sat with
my research assistant

00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:34.200
and said, "So what do
you do when you pray?"

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.290
She said, "I take bad
thoughts out of my mind."

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.780
As if she could sort of
physically pick them up

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.500
and take them out of her mind.

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.770
As if they were almost
physical things in the mind

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:46.470
that she could remove.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:50.511
And the man who I quoted
at the top continues,

00:36:50.511 --> 00:36:53.677
"I want the kind of mind
that's very positive

00:36:53.677 --> 00:36:55.477
"and a kind of mind that's very conscious

00:36:55.477 --> 00:37:00.150
"of God's presence, knowing
that God is beside me."

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:02.200
One of the things that is really striking

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:06.667
in these interviews is
that, not everybody,

00:37:06.667 --> 00:37:11.667
but many, many people do
not, many people believe

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.260
that if you are a good
Christian, many people in Accra,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.720
if you are a good Christian,

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.450
you could get envy and
anger out of your mind.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.500
You would just pop it out.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.610
Whereas, the Americans,
that's so antagonistic

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.510
to sort of this kind of
widely-shared Freudian model

00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:32.020
that we have that we
are full of conflicting

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.100
negative feelings and
our challenge is learning

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.106
how to manage in the
face of our complicated,

00:37:39.106 --> 00:37:41.758
contradictory feelings.

00:37:41.758 --> 00:37:45.370
The Vineyard Christians
in the United States

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.830
also thought very differently
about sin in my experience.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:50.880
So here is Easter morning at the Vineyard.

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.937
The associate pastor, he says,

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:56.317
"Shame comes when we
become aware of our own sin

00:37:56.317 --> 00:37:58.007
"and also the sin that's done to us,

00:37:58.007 --> 00:38:00.109
"the wrong things done to us that hurt us.

00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:03.737
"When I feel shame, it feels
like I'm a dirty little crow

00:38:03.737 --> 00:38:06.037
"in a room full of fancy flamingos,

00:38:06.037 --> 00:38:09.110
"marked by whatever is dirty
and bad and worthless."

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:11.340
That's quite a striking image.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:14.940
I feel dirty when I feel shame.

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:17.110
So how does the resurrection of Christ

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.740
reverse that within me and within you?

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.177
And her basic answer was,

00:38:21.177 --> 00:38:23.577
"If you believe, it will happen.

00:38:23.577 --> 00:38:26.507
"When I see the shame and guilt within me

00:38:26.507 --> 00:38:28.037
"and I ask Jesus for help,

00:38:28.037 --> 00:38:32.150
"He takes it for me and
He dies it on the cross."

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:34.170
That's what Jesus does.

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.610
That he needs you to
take these bad feelings

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:39.930
that you have inside of you
that make you feel so dirty

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:42.200
in a room full of fancy flamingos,

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.280
and He helps you to get rid of them.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.490
So I was thinking about
meeting the expectations

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:50.430
of the Foerster lecture in
talking about immortality,

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.850
and I thought I would share
these two representations

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:56.731
of Heaven and the Vineyard
Christian Fellowship

00:38:56.731 --> 00:39:01.731
in Chicago, the United
States, and in Accra.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:07.950
So what Vineyard prayer
deliver the prayer towards?

00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:12.570
When I joined the church in the South Bay,

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.640
and I joined a year-long prayer group

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.280
in which we were going to
pray systematically together

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.260
and talk about the experience of prayer.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.420
I was given a story called
the Monk and the Samurai.

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:24.690
And some of you may know this story.

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:28.440
A samurai, a warrior, comes to a monk

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.180
and he asks the monk, "Tell
me about Heaven and Hell."

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.907
And the monk says, "You
disgusting samurai warrior.

00:39:35.907 --> 00:39:39.007
"You just fill me with contempt.

00:39:39.007 --> 00:39:41.650
"I can't believe you'd ask
me about this question."

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.739
The samurai's filled with rage.

00:39:43.739 --> 00:39:47.380
He lifts up his sword to strike the monk

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.100
and the monk says, "That's Hell."

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.390
And the samurai then lowers his sword.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:56.684
He feels moved and amazed
and overwhelmed with the joy

00:39:56.684 --> 00:40:00.050
that a monk would possibly
sacrifice his life

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.650
to teach him about Heaven and Hell.

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.500
And then, the monk says, "That's Heaven."

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.970
So this was given to me
as a way of representing

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:13.000
what I would experience as
a result of participating

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.060
in this prayer group.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.040
And the way that I
caricature it is by saying,

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:19.500
and this is not true, this is
not what the pastor would say.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.700
But I would caricature this
by saying that Heaven and Hell

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.727
are within you, and that
if you know Jesus rightly,

00:40:26.727 --> 00:40:29.710
your feelings would be soothed.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:34.440
You would be delivered into
a state of comfort and ease

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:36.780
on earth today.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:39.360
I don't know if this is exactly,

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.340
if this actually takes place in Accra.

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.400
But there's a scene that I
saw in these Accra churches.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.190
This comes at the end of
a service, and a member

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.990
of the congregation, people
are holding up envelopes

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:54.540
filled with money and they
are marching to the front

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.230
of the sanctuary to hand over the money,

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:03.110
and they are seeding a miracle.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.300
They're giving over this
money and it's going

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.500
to come back a hundredfold.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.940
And one of my lasting memories
of going to church services,

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:14.720
and you can see that, it's
easy to see this on YouTube,

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.920
as well, the pastors would
prophecy over the grow,

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.057
and they'll say, "I
see 11 sets of car keys

00:41:21.057 --> 00:41:22.997
"that are coming to people in this room.

00:41:22.997 --> 00:41:25.167
"I see people owning their own houses.

00:41:25.167 --> 00:41:29.110
"I see one of you owning all
the houses on your block."

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:32.600
And so this is often
described and is caricatured

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.290
from the American perspective
as a prosperity gospel.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:39.480
Come to church, Jesus
will deliver stuff to you.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.900
And that's certainly truly present.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:47.900
I think of this, though,
as a way of more asserting

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:52.630
that if you go to church and
if you take Jesus seriously,

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:56.090
it will change who you
are in public space.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:57.870
There was a sense that you were asked

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:59.700
in a church like this again and again

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:03.390
to present yourself as a choosing agent.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:04.810
You choose Jesus.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:06.310
You stand for Jesus.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:08.030
You believe in Jesus.

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:11.550
And this constant choice
is what protects you

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:14.700
from evil, aligns you with God,

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:17.600
and delivers to you comfort on earth.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.010
But it is more a social comfort.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:22.440
It's a way about being
a person of authority

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:27.100
and stature in the world rather
than a feel-good happiness.

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:30.750
And, again, I'm sure the
pastors would not be comfortable

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.490
quite with the way that I framed it,

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:37.007
but that's what I saw
in these interactions.

00:42:37.007 --> 00:42:40.110
You could say that these
differences have to do

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:42.440
with socioeconomic and
political differences

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:45.132
and you would absolutely be correct.

00:42:45.132 --> 00:42:48.780
There are some very
concrete reason why people

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.200
in Accra would want money.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.310
They don't have a lot of money.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:53.800
It's a very poor city.

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.360
Even though these are
middle-class communities,

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.540
it makes sense that people want jobs.

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.300
It's also true that these are congregants

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.003
in desperate need of a
better political order.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.093
I think when Ghana became independent,

00:43:14.816 --> 00:43:17.950
its economic standing
per capita was on the

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:19.710
same level as Singapore's.

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:22.010
And, obviously, those
countries have diverged.

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.610
There are good reasons to feel that people

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:28.161
are reaching out for a
better political order.

00:43:28.161 --> 00:43:31.150
And one very straightforward
way of explaining

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:35.440
the appeal of these groups
is that the traditional

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.630
African religion is a
religion which highly

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:45.997
valorizes and leads your
attention to the presence

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.630
of evil in the world.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.760
One of the things that these
new charismatic churches do

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.280
is to give you the
tools to fight that evil

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.180
so you're protected and
you do not have to suffer

00:43:57.180 --> 00:44:00.190
what other people who are
without jobs are suffering.

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:02.087
And that's all true.

00:44:02.087 --> 00:44:05.430
But I also think there's
a story about the way

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.620
in which people think about their minds

00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:11.050
and the way it shapes
their spiritual experience.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.800
So compared to the US sample,

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.973
I thought that what I saw was that

00:44:15.973 --> 00:44:19.260
the mind/world boundary was more porous.

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:23.470
That bad feelings move out of
your mind and into the world

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:25.020
and zap people.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.740
I thought I saw that
feelings were the interiority

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:32.430
that we just celebrate and
cherish in this country.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:36.163
It was just much less
salient for these students.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.720
Unless it's envy and anger and
people are really interested

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.420
in envy and anger.

00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:46.530
And the fantastic imagination,
walking with a great fluffy

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:49.280
lion by your side, just was not important

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.850
to these Accra students,

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.720
and to anything I could see in the story

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:55.450
of the new charismatic churches.

00:44:55.450 --> 00:44:59.780
Imagination achieves a
practical outcome in the world

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:04.780
and there's a sense in the act of prayer

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:06.980
that words are not fluff.

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:10.240
They are, in some ways,
more real in the world.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:13.220
Your choice of Jesus is
more real in the world

00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:15.623
than it is in the American setting.

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:21.290
So just to persuade you
that there is something

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:24.450
about the mind that's
shaping spiritual experience

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:27.050
going on, I thought I
would walk you through four

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:30.683
of what I'm going to call
William James Experiences.

00:45:30.683 --> 00:45:34.080
Hallucinations, the
bodily experience of God,

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.610
out of body experiences,
and sleep paralysis.

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:39.590
And talk to you about the
ways is which congregants

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:42.010
in the two different
communities talked about

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.690
these experiences when
I asked them questions.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:49.380
And my comparison set here is
from some experimental work

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:52.370
I did in the Bay Area
where I brought 34...

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.890
I brought well over a
hundred people into my office

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.910
and randomized them to prayer
versus non-prayer practices

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:00.280
and saw what happened.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.190
But before I did that, we talked to them

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:06.190
at considerable length about
their spiritual experience.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:10.130
34 of that group came from
a Vineyard Fellowship.

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:13.900
And so, I'm going to
compare what they said,

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.230
what the pastoral students said,

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:17.930
and in the back of my mind,

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:20.610
I have my experience
with the Chicago Vineyard

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.850
and I also am the kind of professor

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:25.960
that hands out surveys and questionaires

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.290
to my undergraduates.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:30.440
And so, I have a lot of little
pieces of data to compare.

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:33.620
So let begin by talking
about hallucinations.

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.461
It seems to me pretty
clear that the audible,

00:46:36.461 --> 00:46:40.640
that the audible voice, hearing
a voice when you're alone,

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:43.520
or hearing a voice when
nobody else is present,

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:46.030
is more common in Accra.

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:48.660
At least, that's what
the evidence suggests.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:52.290
So when I sat with people
in the United States

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.675
and said, "Have you ever
heard God speak audibly?"

00:46:57.675 --> 00:47:02.240
You know, roughly a seventh
of our Vineyard sample

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:03.213
said yes.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.070
Six out of 15 folks in Accra said yes.

00:47:07.070 --> 00:47:10.200
Not only that but three our
of 15 said that they heard

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.040
God's voice audibly several times a week.

00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.456
That's pretty unusual.

00:47:14.456 --> 00:47:16.057
They were not psychotic.

00:47:16.057 --> 00:47:19.640
They were more willing
to describe themselves

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.905
as having this hallucinatory experience.

00:47:22.905 --> 00:47:25.040
I gave people pen and paper,

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.460
I gave people surveys,
questionaires to fill out and,

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.800
in my class, or my Daniel Institute folks.

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.603
60% of them said that they
had heard a voice when alone.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:41.193
50% of my US sample did.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.890
I give these questionaires
to undergraduates.

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.670
Even more striking
difference because I had

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:50.050
my research assistant go
into the University of Legon,

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:51.510
and hand out questionaires.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:53.427
Many more people willing to say that they

00:47:53.427 --> 00:47:55.500
has heard an audible voice.

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.550
I gave people a different
kind of questionaire

00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.780
that asks in many different kinds of ways

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:02.870
about whether they've had
unusual auditory experiences.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:05.780
Much more likely to be the case in Accra

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.030
that people say yes.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:11.070
And I wanted to share with you a snippet

00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:12.080
of one of my interviews.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.110
This was with a young
woman and we're talking

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.727
about hearing God speak.

00:48:15.727 --> 00:48:17.677
"Have you ever heard God speaks in a way

00:48:17.677 --> 00:48:19.747
"that you can hear with your ears?"

00:48:19.747 --> 00:48:20.847
"Yes." she said.

00:48:20.847 --> 00:48:24.164
"Yes, many times it's
his word confirmed to me.

00:48:24.164 --> 00:48:27.720
"I hear somebody say the word in my ears."

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.817
So, you know, here's your
perseverative anthropologist.

00:48:31.817 --> 00:48:33.627
"Okay, how commonly does it feel

00:48:33.627 --> 00:48:35.117
"that that's actually auditory?

00:48:35.117 --> 00:48:37.420
"So that you would hear
it with your ears?"

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:39.080
And she does something very interesting.

00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.601
She says, "As soon as
I'm conscious of it."

00:48:41.601 --> 00:48:44.880
And so, I leap in, assuming
this is like the way

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.713
Americans talk.

00:48:45.713 --> 00:48:46.546
"It stops?"

00:48:46.546 --> 00:48:48.490
And she says, "No, as soon
as I'm conscious of it.

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:50.667
"When I'm conscious that
I'm hearing God speak,

00:48:50.667 --> 00:48:51.795
"I hear it."

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:54.367
And then, I say, "Oh, then
it pops out and becomes

00:48:54.367 --> 00:48:55.260
"more auditory?"

00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.800
And she says, "Yes."

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.532
So these unusual sensory
experiences are really interesting.

00:49:00.532 --> 00:49:05.532
I cannot say to any of you,
hear God speak audibly.

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.040
But I can invite you
to have an experience.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.490
I can invite you to pay attention

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.949
to your unusual sensory experience.

00:49:13.949 --> 00:49:17.513
You know, after a while,
over the next six months,

00:49:17.513 --> 00:49:20.230
a couple of you, maybe five or six,

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.530
will have some kind of odd auditory

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:24.270
hearing-voice experience.

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:27.000
There's something that's
involved in learning

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.070
and the way that people come
to report these experiences.

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:33.480
And there seems to be more
willingness to pay attention

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.610
to them and to report
them in my Accra group.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:39.680
Bodily experience of prayer.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.940
So these of three kinds
of phenomena that often

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:44.200
travel together.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:46.430
People are overwhelmed by emotion.

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:47.320
They start praying.

00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.780
They start crying, crying, crying.

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:49.990
They can't stop.

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:51.630
Or they feel really, really weak

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.140
and they have to sit down.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.330
Or they feel like there's
an adrenalin rush.

00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:57.420
And sometimes people do more of the crying

00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:59.660
and sometimes people
do more of the shaking.

00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.780
But there are things
that you see happening

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:03.600
in a congregation.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.600
So the Americans like to do this stuff

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.050
in a church like the Vineyard.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:10.260
They love to do it in Accra.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:12.440
So it was visibly
evident to me that people

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.377
did more of this bodily
experience of God stuff

00:50:15.377 --> 00:50:20.137
in these congregations
in which I saw thousands

00:50:20.137 --> 00:50:22.251
of people worshiping God.

00:50:22.251 --> 00:50:27.251
In Accra, it was clearly
evident in the interviews

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:29.551
that people liked doing this stuff.

00:50:29.551 --> 00:50:32.840
And what I found really striking, also,

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.757
was that the more people talked about,

00:50:36.757 --> 00:50:40.160
the more people talked
about loving to experience

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.200
God in their body, the more they reported

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.910
a vivid back and forth
imaginal dialogue with God.

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:50.260
And that relation did not hold up,

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:53.040
that was not true in my American sample.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:54.570
There's something much more physical

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:57.468
about the experience of God in Accra.

00:50:57.468 --> 00:50:59.310
Out of body experience.

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:02.190
So, technically, these
are they experiences

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:05.870
that you can generate by
just stimulating the brain

00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:07.600
when somebody is on a laboratory table.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.830
These are experiences when
people feel themselves

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.570
not in their body, and
sometimes they turn around

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:16.000
and they see themselves.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.860
So none of you has probably
had one of these experiences.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.680
We don't know exactly how common they are

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.256
in the general population.

00:51:24.256 --> 00:51:27.420
But it was really clear
that there was a different

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.990
degree of interest in
having those experiences

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:33.551
among the Accra students
and the Vineyard group.

00:51:33.551 --> 00:51:38.551
So with my Americans,
the idea that your mind

00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:42.160
should leave your body and
that you could turn around

00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.290
and look at yourself, my
Americans thought that

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.020
was a totally neat idea.

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.890
40% of them said that they'd
had an experience like that.

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:50.920
That's pretty unlikely.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:55.920
But looking at what they aid,
maybe 20% had an experience

00:51:56.126 --> 00:51:59.470
that was like an out of body experience.

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:02.920
My Accra students were
horrified by the idea.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.560
Only one of them said that
they'd had such an experience

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.670
and, to her, it was a
sign that she was dying.

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.270
And, in fact, ethnographically,
leaving your body

00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:15.183
is associated with death in this world.

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:17.930
Sleep paralysis.

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:20.100
Being awake but unable to move.

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:22.213
So this is an event in the world.

00:52:22.213 --> 00:52:24.650
Roughly a quarter of Americans
report this experience

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:25.826
at some point.

00:52:25.826 --> 00:52:28.810
These are these moments when you wake up.

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:29.710
It's the middle of the night.

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:31.660
Typically, you're sleeping on your back.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.970
And you can't move.

00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:35.080
It's pretty freaky.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.040
You feel as if there's a
heavy weight on your chest.

00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.900
Often, there's something
clutching your throat.

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:41.620
And, often, you feel as if
there's an evil presence

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.453
in the room.

00:52:42.453 --> 00:52:45.023
These experience are reported
in at least 30 cultures.

00:52:45.023 --> 00:52:46.916
We know they're out there.

00:52:46.916 --> 00:52:50.065
About a third of the
Americans in my little sample

00:52:50.065 --> 00:52:52.820
reported that they'd
had such an experience.

00:52:52.820 --> 00:52:55.140
Again, it's about the American rate.

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:57.657
And half of them dismissed it.

00:52:57.657 --> 00:52:59.053
"Yeah, but I was overtired.

00:53:02.061 --> 00:53:05.090
"It was kind of trippy but it
wasn't anything spiritual."

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:07.720
If the American identified
it as the presence

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:10.131
of a demon, then the American went on

00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:14.140
at much greater length and
they would talk about it.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.910
Accra, over two-thirds of the sample

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:18.740
report sleep paralysis.

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.890
And this is, and there a
couple of other sources

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:22.860
of data that will support this.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.210
And they talk about it at length.

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:26.797
So here's a man who says,

00:53:26.797 --> 00:53:27.927
"I laid down one night.

00:53:27.927 --> 00:53:29.657
"I felt a heavy presence in the room.

00:53:29.657 --> 00:53:32.100
"It was so heavy and it fell on me..."

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:32.947
This is a woman, actually.

00:53:32.947 --> 00:53:35.297
"The thing held my next down
and held by belly button

00:53:35.297 --> 00:53:36.130
"like that.

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:36.963
"The think was like this.

00:53:36.963 --> 00:53:38.517
"And I felt the finger of the thing

00:53:38.517 --> 00:53:40.327
"and it was pressing me down.

00:53:40.327 --> 00:53:42.697
"As such, the room became heavy.

00:53:42.697 --> 00:53:44.740
"I said, 'Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!',

00:53:45.587 --> 00:53:46.930
"and it just lifted."

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:49.005
So this is one of the shorter examples

00:53:49.005 --> 00:53:53.083
because the others
wouldn't fit on the page.

00:53:54.010 --> 00:53:57.080
So I think that there's a story here.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:00.280
I think there's a story
about a different theory

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:03.450
of mine, and by this, I
mean a local set of ideas

00:54:03.450 --> 00:54:06.460
about how the mind is
constituted and whether

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.650
it's separate from the world,

00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:09.370
and whether thoughts are real in the world

00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:11.510
the way the tables and chair are real.

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:15.430
And I think that helps to
explain these phenomena.

00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:18.731
So I think the fact that there is this,

00:54:18.731 --> 00:54:23.185
the mind/world boundary's more porous

00:54:23.185 --> 00:54:26.790
and anger and envy can
leak out and cause damage.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.630
I think that helps to
explain the fact that

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:31.800
an adult's mind in Accra, I think,

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:33.630
is more connected to the body.

00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:35.680
So the idea of losing the mind and having

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:37.280
the mind separate from the body, I think,

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:40.460
is just freakily scary
to these Accra students

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.060
in a way that is not to Americans

00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:44.460
who were totally happy with
the idea that their mind

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:47.280
can go zipping around and going
hunting on the astral plane

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:48.523
or doing whatever else.

00:54:49.387 --> 00:54:53.290
Americans, they really
talk about their feelings.

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:57.220
In Accra, it makes sense
that the bodily experience

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:59.930
of God is so much more
important because the body,

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:02.730
in some sense, counts
more than the feelings.

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:04.740
There's something that makes sense

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.560
about the sense of evil
being more important,

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:10.270
more salient, and feeling the evil more in

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:12.180
your body and maybe reporting

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.483
more sleep paralysis experiences.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:19.500
And I think that
hallucinations are more common

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:22.300
because there's more...

00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:27.320
I think the people are
less committed to this idea

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:31.400
of a radical boundary between
the mind and the world.

00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:33.680
They're also a little bit
more committed to the sense

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:36.070
that the words are somehow
real in the world and maybe

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:39.713
they have their own own realness.

00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:44.320
In any event, I think there's a story here

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.840
about the anthropology
of mind and imagination

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:50.058
that I know Charles Hirschkind and others

00:55:50.058 --> 00:55:52.440
on this campus are
involved when I see them

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:54.758
as part of this general project.

00:55:54.758 --> 00:55:57.660
My goal is to identify dimensions

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.650
of this cultural phenomenon
which is the local

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:02.750
theory of mind, the way
in which you could think

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:04.863
about the structure of your mind.

00:56:04.863 --> 00:56:08.095
And I think there are real
psychological consquences

00:56:08.095 --> 00:56:12.097
from these different ideas about the mind.

00:56:12.097 --> 00:56:16.319
And the way I frame this,
or the way I'm seeking

00:56:16.319 --> 00:56:18.870
to frame this is in terms of social

00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:21.110
or cultural kindling.

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:24.483
So we know that psychiatric
illness, for example,

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:28.780
varies according to the
way that this culture

00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:32.060
imagines psychiatric symptoms.

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:35.910
It also varies according
to whether you have had

00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:39.160
an experience before, you're
more likely to have it again.

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:42.486
So the classic example, where
the term social kindling

00:56:42.486 --> 00:56:44.963
actually rises from, is depression.

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.580
The first time that
somebody has an experience

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:50.980
of major depressive disorder,

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.290
chances are something lousy
has happened in their life.

00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:55.280
They've gotten divorced.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.380
They've lost a job.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.880
Something really bad has happened.

00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:02.650
It doesn't take as much
blow for that person

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:05.177
to develop major depressive
disorder the next time.

00:57:05.177 --> 00:57:09.410
It's as if the pathways
in their neural pathways

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:12.250
are more tightly connected so there's more

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:14.880
of an invitation to respond again,

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:17.070
the way you respond the first time.

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:21.270
And psychiatric
anthropologists have been able

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:22.560
to demonstrate that there are different

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:24.500
patterns in the way that
people, for example,

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:26.790
feel depression in their body.

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:29.790
Maybe people are more
likely to feel joint pain

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:31.366
rather than sadness.

00:57:31.366 --> 00:57:34.310
I think that the story
of spiritual experience

00:57:34.310 --> 00:57:37.690
is going to come out in
a similar kind of way.

00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:40.830
That the way that we think
about about our minds

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:42.690
will shape the way that we pay attention

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:44.230
to mental events.

00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:47.610
And that the way that we
attend to these events

00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:50.010
will change the way we experience them

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.630
and that there will be
sort of a cascade effect

00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:55.787
in which people are more likely to report

00:57:55.787 --> 00:57:58.860
these powerful unusual experiences

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.460
in ways that are shaped
by their expectations

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.620
about the mind.

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:04.350
So let me leave it there.

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:05.610
Thank you very much.

00:58:05.610 --> 00:58:08.777
(audience applauding)
