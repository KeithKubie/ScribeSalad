PRESENTER: Good
afternoon, and welcome

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.490
to Talks at Google in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.860
Today, it's my
privilege to introduce

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.630
two extraordinary individuals--
Professor Lani Guinier and Dr.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.700
Debra Bial.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.760
Among many other things,
both are fierce advocates

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.870
of equal educational
opportunity for all.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.220
Deborah Bial was
MacArthur Fellow in 2007.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.710
She is an education
strategist who

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.730
addresses the
challenges of college

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.260
access for under-represented
populations

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.270
by identifying and fostering
latent talent and opening

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.540
opportunities for them to
pursue higher education.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.010
Through her Posse
Foundation, which

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.480
is funded in part by Google,
she offers an alternative model

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.000
for identifying promising young
people from less advantaged

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.180
urban environments.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.330
Promising students are invited
to join a Posse-- a small group

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.300
that participates in an
eight-month pre-collegiate

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.590
training program that builds
individual and team skills

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.120
and serves as an essential
social support system

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.360
once students arrive at college.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.520
She served as the founder
and president of the Posse

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.310
Foundation since 1989.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.600
She's also a founding partner of
the consulting company Firefly

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.500
Education, LLC.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.350
Lani Guinier is the
first woman of color

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.350
appointed to a tenured
professorship at Harvard Law

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.710
School.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.100
Previously, she had
been a tenured professor

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.380
at the University
of Pennsylvania,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.940
a lawyer with the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund,

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.820
Special Assistant to the
Assistant Attorney General

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.370
for Civil Rights during
the Carter Administration,

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.900
and was nominated
by President Clinton

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.480
to be the first black woman to
head the Civil Rights Division

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.600
of the Department of Justice.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.510
Professor Guinier, on behalf
of the people of United States,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.850
I apologize for how
that went-- sincerely.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.440
She is the author of
several books, most recently

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.020
"The Tyranny of the Meritocracy:
Democratizing Higher

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.500
Education in America."

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.310
And she has received
10 honorary degrees,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.220
although I suspect that
she feels equally honored

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.260
to have received awards
for teaching excellence

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.380
from both Penn and
Harvard Law Schools.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.770
Please join me in welcoming
in conversation Lani

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.082
Guinier and Deborah Bial.

00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:46.926
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.700
DEBORAH BIAL: We're just
winging this, you guys.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.100
But-- not really.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.820
We're acting like we are.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.730
I'm Debbie Bial.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.306
I run the Posse Foundation.

00:02:58.306 --> 00:02:59.930
LANI GUINIER: I'm
Lani Guinier, and I'm

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.510
a law professor who is very
fond of the Posse Foundation.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.720
DEBORAH BIAL: We're
fond of each other.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.170
We really are, actually.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.410
I admire Lani enormously.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.060
And this is the first time that
we've actually come together

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.420
to talk about an issue
that we've been dealing

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.920
with separately for decades.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.770
And what I am so
grateful to Lani for

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.660
is that she has written
extensively about an issue

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.450
that this country doesn't
talk enough about.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.000
And that is the idea that
the country was built on,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.650
which is that we're supposed
to be a meritocracy.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.200
And I work with 52 different
colleges and universities,

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.740
all elite.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.760
And those institutions
are really

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.600
gatekeepers for
young people who want

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.910
to achieve the American dream.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.250
And Lani has written
a lot about that.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.120
And you validate
what we do at Posse.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.950
And I'll talk more about that,
but I wanted to thank you,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.334
because it's an
honor to be here.

00:04:08.334 --> 00:04:09.250
LANI GUINIER: Oh, wow.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.947
DEBORAH BIAL: Thank you.

00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:13.530
LANI GUINIER: Well, I'll just
be quiet, and I'll let you talk.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.339
No, it's a privilege to be here.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:25.090
I've had a lot of opportunity
to talk to and work

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.087
with one of the former Posse
officers, Shirley Collado.

00:04:29.087 --> 00:04:29.920
DEBORAH BIAL: Right.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.630
And she was a Posse member.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.030
LANI GUINIER: Right.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.090
And she's the one who really
explained to me what it

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.410
was like to be a Posse member.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.390
And her story is so
powerful, because she's

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.010
the daughter of
a taxi driver who

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.210
was somebody who had
come to the United States

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.880
from another country.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.880
And her father was
extremely worried

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.380
that she was going to leave New
York City to go to Vanderbilt,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.270
which is in Tennessee.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.950
And so they arranged
an agreement

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.090
that she would call him or
he would call her every day--

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.680
he's a taxi driver-- at
9 o'clock or 8 o'clock,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.020
and she'd have to report to
him as to what she was doing.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.280
And it turned out,
initially, that she

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.010
thought this was intrusive.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.350
But it turned out to be very
powerful in a way of reassuring

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.580
her, because she was
in a new environment

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.520
completely without coming in
with old friends or people

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.120
who've been there before.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.110
And so the fact that
she had somebody

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.840
to look forward to to
talk to every night

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.130
was very affirming for her.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.460
She ended up doing
extraordinarily well.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.780
She ended up getting a PhD.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.180
She's now-- I'm not sure exactly
of her position at Rutgers,

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.120
but she's in a high--

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.020
DEBORAH BIAL: Executive
Vice Chancellor.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.728
LANI GUINIER: OK.

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:05.790
Executive Vice
Chancellor, who used

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.730
to rely on to her
taxicab father to move

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.030
on to the next day of her life.

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:20.190
So she's just a really good
example of the Posse program.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.620
DEBORAH BIAL: But what
Lani writes-- you guys

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.138
should all read her
book, which we have.

00:06:27.138 --> 00:06:32.115
Make the pitch at the beginning,
the middle, and the end.

00:06:32.115 --> 00:06:35.010
But Lani has a whole chapter
dedicated to this program

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.180
as an example of how we
can be thinking differently

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.710
about defining
this term "merit."

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.970
And I like to talk
about the word "merit"

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.420
because-- I don't know
how many of you went

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.480
to one of what we call the
most selective colleges

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.350
in the United
States, but there's

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.290
over 1,400 four-year colleges
in the United States.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:57.680
If you took just the top
10%, the ones that everyone

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.350
has heard of-- the
Ivy League schools,

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:01.780
and Vanderbilt, Northwestern,
and Duke, these kinds

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.280
of schools,
Middlebury-- they still

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.140
rely pretty heavily on the
SAT as a way of deciding

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.659
who's going to be admitted.

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:12.325
You're familiar.

00:07:12.325 --> 00:07:14.670
You know this idea.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.450
But in 2015, it's still
white and Asian kids

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.490
that are scoring the
best on those tests.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.330
Now, we could talk
about all the problems

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.230
and why that is the case.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.980
But here's a kid like
Shirley-- and I just

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.040
want to jump on your story a
little bit-- Shirley grew up

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.920
in Brooklyn.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.490
She's a Dominican
kid who got 800

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:40.400
combined-- I'm letting this
sink in-- combined on the math

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.540
and reading sections of the SAT.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.530
She lets us say this-- combined.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.080
She never in a
million years would've

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.820
gotten into Vanderbilt.

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.160
We get her into Vanderbilt.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.010
She graduates with honors.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:56.740
She gets her doctorate in
clinical psychology from Duke.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.630
She becomes the dean of
the college at Middlebury.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.450
And within the
next five years, I

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.740
think she's going to
be a college president.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.350
Today, those schools
that I mentioned,

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:12.530
88% of the presidents of
those schools are white men.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.600
If you look at who's in the
US Senate, 94% of our Senate

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.280
is white.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.640
Most are men.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.430
The same thing with who runs
Fortune 500 companies-- white

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.530
guys, mostly.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.940
And their Section 16
executives, white.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.910
So what we're talking
about is, well,

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.750
how do we keep going like that?

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.390
Right, Lani?

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:35.820
Because if we keep
doing that in a country

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.460
where the demographics are
changing radically-- and what,

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.600
within the next 30 years, white
Hispanics will be the minority,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.290
no longer be the majority.

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.710
We're not going to
have a country that's

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:48.630
representative of its people.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.840
So maybe we could
talk a little bit

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.320
about why it's important
for the elite schools--

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.370
why do you think, and why
do I-- why should they

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.140
be focused on thinking
differently about who deserves

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:02.650
to be on their campuses?

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.730
LANI GUINIER: So
just to put what

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:11.550
you're saying into a
slightly larger context--

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:14.020
and I definitely
want to follow up

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:21.000
what you're saying-- the
book that I am describing--

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.380
or that actually, you've done
a great job of describing--

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.320
is really about what
we mean by merit.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:34.150
And so it's a larger question
than just who is benefiting

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.330
from the concept of merit.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:39.860
But we tend to think
of merit as something

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.130
that measures how well you
do on a particular test

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.780
at a particular moment.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.990
And what I am trying
to do in this book,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.830
and what I think is
consistent with what the Posse

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:57.160
program does, is to give people
another way of identifying

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.110
with and exhibiting merit.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:01.430
And that is working
together in groups,

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.230
in posses, that can
look at a problem

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.860
from different perspectives,
and as a result,

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.180
work together to
solve that problem.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.270
And adding to your comment
about the number of men

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:24.040
versus women-- and finding more
women who are going to college

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.130
and who are graduating,
because it turns out

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.860
that the women are better at
collaborating with each other

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:30.510
then the men.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:37.460
There's a study by a woman named
Anita Woolley who, in fact, I

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:43.130
think was working with
MIT at the same time she

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.710
was doing this study.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.930
And what they were
trying to find out

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:49.820
is who was leading
the conversation

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.896
and what groups were
most effective in solving

00:10:52.896 --> 00:10:54.270
the particular
problems that were

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.780
presented before the groups.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.510
And it turned out that the more
women you had in the group,

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:03.590
the better the group was at
solving the problem, up to 85%.

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:06.330
Once you had 85% women, it
was fine to bring in the men.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.530
They would not be a
complete distraction.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:10.030
OK.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:13.950
Now, why would that be if
we have so few women who

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.940
are in positions
of power, and yet

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.330
those are the
people who are most

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.050
likely to work together to
collaborate to solve problems?

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.810
And I don't know the
answer to the question

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.880
of why is this true
of women and not men.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:27.855
It may be biological.

00:11:27.855 --> 00:11:29.390
It may be cultural.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.550
There are all kinds
of explanations.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.380
But it's really important
that we acknowledge

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:41.410
the value and the, quote,
"merit" of people--

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.240
disproportionately women--
who can work together

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.850
to solve problems.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:48.800
And the reason they can work
together to solve problems

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.130
is that they're willing
to listen to each other.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:55.160
Whereas what many of the men
do is that they immediately

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.990
think of an answer
and want to say

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.320
the answer to everyone else.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.250
They're not really interested
in what other people are saying.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.790
They're self-promoting-- not
all men, but many of them.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:10.550
And so the point
I'm trying to make,

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.400
the point I'm emphasizing,
is the power of collaboration

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.070
and the importance in the
21st century of developing

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:23.490
a group of college graduates
who are comfortable working

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:26.600
with other people to
solve complicated problems

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.230
and who are not simply trying
to dominate the conversation

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:33.390
and demonstrate how smart
they individually are,

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.670
but who are willing to listen
to what other people are saying,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.720
build on what those
other people are saying,

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:45.180
and create new and helpful
instruments for solving

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:46.050
these problems.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:51.470
One last example is a professor
from the University of Michigan

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:58.430
who also is doing
work on groups.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:01.370
And his experience
is with people who

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.270
are all taking the same test.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:07.850
And his argument is that
when you give people a test

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.642
and there are 10
questions on the test,

00:13:09.642 --> 00:13:11.100
there are some
people who are going

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.740
to immediately answer
7 of the 10 questions

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:15.190
and get them right.

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:17.410
But they don't get all
of the questions right.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:19.900
So what do they do?

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:24.832
Our instinct is to get the
people who had the 7 of the 10

00:13:24.832 --> 00:13:27.290
questions right, because they
had the most questions right,

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:28.750
and we put all of them together.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:31.860
That's the SAT idea.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.390
You get the people who all
did, quote, "the best."

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:38.660
But what if it turns
out that you're

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.200
overlooking two or
three of the answers

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:46.220
to questions that these, quote
unquote, "stars" got wrong,

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:52.130
and that some people got those
three or two questions right,

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:56.710
but didn't get as many questions
right as the initial group

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.090
leaders?

00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.970
You really want people
to work together,

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.542
even though they only got
2 or 3 of the 10 questions

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:04.750
right, if it turns out that
they're the only ones who

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:07.150
got those correct.

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.380
So the idea is
that-- and I think

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.380
it's very similar
and very compatible

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.740
with the concept of Posse--
is that in the 21st century,

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:20.402
it's really important that
you can work in groups.

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.860
And I don't mean work in groups,
and we all march together,

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.000
and you follow everyone.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.900
I mean work in a position
where you are not

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.090
the only person with ideas.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.550
You are open to
other people's ideas,

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.680
and you're willing to
test out their ideas

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.380
and see ways in which
those ideas can be improved

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.580
or can be--

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.190
DEBORAH BIAL:
That's very Google.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:45.012
LANI GUINIER: Very Google?

00:14:45.012 --> 00:14:47.130
DEBORAH BIAL: But
Lani, can I ask what--

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.990
since I have you
captive-- why do

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:55.110
you think we've been so
resistant to this when we admit

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:56.800
people to these colleges?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.472
Why are we clinging
to the SAT so much?

00:15:01.472 --> 00:15:03.180
LANI GUINIER: Well,
first of all, there's

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:08.040
a lot of money behind
the SAT and those tests.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.350
So there's a part
of the population

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:15.430
that's invested in that in
terms of their livelihood.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:20.270
I think the idea that you can
reduce people's intelligence

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.627
and you can reduce people's
ability to the performance--

00:15:23.627 --> 00:15:24.710
DEBORAH BIAL: Test scores.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:25.501
LANI GUINIER: Yeah.

00:15:25.501 --> 00:15:26.700
On a single test.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.570
It's not like you get the chance
to do this test every month

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.670
for a year.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.431
DEBORAH BIAL: Raise your hand
if you took the SAT or the ACT.

00:15:35.431 --> 00:15:40.090
Look how many--
almost all of you.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:45.280
Raise your hand if
you went to college.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.070
And raise your hand
if someone said

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.282
to you, what was your score.

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:53.212
Do you remember that?

00:15:53.212 --> 00:15:55.670
And raise your hand if you're
willing to tell us your score

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:57.090
right now.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:58.410
Exactly.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:59.205
A couple.

00:15:59.205 --> 00:16:01.040
A lot less hands.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:05.862
Because we still feel
like it reflects--

00:16:05.862 --> 00:16:07.320
there's a judgment
that we're going

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.070
to make about you if
we hear your score.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.454
That's terrible.

00:16:11.454 --> 00:16:13.620
We shouldn't make that
judgment about you right now.

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.924
And look how old you are.

00:16:15.924 --> 00:16:17.190
I'm sorry.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.730
LANI GUINIER: Can I just hang a
footnote to what you're saying,

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.650
and then you can proceed?

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.470
DEBORAH BIAL: Yes.

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:25.400
LANI GUINIER: So I
have to tell you--

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:31.001
it's a personal story-- when
I was admitted to Radcliffe

00:16:31.001 --> 00:16:32.250
College of Harvard University.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:36.460
DEBORAH BIAL: This is a
good story in your end--

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.220
I love the story.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:44.690
LANI GUINIER: So
my father, who was

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.890
born in Jamaica in
the West Indies,

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.980
he came to United States.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.970
He went to Boston
English High School.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.170
He then applied to Harvard.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.570
He was admitted to
Harvard College,

00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:00.690
except that they didn't
realize he was black.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.830
They didn't have that kind
of photography or whatever.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.740
DEBORAH BIAL: No photo included.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.690
LANI GUINIER: And that was
his "mistake," quote unquote,

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.270
because he showed up.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.166
And once they saw him,
they said, oh my god,

00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:14.540
what are we going
to do with you?

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.980
So they admitted him, since
they had already admitted him.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.060
But they wouldn't allow
to live in the dormitory.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:27.440
They wouldn't allow him
to eat in the dining halls

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.240
with the other students.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:34.450
And the first person to-- well,
there are a number of people.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:39.660
But the people he knew from
Boston English High School,

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.530
where he had been the
chair of the newspaper

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.160
and had done very well,
and who were his friends,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.970
those people were very
friendly when he was

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.220
at Boston English High School.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.750
But once he was at
Harvard College,

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:52.720
they wouldn't talk
to him, either.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.130
So I'm saying that
because for me, he

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.230
felt it was important
that I go to Harvard,

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:07.930
test it out, see if they've
improved in the past 40 years.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:16.310
But it was also
in many ways what

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.410
I felt was a painful
experience-- that

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:22.210
is, my roommate-- I
believe that's what

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:23.250
you were talking about.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:27.660
So my roommate comes
into my dorm room

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:30.390
the first day of
class, and she starts

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:31.580
telling me about herself.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.400
And she explained that she
was very worried that she

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.130
would never get married.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:39.270
And I'm thinking, this is
a very odd conversation.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:40.870
This is the first
day of college.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.390
I'm 17 years old.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.790
I'm definitely not thinking
about who I might marry.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:48.790
But she was using
this as an opportunity

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.650
to brag about her test
scores, because it

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.370
turns that she had gotten
perfect 800s on her SATs.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:57.520
So that was her
announcement to me,

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:03.410
and I was there for-- I
should be observant of her

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.940
and learn from her.

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.320
And what I learned was to
move to another dorm room.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.020
DEBORAH BIAL: But
what she means,

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:13.210
and what other people
would be really impressed,

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.740
is that she is smart.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.670
We equate that test
score with intelligence.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.610
And when we use the word
"merit" in higher ed,

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:24.990
and we give out
merit scholarships,

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:27.510
we give them to the kids
with the highest test scores,

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.300
because if you look the word
"merit" up in the dictionary,

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.040
it means deserve.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.200
Who deserves to be at Harvard?

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.890
Who deserves to be at Cornell?

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.996
Who deserves to
be at Vanderbilt?

00:19:38.996 --> 00:19:40.370
The kids with the
highest scores,

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:41.620
because they are the smartest.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.500
It's that simple.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:48.190
But because white and Asian
kids are still scoring the best,

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.420
they deserve to be
at these schools

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:55.290
more than black and Asian
kids, than poor kids who

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.650
don't score as well.

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.430
There's an amazing stat.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:02.140
I know you're going
to love this stat.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.800
The top 150 schools
in the United States

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.320
would need 50,000 black
students every year

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.240
going into their freshman
class, their first-year class,

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.960
if they were going to reflect
the percentage of blacks

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.260
that exist in the
American population.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:21.110
But only 9,000 black
kids scored 1,200

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:25.065
or above on the math and verbal
sections of the SAT last year.

00:20:25.065 --> 00:20:26.940
LANI GUINIER: 9,000 in
the in entire country?

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.040
DEBORAH BIAL: In the
entire United States.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.580
If we continue to rely
too heavily on the SAT,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.670
we'll never get the kind
of reflective diversity

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.240
that we want on our campuses.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.170
And if we continue to
define merit so narrowly

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.180
that it only relates
to the test score,

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.140
we're basically going
to say a certain slice

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:54.550
of the demographic deserves
to be on our campuses.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:58.040
The others, we'll create
charity programs for.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.680
At risk, poor kids,
under-represented, needy,

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.560
underprivileged-- we've
got programs for them.

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:11.130
And when you do that,
you divide the community.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.740
You create a campus
community that says,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.610
these kids deserve to be here.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:17.460
And then out of the
kindness of our hearts,

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.150
we're bringing in
the rest of you.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:22.420
And that's very dangerous
for this country.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:26.970
Kids with high scores, of
course, deserve, of course.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:30.260
But they're not the
only kids that deserve.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.590
And so I feel like what we have
an opportunity to do together

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:37.760
is say, here's the theory
and the analysis behind it,

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.150
and here's one example of a
program that puts into practice

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.480
this other way of
finding talent.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.200
And think about how--
Google is a company that

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.470
thinks outside the box.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.920
You're all about that.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.750
You need people who are creative
thinkers who think differently.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.700
And you want to put
teams together--

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:00.250
don't you guys believe in
working in teams a lot,

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.970
or is that just
what I'm imagining?

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:02.940
You do, right?

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.730
The teams are more fun.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.800
They're more dynamic.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.250
They're sillier.

00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:10.780
But you come up with
great ideas that way,

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.480
where if you're working
by yourself only,

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.720
if it would happen in a
different way, less often.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:19.806
So Posse says-- there was a
kid who dropped out of college.

00:22:19.806 --> 00:22:21.430
He said, I never
would have dropped out

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:22.810
if I have my posse with me.

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.830
This kid was super
smart-- great SAT scores,

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.565
by the way-- got
into an Ivy League,

00:22:28.565 --> 00:22:30.440
but dropped out because
of the culture shock,

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.080
because he didn't
see anybody like him.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.170
The posse created
a support system.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:38.960
But then we began to look
at these other indicators.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.160
And I bet if anybody--
is anyone here

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.100
responsible for hiring people?

00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:47.594
What's your name?

00:22:47.594 --> 00:22:49.330
AUDIENCE: Brian.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:50.270
DEBORAH BIAL: Ryan?

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.390
AUDIENCE: Brian

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.040
DEBORAH BIAL: Brian,
so you don't only

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.500
care about a test score now.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.430
You look for other things.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.000
You look for grit.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.570
You look for leadership ability.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.780
You look for analytical
ability, problem solving skills,

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.750
ability to work well in
a team, collaborate--

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.000
I can go on and on.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.843
Aren't you looking
for all those things?

00:23:10.843 --> 00:23:12.630
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.660
DEBORAH BIAL: Among--
I'm not saying--

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.850
when these kids
are 17 years old,

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:19.856
they're nominated to Posse.

00:23:19.856 --> 00:23:20.855
I wish I could stand up.

00:23:20.855 --> 00:23:22.200
I always want to stand up.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.060
We can put them in a room like--

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.720
LANI GUINIER: You can stand up.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.340
DEBORAH BIAL: No, because the
camera and the whole thing.

00:23:29.064 --> 00:23:31.760
But imagine a room like
this with no furniture.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.230
And 100 kids from Boston
come into this room.

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.610
They've been nominated by
someone who believes in them.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.210
And the person who
believes in them

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.180
says, this kid might not have
the best score, but I know her.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.090
She's amazing.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:51.500
She could kick ass at
a school like Union.

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:54.179
They walk in, and for
three hours-- and Brian,

00:23:54.179 --> 00:23:55.845
I think you would
love this if we did it

00:23:55.845 --> 00:23:59.080
at Google-- those
100 kids get put

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.860
through a series of activities.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:03.550
They're building
robots out of LEGOs.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:05.430
They're running a
discussion in small groups

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:06.600
on genetic testing.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.950
Quick, you have four
minutes, run a discussion.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.970
They are creating a public
service announcement

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.230
that they have to
present in front of you.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.340
And we're watching
them and looking

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.150
for these-- I don't
like this term,

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.740
but people call non-cognitive
traits-- they're cognitive.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:25.250
Anyway, we find the standout
kids, the dynamic kids,

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.470
the kids who think
creatively, the kids

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.960
who work well in teams,
the kids who are leaders,

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.650
who have ambition and drive
and motivation and all of that.

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.960
That's our first
slice of the pie.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.050
We don't even look at
the test score yet.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.070
We'll look at that later.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:45.650
That's one way of finding
talent, kids who are amazing,

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:50.770
kids who deserve to have a
shot at the American dream.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:53.660
And so we're putting
into practice

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.350
this idea that you shouldn't
define merit so narrowly.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:00.920
LANI GUINIER: I think
that's a great example.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.890
I'm also thinking of
some of the TV shows

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:14.470
where you can see black kids
walking across the terrain

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.140
in front of the projects.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:19.850
And in one of these shows,
there were two brothers

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:23.390
who were talking about
the amount of marijuana

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:27.650
that they had each sold
that particular day

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.510
and how much money
they had made.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:34.980
And the younger one was
computing in his head

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:37.270
how much he had
sold and how much

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:39.800
he had benefited from the sale.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.650
And his older brother
was just amazed,

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.180
because the younger
brother, who was

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.830
in the fourth grade
or fifth grade

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.270
was not doing well
in math, and yet he's

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:50.010
doing this in his head.

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:56.240
And so the older brother says,
how come you're failing math?

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.580
And he said, because
I don't really

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.460
care what the
outcome is in math,

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:03.170
but I care in terms of
selling these drugs.

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.050
If I get it wrong,
they're going to kill me.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:10.490
So there's a talent
there, but it's not being

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.890
developed in the right format.

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.380
DEBORAH BIAL: So we have a
few more minutes to talk,

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.740
and then we're going to
open it up for questions.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.280
And I thought
maybe it would also

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.850
be interesting to
hear a little bit more

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:28.730
about how you think these higher
ed institutions can change,

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.160
what you think they can do.

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:38.260
LANI GUINIER: Well, this is
an opportunity for me to cry,

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:40.680
because I've been trying
to get institutions

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.520
where I teach to
at least address--

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.050
they don't necessarily have
to cure-- but at least address

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:51.270
the issues that we've
been discussing.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.440
Now, I've been at law schools,
not at elementary schools

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.590
or at, quote
unquote, "colleges."

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:04.200
But what I did find-- and
this is not about class

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:09.230
as much as it is about gender--
the people at both law schools

00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:12.240
that I was associated or
have been associated with,

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.980
both at UPenn and
at Harvard, there

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.210
are more men than
women in the school.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.840
The men outperform the women,
although the women come

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.970
into the school with
very similar criteria

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:27.600
as the men in terms
of their LSAT scores

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.160
and their undergraduate GPA.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.860
In fact, the women have slightly
higher undergraduate GPA

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.070
and have slightly
higher LSAT scores,

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.630
but they're statistically
not significant.

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:42.670
And yet the women, when
they come to law school--

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:50.390
these are considered important
and difficult-to-get-into law

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:57.050
schools-- the women have
the LSAT scores that would

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:00.200
presumably predict that they're
going to do better in law

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:05.370
school, but they don't do as
well as the men in law school.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:09.720
So the LSAT is predicting
about 14% of the variance

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.230
in first-year classes--
this was at Penn--

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.250
and 15% of the variance
in second year, which

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:19.240
means that 85% of the
time, the LSAT was wrong.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:23.680
Wrong, W-R-O-N-G.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.570
DEBORAH BIAL: So
what's going on then?

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:28.640
LANI GUINIER: The LSAT
is not a good predictor.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.140
It tells you how
well somebody is

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.310
at answering certain questions
under a lot of stress,

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:38.160
but that doesn't mean you're
going to be a good lawyer.

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.480
And it doesn't mean you're
going to be a good law

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.650
student either.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.830
So if 85% of the time
you are wrong in terms

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.240
of the correlation
between your LSAT scores

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:53.970
and your performance,
we need to reconsider

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:56.370
what we're considering,
quote unquote, "merit."

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.690
DEBORAH BIAL: So
what should they do?

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:01.020
If you could press
the button and Harvard

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:05.780
and Yale and Princeton would
change, how would they change?

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.640
LANI GUINIER: Well,
the answer to that

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.060
is a long one, because they'd
have to change the culture.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.500
It's not enough just
to change the score,

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.000
because you could
say, oh, well they

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.570
could say if you pass
the LSAT, that's enough.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:21.540
You don't have to
have a higher LSAT,

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:23.790
since the distinction
in your LSAT score

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.340
really is not very predictive.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:30.000
So the LSAT could be a floor.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.750
That is, you have to
get above that floor.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.250
Even if you're right
above it, that's fine.

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:35.980
We're not going to
compare you to people

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:40.600
who are doing a lot better,
because I could show you

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.730
scatter plots, et cetera
where you see people

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:47.100
who had really high LSAT scores
and really low law school

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:47.980
grades.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.355
DEBORAH BIAL: And
my guess, Lani,

00:29:49.355 --> 00:29:53.230
is that people listening to
you-- I have this sense--

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:57.500
know or are wondering if
maybe those scores would

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.190
be more predictive if
culture was different

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:04.180
on these campuses, that as
a woman, I get a high score

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.840
and I go to Harvard, but because
the culture is a certain way,

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.090
my performance is affected.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:12.851
I don't know.

00:30:12.851 --> 00:30:14.850
LANI GUINIER: But this
is true for men and women

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:19.110
in terms of the LSAT being a
good predictor of performance.

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:22.880
So becoming a man is not
going to help you in terms

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:27.800
of doing better at law schools.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.840
But what I really
wanted to get back to,

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.410
which is what Posse
is well known for,

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:38.100
is the power of working
with other people,

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:43.020
collaborating and building trust
among that group of people,

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.810
each of whom is
bringing something new,

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.180
something different,
something potentially

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.630
important to the group.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.240
And so the challenge is,
are you in a position

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.990
to take advantage of what the
various people in this room

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.950
or in a particular
group have to offer?

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:02.930
Or are you one of
these people who

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:04.580
has to dominate
the conversation,

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.830
has to show how smart
you are, and has

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:08.590
to take charge in
which you are leading

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.680
and everyone is just following?

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:16.300
That can be very boring and
also not very effective.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:21.100
Whereas if we had a culture
shift-- not just a rule

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:24.680
shift-- meaning a culture
shift that says the way

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:29.740
we think merit-- and Amartya
Sen has a definition of merit.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.350
Merit is an incentive
system that rewards actions

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.580
a society values, an
incentive system that rewards

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.720
actions a society values.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.670
Well, maybe the
actions that we value

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:42.230
are not how well
you do on the test,

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:46.050
but how well you do in solving
the real problems of the world.

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.970
And you alone are not going
to be able to do that.

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.680
But if you find the
right posse, you

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.200
find the right group
of people, each of whom

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.170
has something to
offer, then you're

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.590
in a position to start really
solving difficult problems.

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:02.360
And it's not that you alone
are going to solve them.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.971
And it may not be that even
the group you're part of alone

00:32:05.971 --> 00:32:07.220
is going to solve the problem.

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:10.280
But you're introducing
interventions

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:14.180
that invite and excite
other people who

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.740
then build on what you've done.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:19.050
And through that
process, I think,

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:21.580
we'll be in much better shape.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.650
By contrast, what
we have right now,

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:27.420
at least in college admission
and college graduation,

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:30.574
is competition as to who is--

00:32:30.574 --> 00:32:31.740
DEBORAH BIAL: Does the best.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:33.320
LANI GUINIER: --who's
doing the best.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:37.710
That is, whose school is
admitting the students

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.450
with the highest LSAT scores?

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.810
And then whose schools are
graduating the people who

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:45.480
go and make the most money?

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.810
And then the idea of the
contribution to society,

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:54.970
the commitment to democracy,
the commitment to making sure

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:58.110
that as a democracy,
we want to make

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:00.490
sure everybody, as many
people as possible,

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.060
are educated, because
we never know,

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:06.420
among those people, who is going
to really contribute something

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.930
unique, and something
that's brave,

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.620
and something that really works.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:15.560
We don't have a good
predictor of that outcome

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.300
through the LSAT, the SAT,
the GRE, none of those.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:24.280
What those tests tend to
tell us is what kind of car

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.650
your parents drive, meaning
they have enough money

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.570
to buy a Mercedes,
so you've obviously

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:33.050
been able to do
well on this test,

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:34.990
because they've
also bought people

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:38.500
who are going to help you to
get prepared for the test.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:42.450
And then, of course, when you're
writing out your admissions

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:46.170
data, you also get somebody
else who writes it for you.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.000
Right?

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.620
They're working on your
behalf, presumably.

00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:53.170
But they're not going to be
there when you're in college

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:56.660
and you have an exam
or something else

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:59.740
to do that you're
really not prepared for,

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.880
because the way you got
there was somebody else was

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.000
pushing you or functioning as
a pedestal on which you could

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.030
stand.

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:13.100
So I'm saying all this because I
think that the Posse program is

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.440
wonderful, not just because
it's bringing together students

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:23.440
from working class families,
but because it's also giving us

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:30.010
the opportunity to see how
teams can be created and built

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:35.150
in ways that not only give
people who are part of the team

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:38.670
confidence, but give
the people who benefit

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:42.840
from the outcome of
the work of the team

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.598
some sense that life is
better with the interventions.

00:34:45.598 --> 00:34:48.139
DEBORAH BIAL: I'm going to use
those as a quote in our next--

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:48.736
that's good.

00:34:48.736 --> 00:34:50.620
Good.

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:54.489
So should we turn to you guys?

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.390
Because you have a million
questions, I'm sure.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.720
LANI GUINIER: I
hope not a million.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.589
DEBORAH BIAL: We'll
start at the beginning.

00:35:02.589 --> 00:35:03.130
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.963
So it sounds like the
population that you're

00:35:04.963 --> 00:35:07.360
most concerned with are
the students that are

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.850
both minorities and talented.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:13.280
And I guess I have-- my brother
is now applying to colleges.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.780
He's just deciding
where he's going.

00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:17.880
So I've been hearing a
lot about this lately.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:24.770
And I have questions about
the population who is either

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:28.130
talented but not
diverse, not minority,

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:31.930
and the population that
is maybe not so talented.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:36.410
So I guess my two
situations that I've

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:41.710
seen that are concerning-- one
is, say, a friend of mine who's

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:47.320
a white guy in engineering,
really smart, and is really

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:51.120
struggling to get
into schools, and he

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:54.510
feels like there are a lot
of spots that are reserved

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.410
for people of other categories.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:35:59.760
He's a really smart
white guy, and is really

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.910
struggling to get
noticed, because he

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.510
doesn't have anything special.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:07.460
In this particular
case, yes, his parents

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.750
went to college-- community
college, not really

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.610
super academic kind of people.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.570
He wasn't from a
Mercedes-driving kind

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:20.145
of family, didn't really get
the support and the motivation

00:36:20.145 --> 00:36:21.200
and everything.

00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.130
But he feels like
because he's white,

00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:24.860
it doesn't really
count for anything.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.960
So that's the one situation
of talented but not minority.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.620
And the other
situation that I see

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.330
are people who are really
not interested in pursuing

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.000
academic careers.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.910
I actually was a serious ballet
dancer, and a lot of my friends

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.620
didn't go to college, because if
you want to be a ballet dancer,

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.600
why would you spend $150,000
on a college education?

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.870
It doesn't make any sense.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.790
DEBORAH BIAL: Or more.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:47.810
AUDIENCE: More, yeah.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.260
So what about for
those people who--

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.920
or they want to
pursue culinary arts,

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:58.490
or they want to do whatever else
that doesn't depend on getting

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:01.500
a college education, where
they feel like they're being

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.850
pressured to spend a
fortune and go into debt

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.040
to get an education
that maybe they

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.840
could have an excellent
professional career doing

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.705
the things that they want
with another path that somehow

00:37:14.705 --> 00:37:16.280
is looked down upon?

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.710
So I guess what are your
thoughts on people in those two

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:19.210
situations?

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:23.770
LANI GUINIER: OK.

00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:29.560
So first, I think you
should go to Canada--

00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:32.600
you don't have to stay,
just visit-- and see

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.800
the way in which they admit
people to their schools.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.000
If you have a grade point
average of over 80%,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.960
you're automatically admitted
to one of their colleges.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:48.350
And I don't know that you're
entitled to your first choice,

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.140
but they try and
give you at least one

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.360
of your first three choices.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.120
And I don't believe
college is free,

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.050
but it's not very expensive.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:03.780
So that would solve
a lot of the problems

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.185
that you're talking about.

00:38:05.185 --> 00:38:07.310
The other point that you're
making, though, I think

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:08.250
is really important.

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.540
And that is that people
are coming to college,

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.990
and they're really
not there to learn.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:19.670
They're there to promote
themselves into another sphere

00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:21.600
where they will be
making a lot of money.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:26.770
So for example, in "The
Harvard Crimson" of about five

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.090
or so years ago,
they had an article

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.280
called "Show Him The Money."

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.400
That was the front page
of "The Harvard Crimson."

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.120
That's the newspaper
the students publish.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.120
And what they were
commenting on-- they'd

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.380
done a survey of the
graduating class.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.240
This was in May of that year.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.752
And the survey noted
that the men from Harvard

00:38:48.752 --> 00:38:50.460
wanted to go to Wall
Street, because they

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.920
wanted to make a lot of money.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.740
And the women wanted to become
lawyers or doctors or teachers.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.170
And the people who are
writing this article

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:02.510
were making fun of the
women, the women who

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:06.460
wanted to do good,
because they should have

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.840
been trying to get the money.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.460
And it suggests
that-- that's why

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.220
I say you need a culture shift.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.397
It's not just that you have
a certain group of people

00:39:16.397 --> 00:39:17.730
and not another group of people.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:20.610
It's that the culture
of higher education

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:29.240
has lost some of its connection
to promoting democracy

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:33.000
and the importance
of civic involvement

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.830
that is the basis of many of
the colleges in this country.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:42.400
It's the reason that
they were created.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.470
And yet they've been shifted
from an engine of democracy

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.450
to an engine of plutocracy.

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:53.450
DEBORAH BIAL: And Lani, can
you help me answer this also?

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:55.460
I have an idea formulated.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.330
Because behind
what you're saying

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:02.140
is a question that I've
heard a lot of times

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:09.390
from white people whose kids
are applying to college,

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.920
and they're worried
that the black kid is

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.350
going to take the spot
that their kid should get.

00:40:15.350 --> 00:40:19.160
And I'm not saying this is
your question, but I hear it.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.830
And I hear that question a lot.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:27.840
There's a black kid in
my daughter's school,

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.710
and she didn't score as well
as my daughter did on the SAT.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.780
And I know she's going
to get in to x school.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:36.430
And my daughter deserves
to be at that school.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.570
And there is
resentment that builds.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:43.180
How are you supposed
to think about that?

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.240
How does the country
think about that?

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:50.390
It is very difficult
for us to understand

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:54.150
that the numbers
of black kids going

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:58.710
to these elite
institutions is very small.

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:02.320
And 10 extra or
20 extra kids that

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.290
get inserted into
that freshman class

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:07.690
even if they didn't
have the test score

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:12.880
is not-- the effect it has on
the number of white students

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.430
applying and their chances
of getting in is minuscule.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:21.580
But it feels big, because we
all know of a black kid who

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.090
gets in with a lower score.

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:28.280
It's this problem of using
the score to define deserving.

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.585
Anyone in this room and
listening and online and all

00:41:31.585 --> 00:41:34.690
of that who thinks that
college admissions is

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.260
an objective process is wrong.

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.900
It's completely subjective.

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.580
The dean of admissions
says, we need a violinist.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.770
Let's try and find a great
violinist for our orchestra.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:50.460
This year, we need
more kids who want

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:55.490
to major in our new
curriculum in communications.

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:58.270
It's just about
building a class.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:00.990
But we're so competitive.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:04.870
And we compete against our
friends, and our kids' friends,

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:06.980
and our parents' friends,
all of this stuff,

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.270
that we end up resenting
the black kid who

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:11.670
got in with the lower score.

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:12.870
It's a big problem.

00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:16.030
And I don't know how
to articulate it more.

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:18.980
LANI GUINIER: But I think
you've articulated it

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.020
very effectively.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.930
The question is, what's
the intervention?

00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:25.072
DEBORAH BIAL: How do we
change our mindset, almost?

00:42:25.072 --> 00:42:26.530
LANI GUINIER: Well,
I think we have

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:30.430
to go back to understanding
what's the purpose of higher

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.280
education.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:35.070
And it's not there simply to
give your child or my child

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.170
an opportunity to
make a lot of money.

00:42:37.170 --> 00:42:40.250
It's also a very important
engine of democracy.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:44.650
And that the part of the
college that we don't really

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:47.510
talk about-- that
we want students

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.130
who are going to
graduate from college

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:53.790
and make a contribution
to our society that

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.670
promotes democracy.

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:58.600
And by democracy,
I mean fairness.

00:42:58.600 --> 00:43:02.100
I mean engagement
of the citizenry

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:07.140
in making decisions that affect
their lives and our lives.

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:11.570
College is not just a platform
for becoming a millionaire

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:17.040
or continuing in your
parents' footsteps

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.370
and being a person from--

00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:22.310
DEBORAH BIAL: A great,
great way of framing it.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:23.875
Thank you.

00:43:23.875 --> 00:43:25.500
AUDIENCE: Are you OK
with somewhat more

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:26.897
of a comment than a question?

00:43:26.897 --> 00:43:28.105
DEBORAH BIAL: Absolutely not.

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:28.980
You need to sit down.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.960
No, just kidding.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.810
AUDIENCE: I see
the essence of what

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:35.940
you're saying as three areas.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:41.640
One is scoring people based on
some perceived ability being

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.120
done badly, and the alternative
is over-credentialism.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:46.120
You have a degree.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.810
Therefore, you must be qualified
to do an entire class of work

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.130
unrelated to the degree.

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:57.540
There is the diversity
aspect, where you're clearly

00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.460
losing the game if
you're not getting

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:02.780
included in the solution.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.480
And someone else is
disproportionately

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.010
winning the game.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:12.760
But my pet peeve is the posse
versus singular model of it.

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:17.560
Survival of the
fittest is universally

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:21.350
accepted as the
driver of evolution.

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:25.360
If you have someone who keeps
his tribe alive by sacrificing

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:30.660
himself or herself,
then that person's genes

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.430
aren't being carried
down directly.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.010
And therefore, clearly,
that person was a failure.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:37.890
But if you look at how
evolution actually works,

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.760
the tribes succeeds,
the tribe survives

00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:44.410
because one person was
willing to sacrifice

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:45.930
for the group's success.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:50.780
And that strikes me
as an almost direct--

00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.430
DEBORAH BIAL: Conflict of--

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.530
AUDIENCE: It's very
much the issue of you

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:58.240
have five people who are very
good each at one science,

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.240
and none of them can get along.

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:03.890
You add a sixth person who gets
people along with each other,

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:06.840
and finally, the team can
succeed rather than being

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.390
a bunch of individuals.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:10.610
Even for leadership, which
is one of the aspects

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:14.570
we consider in recruitment,
it is hierarchical sort

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:15.740
of leadership we look at.

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.340
It is not management of a group
to make the group effective.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.570
It is domination of
the group in order

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.660
to make the group
do what it's told.

00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:28.860
And I feel like that is not
just some people are winning

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:30.260
and other people are losing.

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.820
But our consensus
as a society seems

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:37.760
to be on the wrong rules
of physics, you might say,

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.970
about how these things work.

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.860
And I feel like that is
an understanding that

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.010
needs to be spread, and
I'm glad you're doing it.

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.410
LANI GUINIER: Well,
I'm glad you just came

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:52.490
up and made what I thought
was a very powerful argument.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:53.510
So thank you.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:57.490
AUDIENCE: So I have just
enough personal experience--

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.490
not nearly as much as
either or both of yours

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:01.509
to be dangerous in
this-- meaning I

00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:03.800
have a daughter who went
through the process this year.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.470
And I'm a regional enrollment
director for my alma mater.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:12.034
So I see a lot of really
scary numbers and experiences

00:46:12.034 --> 00:46:14.450
happen, from both the applicant
perspective and the alumni

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.280
perspective.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.781
So my view is the entire
process of getting into colleges

00:46:20.781 --> 00:46:22.780
and going through college
is a completely broken

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.860
for everybody,
regardless of what

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.010
your socioeconomic,
racial, gender class is.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:31.430
It's 100% broken for everybody.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:35.360
And somebody has to do
something drastic soon

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:38.160
to take a leadership
role in changing it.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:43.390
But because institutions
exist to continue to exist,

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.050
it's happening way too slowly.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:49.860
So I'm going to tell you an
idea I sent to our admissions

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.910
director at our campus
this spring that I think

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:55.450
after his eyes and
ears got done bleeding

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.970
after he read the idea, he sent
me a politically correct note

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:00.030
back.

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:04.260
But my idea was-- because
all these colleges

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:05.099
are keeping score.

00:47:05.099 --> 00:47:05.890
DEBORAH BIAL: Yeah.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:07.340
The rankings and--

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:11.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah, rankings,
number of applications, yields.

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:13.890
There's all kinds of scorecards.

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:16.970
I said, my recommendation
is next year

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.620
we have no applications.

00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:21.700
There is no application process.

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:22.407
The process is--

00:47:22.407 --> 00:47:23.740
DEBORAH BIAL: Random enrollment.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.220
AUDIENCE: Well, not exactly.

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.620
You take your
admissions officers

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.510
who spend time reading
too many applications

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.720
and delivering on the
admission director's

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:36.800
need for the communications
class or the violinist,

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.680
and they just go out
into the community,

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:43.320
and they find the right
1,200 people for you.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.680
Why don't we do that?

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.950
Someone has got to be first.

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:49.050
And so my question
for you is, is

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:51.700
anybody close to being
first with anything

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.200
that matters in this?

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:56.070
The closest thing I
see to this is maybe

00:47:56.070 --> 00:47:58.970
what's happening in technology
with EdX and things like that.

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:00.740
But they are still
premium institutions,

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.970
and they haven't figured
out how to commercialize it.

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:06.322
But is anybody doing anything
material to be first at this

00:48:06.322 --> 00:48:07.280
and start to change it?

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.700
DEBORAH BIAL: I
have some things.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.510
I love what you're
saying, because you're

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:17.430
saying we have to be radical.

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:20.240
It's not enough, this
little small-- Lani,

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:24.800
who is a civil rights expert and
witnessed the progress we made

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.280
is also witnessing,
as we all are,

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:29.740
how we are moving backwards.

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.410
We strike down the
Voting Rights Act.

00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:32.992
And we lose affirmative action.

00:48:32.992 --> 00:48:34.450
And we think--
because we're there.

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:35.491
We've solved the problem.

00:48:35.491 --> 00:48:37.070
We have a black president.

00:48:37.070 --> 00:48:37.950
Done.

00:48:37.950 --> 00:48:42.570
But we need to be more
radical, because we move away

00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:44.430
too slowly, as you're saying.

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:47.570
So MOOCs have evolved.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:48.970
Higher ed is going to change.

00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:53.110
We call it sometimes
the higher ed bubble.

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.950
Remember, we had these
other technology bubbles.

00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:57.390
But it's going to burst.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.840
People will not
be able to afford

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.320
this kind of higher
education within the next

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:03.740
I don't know how many years.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:04.950
The schools can't afford it.

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:05.890
We can't afford it.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:07.840
Something is going to change.

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:09.880
I just wanted to
mention-- this is not

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.950
supposed to be about Posse--
I wanted to mention that

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:15.740
this year, we had
15,000 nominations

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:18.990
from all over the United
States for 700 slots.

00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:21.930
And every one of
those 15,000 kids

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:24.510
came from someone who
said, this is a great kid.

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:27.320
He should be going
to this great school.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.160
Someone who believes in
this kid and knows this kid.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:33.640
Frankly, in my opinion,
all 15,000 of those kids

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:36.380
should be sent to
these great schools.

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.570
Nothing would happen that's bad.

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:40.410
It would only be good.

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:43.530
But those 15,000
kids came into a room

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:44.990
that was radically different.

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:47.140
It wasn't about scores
and grades and tests.

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:50.594
It was about all of
these other qualities

00:49:50.594 --> 00:49:52.260
that we think could
make a great student

00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:56.030
on a campus and a great
leader in the workforce.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:50:01.260
If we could do more of that--
replicate these large group

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:04.760
interviews, these large group
opportunities for companies

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:09.090
like Google to hire, for
schools like Vanderbilt

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:12.430
to admit students-- for whatever
it is that we're looking for,

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:15.280
it gives us another way
of finding talent that's

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.640
more radical, because it's
not just sitting in a room

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.930
and looking at a piece of
paper and making a decision.

00:50:21.930 --> 00:50:23.780
I know we're
running out of time,

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.780
because we have three minutes.

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:28.860
But I love that.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.880
And there are things
that are happening,

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.090
and I just think we
need to keep pushing it

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:37.800
really loudly, that we should
radically change the system,

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:40.240
or it'll just break,
like you said,

00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:41.747
and then we will have no choice.

00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:48.768
LANI GUINIER: We cannot
end on that note.

00:50:48.768 --> 00:50:50.110
DEBORAH BIAL: No.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:51.890
LANI GUINIER: So
please ask a question.

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:54.450
AUDIENCE: I'll be real
fast because of time.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:57.110
Meritocracy rests on
a bedrock of scarcity.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:02.656
We can only enlist x many people
each year, so how do we pick?

00:51:02.656 --> 00:51:04.780
And you make good points
about changing the metric,

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:07.117
but you also mentioned
if I change the metric,

00:51:07.117 --> 00:51:09.450
then some other people who
might have otherwise deserved

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:10.700
don't get to go.

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.380
The other way to
approach that problem

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.410
is to drastically
increase the number

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:16.160
of people who are able to go.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.140
So what are your
thoughts about changing

00:51:18.140 --> 00:51:20.260
that restriction of the
small number of people

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.510
who are able to go to college?

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:23.840
DEBORAH BIAL: That's positive.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.180
LANI GUINIER: Yeah,
I agree with you.

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:36.390
DEBORAH BIAL: MOOCs might
be able to make that happen.

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:39.660
We may be able to create more
systems that take more kids.

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.220
LANI GUINIER: Or go to
Canada and see what they do.

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:45.220
DEBORAH BIAL: Canada again.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:46.720
LANI GUINIER:
Because if you have

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:52.240
an 80% or above in terms
of your high school grades,

00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:54.780
you're entitled to go
to college in Canada.

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:56.360
They've figured that out.

00:52:00.554 --> 00:52:01.220
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:02.911
My kids are not Canadian.

00:52:02.911 --> 00:52:04.660
I have a nine-year-old
and a six-year-old.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:05.930
LANI GUINIER: A nine-year-old
and a six-year-old?

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:06.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:07.120
I've done the math.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:07.880
LANI GUINIER: I'm glad
they're not getting

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.490
into college at this age.

00:52:09.490 --> 00:52:10.800
AUDIENCE: Well, but I
have to start financially

00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:12.640
planning for that now, because
it's going to cost me half

00:52:12.640 --> 00:52:14.320
a million dollars to send them.

00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:18.110
And how do we
solve that problem?

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:19.820
That's part of what I'm saying.

00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.470
Literacy is so important that
we give it away for free.

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.511
LANI GUINIER: That's why
I'm saying go to Canada.

00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:27.490
DEBORAH BIAL: I
think you're hearing

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:30.010
is that it's not an
answerable question right now.

00:52:30.010 --> 00:52:31.180
You're right.

00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:34.300
We need everybody to
feel like the opportunity

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:37.800
to reach an American dream,
whatever that dream is, exists.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.690
And it feels
unbelievably unfair.

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:42.820
We're living in a
country that has

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:46.550
33% of its population
living in poverty,

00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:51.090
or what we call
near poverty-- 33%.

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:53.910
Those kids, we don't
even talk about them.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:55.514
Do you read about
the poverty that

00:52:55.514 --> 00:52:56.680
exists in the United States?

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:57.950
You don't, really.

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:00.510
And so we need to talk about it.

00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:03.140
The middle class has gotten
squeezed out of education,

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.950
because the cost is so enormous.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:08.700
So we end up with schools that
we call rich-poor schools.

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.160
The rich kids can go,
and the really poor kids

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.050
can get these scholarships.

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:14.070
It's not enough.

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:17.550
And we need to find a way
to make state systems work

00:53:17.550 --> 00:53:20.620
for everybody, to make
great schools expand

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.340
what they offer to more people.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.574
We haven't figured it out.

00:53:23.574 --> 00:53:25.240
You're right-- we
have to figure it out.

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.989
And maybe by the time
your kids are older,

00:53:26.989 --> 00:53:28.820
there will be something great.

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:30.260
LANI GUINIER: But
it's not just--

00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:32.760
I think what you
just said was great.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.390
DEBORAH BIAL: It's too negative?

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:35.450
LANI GUINIER: No, no.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:38.590
But it's something that--
we don't have the capacity

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:41.916
to solve that problem alone,
but it's an issue that--

00:53:41.916 --> 00:53:43.540
that's why I keep
talking about Canada,

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:48.030
or you should go to Finland or
to other countries and see that

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:51.360
in these other countries, they
are committed to making sure

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.532
every student--

00:53:52.532 --> 00:53:53.990
DEBORAH BIAL: To
use them as models

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:55.740
for something we could copy.

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:56.573
LANI GUINIER: Right.

00:53:56.573 --> 00:54:01.260
If we think we are in a
position of greatness,

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:05.220
we need to go and actually see
greatness that is democratic

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:09.985
as opposed to plutocratic,
which is what we have here.

00:54:09.985 --> 00:54:11.860
AUDIENCE: So we said
that test scores are not

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:15.860
predictive of college success,
but you have this Posse

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:16.820
selection process.

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:18.259
Is that predictive?

00:54:18.259 --> 00:54:19.050
DEBORAH BIAL: Yeah.

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:22.030
So I didn't say
they're not predictive.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:22.625
Test scores--

00:54:22.625 --> 00:54:23.626
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you did.

00:54:23.626 --> 00:54:25.125
DEBORAH BIAL: Yeah,
they're limited.

00:54:25.125 --> 00:54:26.410
They predict for some kids.

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:28.494
And the only thing
the SATs predict

00:54:28.494 --> 00:54:30.910
is how well you're going to
do your first year in college,

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:33.240
what your GPA will be.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:34.760
Again, it's like Lani said.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.570
It's incredibly flawed, but
it finds some great kids.

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:43.030
Posse kids graduate
at rates of over 90%

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:46.300
from 52 colleges
and universities

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.260
that we send them to.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:50.550
Thousands of Posse kids
have won $800 million

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:53.260
in scholarships over
the past 25 years.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:56.915
So we've got a program
that's showing that what Lani

00:54:56.915 --> 00:54:59.530
is talking about totally works.

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:02.780
We've got thousands of
kids in an experiment,

00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:05.930
and this other way
of identifying talent

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:09.110
is just as good as the SAT.

00:55:09.110 --> 00:55:11.800
All I'm saying is we can't
just only use the SAT.

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.952
We need many more ways
of finding great kids.

00:55:14.952 --> 00:55:16.410
And then the cost
is another issue.

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:19.740
OK.

00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:21.490
You guys, thank you so much.

00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:23.946
Lani, a pleasure to be with you.

00:55:23.946 --> 00:55:24.820
Thank you, everybody.

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:25.944
[APPLAUSE]
