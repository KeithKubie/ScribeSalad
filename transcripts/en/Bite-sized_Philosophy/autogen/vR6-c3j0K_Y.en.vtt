I've been telling people online in
various ways and in lectures that they

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410
various ways and in lectures that they
 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.079
various ways and in lectures that they
should start fixing up the world by

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089
should start fixing up the world by
 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.419
should start fixing up the world by
cleaning up their room and I wanted to

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429
cleaning up their room and I wanted to
 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.980
cleaning up their room and I wanted to
just elaborate on that a little bit

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990
just elaborate on that a little bit
 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.200
just elaborate on that a little bit
before I get back to the lecture itself

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210
before I get back to the lecture itself
 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.980
before I get back to the lecture itself

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990
so as it's become this internet weird
 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.150
so as it's become this internet weird

internet meme you know and and and and
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.179
internet meme you know and and and and
it's a joke and good it's a joke I'm

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189
it's a joke and good it's a joke I'm
 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.950
it's a joke and good it's a joke I'm
really happy about the fact that so much

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960
really happy about the fact that so much
 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.779
really happy about the fact that so much
of this has got like the leaving of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789
of this has got like the leaving of
 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.820
of this has got like the leaving of
humor and it's really important because

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
humor and it's really important because
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.050
humor and it's really important because
that's what stops things from

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
that's what stops things from
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.930
that's what stops things from
degenerating into into conflict humor

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
degenerating into into conflict humor
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.360
degenerating into into conflict humor
and I was thinking about this idea of

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
and I was thinking about this idea of
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.979
and I was thinking about this idea of
cleaning up your room in relationship to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
cleaning up your room in relationship to
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.380
cleaning up your room in relationship to
the mustard seed idea and you see the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
the mustard seed idea and you see the
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.569
the mustard seed idea and you see the
thing about cleaning up your room this

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
thing about cleaning up your room this
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.920
thing about cleaning up your room this
is also something I learned from Carl

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
is also something I learned from Carl
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.319
is also something I learned from Carl
Jung and his study is on alchemy because

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329
Jung and his study is on alchemy because
 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.110
Jung and his study is on alchemy because
for Jung when the alchemist was

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120
for Jung when the alchemist was
 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.520
for Jung when the alchemist was
attempting to make the philosopher's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
attempting to make the philosopher's
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.260
attempting to make the philosopher's
stone he was not only engaged in the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270
stone he was not only engaged in the
 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.060
stone he was not only engaged in the
transformation of the material world but

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
transformation of the material world but
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.650
transformation of the material world but
he was engaged in the process of self

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
he was engaged in the process of self
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.920
he was engaged in the process of self
transformation that occurred at the same

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
transformation that occurred at the same
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.290
transformation that occurred at the same
time as that the chemical Trent as the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300
time as that the chemical Trent as the
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.880
time as that the chemical Trent as the
chemical transformation so the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
chemical transformation so the
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.860
chemical transformation so the
psychological work in some sense let's

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
psychological work in some sense let's
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.840
psychological work in some sense let's
say you want to sort out your room and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
say you want to sort out your room and
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.280
say you want to sort out your room and
beautify it because the beauty is also

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290
beautify it because the beauty is also
 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.929
beautify it because the beauty is also
important and let's say that all you

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939
important and let's say that all you
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.460
important and let's say that all you
have is just a little room like you're

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
have is just a little room like you're
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.859
have is just a little room like you're
not rich you're poor and you don't have

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
not rich you're poor and you don't have
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.240
not rich you're poor and you don't have
any power that's another thing but

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
any power that's another thing but
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.679
any power that's another thing but
you've got your damn room and you've got

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
you've got your damn room and you've got
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.660
you've got your damn room and you've got
this space right in front of you you

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
this space right in front of you you
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.210
this space right in front of you you
know that that's a part of the cosmos

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
know that that's a part of the cosmos
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.280
know that that's a part of the cosmos
that you can come to grips with and you

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290
that you can come to grips with and you
 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.960
that you can come to grips with and you
might think well what's there in front

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970
might think well what's there in front
 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640
might think well what's there in front
of you right in front of you and the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650
of you right in front of you and the
 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.260
of you right in front of you and the
answer to that is it depends on how open

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
answer to that is it depends on how open
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.450
answer to that is it depends on how open
your eyes are that's the proper answer

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
your eyes are that's the proper answer
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.910
your eyes are that's the proper answer
because you could say and William Blake

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920
because you could say and William Blake
 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.550
because you could say and William Blake
said this for example Aldous Huxley make

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560
said this for example Aldous Huxley make
 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.140
said this for example Aldous Huxley make
comments that we're very similar that in

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
comments that we're very similar that in
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.090
comments that we're very similar that in
a transcendent state you can see

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
a transcendent state you can see
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.310
a transcendent state you can see
infinity in the finite and you might say

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320
infinity in the finite and you might say
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.780
infinity in the finite and you might say
well you can say and you can see

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
well you can say and you can see
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.850
well you can say and you can see
infinity and what you have within your

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
infinity and what you have within your
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.590
infinity and what you have within your
grasp if you look and you could say

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
grasp if you look and you could say
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660
grasp if you look and you could say
maybe that's the case with your room and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670
maybe that's the case with your room and
 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.359
maybe that's the case with your room and
so you want to clean up your room well

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369
so you want to clean up your room well
 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.480
so you want to clean up your room well
okay how do you do that exactly well a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
okay how do you do that exactly well a
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.850
okay how do you do that exactly well a
room is a room is a place to sleep

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
room is a room is a place to sleep
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.429
room is a room is a place to sleep
and so if you say your room ups properly

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
and so if you say your room ups properly
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.690
and so if you say your room ups properly
then you figure out how to sleep and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700
then you figure out how to sleep and
 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.550
then you figure out how to sleep and
when you should sleep and how you should

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560
when you should sleep and how you should
 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.230
when you should sleep and how you should
sleep and then you figure out when you

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240
sleep and then you figure out when you
 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.520
sleep and then you figure out when you
should wake up and then you figure out

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
should wake up and then you figure out
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.749
should wake up and then you figure out
well what clothes you should wear

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
well what clothes you should wear
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.889
well what clothes you should wear
because they have to be arranged

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899
because they have to be arranged
 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.330
because they have to be arranged
properly in your dress and then you have

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
properly in your dress and then you have
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.589
properly in your dress and then you have
to have some place to put your clothes

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599
to have some place to put your clothes
 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.969
to have some place to put your clothes
you're going to have some clothes you

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
you're going to have some clothes you
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.839
you're going to have some clothes you
have to figure out what you're going to

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849
have to figure out what you're going to
 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.190
have to figure out what you're going to
wear those clothes to do

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
wear those clothes to do
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.140
wear those clothes to do
right and then that means you have to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
right and then that means you have to
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.520
right and then that means you have to
figure out what you're going to do and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
figure out what you're going to do and
 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.619
figure out what you're going to do and
then your room has to serve that purpose

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629
then your room has to serve that purpose
 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.119
then your room has to serve that purpose
because otherwise it doesn't set up

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129
because otherwise it doesn't set up
 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.000
because otherwise it doesn't set up
properly and if it doesn't set up if it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010
properly and if it doesn't set up if it
 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.220
properly and if it doesn't set up if it
doesn't serve your purposes you will be

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230
doesn't serve your purposes you will be
 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.229
doesn't serve your purposes you will be
unhappy and not happy in the room

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239
unhappy and not happy in the room
 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.360
unhappy and not happy in the room
because the way that we perceive the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
because the way that we perceive the
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.720
because the way that we perceive the
world is as a place to move from point A

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730
world is as a place to move from point A
 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.199
world is as a place to move from point A
to point B in and then if the place that

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209
to point B in and then if the place that
 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.420
to point B in and then if the place that
we're in facilitates that movement then

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
we're in facilitates that movement then
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.220
we're in facilitates that movement then
we're happy to be there and it's a place

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230
we're happy to be there and it's a place
 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.830
we're happy to be there and it's a place
that we're in serves as an obstacle to

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840
that we're in serves as an obstacle to
 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.930
that we're in serves as an obstacle to
that movement then we're unhappy to be

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940
that movement then we're unhappy to be
 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.089
that movement then we're unhappy to be
there and so what it means to set up

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099
there and so what it means to set up
 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.350
there and so what it means to set up
your room is that you have to have

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360
your room is that you have to have
 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.750
your room is that you have to have
somewhere to go that's worthwhile or you

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760
somewhere to go that's worthwhile or you
 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.069
somewhere to go that's worthwhile or you
can't set up your room and then your

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079
can't set up your room and then your
 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.960
can't set up your room and then your
room has to be set up to facilitate that

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970
room has to be set up to facilitate that
 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.210
room has to be set up to facilitate that
and then the next thing is well maybe

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
and then the next thing is well maybe
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.160
and then the next thing is well maybe
you have to make it beautiful but that's

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
you have to make it beautiful but that's
 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.660
you have to make it beautiful but that's
not easy right that means you have to

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670
not easy right that means you have to
 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.640
not easy right that means you have to

something out of nothing it you have to
 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.319
something out of nothing it you have to
be creative in order to do that and so

together they will interfere with that
you'll interfere with that because you

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380
you'll interfere with that because you
 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.599
you'll interfere with that because you
won't have the discipline to do it

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609

lowly place let's say and so are you and
you're trying to move out of that then

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590
you're trying to move out of that then
 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.949
you're trying to move out of that then
the higher you move out of that the more

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959
the higher you move out of that the more
 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.469
the higher you move out of that the more
the place they're in looks bad and you

over chaos and evil but that isn't what
will happen what will happen instead is

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720
will happen what will happen instead is
 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.420
will happen what will happen instead is
that they will attempt to pull you back

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430
that they will attempt to pull you back

that they will attempt to pull you back
down they'll attempt to and I mean

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920
down they'll attempt to and I mean
 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.040
down they'll attempt to and I mean
obviously all families still do that but

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050
obviously all families still do that but
 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.890
obviously all families still do that but
but all families do that to some degree

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900
but all families do that to some degree
 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.320
but all families do that to some degree
and some families do almost nothing but

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330
and some families do almost nothing but
 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.540
and some families do almost nothing but
that and so what that means is that if

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550
that and so what that means is that if
 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.240
that and so what that means is that if
you're going to organize your room then

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250
you're going to organize your room then
 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.560
you're going to organize your room then

some of those Devils have have lineages
 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.230
some of those Devils have have lineages
that go back many many many generations

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240
that go back many many many generations
 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.570

and so and then and so to sort yourself

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590
and so and then and so to sort yourself
 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.770

trivial matter you know and you can do
that you'll learn by doing that and then

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120
that you'll learn by doing that and then
 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.640
that you'll learn by doing that and then
maybe you'll learn enough by doing that

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650
maybe you'll learn enough by doing that
 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.170
maybe you'll learn enough by doing that
so that you can fix up your family a

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180
so that you can fix up your family a
 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.880
so that you can fix up your family a
little bit and then having done that

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890
little bit and then having done that
 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.470
little bit and then having done that
you'll have enough character so that

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480
you'll have enough character so that
 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.690
you'll have enough character so that
when you try to operate in the world at

your job or maybe in the broader social
 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.100
your job or maybe in the broader social
spheres that you'll be a force for good

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110
spheres that you'll be a force for good
 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.540
spheres that you'll be a force for good
instead of harm because you'll have

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550
instead of harm because you'll have
 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.180
instead of harm because you'll have
learned some humility by noting just how

together well and yourself for that
matter and so you'll proceed cautiously
