00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.740
Asked me to talk a little bit about the

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.800
new innovations in voting systems. And so I'd like to tell you about end-to-end

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.240
verifiable voting systems,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.920
which is the buzzword that academics are using to describe this.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.040
Now,Which means really that you can verify the whole flow of

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.420
information, from your head, as to who you think you want to vote for,

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.519
all the way through the casting of the vote and the tabulation

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.699
and then the final tally,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.040
so that you can verify that every step of the way is going the way it should

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.980
and that your vote counts the way you intended,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.340
that the final result is the accurate representation of everybody's votes.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.180
And right now, with many voting systems,

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.389
you can have a certain amount of verifiability. The lovely thing about paper ballots

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.070
is that you can see that, you know, what you wrote down is what you intended. And so that's a

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.870
very important property, very nice.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.560
But once you've cast the paper ballot, you're trusting the chain of custody of those paper ballots

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.680
to make sure that the count is done right

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.980
and that the ballots being counted are the right ones.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.100
Brady: "Talk to me about this selfie thing. Some people like to take a photo of their ballot, don't they?"

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.140
Yeah, it's a lot of fun, and I think it may increase voter participation

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.240
to have a little more fun like that in the ballot booth and so on, too.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.240
The thing that is worrisome about it, though, from

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.100
a security point of view, is that, you know, with a selfie of you casting your ballot,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.260
you can sell your ballot. And that's one of the things that we've learned the hard way over many many decades,

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.809
is that you don't want to enable people to sell their ballots.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.850
So you shouldn't leave the voting booth with any kind of proof as to how you voted.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.659
You shouldn't have a receipt saying you voted this way, you shouldn't have a copy of your ballot,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.920
you shouldn't have anything that proves how you voted.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.720
Because that can be worth, you know, 20 bucks to the, you know, to you,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.860
from the guy down the bar who wants to, you know, buy your vote. Or maybe coerce you.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.040
So, yeah, how can you possibly know that your vote was counted the way you wanted?

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.520
This is a hard question, and it makes a fascinating research area. And it turns out

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.040
you can thread this needle with a bit of care and a bit of cryptography, a bit of mathematics.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.890
So how do you do this?

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.380
So the idea would be that you get a receipt when you vote.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.260
And the receipt is not the plain text as to how you voted

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.560
but an encryption of how you voted. So it's something that you can't sell down at the bar,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.770
because it's not something that's interpretable by somebody else.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.160
Brady: "So what is it, like a number, or a barcode, or...?"

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.980
It's a number or a barcode or something like that. It represents how you voted.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.340
So you get a receipt,

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.820
and, the new thing here in these end-to-end verifiable systems

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.600
is the copies of all the receipts get posted on the web.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.040
So say, Brady, and here Brady's receipt, and Ron, and here's Ron's receipt, and so on and so forth. Everybody's name and their

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.360
receipts get posted.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.419
Nobody can tell how anybody else voted. You can't sell your vote based on that posting. But it's all on the web,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.379
and it's all there for anybody look at. And you can look at it, and you can see that, yep,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.790
they've got my receipt right, and that receipt is an encryption of my vote, right?

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.680
So that's the key thing. You know your vote is in the pile,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.460
and you know your vote is in the pile the way you think it should be,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.880
because you have reason to believe, as I'll explain,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.060
that your encryption of your vote is actually correct.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.020
Brady: "Everyone's encryption looks different, though."

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.340
Everybody's encryption looks different.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.400
So it's not a simple encryption in a deterministic way. It's a good point.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.140
Yeah, so if everybody's voting for Alice, all the Alices don't look the same, and all the Bobs don't look the same.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.909
So there's a couple of subtleties here. One is, well, how do you verify the tally then? So somebody is announcing that

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.939
Alice won. And so, all these encrypted votes are

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.509
primarily for Alice, and there's some for Bob, but there's more for Alice.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.429
That's the assertion that the election officials have made. How do they know? How do they

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:21.388
convince anybody that that's right? And they'd like to convince everybody that that's right without showing the decryptions of everybody's vote.

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.679
So they've got this pile of encrypted votes and an announced result,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.479
and you'd like to know,... if you're an election official, you'd like to convince everybody that's the right result.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.949
So there's a number of ways of doing this, and there's quite a large literature on this. Here's a way

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.940
that's pretty simple to describe. So you could use something called homomorphic encryption.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.880
What does that mean? So it means that you can multiply

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.540
ciphertext together and end up with them representing the sum of their plaintext.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.859
So, encryption of a one times an encryption of a two will give you an encryption of a three, right?

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:58.469
So you end up adding the plaintext when you multiply the ciphertext. So this is cool.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.120
You can do lots of wonderful things with this. And in particular, you can do the tally for the voting system.

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.578
For example, if your vote is a vote for Alice, you might have an encryption of a one.

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.249
And if your vote is a vote for Bob, you might have an encryption for a zero. And suppose Alice and Bob are the only two candidates.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.470
So then, each ballot is either a one or a zero, and basically what you want to do is add them up.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.739
But they're ciphertexts, so you don't see the ones and the zeros.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.789
But you can use this homomorphic property, you can multiply all these ciphertexts together

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.079
end up with a number which represents the sum of all of the

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:35.179
plaintext ballots. And that sum is just the number of votes cast for Alice then, right?

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.219
So the tally for Alice is the sum of all these things. And Bob is just the number of votes minus the tally for Alice,

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:42.769
of course. So if Alice has more than half, she wins.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.020
So there, you can multiply these ciphertexts together and get a ciphertext that's the ciphertext for the sum,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.680
and that ciphertext can be decrypted publicly

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.700
in a way that everybody can see is proper. So you can see yes that is... and everybody could also do this multiplication,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.260
So that is, they can check that that's the ciphertext to decrypt,

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.040
and the election officials could decrypt that in a nice way

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.370
and show that that's the proper decryption, so that we have the right tally for Alice.

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:13.459
So that's one part of what you need to do then, is everybody can verify the tally from these encrypted things.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.579
And that's cool, right? So that's one part of it. The other part you want to

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.740
deal with is the fact that you need to know that your ciphertext is really representing your vote, right? So you go into the

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.440
voting booth, you're getting this receipt,

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:29.329
and you want to know that that receipt really represents your vote. So you vote for Alice, and you get this receipt which is a

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.199
ciphertext,

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.139
you can't decrypt that ciphertext. In fact, you shouldn't be able to decrypt that

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.719
ciphertext, because then you could sell your vote, just like you could with a selfie, right? So you want to know that that

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.859
ciphertext is really for, say, Alice, if you're voting for Alice.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.680
So, that's a little more subtle.

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.519
Maybe this matchbox analogy is not a bad way to explain it. How do you

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.979
know that you've got a good match? You're going on a camping trip, you can, you're allowed to take only one match

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.000
How do you know you've got a good match?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.599
Well, you could take a box out of the drawer, you can say well,

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:01.159
maybe this is a box of good matches.

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.539
And you try randomly sampling those matches, and, light, yeah, that one lights, that one lights.

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.479
But you want to take with you a match you haven't tried yet. And so you,

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.819
maybe the last match, you say, well, I haven't tried that match, but all the others in the box were good, and therefore

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.669
I'm going to trust that this one is good. You put that your pocket and take it camping.

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:21.169
So you can do something like that with the encryption here. You can say, I walk into the voting booth,

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.060
I get an encryption of  my first

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.660
representation of the choice. I say Alice and I get encryption, then I want to see,

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:32.028
is that really a good encryption? It's like seeing if it's a good match.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.280
So I'll strike it, or I'll ask that to be decrypted,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.570
which the machine can do for me, since it

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:43.559
encrypted it in the first place. So, so once I test it, I, once I see that, how it decrypts properly, unfortunately,

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.310
I can't use that to vote with, because now I know how to, how it decrypts as well,

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.670
and I can't post that, because I could sell my vote if I were to post that one.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.765
So that's a spoiled ballot, and, and we can't use that.

00:06:54.765 --> 00:06:56.540
Brady: "That gets taken off the tally."

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.860
It's taken, it's not even posted,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.640
it's not in the tally, it's not used, it's not anywheres. It's like I haven't voted at all,

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.679
I'm just testing the voting machine. And I can do that as many times as I like, you know, two or three times,

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.140
check out different decryptions of different things, and I can see the machine is reliably encrypting

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.600
whatever I say I want to vote for. I can say I'm voting for Alice and test that, I can say I'm voting for Bob and I test that,

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.159
and say I'm voting for Alice again. Maybe I don't test that one, and I say, okay we'll go with that,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:28.619
we'll post that on the web. And then you've got confidence, just like with the matches, that that encryption was done properly.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.700
It doesn't need to be done by a lot of people, right? It just needs to be done enough

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.579
so that you know machines aren't trying to cheat in any large-scale way.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.750
So those are the two parts of it. Getting encryptions that you can trust, even if you're not a computer,

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:45.720
and getting a tally that you can verify, even though the inputs of the tally are encryptions.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.070
And so this is a wonderful idea. It's evolved over the years with many different people

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.150
putting parts of it together, but it means you can have a voting system, then,

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.530
that's verifiable, all the way from who you want to vote for, that end of the process,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.380
through the casting of the ballot, through the posting of the ballots, through the tally and the announcement of the result. You can verify that the

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.529
outcome is right. So, in the future, this might be the kind of voting system

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:11.940
everybody will vote on. But it's still in research stages a bit. It's under development.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.880
There are some jurisdictions that are starting to use it in practice, and we'll see how it goes. I'm optimistic.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.340
...Alice,

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:26.729
so put another Alice in, pick one out, and put it back, together with a copy of it. So now I've got

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.610
six ballots.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:33.409
That's cool. So now I've drawn the bits. Now it's four to two...
